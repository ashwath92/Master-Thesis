- define a measure of semantic similarity based on combining

- paper similarity measure is close to modeling (A,cites,B), (z,authorOf,A), type semantic info
-> combined similarity measure somewhat convoluted

input text -> [fixed size set of textually similar papers] -> semantically similar papers     (<- wouldn't this just always be the highest for the fixed size set papers themselves? mby not b/c of weighted averaging over all fixed size set papers)

We consider these features to be a major advantage of MA over GS. However, we identify four main limitations regarding the available metadata.

Third, some publications are assigned to incorrect years. Fourth, the metadata of some publications did not include all authors. Nevertheless, we show that an average-based indicator (i.e. the journal normalized citation score; JNCS) as well as a distribution-based indicator (i.e. percentile rank classes; PR classes) can be calculated with relative ease using MA. Hence, normalization of citation counts is feasible with MA. The citation analyses in MA and Scopus yield uniform results. The JNCS and the PR classes are similar in both databases, and, as a consequence, the evaluation of the researchers' publication impact is congruent in MA and Scopus.

  abstract = {This study compares rhetorical citation functions in eight high- and eight low-graded master's theses in the field of gender studies, written in English as a second language. The following rhetorical functions of citations are identified: attribution, exemplification, further reference, statement of use, application, evaluation, establishing links between sources, and comparison of one's own work with that of other authors. It is shown that both sets of theses use citations predominantly for attribution, suggesting that one of the functions of citation in student writing is knowledge display. The use of citation for non-attribution functions is found to be considerably lower in the low-rated theses than in the high-rated theses, both in the whole theses and in individual chapters. The findings show that there is a relationship between citation use and thesis grade, thus pointing to the importance of effective citation strategies for studentsâ academic success. In conclusion, the paper argues that source use and citation skills should receive more attention in EAP instruction and suggests activities focusing on this area of academic writing.},

  abstract = {In the last 16Â years, more than 200 research articles were published about research-paper recommender systems. We reviewed these articles and present some descriptive statistics in this paper, as well as a discussion about the major advancements and shortcomings and an overview of the most common recommendation concepts and approaches. We found that more than half of the recommendation approaches applied content-based filtering (55Â {\%}). Collaborative filtering was applied by only 18Â {\%} of the reviewed approaches, and graph-based recommendations by 16Â {\%}. Other recommendation concepts included stereotyping, item-centric recommendations, and hybrid recommendations. The content-based filtering approaches mainly utilized papers that the users had authored, tagged, browsed, or downloaded. TF-IDF was the most frequently applied weighting scheme. In addition to simple terms, n-grams, topics, and citations were utilized to model users' information needs. Our review revealed some shortcomings of the current research. First, it remains unclear which recommendation concepts and approaches are the most promising. For instance, researchers reported different results on the performance of content-based and collaborative filtering. Sometimes content-based filtering performed better than collaborative filtering and sometimes it performed worse. We identified three potential reasons for the ambiguity of the results. (A) Several evaluations had limitations. They were based on strongly pruned datasets, few participants in user studies, or did not use appropriate baselines. (B) Some authors provided little information about their algorithms, which makes it difficult to re-implement the approaches. Consequently, researchers use different implementations of the same recommendations approaches, which might lead to variations in the results. (C) We speculated that minor variations in datasets, algorithms, or user populations inevitably lead to strong variations in the performance of the approaches. Hence, finding the most promising approaches is a challenge. As a second limitation, we noted that many authors neglected to take into account factors other than accuracy, for example overall user satisfaction. In addition, most approaches (81Â {\%}) neglected the user-modeling process and did not infer information automatically but let users provide keywords, text snippets, or a single paper as input. Information on runtime was provided for 10Â {\%} of the approaches. Finally, few research papers had an impact on research-paper recommender systems in practice. We also identified a lack of authority and long-term research interest in the field: 73Â {\%} of the authors published no more than one paper on research-paper recommender systems, and there was little cooperation among different co-author groups. We concluded that several actions could improve the research landscape: developing a common evaluation framework, agreement on the information to include in research papers, a stronger focus on non-accuracy aspects and user modeling, a platform for researchers to exchange information, and an open-source framework that bundles the available recommendation approaches.},

  abstract = {Numerous recommendation approaches are in use today. However, comparing their effectiveness is a challenging task because evaluation results are rarely reproducible. In this article, we examine the challenge of reproducibility in recommender-system research. We conduct experiments using Plista's news recommender system, and Docear's research-paper recommender system. The experiments show that there are large discrepancies in the effectiveness of identical recommendation approaches in only slightly different scenarios, as well as large discrepancies for slightly different approaches in identical scenarios. For example, in one news-recommendation scenario, the performance of a content-based filtering approach was twice as high as the second-best approach, while in another scenario the same content-based filtering approach was the worst performing approach. We found several determinants that may contribute to the large discrepancies observed in recommendation effectiveness. Determinants we examined include user characteristics (gender and age), datasets, weighting schemes, the time at which recommendations were shown, and user-model size. Some of the determinants have interdependencies. For instance, the optimal size of an algorithms' user model depended on users' age. Since minor variations in approaches and scenarios can lead to significant changes in a recommendation approach's performance, ensuring reproducibility of experimental results is difficult. We discuss these findings and conclude that to ensure reproducibility, the recommender-system community needs to (1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments, (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.},

Although its main purpose is to make it easier for researchers to search for scientific information, CiteSeerxhas been proven as a powerful resource in many data mining, machine learning and information retrieval applications that use rich metadata, e.g., titles, abstracts, authors, venues, references lists, etc. The metadata extraction in CiteSeerxis done using automated techniques. Although fairly accurate, these techniques still result in noisy metadata. Since the performance of models trained on these data highly depends on the quality of the data, we propose an approach to CiteSeerxmetadata cleaning that incorporates information from an external data source. The result is a subset of CiteSeerx, which is substantially cleaner than the entire set. Our goal is to make the new dataset available to the research community to facilitate future work in Information Retrieval.},

abstract="Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.",

abstract="Adaptive web sites may offer automated recommendations generated through any number of well-studied techniques including collaborative, content-based and knowledge-based recommendation. Each of these techniques has its own strengths and weaknesses. In search of better performance, researchers have combined recommendation techniques to build hybrid recommender systems. This chapter surveys the space of two-part hybrid recommender systems, comparing four different recommendation techniques and seven different hybridization strategies. Implementations of 41 hybrids including some novel combinations are examined and compared. The study finds that cascade and augmented hybrids work well, especially when combining two components of differing strengths.",
