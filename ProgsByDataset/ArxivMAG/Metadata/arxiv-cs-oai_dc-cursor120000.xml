 <dc:title>Solving Non-parametric Inverse Problem in Continuous Markov Random Field

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the inverse problem, or the statistical machine
learning problem, in Markov random fields with a non-parametric pair-wise
energy function with continuous variables. The inverse problem is formulated by
maximum likelihood estimation. The exact treatment of maximum likelihood
estimation is intractable because of two problems: (1) it includes the
evaluation of the partition function and (2) it is formulated in the form of
functional optimization. We avoid Problem (1) by using Bethe approximation.
Bethe approximation is an approximation technique equivalent to the loopy
belief propagation. Problem (2) can be solved by using orthonormal function
expansion. Orthonormal function expansion can reduce a functional optimization
problem to a function optimization problem. Our method can provide an analytic
form of the solution of the inverse problem within the framework of Bethe
approximation.

 <dc:title>This Just In: Fake News Packs a Lot in Title, Uses Simpler, Repetitive
  Content in Text Body, More Similar to Satire than Real News</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of fake news has gained a lot of attention as it is claimed to
have had a significant impact on 2016 US Presidential Elections. Fake news is
not a new problem and its spread in social networks is well-studied. Often an
underlying assumption in fake news discussion is that it is written to look
like real news, fooling the reader who does not check for reliability of the
sources or the arguments in its content. Through a unique study of three data
sets and features that capture the style and the language of articles, we show
that this assumption is not true. Fake news in most cases is more similar to
satire than to real news, leading us to conclude that persuasion in fake news
is achieved through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments. We show
overall title structure and the use of proper nouns in titles are very
significant in differentiating fake from real. This leads us to conclude that
fake news is targeted for audiences who are not likely to read beyond titles
and is aimed at creating mental associations between entities and claims.

 <dc:description>  The use of alluring headlines (clickbait) to tempt the readers has become a
growing practice nowadays. For the sake of existence in the highly competitive
media industry, most of the on-line media including the mainstream ones, have
started following this practice. Although the wide-spread practice of clickbait
makes the reader's reliability on media vulnerable, a large scale analysis to
reveal this fact is still absent. In this paper, we analyze 1.67 million
Facebook posts created by 153 media organizations to understand the extent of
clickbait practice, its impact and user engagement by using our own developed
clickbait detection model. The model uses distributed sub-word embeddings
learned from a large corpus. The accuracy of the model is 98.3%. Powered with
this model, we further study the distribution of topics in clickbait and
non-clickbait contents.

 <dc:description>  We consider graph Turing machines, a model of parallel computation on a
graph, in which each vertex is only capable of performing one of a finite
number of operations. This model of computation is a natural generalization of
several well-studied notions of computation, including ordinary Turing
machines, cellular automata, and parallel graph dynamical systems. We analyze
the power of computations that can take place in this model, both in terms of
the degrees of computability of the functions that can be computed, and the
time and space resources needed to carry out these computations. We further
show that properties of the underlying graph have significant consequences for
the power of computation thereby obtained. In particular, we show that every
arithmetically definable set can be computed by a graph Turing machine in
constant time, and that every computably enumerable Turing degree can be
computed in constant time and linear space by a graph Turing machine whose
underlying graph has finite degree.

 <dc:description>  Edge-matching problems, also called edge matching puzzles, are abstractions
of placement problems with neighborhood conditions. Pieces with colored edges
have to be placed on a board such that adjacent edges have the same color. The
problem has gained interest recently with the (now terminated) Eternity~II
puzzle, and new complexity results. In this paper we consider a number of
settings which differ in size of the puzzles and the manipulations allowed on
the pieces. We investigate the effect of allowing rotations of the pieces on
the complexity of the problem, an aspect that is only marginally treated so
far. We show that some problems have polynomial time algorithms while others
are NP-complete. Especially we show that allowing rotations in one-row puzzles
makes the problem NP-hard. The proofs of the hardness result uses a large
number of colors. This is essential because we also show that this problem (and
another related one) is fixed-parameter tractable, where the relevant parameter
is the number of colors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  -- Within the Future Internet, a new trend is foreseen with the creation of
overlay networks composed of residential gateways (i.e. Home-Box), leveraging
their storage and upload capacity in order to achieve scalable and
cost-efficient content distribution. In this paper, we highlight an
architecture of such a home-box overlay for Video On Demand (VOD) services, in
cooperation with a network-aware request redirection and content caching
strategy that optimize the resource usage at both network and client side to
reduce the overall distribution cost. The proposed system is compared to
existing solutions through comprehensive simulations. The results demonstrate
the strong advantage of introducing such a network-aware and popularity-based
caching strategy in terms of cost reduction for VOD services, especially for
Content Delivery Networks.

 <dc:description>  Accounting for undecided and uncertain voters is a challenging issue for
predicting election results from public opinion polls. Undecided voters typify
the uncertainty of swing voters in polls but are often ignored or allocated to
each candidate in a simplistic manner. Historically this has been adequate
because first, the undecided tend to settle on a candidate as the election day
draws closer, and second, they are comparatively small enough to assume that
the undecided voters do not affect the relative proportions of the decided
voters. These assumptions are used by poll authors and meta-poll analysts, but
in the presence of high numbers of undecided voters these static rules may bias
election predictions. In this paper, we examine the effect of undecided voters
in the 2016 US presidential election. This election was unique in that a) there
was a relatively high number of undecided voters and b) the major party
candidates had high unfavorability ratings. We draw on psychological theories
of decision making such as decision field theory and prospect theory to explain
the link between candidate unfavorability and voter indecisiveness, and to
describe how these factors likely contributed to a systematic bias in polling.
We then show that the allocation of undecided voters in the 2016 election
biased polls and meta-polls in a manner consistent with these theories. These
findings imply that, given the increasing number of undecided voters in recent
elections, it will be important to take into account the underlying psychology
of voting when making predictions about elections.

 <dc:description>  A large number of new consumer and industrial applications are likely to
change the classic operator's business models and provide a wide range of new
markets to enter. This article analyses the most relevant 5G use cases that
require ultra-low latency, from both technical and business perspectives. Low
latency services pose challenging requirements to the network, and to fulfill
them operators need to invest in costly changes in their network. In this
sense, it is not clear whether such investments are going to be amortized with
these new business models. In light of this, specific applications and
requirements are described and the potential market benefits for operators are
analysed. Conclusions show that operators have clear opportunities to add value
and position themselves strongly with the increasing number of services to be
provided by 5G.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The task of counting eucalyptus trees from aerial images collected by
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been frequently explored by techniques of
estimation of the basal area, i.e, by determining the expected number of trees
based on sampling techniques. An alternative is the use of machine learning to
identify patterns that represent a tree unit, and then search for the
occurrence of these patterns throughout the image. This strategy depends on a
supervised image segmentation step to define predefined interest regions. Thus,
it is possible to automate the counting of eucalyptus trees in these images,
thereby increasing the efficiency of the eucalyptus forest inventory
management. In this paper, we evaluated 20 different classifiers for the image
segmentation task. A real sample was used to analyze the counting trees task
considering a practical environment. The results show that it possible to
automate this task with 0.7% counting error, in particular, by using strategies
based on a combination of classifiers. Moreover, we present some performance
considerations about each classifier that can be useful as a basis for
decision-making in future tasks.

 <dc:description>  We present a deep convolutional decoder architecture that can generate
volumetric 3D outputs in a compute- and memory-efficient manner by using an
octree representation. The network learns to predict both the structure of the
octree, and the occupancy values of individual cells. This makes it a
particularly valuable technique for generating 3D shapes. In contrast to
standard decoders acting on regular voxel grids, the architecture does not have
cubic complexity. This allows representing much higher resolution outputs with
a limited memory budget. We demonstrate this in several application domains,
including 3D convolutional autoencoders, generation of objects and whole scenes
from high-level representations, and shape from a single image.

fashion, measures the similarity between customer questions and agent answers
using a dual encoder network, a Siamese-like neural network architecture.
Answer templates are extracted from embeddings derived from past agent answers,
without turn-by-turn annotations. Responses to customer inquiries are generated
by selecting the best template from the final set of templates. We show that,
in a closed domain like customer service, the selected templates cover $&gt;$70\%
of past customer inquiries. Furthermore, the relevance of the model-selected
templates is significantly higher than templates selected by a standard tf-idf
baseline.

 <dc:description>  Current speech enhancement techniques operate on the spectral domain and/or
exploit some higher-level feature. The majority of them tackle a limited number
of noise conditions and rely on first-order statistics. To circumvent these
issues, deep networks are being increasingly used, thanks to their ability to
learn complex functions from large example sets. In this work, we propose the
use of generative adversarial networks for speech enhancement. In contrast to
current techniques, we operate at the waveform level, training the model
end-to-end, and incorporate 28 speakers and 40 different noise conditions into
the same model, such that model parameters are shared across them. We evaluate
the proposed model using an independent, unseen test set with two speakers and
20 alternative noise conditions. The enhanced samples confirm the viability of
the proposed model, and both objective and subjective evaluations confirm the
effectiveness of it. With that, we open the exploration of generative
architectures for speech enhancement, which may progressively incorporate
further speech-centric design choices to improve their performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the localization outage probability (LOP), the
probability that the position error exceeds a given threshold, in randomly
deployed wireless networks. Two typical cases are considered: a mobile agent
uses all the neighboring anchors or select the best pair of anchors for
self-localization. We derive the exact LOP for the former case and tight bounds
for the LOP for the latter case. The comparison between the two cases reveals
the advantage of anchor selection in terms of LOP versus complexity tradeoff,
providing insights into the design of efficient localization systems.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, researchers started using cognitive load in various settings, e.g.,
educational psychology, cognitive load theory, or human-computer interaction.
Cognitive load characterizes a tasks' demand on the limited information
processing capacity of the brain. The widespread adoption of eye-tracking
devices led to increased attention for objectively measuring cognitive load via
pupil dilation. However, this approach requires a standardized data processing
routine to reliably measure cognitive load. This technical report presents
CEP-Web, an open source platform to providing state of the art data processing
routines for cleaning pupillary data combined with a graphical user interface,
enabling the management of studies and subjects. Future developments will
include the support for analyzing the cleaned data as well as support for
Task-Evoked Pupillary Response (TEPR) studies.

 <dc:title>Experimental Analysis of Design Elements of Scalarizing Functions-based
  Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we systematically study the importance, i.e., the influence on
performance, of the main design elements that differentiate scalarizing
functions-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). This class of
MOEAs includes Multiobjecitve Genetic Local Search (MOGLS) and Multiobjective
Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and proved to be very
successful in multiple computational experiments and practical applications.
The two algorithms share the same common structure and differ only in two main
aspects. Using three different multiobjective combinatorial optimization
problems, i.e., the multiobjective symmetric traveling salesperson problem, the
traveling salesperson problem with profits, and the multiobjective set covering
problem, we show that the main differentiating design element is the mechanism
for parent selection, while the selection of weight vectors, either random or
uniformly distributed, is practically negligible if the number of uniform
weight vectors is sufficiently large.

 <dc:description>  We describe a novel method for blind, single-image spectral super-resolution.
While conventional super-resolution aims to increase the spatial resolution of
an input image, our goal is to spectrally enhance the input, i.e., generate an
image with the same spatial resolution, but a greatly increased number of
narrow (hyper-spectral) wave-length bands. Just like the spatial statistics of
natural images has rich structure, which one can exploit as prior to predict
high-frequency content from a low resolution image, the same is also true in
the spectral domain: the materials and lighting conditions of the observed
world induce structure in the spectrum of wavelengths observed at a given
pixel. Surprisingly, very little work exists that attempts to use this
diagnosis and achieve blind spectral super-resolution from single images. We
start from the conjecture that, just like in the spatial domain, we can learn
the statistics of natural image spectra, and with its help generate finely
resolved hyper-spectral images from RGB input. Technically, we follow the
current best practice and implement a convolutional neural network (CNN), which
is trained to carry out the end-to-end mapping from an entire RGB image to the
corresponding hyperspectral image of equal size. We demonstrate spectral
super-resolution both for conventional RGB images and for multi-spectral
satellite data, outperforming the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Users like sharing personal photos with others through social media. At the
same time, they might want to make automatic identification in such photos
difficult or even impossible. Classic obfuscation methods such as blurring are
not only unpleasant but also not as effective as one would expect. Recent
studies on adversarial image perturbations (AIP) suggest that it is possible to
confuse recognition systems effectively without unpleasant artifacts. However,
in the presence of counter measures against AIPs, it is unclear how effective
AIP would be in particular when the choice of counter measure is unknown. Game
theory provides tools for studying the interaction between agents with
uncertainties in the strategies. We introduce a general game theoretical
framework for the user-recogniser dynamics, and present a case study that
involves current state of the art AIP and person recognition techniques. We
derive the optimal strategy for the user that assures an upper bound on the
recognition rate independent of the recogniser's counter measure. Code is

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification (re-id) aims to match people across non-overlapping
camera views. So far the RGB-based appearance is widely used in most existing
works. However, when people appeared in extreme illumination or changed
clothes, the RGB appearance-based re-id methods tended to fail. To overcome
this problem, we propose to exploit depth information to provide more invariant
body shape and skeleton information regardless of illumination and color
change. More specifically, we exploit depth voxel covariance descriptor and
further propose a locally rotation invariant depth shape descriptor called
Eigen-depth feature to describe pedestrian body shape. We prove that the
distance between any two covariance matrices on the Riemannian manifold is
equivalent to the Euclidean distance between the corresponding Eigen-depth
features. Furthermore, we propose a kernelized implicit feature transfer scheme
to estimate Eigen-depth feature implicitly from RGB image when depth
information is not available. We find that combining the estimated depth
features with RGB-based appearance features can sometimes help to better reduce
visual ambiguities of appearance features caused by illumination and similar
clothes. The effectiveness of our models was validated on publicly available
depth pedestrian datasets as compared to related methods for person
re-identification.

 <dc:description>  There are now a broad range of time series classification (TSC) algorithms
designed to exploit different representations of the data. These have been
evaluated on a range of problems hosted at the UCR-UEA TSC Archive
(www.timeseriesclassification.com), and there have been extensive comparative
studies. However, our understanding of why one algorithm outperforms another is
still anecdotal at best. This series of experiments is meant to help provide
insights into what sort of discriminatory features in the data lead one set of
algorithms that exploit a particular representation to be better than other
algorithms. We categorise five different feature spaces exploited by TSC
algorithms then design data simulators to generate randomised data from each
representation. We describe what results we expected from each class of
algorithm and data representation, then observe whether these prior beliefs are
supported by the experimental evidence. We provide an open source
implementation of all the simulators to allow for the controlled testing of
hypotheses relating to classifier performance on different data
representations. We identify many surprising results that confounded our
expectations, and use these results to highlight how an over simplified view of
classifier structure can often lead to erroneous prior beliefs. We believe
ensembling can often overcome prior bias, and our results support the belief by
showing that the ensemble approach adopted by the Hierarchical Collective of
Transform based Ensembles (HIVE-COTE) is significantly better than the
alternatives when the data representation is unknown, and is significantly
better than, or not significantly significantly better than, or not
significantly worse than, the best other approach on three out of five of the
individual simulators.

 <dc:description>  Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices used as feature descriptors in
image recognition are usually high dimensional. Traditional manifold learning
is only applicable for reducing the dimension of high-dimensional vector-form
data. For high-dimensional SPD matrices, directly using manifold learning
algorithms to reduce the dimension of matrix-form data is impossible. The SPD
matrix must first be transformed into a long vector, and then the dimension of
this vector must be reduced. However, this approach breaks the spatial
structure of the SPD matrix space. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
new dimension reduction algorithm on SPD matrix space to transform
high-dimensional SPD matrices into low-dimensional SPD matrices. Our work is
based on the fact that the set of all SPD matrices with the same size has a Lie
group structure, and we aim to transform the manifold learning to the SPD
matrix Lie group. We use the basic idea of the manifold learning algorithm
called locality preserving projection (LPP) to construct the corresponding
Laplacian matrix on the SPD matrix Lie group. Thus, we call our approach
Lie-LPP to emphasize its Lie group character. We present a detailed algorithm
analysis and show through experiments that Lie-LPP achieves effective results
on human action recognition and human face recognition.

 <dc:description>  The aspirations for a 5th generation (5G) mobile network are high. It has a
vision of unprecedented data-rate and extremely pervasive connectivity. To
cater such aspirations in a mobile phone, many existing efficiency aspects of a
mobile phone need to be reviewed. We look into the matter of required energy to
encrypt and decrypt the huge amount of traffic that will leave from and enter
into a 5G enabled mobile phone. In this paper, we present an account of the
power consumption details of the efficient hardware implementations of AES and
SNOW 3G. We also present an account of the power consumption details of LTE
protocol stack on some cutting edge hardware platforms. Based on the
aforementioned two accounts, we argue that the energy requirement for the
current encryption systems AES and SNOW 3G will not impact the battery-life of
a 5G enabled mobile phone by any significant proportion.

problem it is not needed to solve a weighted perfect matching problem in an

 <dc:title>L2-constrained Softmax Loss for Discriminative Face Verification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ranjan, Rajeev</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, the performance of face verification systems has
significantly improved using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs). A
typical pipeline for face verification includes training a deep network for
subject classification with softmax loss, using the penultimate layer output as
the feature descriptor, and generating a cosine similarity score given a pair
of face images. The softmax loss function does not optimize the features to
have higher similarity score for positive pairs and lower similarity score for
negative pairs, which leads to a performance gap. In this paper, we add an
L2-constraint to the feature descriptors which restricts them to lie on a
hypersphere of a fixed radius. This module can be easily implemented using
existing deep learning frameworks. We show that integrating this simple step in
the training pipeline significantly boosts the performance of face
verification. Specifically, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the
challenging IJB-A dataset, achieving True Accept Rate of 0.909 at False Accept
Rate 0.0001 on the face verification protocol. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on LFW dataset with an accuracy of 99.78%, and
competing performance on YTF dataset with accuracy of 96.08%.

 <dc:description>  -Recent advances in microelectronics have enabled the realization of Wireless
Body Area Networks (WBANs). However , the massive growth in wireless devices
and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things
(IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary
through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we propose a new
protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the
emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a
BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator.
Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency
channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the
superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a
Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience
interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually
switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR,
an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a
time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC.

 <dc:title>Mining Best Closed Itemsets for Projection-antimonotonic Constraints in

 <dc:description>  The exponential explosion of the set of patterns is one of the main
challenges in pattern mining. This challenge is approached by introducing a
constraint for pattern selection. One of the first constraints proposed in
pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is
an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its
superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern
selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to
generate patterns satisfying these constraints.
  In order to deal with nonmonotonic constraints we introduce the notion of
&quot;projection antimonotonicity&quot; and SOFIA algorithm that allow generating best
patterns for a class of nonmonotonic constraints. Cosine interest, robustness,
stability of closed itemsets, and the associated delta-measure are among these
constraints. SOFIA starts from light descriptions of transactions in dataset (a
small set of items in the case of itemset description) and then iteratively
adds more information to these descriptions (more items with indication of
tidsets they describe).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we identify a class of absolutely continuous probability
distributions, and show that the differential entropy is uniformly convergent
over this space under the metric of total variation distance. One of the
advantages of this class is that the requirements could be readily verified for

 <dc:description>  Link-flooding attack (LFA) has emerged as a serious threat to Internet which
cuts off connections between legitimate hosts and targeted servers by flooding
only a few links (e.g., target links). Several mechanisms have been proposed to
mitigate LFA, however, they can only mitigate LFA after target links have been
compromised by adversaries. Based on the fact that adversaries rely on network
linkmap to discover weakness of the network, in this paper, we propose an
active LFA mitigation mechanism, called Linkbait, that actively and
preventively mitigates LFA by providing a fake linkmap to adversaries. Inspired
by Moving Target Defense (MTD), we propose a link obfuscation algorithm in
Linkbait that selectively reroutes probing flows to hide target links from
adversaries and mislead them to consider some bait links as target links. By
providing the faked linkmap to adversaries, Linkbait can actively mitigate LFA
even without identifying bots and does not affect flows from legitimate hosts.
In order to further reduce the junk traffic generated by adversaries from
entering the network, we propose a bot detection algorithm in Linkbait that
extracts unique traffic patterns from LFA and leverages Support Vector Machine
to accurately distinguish bots from legitimate hosts. Finally, we evaluate the
feasibility of implementing Linkbait in real Internet, and evaluate its
performance by using both a real-world testbed and large-scale simulations. The
analyses and experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of Linkbait.

 <dc:description>  While humor has been historically studied from a psychological, cognitive and
linguistic standpoint, its study from a computational perspective is an area
yet to be explored in Computational Linguistics. There exist some previous
works, but a characterization of humor that allows its automatic recognition
and generation is far from being specified. In this work we build a
crowdsourced corpus of labeled tweets, annotated according to its humor value,
letting the annotators subjectively decide which are humorous. A humor
classifier for Spanish tweets is assembled based on supervised learning,
reaching a precision of 84% and a recall of 69%.

 <dc:title>Objects as context for detecting their semantic parts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a semantic part detection approach that effectively leverages
object information.We use the object appearance and its class as indicators of
what parts to expect. We also model the expected relative location of parts
inside the objects based on their appearance. We achieve this with a new
network module, called OffsetNet, that efficiently predicts a variable number
of part locations within a given object. Our model incorporates all these cues
to detect parts in the context of their objects. This leads to considerably
higher performance for the challenging task of part detection compared to using
part appearance alone (+5 mAP on the PASCAL-Part dataset). We also compare to
other part detection methods on both PASCAL-Part and CUB200-2011 datasets.

 <dc:description>  Sending a message through an unknown network is a difficult problem. In this
paper, we consider the case in which, during a preprocessing phase, we assign a
label and a routing table to each node. The routing strategy must then decide
where to send the package using only the label of the target node and the
routing table of the node the message is currently at.
  In this paper, we present the first routing scheme for the particular case in
which the network is defined by the visibility graph of a polygon with $n$
vertices and $h$ holes. For any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ the routing scheme provides
stretch at most $1+\varepsilon$. The labels have $O(\log n)$ bits and the
corresponding routing tables are of size $O(\varepsilon^{-1}(h+1)\log n)$. The
preprocessing time is $O(n^2\log n+(h+1)n^2+\varepsilon^{-1}(h+1)n)$ and can be
improved to $O(n^2+\varepsilon^{-1}n)$ for simple polygons.

 <dc:description>  The sparsity and compressibility of finite-dimensional signals are of great
interest in fields such as compressed sensing. The notion of compressibility is
also extended to infinite sequences of i.i.d. or ergodic random variables based
on the observed error in their nonlinear k-term approximation. In this work, we
use the entropy measure to study the compressibility of continuous-domain
innovation processes (alternatively known as white noise). Specifically, we
define such a measure as the entropy limit of the doubly quantized (time and
amplitude) process. This provides a tool to compare the compressibility of
various innovation processes. It also allows us to identify an analogue of the
concept of &quot;entropy dimension&quot; which was originally defined by R\'enyi for
random variables. Particular attention is given to stable and impulsive Poisson
innovation processes. Here, our results recognize Poisson innovations as the
more compressible ones with an entropy measure far below that of stable
innovations. While this result departs from the previous knowledge regarding
the compressibility of fat-tailed distributions, our entropy measure ranks
stable innovations according to their tail decay.

 <dc:title>Cooking Lightweight XML Query Processor with Binary Joins and Comparing

 <dc:description>  XML queries can be modeled by twig pattern queries (TPQs) specifying
predicates on XML nodes and XPath relationships satisfied between them. A lot
of TPQ types have been proposed; this paper takes into account a TPQ model
extended by a specification of output and non-output query nodes since it
complies with the XQuery semantics and, in many cases, it leads to a more
efficient query processing. In general, there are two approaches to process the
TPQ: holistic joins and binary joins. The holistic joins have been developed as
a generalization of the binary joins, and they have been considered as a
state-of-the-art TPQ processing method. Surprisingly, a thorough analytical and
experimental comparison is still missing despite an enormous research effort in
this area. In this paper, we try to fill this gap; we analytically and
experimentally show that the binary joins used in a fully-pipelined plan (i.e.,
the plan where each join operation does not wait for the complete result of the
previous operation) can often overcome the holistic joins even without any
cost-based optimizer, especially for TPQs with a higher ratio of non-output
query nodes. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
(i) we introduce several improvements of existing binary join approaches
allowing to build a fully-pipelined plan for a TPQ considering non-output query
nodes, (ii) we prove that for a certain class of TPQs such a plan has the
linear time complexity with respect to the size of the input and output as well
as the linear space complexity with respect to the XML document depth (i.e.,
the same complexity as the holistic join approaches), (iii) we show that our
improved binary join approach overcomes the holistic join approaches in many
situations.

 <dc:title>Palgol: A High-Level DSL for Vertex-Centric Graph Processing with Remote
  Data Access</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Pregel is a popular distributed computing model for dealing with large-scale
graphs. However, it can be tricky to implement graph algorithms correctly and
efficiently in Pregel's vertex-centric model, especially when the algorithm has
multiple computation stages, complicated data dependencies, or even
communication over dynamic internal data structures. Some domain-specific
languages (DSLs) have been proposed to provide more intuitive ways to implement
graph algorithms, but due to the lack of support for remote access --- reading
or writing attributes of other vertices through references --- they cannot
handle the above mentioned dynamic communication, causing a class of Pregel
algorithms with fast convergence impossible to implement.
  To address this problem, we design and implement Palgol, a more declarative
and powerful DSL which supports remote access. In particular, programmers can
use a more declarative syntax called chain access to naturally specify dynamic
communication as if directly reading data on arbitrary remote vertices. By
analyzing the logic patterns of chain access, we provide a novel algorithm for
compiling Palgol programs to efficient Pregel code. We demonstrate the power of
Palgol by using it to implement several practical Pregel algorithms, and the
evaluation result shows that the efficiency of Palgol is comparable with that
of hand-written code.

based on our tests of seven different Arabic-script texts of varying quality
and typefaces, totaling over 7,000 lines. These accuracy rates not only
represent a distinct improvement over the actual accuracy rates of the various
proprietary OCR options for classical Arabic-script texts, but, equally
important, they are produced using an open-source OCR software, thus enabling
us to make this Arabic-script OCR technology freely available to the broader

 <dc:description>  Convolutional networks reach top quality in pixel-level object tracking but
require a large amount of training data (1k~10k) to deliver such results. We
propose a new training strategy which achieves state-of-the-art results across
three evaluation datasets while using 20x~100x less annotated data than
competing methods. Our approach is suitable for both single and multiple object
tracking. Instead of using large training sets hoping to generalize across
domains, we generate in-domain training data using the provided annotation on
the first frame of each video to synthesize (&quot;lucid dream&quot;) plausible future
video frames. In-domain per-video training data allows us to train high quality
appearance- and motion-based models, as well as tune the post-processing stage.
This approach allows to reach competitive results even when training from only
a single annotated frame, without ImageNet pre-training. Our results indicate
that using a larger training set is not automatically better, and that for the
tracking task a smaller training set that is closer to the target domain is
more effective. This changes the mindset regarding how many training samples
and general &quot;objectness&quot; knowledge are required for the object tracking task.

 <dc:description>  This work analyzes a mmWave single-cell network, which comprises a macro base
station (BS) and an overlaid tier of small-cell BSs using a wireless backhaul
for data traffic. We look for the optimal number of antennas at both BS and
small-cell BSs that maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system when a
hybrid transceiver architecture is employed. Closed-form expressions for the
EE-optimal values of the number of antennas are derived that provide valuable
insights into the interplay between the optimization variables and hardware
characteristics. Numerical and analytical results show that the maximal EE is
achieved by a 'close-to' fully-digital system wherein the number of BS antennas
is approximately equal to the number of served small cells.

 <dc:description>  We present a mathematical programming-based method for model predictive
control of cyber-physical systems subject to signal temporal logic (STL)
specifications. We describe the use of STL to specify a wide range of
properties of these systems, including safety, response and bounded liveness.
For synthesis, we encode STL specifications as mixed integer-linear constraints
on the system variables in the optimization problem at each step of a receding
horizon control framework. We prove correctness of our algorithms, and present
experimental results for controller synthesis for building energy and climate
control.

 <dc:description>  Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are integral parts of software systems that
require interactions from their users. Software testers have paid special
attention to GUI testing in the last decade, and have devised techniques that
are effective in finding several kinds of GUI errors. However, the introduction
of new types of interactions in GUIs (e.g., direct manipulation) presents new
kinds of errors that are not targeted by current testing techniques. We believe
that to advance GUI testing, the community needs a comprehensive and high level
GUI fault model, which incorporates all types of interactions. The work
detailed in this paper establishes 4 contributions: 1) A GUI fault model
designed to identify and classify GUI faults. 2) An empirical analysis for
assessing the relevance of the proposed fault model against failures found in
real GUIs. 3) An empirical assessment of two GUI testing tools (i.e. GUITAR and
Jubula) against those failures. 4) GUI mutants we've developed according to our
fault model. These mutants are freely available and can be reused by developers
for benchmarking their GUI testing tools.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The universally applied Codd's relational model has two constructs: a stored
relation, with stored attributes only and a view, only with the inherited ones.
In 1992, we have proposed third construct, mixing both types of attributes.
Examples showed the idea attractive. No one followed however. We now revisit
our proposal. We show that a relational database scheme using also our
construct may be more faithful to reality. It may spare the logical navigation
or complex value expressions to queries. It may also avoid auxiliary views,
often necessary in practice at present. Better late than never, existing DBSs
should easily accommodate our proposal, with almost no storage and processing
overhead.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a framework for cross-layer optimization to ensure
ultra-high reliability and ultra-low latency in radio access networks, where
both transmission delay and queueing delay are considered. With short
transmission time, the blocklength of channel codes is finite, and the Shannon
Capacity cannot be used to characterize the maximal achievable rate with given
transmission error probability. With randomly arrived packets, some packets may
violate the queueing delay. Moreover, since the queueing delay is shorter than
the channel coherence time in typical scenarios, the required transmit power to
guarantee the queueing delay and transmission error probability will become
unbounded even with spatial diversity. To ensure the required
quality-of-service (QoS) with finite transmit power, a proactive packet
dropping mechanism is introduced. Then, the overall packet loss probability
includes transmission error probability, queueing delay violation probability,
and packet dropping probability. We optimize the packet dropping policy, power
allocation policy, and bandwidth allocation policy to minimize the transmit
power under the QoS constraint. The optimal solution is obtained, which depends
on both channel and queue state information. Simulation and numerical results
validate our analysis, and show that setting packet loss probabilities equal is
a near optimal solution.

 <dc:description>  Early stopping is a widely used technique to prevent poor generalization
performance when training an over-expressive model by means of gradient-based
optimization. To find a good point to halt the optimizer, a common practice is
to split the dataset into a training and a smaller validation set to obtain an
ongoing estimate of the generalization performance. We propose a novel early
stopping criterion based on fast-to-compute local statistics of the computed
gradients and entirely removes the need for a held-out validation set. Our
experiments show that this is a viable approach in the setting of least-squares
and logistic regression, as well as neural networks.

 <dc:description>  Continuous Integration (CI) implies that a whole developer team works
together on the mainline of a software project. CI systems automate the builds
of a software. Sometimes a developer checks in code, which breaks the build. A
broken build might not be a problem by itself, but it has the potential to
disrupt co-workers, hence it affects the performance of the team. In this
study, we investigate the interplay between nonfunctional requirements (NFRs)
and builds statuses from 1,283 software projects. We found significant
differences among NFRs related-builds statuses. Thus, tools can be proposed to
improve CI with focus on new ways to prevent failures into CI, specially for
efficiency and usability related builds. Also, the time required to put a
broken build back on track indicates a bimodal distribution along all NFRs,
with higher peaks within a day and lower peaks in six weeks. Our results
suggest that more planned schedule for maintainability for Ruby, and for
functionality and reliability for Java would decrease delays related to broken
builds.

 <dc:title>Towards Automatic Generation of Short Summaries of Commits</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Committing to a version control system means submitting a software change to
the system. Each commit can have a message to describe the submission. Several
approaches have been proposed to automatically generate the content of such
messages. However, the quality of the automatically generated messages falls
far short of what humans write. In studying the differences between
auto-generated and human-written messages, we found that 82% of the
human-written messages have only one sentence, while the automatically
generated messages often have multiple lines. Furthermore, we found that the
commit messages often begin with a verb followed by an direct object. This
finding inspired us to use a &quot;verb+object&quot; format in this paper to generate
short commit summaries. We split the approach into two parts: verb generation
and object generation. As our first try, we trained a classifier to classify a
diff to a verb. We are seeking feedback from the community before we continue
to work on generating direct objects for the commits.

 <dc:description>  When learning to use an Application Programming Interface (API), programmers
need to understand the inputs and outputs (I/O) of the API functions. Current
documentation tools automatically document the static information of I/O, such
as parameter types and names. What is missing from these tools is dynamic
information, such as I/O examples---actual valid values of inputs that produce
certain outputs. In this paper, we demonstrate Docio, a prototype toolset we
built to generate I/O examples. Docio logs I/O values when API functions are
executed, for example in running test suites. Then, Docio puts I/O values into
API documents as I/O examples. Docio has three programs: 1) funcWatch, which
collects I/O values when API developers run test suites, 2) ioSelect, which
selects one I/O example from a set of I/O values, and 3) ioPresent, which
embeds the I/O examples into documents. In a preliminary evaluation, we used
Docio to generate four hundred I/O examples for three C libraries: ffmpeg,
libssh, and protobuf-c. Docio is open-source and available at:

 <dc:description>  Classical higher-order logic, when utilized as a meta-logic in which various
other (classical and non-classical) logics can be shallowly embedded, is well
suited for realising a universal logic reasoning approach. Universal logic
reasoning in turn, as envisioned already by Leibniz, may support the rigorous
formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments within machines.
A respective universal logic reasoning framework is described and a range of
exemplary applications are discussed. In the future, universal logic reasoning
in combination with appropriate, controlled forms of rational argumentation may
serve as a communication layer between humans and intelligent machines.

 <dc:title>Learning and Refining of Privileged Information-based RNNs for Action
  Recognition from Depth Sequences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shi, Zhiyuan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Tae-Kyun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Existing RNN-based approaches for action recognition from depth sequences
require either skeleton joints or hand-crafted depth features as inputs. An
end-to-end manner, mapping from raw depth maps to action classes, is
non-trivial to design due to the fact that: 1) single channel map lacks texture
thus weakens the discriminative power; 2) relatively small set of depth
training data. To address these challenges, we propose to learn an RNN driven
by privileged information (PI) in three-steps: An encoder is pre-trained to
learn a joint embedding of depth appearance and PI (i.e. skeleton joints). The
learned embedding layers are then tuned in the learning step, aiming to
optimize the network by exploiting PI in a form of multi-task loss. However,
exploiting PI as a secondary task provides little help to improve the
performance of a primary task (i.e. classification) due to the gap between
them. Finally, a bridging matrix is defined to connect two tasks by discovering
latent PI in the refining step. Our PI-based classification loss maintains a
consistency between latent PI and predicted distribution. The latent PI and
network are iteratively estimated and updated in an expectation-maximization
procedure. The proposed learning process provides greater discriminative power
to model subtle depth difference, while helping avoid overfitting the scarcer
training data. Our experiments show significant performance gains over
state-of-the-art methods on three public benchmark datasets and our newly
collected Blanket dataset.

 <dc:description>  This second part of a 2 volume-expertise is mainly based on the results of
the inventory described in the first part. It is also based on a &quot;worrying&quot;
statement in the terms of reference of this expert report 1, which states that
&quot;Asia enjoys a favourable technological context [in terms of equipment
according to UN statistics]. Nevertheless, digital technology is still hardly
present in the practices of the member institutions of the Agency and the
francophone university community; So distance education is not well developed:
there are currently no French-language distance training courses offered by an
establishment in Asia; The region has only 14 enrolled in ODL over the period
2010 - 2014; Only three institutions have responded to the AUF's &quot;Mooc&quot; calls
for projects over the last two years, etc.&quot;. The terms of reference also
indicate a state of deficiency &quot;in the Francophone digital campuses whose
officials explain that the computer equipment are less and less used for
individual practices&quot;. The proliferation of mobile digital technologies that
would normally constitute an important asset for the development of teaching
practices and innovative research around the Francophone digital campuses has
not lived up to expectations. The paper refers to another no less important
detail that would explain the paradox between the proliferation of
technological tools and the reduction in usage when it indicates that, in
parallel, and contrary to the francophone campuses, In English a positive
dynamics of integration of T ICE and distance&quot;. The document provides concrete
examples, such as the ASEAN Cyber University (ACU) program run by South Korea
and its e-learning centers in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar, The
Vietnamese language and the fablab set up in the region since 2014 without the
Francophonie being involved. A first hypothesis emerges from this premonitory
observation that it is not technology that justifies the gradual demobilization
(or even demotivation) of local actors to establish forms of Francophone
partnerships for training and research. Nor is it a question of political will
to improve technological infrastructure in digital training and research.
Almost all the interviews carried out within the framework of this mission
demonstrated the convergence of views and ambitious attitudes expressed by
three categories of actors encountered:- political actors met in the ministries
of education of the three countries who are aware of the importance of digital
education and the added value generated by technologies for education. Each of
the three countries has a regulatory framework and national technological
innovation projects for education and digital education;- public and private
academic institutions which, through their rectors, presidents and technical
and pedagogical leaders, demonstrate their profound convictions for digital
education (for reasons of quality, competitiveness and economic interest).
However, given the rather centralized governance model at state level, the
majority of academic institutions in the three countries are often awaiting the
promulgation of legal texts (decrees, charters, conventions, directives , Etc.)
that enable them to act and adopt innovative solutions in teaching and
research;- Teacher-researchers relatively little consulted in this expertise,
but sufficiently engaged as actors on the ground to be able to predict their
points of view with regard to the use of digital in their pedagogical and
research activities. Teachers and researchers with relatively modest incomes
would inevitably have a decisive role in any academic reform on the digital
level if concrete mobilizing arguments could compensate for their shortfalls by
joining digital training or development projects or programs.

 <dc:description>  Higher education in the fourth industrial revolution, HE 4.0, is a complex,
dialectical and exciting opportunity which can potentially transform society
for the better. The fourth industrial revolution is powered by artificial
intelligence and it will transform the workplace from tasks based
characteristics to the human centred characteristics. Because of the
convergence of man and machine, it will reduce the subject distance between
humanities and social science as well as science and technology. This will
necessarily require much more interdisciplinary teaching, research and
innovation. This paper explores the impact of HE 4.0 on the mission of a
university which is teaching, research (including innovation) and service.

 <dc:description>  We present a hybrid method for latent information discovery on the data sets
containing both text content and connection structure based on constrained low
rank approximation. The new method jointly optimizes the Nonnegative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) objective function for text clustering and the Symmetric
NMF (SymNMF) objective function for graph clustering. We propose an effective
algorithm for the joint NMF objective function, based on a block coordinate
descent (BCD) framework. The proposed hybrid method discovers content
associations via latent connections found using SymNMF. The method can also be
applied with a natural conversion of the problem when a hypergraph formulation
is used or the content is associated with hypergraph edges.
  Experimental results show that by simultaneously utilizing both content and
connection structure, our hybrid method produces higher quality clustering
results compared to the other NMF clustering methods that uses content alone
(standard NMF) or connection structure alone (SymNMF). We also present some
interesting applications to several types of real world data such as citation
recommendations of papers. The hybrid method proposed in this paper can also be
applied to general data expressed with both feature space vectors and pairwise
similarities and can be extended to the case with multiple feature spaces or
multiple similarity measures.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents real-time vibration based identification technique using
measured frequency response functions(FRFs) under random vibration loading.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are trained to map damage fingerprints to
damage characteristic parameters. Principal component statistical analysis(PCA)
technique was used to tackle the problem of high dimensionality and high noise
of data, which is common for industrial structures. The present study considers
Crack, Rivet hole expansion and redundant uniform mass as damages on the
structure. Frequency response function data after being reduced in size using
PCA is fed to individual neural networks to localize and predict the severity
of damage on the structure. The system of ANNs trained with both numerical and
experimental model data to make the system reliable and robust. The methodology
is applied to a numerical model of stiffened panel structure, where damages are
confined close to the stiffener. The results showed that, in all the cases
considered, it is possible to localize and predict severity of the damage
occurrence with very good accuracy and reliability.

 <dc:description>  Different users can use a given Internet application in many different ways.
The ability to record detailed event logs of user in-application activity
allows us to discover ways in which the application is being used. This enables
personalization and also leads to important insights with actionable business
and product outcomes.
  Here we study the problem of user session categorization, where the goal is
to automatically discover categories/classes of user in-session behavior using
event logs, and then consistently categorize each user session into the
discovered classes. We develop a three stage approach which uses clustering to
discover categories of sessions, then builds classifiers to classify new
sessions into the discovered categories, and finally performs daily
classification in a distributed pipeline. An important innovation of our
approach is selecting a set of events as long-tail features, and replacing them
with a new feature that is less sensitive to product experimentation and
logging changes. This allows for robust and stable identification of session
types even though the underlying application is constantly changing. We deploy
the approach to Pinterest and demonstrate its effectiveness. We discover
insights that have consequences for product monetization, growth, and design.
Our solution classifies millions of user sessions daily and leads to actionable
insights.

 <dc:description>  We are living in an information era from Twitter to Fitocracy every episode
of peoples life is converted to numbers. That abundance of data is also
available in information technologies. From Stackoverflow to GitHub many big
data sources are available about trends in Information Technologies. The aim of
this research is studying information technology trends and compiling useful
information about those technologies using big data sources mentioned above.
Those collected information might be helpful for decision makers or information
technology professionals to decide where to invest their time and money. In
this research we have mined and analyzed StackExchange and GitHub data for
creating meaningful predictions about information technologies. Initially
StackExchange and GitHub data were imported into local data repositories. After
the data is imported, cleaning and preprocessing techniques like tokenization,
stemming and dimensionality reduction are applied to data. After preprocessing
and cleaning keywords, their relations are extracted from data. Using those
keywords data, four main knowledge areas and their variations, i.e., 20
Programming Languages, 8 Database Applications, 4 Cloud Services and 3 Mobile
Operating Systems, are selected for analysis of their trends. After the
keywords are selected, extracted patterns are used for cluster analysis in
Gephi. Produced graphs are used for the exploratory analysis of the programming
languages data. After exploratory analysis, time series of usage are created
for selected keywords. Those times series are used as training and testing data
for forecasts created using R forecast library. After making forecasts, their
accuracy are tested using Mean Magnitude of Relative Error and Median Magnitude
of Relative Error.

 <dc:title>On the Efficiency of Sharing Economy Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider a sharing economy network where agents embedded in a graph share
their resources. This is a fundamental model that abstracts numerous emerging
applications of collaborative consumption systems. The agents generate a random
amount of spare resource that they can exchange with their one-hop neighbours,
seeking to maximize the amount of desirable resource items they receive in the
long run. We study this system from three different perspectives: a) the
central designer who seeks the resource allocation that achieves the most fair
endowments after the exchange; b) the game theoretic where the nodes seek to
form sharing coalitions within teams, attempting to maximize the benefit of
their team only; c) the market where the nodes are engaged in trade with their
neighbours trying to improve their own benefit. It is shown that there is a
unique family of sharing allocations that are at the same time most fair,
stable with respect to continuous coalition formation among the nodes and
achieving equilibrium in the market perspective. A dynamic sharing policy is
given then where each node observes the sharing rates of its neighbours and
allocates its resource accordingly. That policy is shown to achieve long term
sharing ratios that are within the family of equilibrium allocations of the
static problem. The equilibrium allocations have interesting properties that
highlight the dependence of the sharing ratios of each node to the structure of
the topology graph and the effect of the isolation of a node on the benefit may
extract from his neighbours.

 <dc:title>Transmission Game in MIMO Interference Channels With Radio-Frequency
  Energy Harvesting</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dong, Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For multi-user transmissions over MIMO interference channels, each user
designs the transmit covariance matrix to maximize its information rate. When
passive radio-frequency (RF) energy harvesters are present in the network, the
transmissions are constrained by both the transmit power limits and the energy
harvesting requirements. A passive RF energy harvester collects the radiated
energy from nearby wireless information transmitters instead of using a
dedicated wireless power source. It needs multiple transmitters to concentrate
their RF radiation on it because typical electric field strengths are weak. In
this paper, strategic games are proposed for the multi-user transmissions.
First, in a non-cooperative game, each transmitter has a best-response strategy
for the transmit covariance matrix that follows a multi-level water-filling
solution. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium exists. Secondly, in a cooperative
game, there is no need to estimate the proportion of the harvested energy from
each transmitter. Rather, the transmitters bargain over the unit-reward of the
energy contribution. An approximation of the information rate is used in
constructing the individual utility such that the problem of network utility
maximization can be decomposed and the bargaining process can be implemented
distributively. The bargaining solution gives a point of rates that is superior
to the Nash equilibria and close to the Pareto front. Simulation results verify
the algorithms that provide good communication performance while satisfying the
RF energy-harvesting requirements.

 <dc:description>  In visual question answering (VQA), an algorithm must answer text-based
questions about images. While multiple datasets for VQA have been created since
late 2014, they all have flaws in both their content and the way algorithms are
evaluated on them. As a result, evaluation scores are inflated and
predominantly determined by answering easier questions, making it difficult to
compare different methods. In this paper, we analyze existing VQA algorithms
using a new dataset. It contains over 1.6 million questions organized into 12
different categories. We also introduce questions that are meaningless for a
given image to force a VQA system to reason about image content. We propose new
evaluation schemes that compensate for over-represented question-types and make
it easier to study the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms. We analyze the
performance of both baseline and state-of-the-art VQA models, including
multi-modal compact bilinear pooling (MCB), neural module networks, and
recurrent answering units. Our experiments establish how attention helps
certain categories more than others, determine which models work better than
others, and explain how simple models (e.g. MLP) can surpass more complex
models (MCB) by simply learning to answer large, easy question categories.

 <dc:description>  Sparse coding (SC) is an automatic feature extraction and selection technique
that is widely used in unsupervised learning. However, conventional SC
vectorizes the input images, which breaks apart the local proximity of pixels
and destructs the elementary object structures of images. In this paper, we
propose a novel two-dimensional sparse coding (2DSC) scheme that represents the
input images as the tensor-linear combinations under a novel algebraic
framework. 2DSC learns much more concise dictionaries because it uses the
circular convolution operator, since the shifted versions of atoms learned by
conventional SC are treated as the same ones. We apply 2DSC to natural images
and demonstrate that 2DSC returns meaningful dictionaries for large patches.
Moreover, for mutli-spectral images denoising, the proposed 2DSC reduces
computational costs with competitive performance in comparison with the
state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Many link prediction algorithms require the computation of a similarity
metric on each vertex pair, which is quadratic in the number of vertices and
infeasible for large networks. We develop a class of link prediction algorithms

scalable to very large networks. We compare the prediction accuracy and runtime
of these methods to existing algorithms on several large link prediction tasks.
Our methods achieve comparable accuracy to standard algorithms but are

 <dc:title>Semi and Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation Using Generative

 <dc:description>  Semantic segmentation has been a long standing challenging task in computer
vision. It aims at assigning a label to each image pixel and needs significant
number of pixellevel annotated data, which is often unavailable. To address
this lack, in this paper, we leverage, on one hand, massive amount of available
unlabeled or weakly labeled data, and on the other hand, non-real images
created through Generative Adversarial Networks. In particular, we propose a
semi-supervised framework ,based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs),
which consists of a generator network to provide extra training examples to a
multi-class classifier, acting as discriminator in the GAN framework, that
assigns sample a label y from the K possible classes or marks it as a fake
sample (extra class). The underlying idea is that adding large fake visual data
forces real samples to be close in the feature space, enabling a bottom-up
clustering process, which, in turn, improves multiclass pixel classification.
To ensure higher quality of generated images for GANs with consequent improved
pixel classification, we extend the above framework by adding weakly annotated
data, i.e., we provide class level information to the generator. We tested our
approaches on several challenging benchmarking visual datasets, i.e. PASCAL,
SiftFLow, Stanford and CamVid, achieving competitive performance also compared
to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method

 <dc:description>  Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed strategic
behavior by fitting reinforcement learning models to behavioral data. However,
traditional IRL methods are only applicable when the observations are in the
form of state-action paths. This assumption may not hold in many real-world
modelling settings, where only partial observations are available. In general,
we may assume that there is a summarizing function $\sigma$, which acts as a
filter between us and the true state-action paths that constitute the
demonstration. Some initial approaches to extending IRL to such situations have
been presented, but with very specific assumptions about the structure of
$\sigma$, such as that only certain state observations are missing. This paper
instead focuses on the most general case of the problem, where no assumptions
are made about the summarizing function, except that it can be evaluated. We
demonstrate that inference is still possible. The paper presents exact and
approximate inference algorithms that allow full posterior inference, which is
particularly important for assessing parameter uncertainty in this challenging
inference situation. Empirical scalability is demonstrated to reasonably sized
problems, and practical applicability is demonstrated by estimating the
posterior for a cognitive science RL model based on observed user's task
completion time only.

 <dc:description>  Recently Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been used to speed up very
CPU-intensive gravitational microlensing simulations. In this work, we use the
Xeon Phi coprocessor to accelerate such simulations and compare its performance
on a microlensing code with that of NVIDIA's GPUs. For the selected set of
parameters evaluated in our experiment, we find that the speedup by Intel's
Knights Corner coprocessor is comparable to that by NVIDIA's Fermi family of
GPUs with compute capability 2.0, but less significant than GPUs with higher
compute capabilities such as the Kepler. However, the very recently released
second generation Xeon Phi, Knights Landing, is about 5.8 times faster than the
Knights Corner, and about 2.9 times faster than the Kepler GPU used in our
simulations. We conclude that the Xeon Phi is a very promising alternative to
GPUs for modern high performance microlensing simulations.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We exploit the following observation to directly find epipolar lines. For a
pixel p in Image A all pixels corresponding to p in Image B are on the same
epipolar line, or equivalently the image of the line spanning A's center and p
is an epipolar line in B. Computing the epipolar geometry from feature points
between cameras with very different viewpoints is often error prone as an
object's appearance can vary greatly between images. This paper extends earlier
work based on the dynamics of the scene which was successful in these cases.
The algorithms introduced here for finding corresponding epipolar lines
accelerate and robustify previous methods for computing the epipolar geometry
in dynamic scenes.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G$, a proper $k$-coloring of $G$ is a partition $c =
(S_i)_{i\in [1,k]}$ of $V(G)$ into $k$ stable sets $S_1,\ldots, S_{k}$. Given a
weight function $w: V(G) \to \mathbb{R}^+$, the weight of a color $S_i$ is
defined as $w(i) = \max_{v \in S_i} w(v)$ and the weight of a coloring $c$ as
$w(c) = \sum_{i=1}^{k}w(i)$. Guan and Zhu [Inf. Process. Lett., 1997] defined
the weighted chromatic number of a pair $(G,w)$, denoted by $\sigma(G,w)$, as
the minimum weight of a proper coloring of $G$. For a positive integer $r$,
they also defined $\sigma(G,w;r)$ as the minimum of $w(c)$ among all proper
$r$-colorings $c$ of $G$.
  The complexity of determining $\sigma(G,w)$ when $G$ is a tree was open for
almost 20 years, until Ara\'ujo et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2014] recently
proved that the problem cannot be solved in time $n^{o(\log n)}$ on $n$-vertex
trees unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.
  The objective of this article is to provide hardness results for computing
$\sigma(G,w)$ and $\sigma(G,w;r)$ when $G$ is a tree or a forest, relying on
complexity assumptions weaker than the ETH. Namely, we study the problem from
the viewpoint of parameterized complexity, and we assume the weaker hypothesis
$FPT \neq W[1]$. Building on the techniques of Ara\'ujo et al., we prove that
when $G$ is a forest, computing $\sigma(G,w)$ is $W[1]$-hard parameterized by
the size of a largest connected component of $G$, and that computing
$\sigma(G,w;r)$ is $W[2]$-hard parameterized by $r$. Our results rule out the
existence of $FPT$ algorithms for computing these invariants on trees or
forests for many natural choices of the parameter.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning-based approaches have been widely used for training controllers
for autonomous vehicles due to their powerful ability to approximate nonlinear
functions or policies. However, the training process usually requires large
labeled data sets and takes a lot of time. In this paper, we analyze the
influences of features on the performance of controllers trained using the
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which gives a guideline of feature
selection to reduce computation cost. We collect a large set of data using The
Open Racing Car Simulator (TORCS) and classify the image features into three
categories (sky-related, roadside-related, and road-related features).We then
design two experimental frameworks to investigate the importance of each single
feature for training a CNN controller.The first framework uses the training
data with all three features included to train a controller, which is then
tested with data that has one feature removed to evaluate the feature's
effects. The second framework is trained with the data that has one feature
excluded, while all three features are included in the test data. Different
driving scenarios are selected to test and analyze the trained controllers
using the two experimental frameworks. The experiment results show that (1) the
road-related features are indispensable for training the controller, (2) the
roadside-related features are useful to improve the generalizability of the
controller to scenarios with complicated roadside information, and (3) the
sky-related features have limited contribution to train an end-to-end
autonomous vehicle controller.

 <dc:description>  Users of electronic devices, e.g., laptop, smartphone, etc. have
characteristic behaviors while surfing the Web. Profiling this behavior can
help identify the person using a given device. In this paper, we introduce a
technique to profile users based on their web transactions. We compute several
features extracted from a sequence of web transactions and use them with
one-class classification techniques to profile a user. We assess the efficacy
and speed of our method at differentiating 25 users on a dataset representing 6
months of web traffic monitoring from a small company network.

 <dc:description>  Very large-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable
successes in a large variety of computer vision tasks. However, the high
computation intensity of DNNs makes it challenging to deploy these models on
resource-limited systems. Some studies used low-rank approaches that
approximate the filters by low-rank basis to accelerate the testing. Those
works directly decomposed the pre-trained DNNs by Low-Rank Approximations
(LRA). How to train DNNs toward lower-rank space for more efficient DNNs,
however, remains as an open area. To solve the issue, in this work, we propose
Force Regularization, which uses attractive forces to enforce filters so as to
coordinate more weight information into lower-rank space. We mathematically and
empirically verify that after applying our technique, standard LRA methods can
reconstruct filters using much lower basis and thus result in faster DNNs. The
effectiveness of our approach is comprehensively evaluated in ResNets, AlexNet,
and GoogLeNet. In AlexNet, for example, Force Regularization gains 2x speedup
on modern GPU without accuracy loss and 4.05x speedup on CPU by paying small
accuracy degradation. Moreover, Force Regularization better initializes the
low-rank DNNs such that the fine-tuning can converge faster toward higher
accuracy. The obtained lower-rank DNNs can be further sparsified, proving that
Force Regularization can be integrated with state-of-the-art sparsity-based
acceleration methods. Source code is available in

 <dc:description>  Intrusion detection for computer network systems becomes one of the most
critical tasks for network administrators today. It has an important role for
organizations, governments and our society due to its valuable resources on
computer networks. Traditional misuse detection strategies are unable to detect
new and unknown intrusion. Besides, anomaly detection in network security is
aim to distinguish between illegal or malicious events and normal behavior of
network systems. Anomaly detection can be considered as a classification
problem where it builds models of normal network behavior, which it uses to
detect new patterns that significantly deviate from the model. Most of the cur-
rent research on anomaly detection is based on the learning of normally and
anomaly behaviors. They do not take into account the previous, re- cent events
to detect the new incoming one. In this paper, we propose a real time
collective anomaly detection model based on neural network learning and feature
operating. Normally a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM
RNN) is trained only on normal data and it is capable of predicting several
time steps ahead of an input. In our approach, a LSTM RNN is trained with
normal time series data before performing a live prediction for each time step.
Instead of considering each time step separately, the observation of prediction
errors from a certain number of time steps is now proposed as a new idea for
detecting collective anomalies. The prediction errors from a number of the
latest time steps above a threshold will indicate a collective anomaly. The
model is built on a time series version of the KDD 1999 dataset. The
experiments demonstrate that it is possible to offer reliable and efficient for
collective anomaly detection.

 <dc:description>  Attacks on the microarchitecture of modern processors have become a practical
threat to security and privacy in desktop and cloud computing. Recently, cache
attacks have successfully been demonstrated on ARM based mobile devices,
suggesting they are as vulnerable as their desktop or server counterparts. In
this work, we show that previous literature might have left an overly
pessimistic conclusion of ARM's security as we unveil AutoLock: an internal
performance enhancement found in inclusive cache levels of ARM processors that
adversely affects Evict+Time, Prime+Probe, and Evict+Reload attacks. AutoLock's
presence on system-on-chips (SoCs) is not publicly documented, yet knowing that
it is implemented is vital to correctly assess the risk of cache attacks. We
therefore provide a detailed description of the feature and propose three ways
to detect its presence on actual SoCs. We illustrate how AutoLock impedes
cross-core cache evictions, but show that its effect can also be compensated in
a practical attack. Our findings highlight the intricacies of cache attacks on
ARM and suggest that a fair and comprehensive vulnerability assessment requires
an in-depth understanding of ARM's cache architectures and rigorous testing
across a broad range of ARM based devices.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a distributed gossip approach for finding a Nash
equilibrium in networked games on graphs. In such games a player's cost
function may be affected by the actions of any subset of players. An
interference graph is employed to illustrate the partially-coupled cost
functions and the asymmetric information requirements. For a given interference
graph, network communication between players is considered to be limited. A
generalized communication graph is designed so that players exchange only their
required information. An algorithm is designed whereby players, with possibly
partially-coupled cost functions, make decisions based on the estimates of
other players' actions obtained from local neighbors. It is shown that this
choice of communication graph guarantees that all players' information is
exchanged after sufficiently many iterations. Using a set of standard
assumptions on the cost functions, the interference and the communication
graphs, almost sure convergence to a Nash equilibrium is proved for diminishing
step sizes. Moreover, the case when the cost functions are not known by the
players is investigated and a convergence proof is presented for diminishing
step sizes. The effect of the second largest eigenvalue of the expected
communication matrix on the convergence rate is quantified. The trade-off
between parameters associated with the communication graph and the ones
associated with the interference graph is illustrated. Numerical results are
presented for a large-scale networked game.

 <dc:title>Unifying the Stochastic Spectral Descent for Restricted Boltzmann
  Machines with Bernoulli or Gaussian Inputs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fan, Kai</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Stochastic gradient descent based algorithms are typically used as the
general optimization tools for most deep learning models. A Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a probabilistic generative model that can be stacked
to construct deep architectures. For RBM with Bernoulli inputs, non-Euclidean
algorithm such as stochastic spectral descent (SSD) has been specifically
designed to speed up the convergence with improved use of the gradient
estimation by sampling methods. However, the existing algorithm and
corresponding theoretical justification depend on the assumption that the
possible configurations of inputs are finite, like binary variables. The
purpose of this paper is to generalize SSD for Gaussian RBM being capable of
mod- eling continuous data, regardless of the previous assumption. We propose
the gradient descent methods in non-Euclidean space of parameters, via de-
riving the upper bounds of logarithmic partition function for RBMs based on
Schatten-infinity norm. We empirically show that the advantage and improvement
of SSD over stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

 <dc:description>  We present a temporal 6-DOF tracking method which leverages deep learning to
achieve state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets of real world
capture. Our method is both more accurate and more robust to occlusions than
the existing best performing approaches while maintaining real-time
performance. To assess its efficacy, we evaluate our approach on several
challenging RGBD sequences of real objects in a variety of conditions. Notably,
we systematically evaluate robustness to occlusions through a series of
sequences where the object to be tracked is increasingly occluded. Finally, our
approach is purely data-driven and does not require any hand-designed features:
robust tracking is automatically learned from data.

 <dc:description>  Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) consists in automatically estimating the
notes in an audio recording, through three attributes: onset time, duration and
pitch. Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA) has become very popular
for this task. PLCA is a spectrogram factorization method, able to model a
magnitude spectrogram as a linear combination of spectral vectors from a
dictionary. Such methods use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to
estimate the parameters of the acoustic model. This algorithm presents
well-known inherent defaults (local convergence, initialization dependency),
making EM-based systems limited in their applications to AMT, particularly in
regards to the mathematical form and number of priors. To overcome such limits,
we propose in this paper to employ a different estimation framework based on
Particle Filtering (PF), which consists in sampling the posterior distribution
over larger parameter ranges. This framework proves to be more robust in
parameter estimation, more flexible and unifying in the integration of prior
knowledge in the system. Note-level transcription accuracies of 61.8 $\%$ and
59.5 $\%$ were achieved on evaluation sound datasets of two different
instrument repertoires, including the classical piano (from MAPS dataset) and
the marovany zither, and direct comparisons to previous PLCA-based approaches
are provided. Steps for further development are also outlined.

 <dc:description>  The importance of quantifying the nature and intensity of emotional states at
the level of populations is evident: we would like to know how, when, and why
individuals feel as they do if we wish, for example, to better construct public
policy, build more successful organizations, and, from a scientific
perspective, more fully understand economic and social phenomena. Here, by
incorporating direct human assessment of words, we quantify happiness levels on
a continuous scale for a diverse set of large-scale texts: song titles and
lyrics, weblogs, and State of the Union addresses. Our method is transparent,
improvable, capable of rapidly processing Web-scale texts, and moves beyond
approaches based on coarse categorization. Among a number of observations, we
find that the happiness of song lyrics trends downward from the 1960's to the
mid 1990's while remaining stable within genres, and that the happiness of
blogs has steadily increased from 2005 to 2009, exhibiting a striking rise and
fall with blogger age and distance from the equator.

 <dc:description>  Automatic Music Transcription (AMT) is one of the oldest and most
well-studied problems in the field of music information retrieval. Within this
challenging research field, onset detection and instrument recognition take
important places in transcription systems, as they respectively help to
determine exact onset times of notes and to recognize the corresponding
instrument sources. The aim of this study is to explore the usefulness of
multiscale scattering operators for these two tasks on plucked string
instrument and piano music. After resuming the theoretical background and
illustrating the key features of this sound representation method, we evaluate
its performances comparatively to other classical sound representations. Using
both MIDI-driven datasets with real instrument samples and real musical pieces,
scattering is proved to outperform other sound representations for these AMT
subtasks, putting forward its richer sound representation and invariance
properties.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide a novel dataset designed for camera invariant color
constancy research. Camera invariance corresponds to the robustness of an
algorithm's performance when run on images of the same scene taken by different
cameras. Accordingly, images in the database correspond to several lab and
field scenes each of which are captured by three different cameras with minimal
registration errors. The lab scenes are also captured under five different
illuminations. The spectral responses of cameras and the spectral power
distributions of the lab light sources are also provided, as they may prove
beneficial for training future algorithms to achieve color constancy. For a
fair evaluation of future methods, we provide guidelines for supervised methods
with indicated training, validation and testing partitions. Accordingly, we
evaluate a recently proposed convolutional neural network based color constancy
algorithm as a baseline for future research. As a side contribution, this
dataset also includes images taken by a mobile camera with color shading
corrected and uncorrected results. This allows research on the effect of color
shading as well.

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks are becoming the de-facto standard models for image
understanding, and more generally for computer vision tasks. As they involve
highly parallelizable computations, CNN are well suited to current fine grain
programmable logic devices. Thus, multiple CNN accelerators have been
successfully implemented on FPGAs. Unfortunately, FPGA resources such as logic
elements or DSP units remain limited. This work presents a holistic method
relying on approximate computing and design space exploration to optimize the
DSP block utilization of a CNN implementation on an FPGA. This method was
tested when implementing a reconfigurable OCR convolutional neural network on
an Altera Stratix V device and varying both data representation and CNN
topology in order to find the best combination in terms of DSP block
utilization and classification accuracy. This exploration generated dataflow
architectures of 76 CNN topologies with 5 different fixed point representation.
Most efficient implementation performs 883 classifications/sec at 256 x 256
resolution using 8% of the available DSP blocks.

 <dc:title>Reliability or Sustainability: Optimal Data Stream Estimation and

 <dc:description>  As a typical Cyber-Physical System (CPS), smart water distribution networks
require monitoring of underground water pipes with high sample rates for
precise data analysis and water network control. Due to poor underground
wireless channel quality and long-range communication requirements, high
transmission power is typically adopted to communicate high-speed sensor data
streams; posing challenges for long term sustainable monitoring. In this paper,
we develop the first sustainable water sensing system, exploiting energy
harvesting opportunities from water flows. Our system does this by scheduling
the transmission of a subset of the data streams, while other correlated
streams are estimated using auto-regressive models based on the sound-velocity
propagation of pressure signals inside water networks. To compute the optimal
scheduling policy, we formalize a stochastic optimization problem to maximize
the estimation reliability, while ensuring the system's sustainable operation
under dynamic conditions. We develop Data Transmission Scheduling (DTS), an
asymptotically optimal scheme; and FAST-DTS, a lightweight online algorithm
that can adapt to arbitrary energy and correlation dynamics. Using over 170
days of real data from our smart water system deployment and conducting
in-vitro experiments to our small-scale testbed; our evaluation demonstrates
that Fast-DTS significantly outperforms three alternatives, considering data
reliability, energy utilization, and sustainable operation.

 <dc:description>  The recognition of actions from video sequences has many applications in
health monitoring, assisted living, surveillance, and smart homes. Despite
advances in sensing, in particular related to 3D video, the methodologies to
process the data are still subject to research. We demonstrate superior results
by a system which combines recurrent neural networks with convolutional neural
networks in a voting approach. The gated-recurrent-unit-based neural networks
are particularly well-suited to distinguish actions based on long-term
information from optical tracking data; the 3D-CNNs focus more on detailed,
recent information from video data. The resulting features are merged in an SVM
which then classifies the movement. In this architecture, our method improves
recognition rates of state-of-the-art methods by 14% on standard data sets.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates a novel task of generating texture images from
perceptual descriptions. Previous work on texture generation focused on either
synthesis from examples or generation from procedural models. Generating
textures from perceptual attributes have not been well studied yet. Meanwhile,
perceptual attributes, such as directionality, regularity and roughness are
important factors for human observers to describe a texture. In this paper, we
propose a joint deep network model that combines adversarial training and
perceptual feature regression for texture generation, while only random noise
and user-defined perceptual attributes are required as input. In this model, a
preliminary trained convolutional neural network is essentially integrated with
the adversarial framework, which can drive the generated textures to possess
given perceptual attributes. An important aspect of the proposed model is that,
if we change one of the input perceptual features, the corresponding appearance
of the generated textures will also be changed. We design several experiments
to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the
proposed method can produce high quality texture images with desired perceptual
properties.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the risks and potential impacts of spreadsheet errors in
scientific research data in a Neuroscience research centre in the UK.
  Spreadsheets usage in neuroscience, or indeed any medical discipline, is a
largely unreported area of spreadsheet research. This paper presents a case
study exploring the possible risks and impacts of spreadsheet errors in the
neuroscience research centre at the University of Newcastle. Data was collected
using an online questionnaire with 17 participants and two detailed
semi-structured interviews.
  The analysis highlights that errors in research data may lead to severe
impacts such as misleading science and damaged personal and organisational
reputations. In addition, many risks factors arise from using spreadsheets such
as inadequate design and a lack of training.
  Spreadsheets are used widely in business and the impacts and risks in these
fields have been studied and highlighted in detail. However, scientific
research and spreadsheets have also a significant relationship that has not
been clarified. The paper also draws out the similarities in spreadsheet
practice between the scientific and business communities.

 <dc:description>  The potential for agents, whether embodied or software, to learn by observing
other agents performing procedures involving objects and actions is rich.
Current research on automatic procedure learning heavily relies on action
labels or video subtitles, even during the evaluation phase, which makes them
infeasible in real-world scenarios. This leads to our question: can the
human-consensus structure of a procedure be learned from a large set of long,
unconstrained videos (e.g., instructional videos from YouTube) with only visual
evidence? To answer this question, we introduce the problem of procedure
segmentation--to segment a video procedure into category-independent procedure
segments. Given that no large-scale dataset is available for this problem, we
collect a large-scale procedure segmentation dataset with procedure segments
temporally localized and described; we use cooking videos and name the dataset
YouCook2. We propose a segment-level recurrent network for generating procedure
segments by modeling the dependencies across segments. The generated segments
can be used as pre-processing for other tasks, such as dense video captioning
and event parsing. We show in our experiments that the proposed model
outperforms competitive baselines in procedure segmentation.

 <dc:title>Automatic Temperature Setpoint Tuning of a Thermoforming Machine using

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new way to design a Fuzzy Terminal Iterative Learning
Control (TILC) to control the heater temperature setpoints of a thermoforming
machine. This fuzzy TILC is based on the inverse of a fuzzy model of this
machine, and is built from experimental (or simulation) data with kriging
interpolation. The Fuzzy Inference System usually used for a fuzzy model is the
zero order Takagi Sugeno Kwan system (constant consequents). In this paper, the
1st order Takagi Sugeno Kwan system is used, with the fuzzy model rules
expressed using matrices. This makes the inversion of the fuzzy model much
easier than the inversion of the fuzzy model based on the TSK of order 0. Based
on simulation results, the proposed fuzzy TILC seems able to give a very good
initial guess as to the heater temperature setpoints, making it possible to
have almost no wastage of plastic sheets. Simulation results show the
effectiveness of the fuzzy TILC compared to a crisp TILC, even though the fuzzy
controller is based on a fuzzy model built from noisy data.

 <dc:description>  Despite the rapid progress of the techniques for image classification, video
annotation has remained a challenging task. Automated video annotation would be
a breakthrough technology, enabling users to search within the videos.
Recently, Google introduced the Cloud Video Intelligence API for video
analysis. As per the website, the system can be used to &quot;separate signal from
noise, by retrieving relevant information at the video, shot or per frame&quot;
level. A demonstration website has been also launched, which allows anyone to
select a video for annotation. The API then detects the video labels (objects
within the video) as well as shot labels (description of the video events over
time). In this paper, we examine the usability of the Google's Cloud Video
Intelligence API in adversarial environments. In particular, we investigate
whether an adversary can subtly manipulate a video in such a way that the API
will return only the adversary-desired labels. For this, we select an image,
which is different from the video content, and insert it, periodically and at a
very low rate, into the video. We found that if we insert one image every two
seconds, the API is deceived into annotating the video as if it only contained
the inserted image. Note that the modification to the video is hardly
noticeable as, for instance, for a typical frame rate of 25, we insert only one
image per 50 video frames. We also found that, by inserting one image per
second, all the shot labels returned by the API are related to the inserted
image. We perform the experiments on the sample videos provided by the API
demonstration website and show that our attack is successful with different
videos and images.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we follow our previous research in the area of Computerized
Adaptive Testing (CAT). We present three different methods for CAT. One of
them, the item response theory, is a well established method, while the other
two, Bayesian and neural networks, are new in the area of educational testing.
In the first part of this paper, we present the concept of CAT and its
advantages and disadvantages. We collected data from paper tests performed with
grammar school students. We provide the summary of data used for our
experiments in the second part. Next, we present three different model types
for CAT. They are based on the item response theory, Bayesian networks, and
neural networks. The general theory associated with each type is briefly
explained and the utilization of these models for CAT is analyzed. Future
research is outlined in the concluding part of the paper. It shows many
interesting research paths that are important not only for CAT but also for
other areas of artificial intelligence.

 <dc:description>  Proliferation of advanced metering devices with high sampling rates in
distribution grids, e.g., micro-phasor measurement units ({\mu}PMU), provides
unprecedented potentials for wide-area monitoring and diagnostic applications,
e.g., situational awareness, health monitoring of distribution assets.
Unexpected disruptive events interrupting the normal operation of assets in
distribution grids can eventually lead to permanent failure with expensive
replacement cost over time. Therefore, disruptive event classification provides
useful information for preventive maintenance of the assets in distribution
networks. Preventive maintenance provides wide range of benefits in terms of
time, avoiding unexpected outages, maintenance crew utilization, and equipment
replacement cost. In this paper, a PMU-data-driven framework is proposed for
classification of disruptive events in distribution networks. The two
disruptive events, i.e., malfunctioned capacitor bank switching and
malfunctioned regulator on-load tap changer (OLTC) switching are considered and
distinguished from the normal abrupt load change in distribution grids. The
performance of the proposed framework is verified using the simulation of the
events in the IEEE 13-bus distribution network. The event classification is
formulated using two different algorithms as; i) principle component analysis
(PCA) together with multi-class support vector machine (SVM), and ii)
autoencoder along with softmax classifier. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and satisfactory classification
accuracies.

 <dc:description>  The data mining field is an important source of large-scale applications and
datasets which are getting more and more common. In this paper, we present
grid-based approaches for two basic data mining applications, and a performance
evaluation on an experimental grid environment that provides interesting
monitoring capabilities and configuration tools. We propose a new distributed
clustering approach and a distributed frequent itemsets generation well-adapted
for grid environments. Performance evaluation is done using the Condor system
and its workflow manager DAGMan. We also compare this performance analysis to a
simple analytical model to evaluate the overheads related to the workflow
engine and the underlying grid system. This will specifically show that
realistic performance expectations are currently difficult to achieve on the
grid.

 <dc:description>  Inspired by the boom of the consumer IoT market, many device manufacturers,
start-up companies and technology giants have jumped into the space.
Unfortunately, the exciting utility and rapid marketization of IoT, come at the
expense of privacy and security. Industry reports and academic work have
revealed many attacks on IoT systems, resulting in privacy leakage, property
loss and large-scale availability problems. To mitigate such threats, a few
solutions have been proposed. However, it is still less clear what are the
impacts they can have on the IoT ecosystem. In this work, we aim to perform a
comprehensive study on reported attacks and defenses in the realm of IoT aiming
to find out what we know, where the current studies fall short and how to move
forward. To this end, we first build a toolkit that searches through massive
amount of online data using semantic analysis to identify over 3000 IoT-related
articles. Further, by clustering such collected data using machine learning
technologies, we are able to compare academic views with the findings from
industry and other sources, in an attempt to understand the gaps between them,
the trend of the IoT security risks and new problems that need further
attention. We systemize this process, by proposing a taxonomy for the IoT
ecosystem and organizing IoT security into five problem areas. We use this
taxonomy as a beacon to assess each IoT work across a number of properties we
define. Our assessment reveals that relevant security and privacy problems are
far from solved. We discuss how each proposed solution can be applied to a
problem area and highlight their strengths, assumptions and constraints. We
stress the need for a security framework for IoT vendors and discuss the trend
of shifting security liability to external or centralized entities. We also
identify open research problems and provide suggestions towards a secure IoT
ecosystem.

 <dc:description>  A significant source of errors in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems
is due to pronunciation variations which occur in spontaneous and
conversational speech. Usually ASR systems use a finite lexicon that provides
one or more pronunciations for each word. In this paper, we focus on learning a
similarity function between two pronunciations. The pronunciations can be the
canonical and the surface pronunciations of the same word or they can be two
surface pronunciations of different words. This task generalizes problems such
as lexical access (the problem of learning the mapping between words and their
possible pronunciations), and defining word neighborhoods. It can also be used
to dynamically increase the size of the pronunciation lexicon, or in predicting
ASR errors. We propose two methods, which are based on recurrent neural
networks, to learn the similarity function. The first is based on binary
classification, and the second is based on learning the ranking of the
pronunciations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on the task of
lexical access using a subset of the Switchboard conversational speech corpus.
Results suggest that on this task our methods are superior to previous methods
which are based on graphical Bayesian methods.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, huge amounts of data are naturally collected in distributed sites
due to different facts and moving these data through the network for extracting
useful knowledge is almost unfeasible for either technical reasons or policies.
Furthermore, classical par- allel algorithms cannot be applied, specially in
loosely coupled environments. This requires to develop scalable distributed
algorithms able to return the global knowledge by aggregating local results in
an effective way. In this paper we propose a distributed algorithm based on
independent local clustering processes and a global merging based on minimum
variance increases and requires a limited communication overhead. We also
introduce the notion of distributed sub-clusters perturbation to improve the
global generated distribution. We show that this algorithm improves the quality
of clustering compared to classical local centralized ones and is able to find
real global data nature or distribution.

representations in building the similarity graph to expand a three-dimensional

using four different word representations and similarity metrics. Our

new sentiment assignments with high accuracy. The highest correlations
(tau=0.51) and the lowest error (mean absolute error &lt; 1.1%), obtained by
combining both the semantic and the distributional features, outperformed the
distributional-based and semantic-based label-propagation models and approached
a supervised algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Recently, the integration of geographical coordinates into a picture has
become more and more popular. Indeed almost all smartphones and many cameras
today have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location information in the
Exif header when a picture is taken. Although the automatic embedding of
geotags in pictures is often ignored by smart phone users as it can lead to
endless discussions about privacy implications, these geotags could be really
useful for investigators in analysing criminal activity. Currently, there are
many free tools as well as commercial tools available in the market that can
help computer forensics investigators to cover a wide range of geographic
information related to criminal scenes or activities. However, there are not
specific forensic tools available to deal with the geolocation of pictures
taken by smart phones or cameras. In this paper, we propose and develop an
image scanning and mapping tool for investigators. This tool scans all the
files in a given directory and then displays particular photos based on
optional filters (date, time, device, localisation) on Google Map. The file
scanning process is not based on the file extension but its header. This tool
can also show efficiently to users if there is more than one image on the map
with the same GPS coordinates, or even if there are images with no GPS
coordinates taken by the same device in the same timeline. Moreover, this new
tool is portable; investigators can run it on any operating system without any
installation. Another useful feature is to be able to work in a read-only
environment, so that forensic results will not be modified. We also present and
evaluate this tool real world application in this paper.

 <dc:description>  Background: Over the past few decades, numerous forecasting methods have been
proposed in the field of epidemic forecasting. Such methods can be classified
into different categories such as deterministic vs. probabilistic, comparative
methods vs. generative methods, and so on. In some of the more popular
comparative methods, researchers compare observed epidemiological data from
early stages of an outbreak with the output of proposed models to forecast the
future trend and prevalence of the pandemic. A significant problem in this area
is the lack of standard well-defined evaluation measures to select the best
algorithm among different ones, as well as for selecting the best possible
configuration for a particular algorithm.
  Results: In this paper, we present an evaluation framework which allows for
combining different features, error measures, and ranking schema to evaluate
forecasts. We describe the various epidemic features (Epi-features) included to
characterize the output of forecasting methods and provide suitable error
measures that could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods with
respect to these Epi-features. We focus on long-term predictions rather than
short-term forecasting and demonstrate the utility of the framework by
evaluating six forecasting methods for predicting influenza in the United
States. Our results demonstrate that different error measures lead to different
rankings even for a single Epi-feature. Further, our experimental analyses show
that no single method dominates the rest in predicting all Epi-features, when
evaluated across error measures. As an alternative, we provide various
consensus ranking schema that summarizes individual rankings, thus accounting
for different error measures. We believe that a comprehensive evaluation
framework, as presented in this paper, will add value to the computational
epidemiology community.

 <dc:description>  We tackle a task where an agent learns to navigate in a 2D maze-like
environment called XWORLD. In each session, the agent perceives a sequence of
raw-pixel frames, a natural language command issued by a teacher, and a set of
rewards. The agent learns the teacher's language from scratch in a grounded and
compositional manner, such that after training it is able to correctly execute
zero-shot commands: 1) the combination of words in the command never appeared
before, and/or 2) the command contains new object concepts that are learned
from another task but never learned from navigation. Our deep framework for the
agent is trained end to end: it learns simultaneously the visual
representations of the environment, the syntax and semantics of the language,
and the action module that outputs actions. The zero-shot learning capability
of our framework results from its compositionality and modularity with
parameter tying. We visualize the intermediate outputs of the framework,
demonstrating that the agent truly understands how to solve the problem. We
believe that our results provide some preliminary insights on how to train an
agent with similar abilities in a 3D environment.

 <dc:description>  Previous theoretical work on deep learning and neural network optimization
tend to focus on avoiding saddle points and local minima. However, the
practical observation is that, at least in the case of the most successful Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), practitioners can always increase the
network size to fit the training data (an extreme example would be [1]). The
most successful DCNNs such as VGG and ResNets are best used with a degree of
&quot;overparametrization&quot;. In this work, we characterize with a mix of theory and
experiments, the landscape of the empirical risk of overparametrized DCNNs. We
first prove in the regression framework the existence of a large number of
degenerate global minimizers with zero empirical error (modulo inconsistent
equations). The argument that relies on the use of Bezout theorem is rigorous
when the RELUs are replaced by a polynomial nonlinearity (which empirically
works as well). As described in our Theory III [2] paper, the same minimizers
are degenerate and thus very likely to be found by SGD that will furthermore
select with higher probability the most robust zero-minimizer. We further
experimentally explored and visualized the landscape of empirical risk of a
DCNN on CIFAR-10 during the entire training process and especially the global
minima. Finally, based on our theoretical and experimental results, we propose
an intuitive model of the landscape of DCNN's empirical loss surface, which
might not be as complicated as people commonly believe.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of inverse reinforcement learning in Markov decision
processes where the agent is risk-sensitive. In particular, we model
risk-sensitivity in a reinforcement learning framework by making use of models
of human decision-making having their origins in behavioral psychology,
behavioral economics, and neuroscience. We propose a gradient-based inverse
reinforcement learning algorithm that minimizes a loss function defined on the
observed behavior. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed technique on
two examples, the first of which is the canonical Grid World example and the
second of which is a Markov decision process modeling passengers' decisions
regarding ride-sharing. In the latter, we use pricing and travel time data from
a ride-sharing company to construct the transition probabilities and rewards of
the Markov decision process.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate image classification with computational resource
limits at test time. Two such settings are: 1. anytime classification, where
the network's prediction for a test example is progressively updated,
facilitating the output of a prediction at any time; and 2. budgeted batch
classification, where a fixed amount of computation is available to classify a
set of examples that can be spent unevenly across &quot;easier&quot; and &quot;harder&quot; inputs.
In contrast to most prior work, such as the popular Viola and Jones algorithm,
our approach is based on convolutional neural networks. We train multiple
classifiers with varying resource demands, which we adaptively apply during
test time. To maximally re-use computation between the classifiers, we
incorporate them as early-exits into a single deep convolutional neural network
and inter-connect them with dense connectivity. To facilitate high quality
classification early on, we use a two-dimensional multi-scale network
architecture that maintains coarse and fine level features all-throughout the
network. Experiments on three image-classification tasks demonstrate that our
framework substantially improves the existing state-of-the-art in both
settings.

 <dc:description>  Privacy directly concerns the user as the data owner (data- subject) and
hence privacy in systems should be implemented in a manner which concerns the
user (user-centered). There are many concepts and guidelines that support
development of privacy and embedding privacy into systems. However, none of
them approaches privacy in a user- centered manner. Through this research we
propose a framework that would enable developers and designers to grasp privacy
in a user-centered manner and implement it along with the software development
life cycle.

 <dc:description>  Assume we are given a sum of linear measurements of $s$ different rank-$r$
matrices of the form $y = \sum_{k=1}^{s} \mathcal{A}_k ({X}_k)$. When and under
which conditions is it possible to extract (demix) the individual matrices
${X}_k$ from the single measurement vector ${y}$? And can we do the demixing
numerically efficiently? We present two computationally efficient algorithms
based on hard thresholding to solve this low rank demixing problem. We prove
that under suitable conditions these algorithms are guaranteed to converge to
the correct solution at a linear rate. We discuss applications in connection
with quantum tomography and the Internet-of-Things. Numerical simulations
demonstrate empirically the performance of the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Generation and load balance is required in the economic scheduling of
generating units in the smart grid. Variable energy generations, particularly
from wind and solar energy resources, are witnessing a rapid boost, and, it is
anticipated that with a certain level of their penetration, they can become
noteworthy sources of uncertainty. As in the case of load demand, energy
forecasting can also be used to mitigate some of the challenges that arise from
the uncertainty in the resource. While wind energy forecasting research is
considered mature, solar energy forecasting is witnessing a steadily growing
attention from the research community. This paper presents a support vector
regression model to produce solar power forecasts on a rolling basis for 24
hours ahead over an entire year, to mimic the practical business of energy
forecasting. Twelve weather variables are considered from a high-quality
benchmark dataset and new variables are extracted. The added value of the heat
index and wind speed as additional variables to the model is studied across
different seasons. The support vector regression model performance is compared
with artificial neural networks and multiple linear regression models for
energy forecasting.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new approach to automatically quantify the severity
of knee OA using X-ray images. Automatically quantifying knee OA severity
involves two steps: first, automatically localizing the knee joints; next,
classifying the localized knee joint images. We introduce a new approach to
automatically detect the knee joints using a fully convolutional neural network
(FCN). We train convolutional neural networks (CNN) from scratch to
automatically quantify the knee OA severity optimizing a weighted ratio of two
loss functions: categorical cross-entropy and mean-squared loss. This joint
training further improves the overall quantification of knee OA severity, with
the added benefit of naturally producing simultaneous multi-class
classification and regression outputs. Two public datasets are used to evaluate
our approach, the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and the Multicenter
Osteoarthritis Study (MOST), with extremely promising results that outperform
existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  We motivate and address a human-in-the-loop variant of the monocular
viewpoint estimation task in which the location and class of one semantic
object keypoint is available at test time. In order to leverage the keypoint
information, we devise a Convolutional Neural Network called Click-Here CNN
(CH-CNN) that integrates the keypoint information with activations from the
layers that process the image. It transforms the keypoint information into a 2D
map that can be used to weigh features from certain parts of the image more
heavily. The weighted sum of these spatial features is combined with global
image features to provide relevant information to the prediction layers. To
train our network, we collect a novel dataset of 3D keypoint annotations on
thousands of CAD models, and synthetically render millions of images with 2D
keypoint information. On test instances from PASCAL 3D+, our model achieves a
mean class accuracy of 90.7%, whereas the state-of-the-art baseline only
obtains 85.7% mean class accuracy, justifying our argument for
human-in-the-loop inference.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies improving solvers based on their past solving experiences,
and focuses on improving solvers by offline training. Specifically, the key
issues of offline training methods are discussed, and research belonging to
this category but from different areas are reviewed in a unified framework.
Existing training methods generally adopt a two-stage strategy in which
selecting the training instances and training instances are treated in two
independent phases. This paper proposes a new training method, dubbed LiangYi,
which addresses these two issues simultaneously. LiangYi includes a training
module for a population-based solver and an instance sampling module for
updating the training instances. The idea behind LiangYi is to promote the
population-based solver by training it (with the training module) to improve
its performance on those instances (discovered by the sampling module) on which
it performs badly, while keeping the good performances obtained by it on
previous instances. An instantiation of LiangYi on the Travelling Salesman
Problem is also proposed. Empirical results on a huge testing set containing
10000 instances showed LiangYi could train solvers that perform significantly
better than the solvers trained by other state-of-the-art training method.
Moreover, empirical investigation of the behaviours of LiangYi confirmed it was
able to continuously improve the solver through training.

 <dc:title>Handover Analysis on High Speed Train with Doppler Frequency Spread</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the handover performance on high speed train (HST)
via different speed under three scenarios, which are viaduct environment,
cutting environment and urban area. To provide stable wireless service, we
adopt Long Term Evolution (LTE) for high speed railway (HST) system. Moreover,
we consider the effect of speed on handover procedure. Interchannel
interference (ICI) caused by the Doppler frequency spread is related to the
speed of HST, which is considered into the proposed system to evaluate the
system handover performance including handover starting time and handover
delay. Numerical results show the parameters in the system including SNR,
throughput, handover starting time and handover delay. The proposed system
provides some insights for practical railway system.

 <dc:description>  In approval voting, individuals vote for all platforms that they find
acceptable. In this situation it is natural to ask: When is agreement possible?
What conditions guarantee that some fraction of the voters agree on even a
single platform? Berg et. al. found such conditions when voters are asked to
make a decision on a single issue that can be represented on a linear spectrum.
In particular, they showed that if two out of every three voters agree on a
platform, there is a platform that is acceptable to a majority of the voters.
Hardin developed an analogous result when the issue can be represented on a
circular spectrum. We examine scenarios in which voters must make two decisions
simultaneously. For example, if voters must decide on the day of the week to
hold a meeting and the length of the meeting, then the space of possible
options forms a cylindrical spectrum. Previous results do not apply to these
multi-dimensional voting societies because a voter's preference on one issue
often impacts their preference on another. We present a general lower bound on
agreement in a two-dimensional voting society, and then examine specific
results for societies whose spectra are cylinders and tori.

 <dc:description>  To achieve the expected 1000x data rates under the exponential growth of
traffic demand, a large number of base stations (BS) or access points (AP) will
be deployed in the fifth generation (5G) wireless systems, to support high data
rate services and to provide seamless coverage. Although such BSs are expected
to be small-scale with lower power, the aggregated energy consumption of all
BSs would be remarkable, resulting in increased environmental and economic
concerns. In existing cellular networks, turning off the under-utilized BSs is
an efficient approach to conserve energy while preserving the quality of
service (QoS) of mobile users. However, in 5G systems with new physical layer
techniques and the highly heterogeneous network architecture, new challenges
arise in the design of BS ON-OFF switching strategies. In this article, we
begin with a discussion on the inherent technical challenges of BS ON-OFF
switching. We then provide a comprehensive review of recent advances on
switching mechanisms in different application scenarios. Finally, we present
open research problems and conclude the paper.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate and characterize spatial
variations on dies or wafers. This new technique exploits recent developments
in matrix completion, enabling estimation of spatial variation across wafers or
dies with a small number of randomly picked sampling points while still
achieving fairly high accuracy. This new approach can be easily generalized,
including for estimation of mixed spatial and structure or device type
information.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the robust consensus problem for a set of
discrete-time linear agents to coordinate over an uncertain communication
network, which is to achieve consensus against the transmission errors and
noises resulted from the information exchange between the agents. We model the
network by means of communication links subject to multiplicative stochastic
uncertainties, which are susceptible to describing packet dropout, random
delay, and fading phenomena. Different communication topologies, such as
undirected graphs and leader-follower graphs, are considered. We derive
sufficient conditions for robust consensus in the mean square sense. This
results unveil intrinsic constraints on consensus attainment imposed by the
network synchronizability, the unstable agent dynamics, and the channel
uncertainty variances. Consensus protocols are designed based on the state
information transmitted over the uncertain channels, by solving a modified
algebraic Riccati equation.

 <dc:title>Novel Structured Low-rank algorithm to recover spatially smooth

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a structured low rank matrix completion algorithm to recover a
time series of images consisting of linear combination of exponential
parameters at every pixel, from under-sampled Fourier measurements. The spatial
smoothness of these parameters is exploited along with the exponential
structure of the time series at every pixel, to derive an annihilation relation
in the $k-t$ domain. This annihilation relation translates into a structured
low rank matrix formed from the $k-t$ samples. We demonstrate the algorithm in
the parameter mapping setting and show significant improvement over state of
the art methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a direct coupling coherent quantum observer for a quantum
plant which consists of a two level quantum system. The quantum observer, which
is a quantum harmonic oscillator, includes homodyne detection measurements. It
is shown that the observer can be designed so that it does not affect the
quantum variable of interest in the quantum plant and that measured output
converges in a given sense to the plant variable of interest. Also, the plant
variable of interest-observer system can be described by a set of linear
quantum stochastic differential equations. A minimum variance unbiased
estimator form of the Kalman filter is derived for linear quantum systems and
applied to the direct coupled coherent quantum observer.

 <dc:description>  Let $\mathcal C$ be a category with finite colimits, and let $(\mathcal
E,\mathcal M)$ be a factorisation system on $\mathcal C$ with $\mathcal M$
stable under pushouts. Writing $\mathcal C;\mathcal M^{\mathrm{op}}$ for the
symmetric monoidal category with morphisms cospans of the form $\stackrel{c}\to
\stackrel{m}\leftarrow$, where $c \in \mathcal C$ and $m \in \mathcal M$, we
give method for constructing a category from a symmetric lax monoidal functor
$F\colon (\mathcal C; \mathcal M^{\mathrm{op}},+) \to (\mathrm{Set},\times)$. A
morphism in this category, termed a \emph{decorated corelation}, comprises (i)
a cospan $X \to N \leftarrow Y$ in $\mathcal C$ such that the canonical
copairing $X+Y \to N$ lies in $\mathcal E$, together with (ii) an element of
$FN$. Functors between decorated corelation categories can be constructed from
natural transformations between the decorating functors $F$. This provides a
general method for constructing hypergraph categories---symmetric monoidal
categories in which each object is a special commutative Frobenius monoid in a
coherent way---and their functors. Such categories are useful for modelling
network languages, for example circuit diagrams, and such functors their
semantics.

 <dc:description>  Semantic segmentation requires a detailed labeling of image pixels by object
category. Information derived from local image patches is necessary to describe
the detailed shape of individual objects. However, this information is
ambiguous and can result in noisy labels. Global inference of image content can
instead capture the general semantic concepts present. We advocate that
holistic inference of image concepts provides valuable information for detailed
pixel labeling. We propose a generic framework to leverage holistic information
in the form of a LabelBank for pixel-level segmentation.
  We show the ability of our framework to improve semantic segmentation
performance in a variety of settings. We learn models for extracting a holistic
LabelBank from visual cues, attributes, and/or textual descriptions. We
demonstrate improvements in semantic segmentation accuracy on standard datasets
across a range of state-of-the-art segmentation architectures and holistic
inference approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper surveys the current state of the art in Natural Language
Generation (NLG), defined as the task of generating text or speech from
non-linguistic input. A survey of NLG is timely in view of the changes that the
field has undergone over the past decade or so, especially in relation to new
(usually data-driven) methods, as well as new applications of NLG technology.
This survey therefore aims to (a) give an up-to-date synthesis of research on
the core tasks in NLG and the architectures adopted in which such tasks are
organised; (b) highlight a number of relatively recent research topics that
have arisen partly as a result of growing synergies between NLG and other areas
of artificial intelligence; (c) draw attention to the challenges in NLG
evaluation, relating them to similar challenges faced in other areas of Natural
Language Processing, with an emphasis on different evaluation methods and the
relationships between them.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a modal typing system that enables us to handle
self-referential formulae, including ones with negative self-references, which
on one hand, would introduce a logical contradiction, namely Russell's paradox,
in the conventional setting, while on the other hand, are necessary to capture
a certain class of programs such as fixed-point combinators and objects with
so-called binary methods in object-oriented programming. The proposed system
provides a basis for axiomatic semantics of such a wider range of programs and
a new framework for natural construction of recursive programs in the
proofs-as-programs paradigm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning multi-label
classifiers with the help of privileged information. Specifically, we use
similarity constraints to capture the relationship between available
information and privileged information, and use ranking constraints to capture
the dependencies among multiple labels. By integrating similarity constraints
and ranking constraints into the learning process of classifiers, the
privileged information and the dependencies among multiple labels are exploited
to construct better classifiers during training. A maximum margin classifier is
adopted, and an efficient learning algorithm of the proposed method is also
developed. We evaluate the proposed method on two applications: multiple object
recognition from images with the help of implicit information about object
importance conveyed by the list of manually annotated image tags; and multiple
facial action unit detection from low-resolution images augmented by
high-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method can effectively take full advantage of privileged information and
dependencies among multiple labels for better object recognition and better
facial action unit detection.

 <dc:description>  While deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in
many challenging inverse problems like image inpainting and super-resolution,
they invariably involve problem-specific training of the networks. Under this
approach, different problems require different networks. In scenarios where we
need to solve a wide variety of problems, e.g., on a mobile camera, it is
inefficient and costly to use these specially-trained networks. On the other
hand, traditional methods using signal priors can be used in all linear inverse
problems but often have worse performance on challenging tasks. In this work,
we provide a middle ground between the two kinds of methods --- we propose a
general framework to train a single deep neural network that solves arbitrary
linear inverse problems. The proposed network acts as a proximal operator for
an optimization algorithm and projects non-image signals onto the set of
natural images defined by the decision boundary of a classifier. In our
experiments, the proposed framework demonstrates superior performance over
traditional methods using a wavelet sparsity prior and achieves comparable
performance of specially-trained networks on tasks including compressive
sensing and pixel-wise inpainting.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a method for assessing skill of performance from video,
for a variety of tasks, ranging from drawing to surgery and rolling dough. We
formulate the problem as pairwise and overall ranking of video collections, and
propose a supervised deep ranking model to learn discriminative features
between pairs of videos exhibiting different amounts of skill. We utilise a
two-stream Temporal Segment Network to capture both the type and quality of
motions and the evolving task state. Results demonstrate our method is
applicable to a variety of tasks, with the percentage of correctly ordered
pairs of videos ranging from 70% to 82% for four datasets. We demonstrate the
robustness of our approach via sensitivity analysis of its parameters.
  We see this work as effort toward the automated and objective organisation of
how-to videos and overall, generic skill determination in video.

 <dc:description>  Deep network pruning is an effective method to reduce the storage and
computation cost of deep neural networks when applying them to resource-limited
devices. Among many pruning granularities, neuron level pruning will remove
redundant neurons and filters in the model and result in thinner networks. In
this paper, we propose a gradually global pruning scheme for neuron level
pruning. In each pruning step, a small percent of neurons were selected and
dropped across all layers in the model. We also propose a simple method to
eliminate the biases in evaluating the importance of neurons to make the scheme
feasible. Compared with layer-wise pruning scheme, our scheme avoid the
difficulty in determining the redundancy in each layer and is more effective
for deep networks. Our scheme would automatically find a thinner sub-network in
original network under a given performance.

 <dc:description>  Self-paced learning (SPL) is a new methodology that simulates the learning
principle of humans/animals to start learning easier aspects of a learning
task, and then gradually take more complex examples into training. This
new-coming learning regime has been empirically substantiated to be effective
in various computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Recently, it has been
proved that the SPL regime has a close relationship to a implicit self-paced
objective function. While this implicit objective could provide helpful
interpretations to the effectiveness, especially the robustness, insights under
the SPL paradigms, there are still no theoretical results strictly proved to
verify such relationship. To this issue, in this paper, we provide some
convergence results on this implicit objective of SPL. Specifically, we prove
that the learning process of SPL always converges to critical points of this
implicit objective under some mild conditions. This result verifies the
intrinsic relationship between SPL and this implicit objective, and makes the
previous robustness analysis on SPL complete and theoretically rational.

 <dc:title>Hierarchical Surrogate Modeling for Illumination Algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hagg, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evolutionary illumination is a recent technique that allows producing many
diverse, optimal solutions in a map of manually defined features. To support
the large amount of objective function evaluations, surrogate model assistance
was recently introduced. Illumination models need to represent many more,
diverse optimal regions than classical surrogate models. In this PhD thesis, we
propose to decompose the sample set, decreasing model complexity, by
hierarchically segmenting the training set according to their coordinates in
feature space. An ensemble of diverse models can then be trained to serve as a
surrogate to illumination.

 <dc:description>  Understanding semantic similarity among images is the core of a wide range of
computer vision applications. An important step towards this goal is to collect
and learn human perceptions. Interestingly, the semantic context of images is
often ambiguous as images can be perceived with emphasis on different aspects,
which may be contradictory to each other.
  In this paper, we present a method for learning the semantic similarity among
images, inferring their latent aspects and embedding them into multi-spaces
corresponding to their semantic aspects.
  We consider the multi-embedding problem as an optimization function that
evaluates the embedded distances with respect to the qualitative clustering
queries. The key idea of our approach is to collect and embed qualitative
measures that share the same aspects in bundles. To ensure similarity aspect
sharing among multiple measures, image classification queries are presented to,
and solved by users. The collected image clusters are then converted into
bundles of tuples, which are fed into our bundle optimization algorithm that
jointly infers the aspect similarity and multi-aspect embedding. Extensive
experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-embedding approaches on various datasets, and scales
well for large multi-aspect similarity measures.

 <dc:title>Towards Teleoperation with Human-like Dynamics: Human Use of Elastic

 <dc:description>  Variable stiffness actuators undergo lower peak force in contacts compared to
their rigid counterparts, and are thus safer for human-robot interaction.
Furthermore, they can store energy in their elastic element and can release it
later to achieve human-like dynamic movements. However, it is not clear how to
integrate them in teleoperator systems so that they can be controlled
intuitively by a human.
  We performed an experiment to study human use of elastic tools to determine
how a teleoperator system with an elastic slave would need to be designed. For
this, we had 13 untrained participants hammer with an elastic tool under
different stiffness conditions, asking them to try to find the best timing for
a backward-forward swing motion in order to achieve the strongest impact.
  We found that the participants generally executed the task efficiently after
a few trials and they converged to very similar solutions. The stiffness
influenced the performance slightly, a stiffness between 2.3 Nm/rad and 4.1
Nm/rad showing the best results.
  We conclude that humans intuitively know how to efficiently use elastic tools
for hammering type tasks. This could facilitate the control of teleoperator
systems with elastic slave manipulators for tasks requiring explosive movements
like hammering.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing multivariate time series data is important for many applications
such as automated control, fault diagnosis and anomaly detection. One of the
key challenges is to learn latent features automatically from dynamically
changing multivariate input. In visual recognition tasks, convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have been successful to learn generalized feature extractors
with shared parameters over the spatial domain. However, when high-dimensional
multivariate time series is given, designing an appropriate CNN model structure
becomes challenging because the kernels may need to be extended through the
full dimension of the input volume. To address this issue, we present two
structure learning algorithms for deep CNN models. Our algorithms exploit the
covariance structure over multiple time series to partition input volume into
groups. The first algorithm learns the group CNN structures explicitly by
clustering individual input sequences. The second algorithm learns the group
CNN structures implicitly from the error backpropagation. In experiments with
two real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our group CNNs outperform existing
CNN based regression methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider efficient differentially private empirical risk
minimization from the viewpoint of optimization algorithms. For strongly convex
and smooth objectives, we prove that gradient descent with output perturbation
not only achieves nearly optimal utility, but also significantly improves the
running time of previous state-of-the-art private optimization algorithms, for
both $\epsilon$-DP and $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP. For non-convex but smooth
objectives, we propose an RRPSGD (Random Round Private Stochastic Gradient
Descent) algorithm, which provably converges to a stationary point with privacy
guarantee. Besides the expected utility bounds, we also provide guarantees in
high probability form. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm consistently
outperforms existing method in both utility and running time.

 <dc:description>  The future smart grid is envisioned as a network of interconnected microgrids
(MGs) - small-scale local power networks comprising generators, storage
capacities and loads. MGs bring unprecedented modularity, efficiency,
sustainability, and resilience to the power grid as a whole. Due to the high
share of renewable generation, MGs require innovative concepts for control and
optimization, giving rise to a novel class of smart energy applications, in
which communications represent an integral part. In this paper, we review power
talk, a communication technique specifically developed for direct current MGs,
which exploits the communication potential residing within the MG power
equipment. Depending on the smart energy application, power talk can be used
either as a primary communication enabler, or an auxiliary communication system
that provides resilient and secure operation. The key advantage of power talk
is that it derives its availability, reliability, and security from the very MG
elements, outmatching standard, off-the shelf communication solutions.

 <dc:description>  In a recent paper [1] we introduced the Fuzzy Bayesian Learning (FBL)
paradigm where expert opinions can be encoded in the form of fuzzy rule bases
and the hyper-parameters of the fuzzy sets can be learned from data using a
Bayesian approach. The present paper extends this work for selecting the most
appropriate rule base among a set of competing alternatives, which best
explains the data, by calculating the model evidence or marginal likelihood. We
explain why this is an attractive alternative over simply minimizing a mean
squared error metric of prediction and show the validity of the proposition
using synthetic examples and a real world case study in the financial services
sector.

Slepian and Wolf [1973] regarding distributed source compression. In our task
Alice, Bob, Charlie and Referee share a joint pure state. Alice and Bob wish to
send a part of their respective systems to Charlie without collaborating with
each other. We give achievability bounds for this task in the one-shot setting
and provide asymptotic analysis in the case when there is no side information
with Charlie.
  Our result implies the result of Abeyesinghe, Devetak, Hayden and Winter
[2009] who studied a special case of this problem. As another special case
wherein Bob holds trivial registers, we recover the result of Devetak and Yard
[2008] regarding quantum state redistribution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of how automated situation-awareness
can be achieved by learning real-world situations from ubiquitously generated
mobility data. Without semantic input about the time and space where situations
take place, this turns out to be a fundamental challenging problem.
Uncertainties also introduce technical challenges when data is generated in
irregular time intervals, being mixed with noise, and errors. Purely relying on
temporal patterns observable in mobility data, in this paper, we propose
Spaceprint, a fully automated algorithm for finding the repetitive pattern of
similar situations in spaces. We evaluate this technique by showing how the
latent variables describing the category, and the actual identity of a space
can be discovered from the extracted situation patterns. Doing so, we use
different real-world mobility datasets with data about the presence of mobile
entities in a variety of spaces. We also evaluate the performance of this
technique by showing its robustness against uncertainties.

 <dc:title>Image Restoration using Autoencoding Priors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose to leverage denoising autoencoder networks as priors to address
image restoration problems. We build on the key observation that the output of
an optimal denoising autoencoder is a local mean of the true data density, and
the autoencoder error (the difference between the output and input of the
trained autoencoder) is a mean shift vector. We use the magnitude of this mean
shift vector, that is, the distance to the local mean, as the negative log
likelihood of our natural image prior. For image restoration, we maximize the
likelihood using gradient descent by backpropagating the autoencoder error. A
key advantage of our approach is that we do not need to train separate networks
for different image restoration tasks, such as non-blind deconvolution with
different kernels, or super-resolution at different magnification factors. We
demonstrate state of the art results for non-blind deconvolution and
super-resolution using the same autoencoding prior.

 <dc:description>  With the headway of the advanced image handling software and altering tools,
a computerized picture can be effectively controlled. The identification of
image manipulation is vital in light of the fact that an image can be utilized
as legitimate confirmation, in crime scene investigation, and in numerous
different fields. The image forgery detection techniques intend to confirm the
credibility of computerized pictures with no prior information about the
original image. There are numerous routes for altering a picture, for example,
resampling, splicing, and copy-move. In this paper, we have examined different
type of image forgery and their detection techniques; mainly we focused on
pixel based image forgery detection techniques.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a stochastic model of diffeomorphisms, whose action on a variety
of data types descends to stochastic models of shapes, images and landmarks.
The stochasticity is introduced in the vector field which transports the data
in the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework for
shape analysis and image registration. The stochasticity thereby models errors
or uncertainties of the flow in following the prescribed deformation velocity.
The approach is illustrated in the example of finite dimensional landmark
manifolds, whose stochastic evolution is studied both via the Fokker-Planck
equation and by numerical simulations. We derive two approaches for inferring
parameters of the stochastic model from landmark configurations observed at
discrete time points. The first of the two approaches matches moments of the
Fokker-Planck equation to sample moments of the data, while the second approach
employs an Expectation-Maximisation based algorithm using a Monte Carlo bridge
sampling scheme to optimise the data likelihood. We derive and numerically test
the ability of the two approaches to infer the spatial correlation length of
the underlying noise.

 <dc:description>  The aim of fine-grained recognition is to identify sub-ordinate categories in
images like different species of birds. Existing works have confirmed that, in
order to capture the subtle differences across the categories, automatic
localization of objects and parts is critical. Most approaches for object and
part localization relied on the bottom-up pipeline, where thousands of region
proposals are generated and then filtered by pre-trained object/part models.
This is computationally expensive and not scalable once the number of
objects/parts becomes large. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric
data-driven method for object and part localization. Given an unlabeled test
image, our approach transfers annotations from a few similar images retrieved
in the training set. In particular, we propose an iterative transfer strategy
that gradually refine the predicted bounding boxes. Based on the located
objects and parts, deep convolutional features are extracted for recognition.
We evaluate our approach on the widely-used CUB200-2011 dataset and a new and
large dataset called Birdsnap. On both datasets, we achieve better results than
many state-of-the-art approaches, including a few using oracle (manually
annotated) bounding boxes in the test images.

 <dc:title>Modular, Fully-abstract Compilation by Approximate Back-translation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A compiler is fully-abstract if the compilation from source language programs
to target language programs reflects and preserves behavioural equivalence.
Such compilers have important security benefits, as they limit the power of an
attacker interacting with the program in the target language to that of an
attacker interacting with the program in the source language. Proving compiler
full-abstraction is, however, rather complicated. A common proof technique is
based on the back-translation of target-level program contexts to
behaviourally-equivalent source-level contexts. However, constructing such a
back- translation is problematic when the source language is not strong enough
to embed an encoding of the target language. For instance, when compiling from
STLC to ULC, the lack of recursive types in the former prevents such a
back-translation.
  We propose a general and elegant solution for this problem. The key insight
is that it suffices to construct an approximate back-translation. The
approximation is only accurate up to a certain number of steps and conservative
beyond that, in the sense that the context generated by the back-translation
may diverge when the original would not, but not vice versa. Based on this
insight, we describe a general technique for proving compiler full-abstraction
and demonstrate it on a compiler from STLC to ULC. The proof uses asymmetric
cross-language logical relations and makes innovative use of step-indexing to
express the relation between a context and its approximate back-translation.
The proof extends easily to common compiler patterns such as modular
compilation and it, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first compiler full
abstraction proof to have been fully mechanised in Coq. We believe this proof
technique can scale to challenging settings and enable simpler, more scalable
proofs of compiler full-abstraction.

 <dc:description>  While the radio spectrum allocation is well regulated, there is little
knowledge about its actual utilization over time and space. This limitation
hinders taking effective actions in various applications including cognitive
radios, electrosmog monitoring, and law enforcement. We introduce Electrosense,
an initiative that seeks a more efficient, safe and reliable monitoring of the
electromagnetic space by improving the accessibility of spectrum data for the
general public. A collaborative spectrum monitoring network is designed that
monitors the spectrum at large scale with low-cost spectrum sensing nodes. The
large set of data is stored and processed in a big data architecture and
provided back to the community with an open spectrum data as a service model,
that allows users to build diverse and novel applications with different
requirements. We illustrate useful usage scenarios of the Electrosense data.

 <dc:description>  The human visual system contains a hierarchical sequence of modules that take
part in visual perception at different levels of abstraction, i.e.,
superordinate, basic, and subordinate levels. One important question is to
identify the &quot;entry&quot; level at which the visual representation is commenced in
the process of object recognition. For a long time, it was believed that the
basic level had advantage over two others; a claim that has been challenged
recently. Here we used a series of psychophysics experiments, based on a rapid
presentation paradigm, as well as two computational models, with bandpass
filtered images to study the processing order of the categorization levels. In
these experiments, we investigated the type of visual information required for
categorizing objects in each level by varying the spatial frequency bands of
the input image. The results of our psychophysics experiments and computational
models are consistent. They indicate that the different spatial frequency
information had different effects on object categorization in each level. In
the absence of high frequency information, subordinate and basic level
categorization are performed inaccurately, while superordinate level is
performed well. This means that, low frequency information is sufficient for
superordinate level, but not for the basic and subordinate levels. These finer
levels require high frequency information, which appears to take longer to be
processed, leading to longer reaction times. Finally, to avoid the ceiling
effect, we evaluated the robustness of the results by adding different amounts
of noise to the input images and repeating the experiments. As expected, the
categorization accuracy decreased and the reaction time increased
significantly, but the trends were the same.This shows that our results are not
due to a ceiling effect.

 <dc:description>  Multi-connectivity (MC) is considered to be key for enabling ultra-reliable
low latency communications in 5G. As MC architectures can realize an orthogonal
multiple access channel (MAC) by using different carrier frequencies, the
information can, in the best case, be delivered in a single time slot. The
orthogonal MAC allows for a diversity gain, which can be exploited by different
combining algorithms such as joint decoding (JD), maximum selection combining
(MSC), and maximum ratio combining (MRC). We evaluate the outage probability of
various MC setups and the different combining algorithms. For doing so, we
establish a simple, yet accurate analytical framework where the number of
links, the spectral efficiency, and the signal-to-noise ratios are
incorporated. The main contributions are: 1) We find that JD requires less
transmit power than MRC and MSC to achieve a given outage probability, assuming
equal noise power. Interestingly, we find that JD becomes more advantageous
with an increasing number of links as well as increasing spectral efficiency.
2) We derive the JD diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and show that JD can
achieve both the maximum diversity gain and the maximum multiplexing gain for
the MC setup. By contrast, MSC and MRC can merely achieve the maximum diversity
gain.

 <dc:description>  Extending state-of-the-art object detectors from image to video is
challenging. The accuracy of detection suffers from degenerated object
appearances in videos, e.g., motion blur, video defocus, rare poses, etc.
Existing work attempts to exploit temporal information on box level, but such
methods are not trained end-to-end. We present flow-guided feature aggregation,
an accurate and end-to-end learning framework for video object detection. It
leverages temporal coherence on feature level instead. It improves the
per-frame features by aggregation of nearby features along the motion paths,
and thus improves the video recognition accuracy. Our method significantly
improves upon strong single-frame baselines in ImageNet VID, especially for
more challenging fast moving objects. Our framework is principled, and on par
with the best engineered systems winning the ImageNet VID challenges 2016,
without additional bells-and-whistles. The proposed method, together with Deep
Feature Flow, powered the winning entry of ImageNet VID challenges 2017. The
code is available at

One way is to use abstract machines that pass a token on a fixed graph along a
path indicated by the GoI. These token-passing abstract machines are space
efficient, because they handle duplicated computation by repeating the same
moves of a token on the fixed graph. Although they can be adapted to obtain
sound models with regard to the equational theories of various evaluation
strategies for the lambda calculus, it can be at the expense of significant
time costs. In this paper we show a token-passing abstract machine that can
implement evaluation strategies for the lambda calculus, with certified time
efficiency. Our abstract machine, called the Dynamic GoI Machine (DGoIM),
rewrites the graph to avoid replicating computation, using the token to find
the redexes. The flexibility of interleaving token transitions and graph
rewriting allows the DGoIM to balance the trade-off of space and time costs.
This paper shows that the DGoIM can implement call-by-need evaluation for the
lambda calculus by using a strategy of interleaving token passing with as much
graph rewriting as possible. Our quantitative analysis confirms that the DGoIM
with this strategy of interleaving the two kinds of possible operations on
graphs can be classified as &quot;efficient&quot; following Accattoli's taxonomy of
abstract machines.

 <dc:description>  A compacted tree is a graph created from a binary tree such that repeatedly
occurring subtrees in the original tree are represented by pointers to existing
ones, and hence every subtree is unique. Such representations form a special
class of directed acyclic graphs. We are interested in the asymptotic number of
compacted trees of given size, where the size of a compacted tree is given by
the number of its internal nodes. Due to its superexponential growth this
problem poses many difficulties. Therefore we restrict our investigations to
compacted trees of bounded right height, which is the maximal number of edges
going to the right on any path from the root to a leaf.
  We solve the asymptotic counting problem for this class as well as a closely
related, further simplified class.
  For this purpose, we develop a calculus on exponential generating functions
for compacted trees of bounded right height and for relaxed trees of bounded
right height, which differ from compacted trees by dropping the above described
uniqueness condition. This enables us to derive a recursively defined sequence
of differential equations for the exponential generating functions. The
coefficients can then be determined by performing a singularity analysis of the
solutions of these differential equations.
  Our main results are the computation of the asymptotic numbers of relaxed as
well as compacted trees of bounded right height and given size, when the size
tends to infinity.

 <dc:description>  In deterministic optimization, line searches are a standard tool ensuring
stability and efficiency. Where only stochastic gradients are available, no
direct equivalent has so far been formulated, because uncertain gradients do
not allow for a strict sequence of decisions collapsing the search space. We
construct a probabilistic line search by combining the structure of existing
deterministic methods with notions from Bayesian optimization. Our method
retains a Gaussian process surrogate of the univariate optimization objective,
and uses a probabilistic belief over the Wolfe conditions to monitor the
descent. The algorithm has very low computational cost, and no user-controlled
parameters. Experiments show that it effectively removes the need to define a
learning rate for stochastic gradient descent.

 <dc:description>  In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile
health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide
influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and
portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods
for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no
information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However,
data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online
learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides,
we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and
connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method
for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar
users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned
policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic
RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method
in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective
policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm
start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization
of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised
learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we
propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the
proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related
tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that
in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>A minimal representation for continuous functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brau&#xdf;e, Franz</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Steinberg, Florian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a variation of a celebrated result of Kawamura and Cook
specifying the least set of information about a continuous function on the unit
interval which is needed for fast function evaluation. To make the above
description precise, one has to specify what is considered a &quot;set of
information&quot; about a function and what &quot;fast&quot; means. Kawamura and Cook use
second-order complexity to define what &quot;fast&quot; means but do not use the most
general notion of a &quot;set of information&quot; this framework is able to handle.
Instead they additionally require the codes to be &quot;length-monotone&quot;. This paper
changes the setting in that it removes the additional premise of
length-monotonicity, and instead imposes further conditions the speed of the
evaluation and the translations. The sense in which the evaluation has to be
fast is given the name &quot;hyper-linear&quot;, for the translations another technical
condition is necessary. Hyper-linear time computation is very restrictive: The
running time is not only forbidden to contain iterations of the length
functions, but also the length function is only allowed to be applied to a
shift by a constant of the argument instead of an arbitrary polynomial. The
paper proves that there is a minimal set of information necessary for
hyper-linear evaluation and that the set of information obtained by Kawamura
and Cook is polynomial-time translatable, but not polynomial-time equivalent to
it. Indeed, the encoding constructed in this paper is not polynomial-time
equivalent to any encoding only using length-monotone names.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous drones (also known as unmanned aerial vehicles) are increasingly
popular for diverse applications of light-weight delivery and as substitutions
of manned operations in remote locations. The computing systems for drones are
becoming a new venue for research in cyber-physical systems. Autonomous drones
require integrated intelligent decision systems to control and manage their
flight missions in the absence of human operators. One of the most crucial
aspects of drone mission control and management is related to the optimization
of battery lifetime. Typical drones are powered by on-board batteries, with
limited capacity. But drones are expected to carry out long missions. Thus, a
fully automated management system that can optimize the operations of
battery-operated autonomous drones to extend their operation time is highly
desirable. This paper presents several contributions to automated management
systems for battery-operated drones: (1) We conduct empirical studies to model
the battery performance of drones, considering various flight scenarios. (2) We
study a joint problem of flight mission planning and recharging optimization
for drones with an objective to complete a tour mission for a set of sites of
interest in the shortest time. This problem captures diverse applications of
delivery and remote operations by drones. (3) We present algorithms for solving
the problem of flight mission planning and recharging optimization. We
implemented our algorithms in a drone management system, which supports
real-time flight path tracking and re-computation in dynamic environments. We
evaluated the results of our algorithms using data from empirical studies. (4)
To allow fully autonomous recharging of drones, we also develop a robotic
charging system prototype that can recharge drones autonomously by our drone
management system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper the concept of Parikh-reducing Church-Rosser systems is
studied. It is shown that for two classes of regular languages there exist such
systems which describe the languages using finitely many equivalence classes of
the rewriting system. The two classes are: 1.) the class of all regular
languages such that the syntactic monoid contains only abelian groups and 2.)
the class of all group languages over a two-letter alphabet. The construction
of the systems yield a monoid representation such that all subgroups are
abelian. Additionally, the complexity of those representations is studied.

 <dc:description>  Data-driven brain parcellations aim to provide a more accurate representation
of an individual's functional connectivity, since they are able to capture
individual variability that arises due to development or disease. This renders
comparisons between the emerging brain connectivity networks more challenging,
since correspondences between their elements are not preserved. Unveiling these
correspondences is of major importance to keep track of local functional
connectivity changes. We propose a novel method based on graph edit distance
for the comparison of brain graphs directly in their domain, that can
accurately reflect similarities between individual networks while providing the
network element correspondences. This method is validated on a dataset of 116
twin subjects provided by the Human Connectome Project.

 <dc:description>  In daily communications, Arabs use local dialects which are hard to identify
automatically using conventional classification methods. The dialect
identification challenging task becomes more complicated when dealing with an
under-resourced dialects belonging to a same county/region. In this paper, we
start by analyzing statistically Algerian dialects in order to capture their
specificities related to prosody information which are extracted at utterance
level after a coarse-grained consonant/vowel segmentation. According to these
analysis findings, we propose a Hierarchical classification approach for spoken
Arabic algerian Dialect IDentification (HADID). It takes advantage from the
fact that dialects have an inherent property of naturally structured into
hierarchy. Within HADID, a top-down hierarchical classification is applied, in
which we use Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) method to build a local classifier for
every parent node into the hierarchy dialect structure. Our framework is
implemented and evaluated on Algerian Arabic dialects corpus. Whereas, the
hierarchy dialect structure is deduced from historic and linguistic knowledges.
The results reveal that within {\HD}, the best classifier is DNNs compared to
Support Vector Machine. In addition, compared with a baseline Flat
classification system, our HADID gives an improvement of 63.5% in term of
precision. Furthermore, overall results evidence the suitability of our
prosody-based HADID for speaker independent dialect identification while
requiring less than 6s test utterances.

 <dc:description>  Many artificial intelligence (AI) applications often require multiple
intelligent agents to work in a collaborative effort. Efficient learning for
intra-agent communication and coordination is an indispensable step towards
general AI. In this paper, we take StarCraft combat game as a case study, where
the task is to coordinate multiple agents as a team to defeat their enemies. To
maintain a scalable yet effective communication protocol, we introduce a
Multiagent Bidirectionally-Coordinated Network (BiCNet ['bIknet]) with a
vectorised extension of actor-critic formulation. We show that BiCNet can
handle different types of combats with arbitrary numbers of AI agents for both
sides. Our analysis demonstrates that without any supervisions such as human
demonstrations or labelled data, BiCNet could learn various types of advanced
coordination strategies that have been commonly used by experienced game
players. In our experiments, we evaluate our approach against multiple
baselines under different scenarios; it shows state-of-the-art performance, and
possesses potential values for large-scale real-world applications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Asynchronous decentralized event-triggered control (ADETC) is an
implementation of controllers characterized by decentralized event generation,
asynchronous sampling updates, and dynamic quantization. Combining those
elements in ADETC results in a parsimonious transmission of information which
makes it suitable for wireless networked implementations. We extend the
previous work on ADETC by introducing periodic sampling, denoting our proposal
asynchronous decentralized periodic event-triggered control (ADPETC), and study
the stability and L2-gain of ADPETC for implementations affected by
disturbances. In ADPETC, at each sampling time, quantized measurements from
those sensors that triggered a local event are transmitted to a dynamic
controller that computes control actions; the quantized control actions are
then transmitted to the corresponding actuators only if certain events are also
triggered for the corresponding actuator. The developed theory is demonstrated
and illustrated via a numerical example.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider abnormality detection via diffusive molecular
communications (MCs) for a network consisting of several sensors and a fusion
center (FC). If a sensor detects an abnormality, it injects into the medium a
number of molecules which is proportional to the sensed value. Two transmission
schemes for releasing molecules into the medium are considered. In the first
scheme, referred to as DTM, each sensor releases a different type of molecule,
whereas in the second scheme, referred to as STM, all sensors release the same
type of molecule. The molecules released by the sensors propagate through the
MC channel and some may reach the FC where the final decision regarding whether
or not an abnormality has occurred is made. We derive the optimal decision
rules for both DTM and STM. However, the optimal detectors entail high
computational complexity as log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) have to be computed.
To overcome this issue, we show that the optimal decision rule for STM can be
transformed into an equivalent low-complexity decision rule. Since a similar
transformation is not possible for DTM, we propose simple low-complexity
sub-optimal detectors based on different approximations of the LLR. The
proposed low-complexity detectors are more suitable for practical MC systems
than the original complex optimal decision rule, particularly when the FC is a
nano-machine with limited computational capabilities. Furthermore, we analyze
the performance of the proposed detectors in terms of their false alarm and
missed detection probabilities. Simulation results verify our analytical
derivations and reveal interesting insights regarding the trade-off between
complexity and performance of the proposed detectors and the considered DTM and
STM schemes.

 <dc:description>  Clinical NLP has an immense potential in contributing to how clinical
practice will be revolutionized by the advent of large scale processing of
clinical records. However, this potential has remained largely untapped due to
slow progress primarily caused by strict data access policies for researchers.
In this paper, we discuss the concern for privacy and the measures it entails.
We also suggest sources of less sensitive data. Finally, we draw attention to
biases that can compromise the validity of empirical research and lead to
socially harmful applications.

 <dc:title>On noncommutative extensions of linear logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Slavnov, Sergey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Logic</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the seminal work &quot;Pomset logic: A noncommutative extension of classical
linear logic&quot; Retor\'e introduced Pomset logic, an extension of linear logic
with a self-dual noncommutative connective. Pomset logic is defined by means of
proof-nets, later a deep inference system BV was designed for this extension,
but equivalence of system has not been proven up to now. As for a sequent
calculus formulation, it has not been known for either of these logics, and
there are convincing arguments that such a sequent calculus in the usual sense
simply does not exist for them.
  In an on-going work on semantics we discovered a system similar to Pomset
logic, where a noncommutative connective is no longer self-dual. Pomset logic
appears as a degeneration, when the class of models is restricted. This will be
shown in a forthcoming paper.
  Motivated by these semantic considerations, in the current work we define a
semicommutative multiplicative linear logic, which is multiplicative linear
logic extended with two nonisomorphic noncommutative connectives (not to be
confused with very different Abrusci-Ruet noncommutative logic). We develop a
syntax of proof-nets and show how this logic degenerates to Pomset logic.
  However, a more important problem than just finding yet another
noncommutative logic is finding a sequent calculus for this logic. We introduce
decorated sequents, which are sequents equipped with an extra structure of a
binary relation of reachability on formulas. We define a decorated sequent
calculus for semicommutative logic and prove that it is cut-free, sound and
complete. This is adapted to &quot;degenerate&quot; variations, including Pomset logic.
Thus, in particular, we give a (sort of) sequent calculus formulation for
Pomset logic, which is one of the key results of the paper.

 <dc:description>  The inverse mapping of GANs'(Generative Adversarial Nets) generator has a
great potential value.Hence, some works have been developed to construct the
inverse function of generator by directly learning or adversarial
learning.While the results are encouraging, the problem is highly challenging
and the existing ways of training inverse models of GANs have many
disadvantages, such as hard to train or poor performance.Due to these reasons,
we propose a new approach based on using inverse generator ($IG$) model as
encoder and pre-trained generator ($G$) as decoder of an AutoEncoder network to
train the $IG$ model. In the proposed model, the difference between the input
and output, which are both the generated image of pre-trained GAN's generator,
of AutoEncoder is directly minimized. The optimizing method can overcome the
difficulty in training and inverse model of an non one-to-one function.We also
applied the inverse model of GANs' generators to image searching and
translation.The experimental results prove that the proposed approach works
better than the traditional approaches in image searching.

 <dc:description>  The theory of rational choice assumes that when people make decisions they do
so in order to maximize their utility. In order to achieve this goal they ought
to use all the information available and consider all the choices available to
choose an optimal choice. This paper investigates what happens when decisions
are made by artificially intelligent machines in the market rather than human
beings. Firstly, the expectations of the future are more consistent if they are
made by an artificially intelligent machine and the decisions are more rational
and thus marketplace becomes more rational.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is a cost-effective way for start-up life sciences
laboratories to store and manage their data. However, in many instances the
data stored over the cloud could be redundant which makes cloud-based data
management inefficient and costly because one has to pay for every byte of data
stored over the cloud. Here, we tested efficient management of data generated
by an electron cryo microscopy (cryoEM) lab on a cloud-based environment. The
test data was obtained from cryoEM repository EMPIAR. All the images were
subjected to an in-house parallelized version of principal component analysis.
An efficient cloud-based MapReduce modality was used for parallelization. We
showed that large data in order of terabytes could be efficiently reduced to
its minimal essential self in a cost-effective scalable manner. Furthermore,
on-spot instance on Amazon EC2 was shown to reduce costs by a margin of about
27 percent. This approach could be scaled to data of any large volume and type.

 <dc:description>  We address human action recognition from multi-modal video data involving
articulated pose and RGB frames and propose a two-stream approach. The pose
stream is processed with a convolutional model taking as input a 3D tensor
holding data from a sub-sequence. A specific joint ordering, which respects the
topology of the human body, ensures that different convolutional layers
correspond to meaningful levels of abstraction. The raw RGB stream is handled
by a spatio-temporal soft-attention mechanism conditioned on features from the
pose network. An LSTM network receives input from a set of image locations at
each instant. A trainable glimpse sensor extracts features on a set of
predefined locations specified by the pose stream, namely the 4 hands of the
two people involved in the activity. Appearance features give important cues on
hand motion and on objects held in each hand. We show that it is of high
interest to shift the attention to different hands at different time steps
depending on the activity itself. Finally a temporal attention mechanism learns
how to fuse LSTM features over time. We evaluate the method on 3 datasets.
State-of-the-art results are achieved on the largest dataset for human activity
recognition, namely NTU-RGB+D, as well as on the SBU Kinect Interaction
dataset. Performance close to state-of-the-art is achieved on the smaller MSR
Daily Activity 3D dataset.

 <dc:description>  A growing body of research focuses on computationally detecting controversial
topics and understanding the stances people hold on them. Yet gaps remain in
our theoretical and practical understanding of how to define controversy, how
it manifests, and how to measure it. In this paper, we introduce a novel
measure we call &quot;contention&quot;, defined with respect to a topic and a population.
We model contention from a mathematical standpoint. We validate our model by
examining a diverse set of sources: real-world polling data sets, actual voter
data, and Twitter coverage on several topics. In our publicly-released Twitter
data set of nearly 100M tweets, we examine several topics such as Brexit, the
2016 U.S. Elections, and &quot;The Dress&quot;, and cross-reference them with other
sources. We demonstrate that the contention measure holds explanatory power for
a wide variety of observed phenomena, such as controversies over climate change
and other topics that are well within scientific consensus. Finally, we
re-examine the notion of controversy, and present a theoretical framework that
defines it in terms of population. We present preliminary evidence suggesting
that contention is one dimension of controversy, along with others, such as
&quot;importance&quot;. Our new contention measure, along with the hypothesized model of
controversy, suggest several avenues for future work in this emerging
interdisciplinary research area.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for lossy image compression based on recurrent,
convolutional neural networks that outperforms BPG (4:2:0 ), WebP, JPEG2000,
and JPEG as measured by MS-SSIM. We introduce three improvements over previous
research that lead to this state-of-the-art result. First, we show that
training with a pixel-wise loss weighted by SSIM increases reconstruction
quality according to several metrics. Second, we modify the recurrent
architecture to improve spatial diffusion, which allows the network to more
effectively capture and propagate image information through the network's
hidden state. Finally, in addition to lossless entropy coding, we use a
spatially adaptive bit allocation algorithm to more efficiently use the limited
number of bits to encode visually complex image regions. We evaluate our method
on the Kodak and Tecnick image sets and compare against standard codecs as well
recently published methods based on deep neural networks.

 <dc:title>Approximation of biased Boolean functions of small total influence by

 <dc:description>  The influence of the $k$'th coordinate on a Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n
\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is the probability that flipping $x_k$ changes the value
$f(x)$. The total influence $I(f)$ is the sum of influences of the coordinates.
The well-known `Junta Theorem' of Friedgut (1998) asserts that if $I(f) \leq
M$, then $f$ can be $\epsilon$-approximated by a function that depends on
$O(2^{M/\epsilon})$ coordinates. Friedgut's theorem has a wide variety of
applications in mathematics and theoretical computer science.
  For a biased function with $E[f]=\mu$, the edge isoperimetric inequality on
the cube implies that $I(f) \geq 2\mu \log(1/\mu)$. Kahn and Kalai (2006)
asked, in the spirit of the Junta theorem, whether any $f$ such that $I(f)$ is
within a constant factor of the minimum, can be $\epsilon \mu$-approximated by
a DNF of a `small' size (i.e., a union of a small number of sub-cubes). We
answer the question by proving the following structure theorem: If $I(f) \leq
2\mu(\log(1/\mu)+M)$, then $f$ can be $\epsilon \mu$-approximated by a DNF of
size $2^{2^{O(M/\epsilon)}}$. The dependence on $M$ is sharp up to the constant
factor in the double exponent.

 <dc:description>  As an interdisciplinary discipline, data mining (DM) is popular in education
area especially when examining students' learning performances. It focuses on
analyzing educational related data to develop models for improving learners'
learning experiences and enhancing institutional effectiveness. Therefore, DM
does help education institutions provide high-quality education for its
learners. Applying data mining in education also known as educational data
mining (EDM), which enables to better understand how students learn and
identify how improve educational outcomes. Present paper is designed to justify
the capabilities of data mining approaches in the filed of education. The
latest trends on EDM research are introduced in this review. Several specific
algorithms, methods, applications and gaps in the current literature and future
insights are discussed here.

 <dc:description>  Although implicit methods require extra calculation, they have been largely
used for obtaining numerical approximations of time-dependent differential
conservation equations in the building science domain, thanks to their
stability conditions that enable the use of larger time steps. Nevertheless,
they require important sub-iterations when dealing with highly nonlinear
problems such as the combined heat and moisture transfer through porous
building elements or when the whole-building is simulated and there is
important coupling among the building elements themselves and among
neighbouring zones and HVAC systems. On the other hand, the classical explicit
Euler scheme is generally not used because its stability condition imposes very
fine time discretisation. Hence, this paper explores the use of an improved
explicit approach - the Dufort-Frankel scheme - to overcome the disadvantage of
the classical explicit one and to bring benefits that cannot be obtained by
implicit methods. The Dufort-Frankel approach is first compared to the
classical implicit and explicit Euler schemes to compute the solution of both
linear and nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through porous materials. Then,
the analysis of the Dufort-Frankel unconditionally stable explicit scheme is
extended to the coupled heat and moisture balances on the scale of a one- and a
two-zone building models. The Dufort-Frankel scheme has the benefits of being
unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time O(dt^2) and to compute
explicitly the solution at each time step, avoiding costly sub-iterations. This
approach may reduce the computational cost by twenty as well as it may enable
perfect synchronism for whole-building simulation and co-simulation. In
addition, it can be easier parallelised on high-performance computer systems.

 <dc:description>  Which topics of machine learning are most commonly addressed in research?
This question was initially answered in 2007 by doing a qualitative survey
among distinguished researchers. In our study, we revisit this question from a
quantitative perspective. Concretely, we collect 54K abstracts of papers
published between 2007 and 2016 in leading machine learning journals and
conferences. We then use machine learning in order to determine the top 10
topics in machine learning. We not only include models, but provide a holistic
view across optimization, data, features, etc. This quantitative approach
allows reducing the bias of surveys. It reveals new and up-to-date insights
into what the 10 most prolific topics in machine learning research are. This
allows researchers to identify popular topics as well as new and rising topics
for their research.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for Google Map aided UAV navigation in GPS-denied
environment. Geo-referenced navigation provides drift-free localization and
does not require loop closures. The UAV position is initialized via
correlation, which is simple and efficient. We then use optical flow to predict
its position in subsequent frames. During pose tracking, we obtain inter-frame
translation either by motion field or homography decomposition, and we use HOG
features for registration on Google Map. We employ particle filter to conduct a
coarse to fine search to localize the UAV. Offline test using aerial images
collected by our quadrotor platform shows promising results as our approach
eliminates the drift in dead-reckoning, and the small localization error
indicates the superiority of our approach as a supplement to GPS.

 <dc:description>  We develop differentially private hypothesis testing methods for the small
sample regime. Given a sample $\cal D$ from a categorical distribution $p$ over
some domain $\Sigma$, an explicitly described distribution $q$ over $\Sigma$,
some privacy parameter $\varepsilon$, accuracy parameter $\alpha$, and
requirements $\beta_{\rm I}$ and $\beta_{\rm II}$ for the type I and type II
errors of our test, the goal is to distinguish between $p=q$ and
$d_{\rm{TV}}(p,q) \geq \alpha$.
  We provide theoretical bounds for the sample size $|{\cal D}|$ so that our
method both satisfies $(\varepsilon,0)$-differential privacy, and guarantees
$\beta_{\rm I}$ and $\beta_{\rm II}$ type I and type II errors. We show that
differential privacy may come for free in some regimes of parameters, and we
always beat the sample complexity resulting from running the $\chi^2$-test with
noisy counts, or standard approaches such as repetition for endowing
non-private $\chi^2$-style statistics with differential privacy guarantees. We
experimentally compare the sample complexity of our method to that of recently
proposed methods for private hypothesis testing.

 <dc:title>Unrestricted Facial Geometry Reconstruction Using Image-to-Image
  Translation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It has been recently shown that neural networks can recover the geometric
structure of a face from a single given image. A common denominator of most
existing face geometry reconstruction methods is the restriction of the
solution space to some low-dimensional subspace. While such a model
significantly simplifies the reconstruction problem, it is inherently limited
in its expressiveness. As an alternative, we propose an Image-to-Image
translation network that jointly maps the input image to a depth image and a
facial correspondence map. This explicit pixel-based mapping can then be
utilized to provide high quality reconstructions of diverse faces under extreme
expressions, using a purely geometric refinement process. In the spirit of
recent approaches, the network is trained only with synthetic data, and is then
evaluated on in-the-wild facial images. Both qualitative and quantitative
analyses demonstrate the accuracy and the robustness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  A text-to-speech synthesis system typically consists of multiple stages, such
as a text analysis frontend, an acoustic model and an audio synthesis module.
Building these components often requires extensive domain expertise and may
contain brittle design choices. In this paper, we present Tacotron, an
end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly
from characters. Given &lt;text, audio&gt; pairs, the model can be trained completely
from scratch with random initialization. We present several key techniques to
make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task.
Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English,
outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. In
addition, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it's
substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.

 <dc:description>  The evolution of opinions in a population of individuals who constantly
interact with a common source of user-generated content (i.e. the internet) and
are also subject to propaganda is analyzed using computer simulations. The
model is based on the bounded confidence approach. In the absence of
propaganda, computer simulations show that the online population as a whole is
either fragmented, polarized or in perfect harmony on a certain issue or
ideology depending on the uncertainty of individuals in accepting opinions not
closer to theirs. On applying the model to simulate radicalization, a
proportion of the online population, subject to extremist propaganda radicalize
depending on their pre-conceived opinions and opinion uncertainty. It is found
that an optimal counter propaganda that prevents radicalization is not
necessarily centrist.

using planar manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing. We use this
strategy to develop icosahedron tensegrity structures with programmable

describe a tendon-driven contraction mechanism to actively control the
deformation of the tensegrity mod-ules. Finally, we validate the approach in a

 <dc:description>  The stochastic block model (SBM) is a random graph model with planted
clusters. It is widely employed as a canonical model to study clustering and
community detection, and provides generally a fertile ground to study the
statistical and computational tradeoffs that arise in network and data
sciences.
  This note surveys the recent developments that establish the fundamental
limits for community detection in the SBM, both with respect to
information-theoretic and computational thresholds, and for various recovery
requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery (a.k.a., detection). The
main results discussed are the phase transitions for exact recovery at the
Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase transition for weak recovery at the
Kesten-Stigum threshold, the optimal distortion-SNR tradeoff for partial
recovery, the learning of the SBM parameters and the gap between
information-theoretic and computational thresholds.
  The note also covers some of the algorithms developed in the quest of
achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via graph-splitting,
semi-definite programming, linearized belief propagation, classical and
nonbacktracking spectral methods. A few open problems are also discussed.

 <dc:title>Automatic Argumentative-Zoning Using Word2vec</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Haixia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In comparison with document summarization on the articles from social media
and newswire, argumentative zoning (AZ) is an important task in scientific
paper analysis. Traditional methodology to carry on this task relies on feature
engineering from different levels. In this paper, three models of generating
sentence vectors for the task of sentence classification were explored and
compared. The proposed approach builds sentence representations using learned
embeddings based on neural network. The learned word embeddings formed a
feature space, to which the examined sentence is mapped to. Those features are
input into the classifiers for supervised classification. Using
10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on the
Argumentative-Zoning (AZ) annotated articles. The results showed that simply
averaging the word vectors in a sentence works better than the paragraph to
vector algorithm and by integrating specific cuewords into the loss function of
the neural network can improve the classification performance. In comparison
with the hand-crafted features, the word2vec method won for most of the
categories. However, the hand-crafted features showed their strength on
classifying some of the categories.

 <dc:description>  We present variational generative adversarial networks, a general learning
framework that combines a variational auto-encoder with a generative
adversarial network, for synthesizing images in fine-grained categories, such
as faces of a specific person or objects in a category. Our approach models an
image as a composition of label and latent attributes in a probabilistic model.
By varying the fine-grained category label fed into the resulting generative
model, we can generate images in a specific category with randomly drawn values
on a latent attribute vector. Our approach has two novel aspects. First, we
adopt a cross entropy loss for the discriminative and classifier network, but a
mean discrepancy objective for the generative network. This kind of asymmetric
loss function makes the GAN training more stable. Second, we adopt an encoder
network to learn the relationship between the latent space and the real image
space, and use pairwise feature matching to keep the structure of generated
images. We experiment with natural images of faces, flowers, and birds, and
demonstrate that the proposed models are capable of generating realistic and
diverse samples with fine-grained category labels. We further show that our
models can be applied to other tasks, such as image inpainting,
super-resolution, and data augmentation for training better face recognition

 <dc:description>  In this work, we examine two approaches to interprocedural data-flow analysis
of Sharir and Pnueli in terms of precision: the functional and the call-string
approach. In doing so, not only the theoretical best, but all solutions are
regarded which occur when using abstract interpretation or widening
additionally. It turns out that the solutions of both approaches coincide. This
property is preserved when using abstract interpretation; in the case of
widening, a comparison of the results is not always possible.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the boundary control for flutter suppression of a
flexible wing, both in bending and twisting displacements, under unsteady
aerodynamic loads. The wing is modeled by a distributed parameter system
described as two coupled partial differential equations. The problem is tackled
in the framework of semigroup theory, and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis
is carried out to assess that the system energy, as well as the bending and
twisting displacements, decays exponentially to zero. The effectiveness of the
proposed boundary control scheme is evaluated based on simulations.

 <dc:description>  The focus of this paper is on co-existence between a communication system and
a pulsed radar sharing the same bandwidth. Based on the fact that the
interference generated by the radar onto the communication receiver is
intermittent and depends on the density of scattering objects (such as, e.g.,
targets), we first show that the communication system is equivalent to a set of
independent parallel channels, whereby pre-coding on each channel can be
introduced as a new degree of freedom. We introduce a new figure of merit,
named the {\em compound rate}, which is a convex combination of rates with and
without interference, to be optimized under constraints concerning the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (including {\em signal-dependent}
interference due to clutter) experienced by the radar and obviously the powers
emitted by the two systems: the degrees of freedom are the radar waveform and
the afore-mentioned encoding matrix for the communication symbols. We provide
closed-form solutions for the optimum transmit policies for both systems under
two basic models for the scattering produced by the radar onto the
communication receiver, and account for possible correlation of the
signal-independent fraction of the interference impinging on the radar. We also
discuss the region of the achievable communication rates with and without
interference. A thorough performance assessment shows the potentials and the
limitations of the proposed co-existing architecture.

 <dc:description>  We present a model of pragmatic referring expression interpretation in a
grounded communication task (identifying colors from descriptions) that draws
upon predictions from two recurrent neural network classifiers, a speaker and a
listener, unified by a recursive pragmatic reasoning framework. Experiments
show that this combined pragmatic model interprets color descriptions more
accurately than the classifiers from which it is built, and that much of this
improvement results from combining the speaker and listener perspectives. We
observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the
model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately
express the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of
human utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic
behaviors. We also show that the embedded speaker model reproduces many of
these pragmatic behaviors.

 <dc:title>Logic Locking for Secure Outsourced Chip Fabrication: A New Attack and

 <dc:description>  Chip designers outsource chip fabrication to external foundries, but at the
risk of IP theft. Logic locking, a promising solution to mitigate this threat,
adds extra logic gates (key gates) and inputs (key bits) to the chip so that it
functions correctly only when the correct key, known only to the designer but
not the foundry, is applied. In this paper, we identify a new vulnerability in
all existing logic locking schemes. Prior attacks on logic locking have assumed
that, in addition to the design of the locked chip, the attacker has access to
a working copy of the chip. Our attack does not require a working copy and yet
we successfully recover a significant fraction of key bits from the design of
the locked chip only. Empirically, we demonstrate the success of our attack on
eight large benchmark circuits from a benchmark suite that has been tailored
specifically for logic synthesis research, for two different logic locking
schemes. Then, to address this vulnerability, we initiate the study of provably
secure logic locking mechanisms. We formalize, for the first time to our
knowledge, a precise notion of security for logic locking. We establish that
any locking procedure that is secure under our definition is guaranteed to
counter our desynthesis attack, and all other such known attacks. We then
devise a new logic locking procedure, Meerkat, that guarantees that the locked
chip reveals no information about the key or the designer's intended
functionality. A main insight behind Meerkat is that canonical representations
of boolean functionality via Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs)
can be leveraged effectively to provide security. We analyze Meerkat with
regards to its security properties and the overhead it incurs. As such, our
work is a contribution to both the foundations and practice of securing digital
ICs.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous vehicles rely on precise high definition (HD) 3d maps for
navigation. This paper presents the mapping component of an end-to-end system
for crowdsourcing precise 3d maps with semantically meaningful landmarks such
as traffic signs (6 dof pose, shape and size) and traffic lanes (3d splines).
The system uses consumer grade parts, and in particular, relies on a single
front facing camera and a consumer grade GPS. Using real-time sign and lane
triangulation on-device in the vehicle, with offline sign/lane clustering
across multiple journeys and offline Bundle Adjustment across multiple journeys
in the backend, we construct maps with mean absolute accuracy at sign corners
of less than 20 cm from 25 journeys. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first end-to-end HD mapping pipeline in global coordinates in the automotive
context using cost effective sensors.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm capable of identifying a wide variety of
human-induced change on the surface of the planet by analyzing matches between
local features in time-sequenced remote sensing imagery. We evaluate feature
sets, match protocols, and the statistical modeling of feature matches. With
application of KAZE features, k-nearest-neighbor descriptor matching, and
geometric proximity and bi-directional match consistency checks, average match
rates increase more than two-fold over the previous standard. In testing our
platform, we developed a small, labeled benchmark dataset expressing
large-scale residential, industrial, and civic construction, along with null
instances, in California between the years 2010 and 2012. On the benchmark set,
our algorithm makes precise, accurate change proposals on two-thirds of scenes.
Further, the detection threshold can be tuned so that all or almost all
proposed detections are true positives.

 <dc:description>  Outdoor lighting has extremely high dynamic range. This makes the process of
capturing outdoor environment maps notoriously challenging since special
equipment must be used. In this work, we propose an alternative approach. We
first capture lighting with a regular, LDR omnidirectional camera, and aim to
recover the HDR after the fact via a novel, learning-based inverse tonemapping
method. We propose a deep autoencoder framework which regresses linear, high
dynamic range data from non-linear, saturated, low dynamic range panoramas. We
validate our method through a wide set of experiments on synthetic data, as
well as on a novel dataset of real photographs with ground truth. Our approach
finds applications in a variety of settings, ranging from outdoor light capture
to image matching.

 <dc:description>  Consider an expander graph in which a $\mu$ fraction of the vertices are
marked. A random walk starts at a uniform vertex and at each step continues to
a random neighbor. Gillman showed in 1993 that the number of marked vertices
seen in a random walk of length $n$ is concentrated around its expectation,
$\Phi := \mu n$, independent of the size of the graph. Here we provide a new
and sharp tail bound, improving on the existing bounds whenever $\mu$ is not
too large.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we study the behavior of a full-duplex (FD) and
amplify-and-forward (AF) relay with multiple antennas, where hardware
impairments of the FD relay transceiver is taken into account. Due to the
inter-dependency of the transmit relay power on each antenna and the residual
self-interference in an FD-AF relay, we observe a distortion loop that degrades
the system performance when the relay dynamic range is not high. In this
regard, we analyze the relay function in presence of the hardware inaccuracies
and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the signal to
distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR), under relay and source transmit power
constraints. Due to the problem complexity, we propose a
gradient-projection-based (GP) algorithm to obtain an optimal solution.
Moreover, a nonalternating sub-optimal solution is proposed by assuming a
rank-1 relay amplification matrix, and separating the design of the relay
process into multiple stages (MuStR1). The proposed MuStR1 method is then
enhanced by introducing an alternating update over the optimization variables,
denoted as AltMuStR1 algorithm. It is observed that compared to GP, (Alt)MuStR1
algorithms significantly reduce the required computational complexity at the
expense of a slight performance degradation. Finally, the proposed methods are
evaluated under various system conditions, and compared with the methods
available in the current literature. In particular, it is observed that as the
hardware impairments increase, or for a system with a high transmit power, the
impact of applying a distortion-aware design is significant.

 <dc:description>  We report the application of machine learning to smartphone based
colorimetric detection of pH values. The strip images were used as the training
set for Least Squares-Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier algorithms
that were able to successfully classify the distinct pH values. The difference
in the obtained image formats was found not to significantly affect the
performance of the proposed machine learning approach. Moreover, the influence
of the illumination conditions on the perceived color of pH strips was
investigated and further experiments were carried out to study effect of color
change on the learning model. Test results on JPEG, RAW and RAW-corrected image
formats captured in different lighting conditions lead to perfect
classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, which proves that the
colorimetric detection using machine learning based systems is able to adapt to
various experimental conditions and is a great candidate for smartphone based
sensing in paper-based colorimetric assays.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a distributed control architecture for voltage and
frequency stabilization in AC islanded microgrids. In the primary control
layer, each generation unit is equipped with a local controller acting on the
corresponding voltage-source converter. Following the plug-and-play design
approach previously proposed by some of the authors, whenever the
addition/removal of a distributed generation unit is required, feasibility of
the operation is automatically checked by designing local controllers through
convex optimization. The update of the voltage-control layer, when units plug
-in/-out, is therefore automatized and stability of the microgrid is always
preserved. Moreover, local control design is based only on the knowledge of
parameters of power lines and it does not require to store a global microgrid
model. In this work, we focus on bus-connected microgrid topologies and enhance
the primary plug-and-play layer with local virtual impedance loops and
secondary coordinated controllers ensuring bus voltage tracking and reactive
power sharing. In particular, the secondary control architecture is
distributed, hence mirroring the modularity of the primary control layer. We
validate primary and secondary controllers by performing experiments with
balanced, unbalanced and nonlinear loads, on a setup composed of three
bus-connected distributed generation units. Most importantly, the stability of
the microgrid after the addition/removal of distributed generation units is
assessed. Overall, the experimental results show the feasibility of the
proposed modular control design framework, where generation units can be
added/removed on the fly, thus enabling the deployment of virtual power plants

 <dc:description>  We introduce the concept of numerical Gaussian processes, which we define as
Gaussian processes with covariance functions resulting from temporal
discretization of time-dependent partial differential equations. Numerical
Gaussian processes, by construction, are designed to deal with cases where: (1)
all we observe are noisy data on black-box initial conditions, and (2) we are
interested in quantifying the uncertainty associated with such noisy data in
our solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations. Our method
circumvents the need for spatial discretization of the differential operators
by proper placement of Gaussian process priors. This is an attempt to construct
structured and data-efficient learning machines, which are explicitly informed
by the underlying physics that possibly generated the observed data. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through several
benchmark problems involving linear and nonlinear time-dependent operators. In
all examples, we are able to recover accurate approximations of the latent
solutions, and consistently propagate uncertainty, even in cases involving very
long time integration.

 <dc:description>  Objects often occlude each other in scenes; Inferring their appearance beyond
their visible parts plays an important role in scene understanding, depth
estimation, object interaction and manipulation. In this paper, we study the
challenging problem of completing the appearance of occluded objects. Doing so
requires knowing which pixels to paint (segmenting the invisible parts of
objects) and what color to paint them (generating the invisible parts). Our
proposed novel solution, SeGAN, jointly optimizes for both segmentation and
generation of the invisible parts of objects. Our experimental results show
that: (a) SeGAN can learn to generate the appearance of the occluded parts of
objects; (b) SeGAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation baselines for the
invisible parts of objects; (c) trained on synthetic photo realistic images,
SeGAN can reliably segment natural images; (d) by reasoning about occluder
occludee relations, our method can infer depth layering.

 <dc:description>  A novel approach is presented to teach the parallel and distributed computing
concepts of synchronization and remote memory access. The single program
multiple data (SPMD) partitioned global address space (PGAS) model presented in
this paper uses a procedural programming language appealing to undergraduate
students. We propose that the amusing nature of the approach may engender
creativity and interest using these concepts later in more sober environments.
Specifically, we implement parallel extensions to LOLCODE within a
source-to-source compiler sufficient for the development of parallel and
distributed algorithms normally implemented using conventional high-performance
computing languages and APIs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a general diagrammatic theory of digital circuits, based on
connections between monoidal categories and graph rewriting. The main
achievement of the paper is conceptual, filling a foundational gap in reasoning
syntactically and symbolically about a large class of digital circuits
(discrete values, discrete delays, feedback). This complements the dominant
approach to circuit modelling, which relies on simulation. The main advantage
of our symbolic approach is the enabling of automated reasoning about abstract
circuits, with a potentially interesting new application to partial evaluation
of digital circuits. Relative to the recent interest and activity in
categorical and diagrammatic methods, our work makes several new contributions.
The most important is establishing that categories of digital circuits are
Cartesian and admit, in the presence of feedback expressive iteration axioms.
The second is producing a general yet simple graph-rewrite framework for
reasoning about such categories in which the rewrite rules are computationally
efficient, opening the way for practical applications.

 <dc:description>  In one perspective, the central problem pursued in this research is that of
the inverse problem in the context of general rough sets. The problem is about
the existence of rough basis for given approximations in a context. Granular
operator spaces were recently introduced by the present author as an optimal
framework for anti-chain based algebraic semantics of general rough sets and
the inverse problem. In the framework, various subtypes of crisp and non crisp
objects are identifiable that may be missed in more restrictive formalism. This
is also because in the latter cases the concept of complementation and negation
are taken for granted. This opens the door for a general approach to
dialectical rough sets building on previous work of the present author and
figures of opposition. In this paper dialectical rough logics are developed
from a semantic perspective, concept of dialectical predicates is formalized,
connection with dialethias and glutty negation established, parthood analyzed
and studied from the point of view of classical and dialectical figures of
opposition. Potential semantics through dialectical counting based on these
figures are proposed building on earlier work by the present author. Her
methods become more geometrical and encompass parthood as a primary relation
(as opposed to roughly equivalent objects) for algebraic semantics. Dialectical
counting strategies over anti chains (a specific form of dialectical structure)
for semantics are also proposed.

 <dc:description>  Recent research in computational linguistics has developed algorithms which
associate matrices with adjectives and verbs, based on the distribution of
words in a corpus of text. These matrices are linear operators on a vector
space of context words. They are used to construct the meaning of composite
expressions from that of the elementary constituents, forming part of a
compositional distributional approach to semantics. We propose a Matrix Theory
approach to this data, based on permutation symmetry along with Gaussian
weights and their perturbations. A simple Gaussian model is tested against word
matrices created from a large corpus of text. We characterize the cubic and
quartic departures from the model, which we propose, alongside the Gaussian
parameters, as signatures for comparison of linguistic corpora. We propose that
perturbed Gaussian models with permutation symmetry provide a promising
framework for characterizing the nature of universality in the statistical
properties of word matrices. The matrix theory framework developed here
exploits the view of statistics as zero dimensional perturbative quantum field
theory. It perceives language as a physical system realizing a universality
class of matrix statistics characterized by permutation symmetry.

 <dc:description>  This article presents the inverse of the kernel operator associated with the
complete quadratic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional for coupled
differential-functional equations when the kernel operator is separable.
Similar to the case of time-delay systems of retarded type, the inverse
operator is instrumental in control synthesis. Unlike the power series
expansion approach used in the previous literature, a direct algebraic method
is used here. It is shown that the domain of definition of the infinitesimal
generator is an invariant subspace of the inverse operator if it is an
invariant subspace of the kernel operator. The process of control synthesis
using the inverse operator is described, and a numerical example is presented
using the sum-of-square formulation.

 <dc:title>Bandit-Based Model Selection for Deformable Object Manipulation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel approach to deformable object manipulation that does not
rely on highly-accurate modeling. The key contribution of this paper is to
formulate the task as a Multi-Armed Bandit problem, with each arm representing
a model of the deformable object. To &quot;pull&quot; an arm and evaluate its utility, we
use the arm's model to generate a velocity command for the gripper(s) holding
the object and execute it. As the task proceeds and the object deforms, the
utility of each model can change. Our framework estimates these changes and
balances exploration of the model set with exploitation of high-utility models.
We also propose an approach based on Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary
Multi-armed Normal Bandits (KF-MANB) to leverage the coupling between models to
learn more from each arm pull. We demonstrate that our method outperforms
previous methods on synthetic trials, and performs competitively on several
manipulation tasks in simulation.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first in a series of results that allow us to develop
a theory providing finer control over the complexity of normalisation, and in
particular of cut elimination. By considering atoms as self-dual
non-commutative connectives, we are able to classify a vast class of inference
rules in a uniform and very simple way. This allows us to define simple
conditions that are easily verifiable and that ensure normalisation and cut
elimination by way of a general theorem. In this paper we define and consider
splittable systems, which essentially comprise a large class of linear logics,
including MLL and BV, and we prove for them a splitting theorem, guaranteeing
cut elimination and other admissibility results as corollaries. In papers to
follow, we will extend this result to non-linear logics. The final outcome will
be a comprehensive theory giving a uniform treatment for most existing logics
and providing a blueprint for the design of future proof systems.

 <dc:title>Planning and Resilient Execution of Policies For Manipulation in Contact

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a method for planning motion for robots with actuation uncertainty
that incorporates contact with the environment and the compliance of the robot
to reliably perform manipulation tasks. Our approach consists of two stages:
(1) Generating partial policies using a sampling-based motion planner that uses
particle-based models of uncertainty and simulation of contact and compliance;
and (2) Resilient execution that updates the planned policies to account for
unexpected behavior in execution which may arise from model or environment
inaccuracy. We have tested our planner and policy execution in simulated SE(2)
and SE(3) environments and Baxter robot. We show that our methods efficiently
generate policies to perform manipulation tasks involving significant contact
and compare against several simpler methods. Additionally, we show that our
policy adaptation is resilient to significant changes during execution; e.g.
adding a new obstacle to the environment.

 <dc:description>  A new method for the optimal solutions is proposed. Originating from the
continuous-time dynamics stability theory in the control field, the optimal
solution is anticipated to be obtained in an asymptotically evolving way. By
introducing a virtual dimension, the variation time, a dynamic system that
describes the variation motion is deduced from the Optimal Control Problem
(OCP), and the optimal solution is its equilibrium point. Through this method,
the intractable OCP is transformed to the Initial-value Problem (IVP) and it
may be solved with mature Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) numerical
integration methods. Especially, the deduced dynamic system is globally stable,
so any initial value will evolve to the extremal solution ultimately.

 <dc:description>  Existing data analytics frameworks are intrinsically compute-centric in
nature. Their computation structure is complex and determined early, and they
take decisions that bind early to this structure. This impacts expressiveness,
job performance, and cluster efficiency.
  We present F2, a new analytics framework that separates computation from data
management, making the latter an equal first-class entity. We argue that this
separation enables more flexibility in expressing analytics jobs and enables
data driven optimizations. Furthermore, it enables a new kind of &quot;tasks&quot; with
loose semantics that can multiplex their execution across different sets of

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a comparative study was conducted between complex networks
representing origin and destination survey data. Similarities were found
between the characteristics of the networks of Brazilian cities with networks
of foreign cities. Power laws were found in the distributions of edge weights
and this scale - free behavior can occur due to the economic characteristics of
the cities.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new method for semantic instance segmentation, by first
computing how likely two pixels are to belong to the same object, and then by
grouping similar pixels together. Our similarity metric is based on a deep,
fully convolutional embedding model. Our grouping method is based on selecting
all points that are sufficiently similar to a set of &quot;seed points&quot;, chosen from
a deep, fully convolutional scoring model. We show competitive results on the
Pascal VOC instance segmentation benchmark.

 <dc:description>  As affordability pressures and tight rental markets in global cities mount,
online shared accommodation sites proliferate. Home sharing arrangements
present dilemmas for planning that aims to improve health and safety standards,
while supporting positives such as the usage of dormant stock and the relieving
of rental pressures on middle/lower income earners. Currently, no formal data
exists on this internationally growing trend. Here, we present a first
quantitative glance on shared accommodation practices across all major urban
centers of Australia enabled via collection and analysis of thousands of online
listings. We examine, countrywide, the spatial and short time scale temporal
characteristics of this market, along with preliminary analysis on rents,
dwelling types and other characteristics. Findings have implications for
housing policy makers and planning practitioners seeking to monitor and respond
to housing policy and affordability pressures in formal and informal housing
markets.

algebraic Riccati equations in testing whether a system is negative imaginary
and in synthesizing state feedback controllers which make the closed loop

 <dc:description>  Robots and autonomous systems that operate around humans will likely always
rely on kill switches that stop their execution and allow them to be
remote-controlled for the safety of humans or to prevent damage to the system.
It is theoretically possible for an autonomous system with sufficient sensor
and effector capability and using reinforcement learning to learn that the kill
switch deprives it of long-term reward and learn to act to disable the switch
or otherwise prevent a human operator from using the switch. This is referred
to as the big red button problem. We present a technique which prevents a
reinforcement learning agent from learning to disable the big red button. Our
technique interrupts the agent or robot by placing it in a virtual simulation
where it continues to receive reward. We illustrate our technique in a simple
grid world environment.

 <dc:description>  Preservers and additive spanners are sparse (hence cheap to store) subgraphs
that preserve the distances between given pairs of nodes exactly or with some
small additive error, respectively. Since real-world networks are prone to
failures, it makes sense to study fault-tolerant versions of the above
structures. This turns out to be a surprisingly difficult task. For every small
but arbitrary set of edge or vertex failures, the preservers and spanners need
to contain {\em replacement paths} around the faulted set. In this paper we
make substantial progress on fault tolerant preservers and additive spanners:
  (1) We present the first truly sub-quadratic size single-pair preservers in
unweighted (possibly directed) graphs for \emph{any} fixed number $f$ of
faults. Our result indeed generalizes to the single-source case, and can be
used to build new fault-tolerant additive spanners (for all pairs).
  (2) The size of the above single-pair preservers is $O(n^{2-g(f)})$ for some
positive function $g$, and grows to $O(n^2)$ for increasing $f$. We show that
this is necessary even in undirected unweighted graphs, and even if you allow
for a small additive error: If you aim at size $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ for
$\epsilon&gt;0$, then the additive error has to be $\Omega(\eps f)$. This
surprisingly matches known upper bounds in the literature.
  (3) For weighted graphs, we provide matching upper and lower bounds for the
single pair case. Namely, the size of the preserver is $\Theta(n^2)$ for $f\geq
2$ in both directed and undirected graphs, while for $f=1$ the size is
$\Theta(n)$ in undirected graphs. For directed graphs, we have a superlinear
upper bound and a matching lower bound.
  Most of our lower bounds extend to the distance oracle setting, where rather
than a subgraph we ask for any compact data structure.

 <dc:title>DeNet: Scalable Real-time Object Detection with Directed Sparse Sampling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tychsen-Smith, Lachlan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We define the object detection from imagery problem as estimating a very
large but extremely sparse bounding box dependent probability distribution.
Subsequently we identify a sparse distribution estimation scheme, Directed
Sparse Sampling, and employ it in a single end-to-end CNN based detection
model. This methodology extends and formalizes previous state-of-the-art
detection models with an additional emphasis on high evaluation rates and
reduced manual engineering. We introduce two novelties, a corner based
region-of-interest estimator and a deconvolution based CNN model. The resulting
model is scene adaptive, does not require manually defined reference bounding
boxes and produces highly competitive results on MSCOCO, Pascal VOC 2007 and
Pascal VOC 2012 with real-time evaluation rates. Further analysis suggests our
model performs particularly well when finegrained object localization is
desirable. We argue that this advantage stems from the significantly larger set
of available regions-of-interest relative to other methods. Source-code is

 <dc:title>Study on 3GPP Rural Macrocell Path Loss Models for Millimeter Wave
  Wireless Communications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>MacCartney Jr., George R.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Little research has been done to reliably model millimeter wave (mmWave) path
loss in rural macrocell settings, yet, models have been hastily adopted without
substantial empirical evidence. This paper studies past rural macrocell (RMa)
path loss models and exposes concerns with the current 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.900 (Release 14) RMa path loss models adopted
from the International Telecommunications Union - Radiocommunications (ITU-R)
Sector. This paper shows how the 3GPP RMa large-scale path loss models were
derived for frequencies below 6 GHz, yet they are being asserted for use up to
30 GHz, even though there has not been sufficient work or published data to
support their validity at frequencies above 6 GHz or in the mmWave bands. We
present the background of the 3GPP RMa path loss models and their use of odd
correction factors not suitable for rural scenarios, and show that the
multi-frequency close-in free space reference distance (CI) path loss model is
more accurate and reliable than current 3GPP and ITU-R RMa models. Using field
data and simulations, we introduce a new close-in free space reference distance
with height dependent path loss exponent model (CIH), that predicts rural
macrocell path loss using an effective path loss exponent that is a function of
base station antenna height. This work shows the CI and CIH models can be used
from 500 MHz to 100 GHz for rural mmWave coverage and interference analysis,
without any discontinuity at 6 GHz as exists in today's 3GPP and ITU-R RMa
models.

 <dc:description>  Reconstruction based on the stereo camera has received considerable attention
recently, but two particular challenges still remain. The first concerns the
need to aggregate similar pixels in an effective approach, and the second is to
maintain as much of the available information as possible while ensuring
sufficient accuracy. To overcome these issues, we propose a new 3D
representation method, namely, planecell, that extracts planarity from the
depth-assisted image segmentation and then projects these depth planes into the
3D world. An energy function formulated from Conditional Random Field that
generalizes the planar relationships is maximized to merge coplanar segments.
We evaluate our method with a variety of reconstruction baselines on both KITTI
and Middlebury datasets, and the results indicate the superiorities compared to
other 3D space representation methods in accuracy, memory requirements and
further applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay system
with an energy harvesting relay node. All nodes are equipped with multiple
antennas, and the relay node depends on the harvested energy from the received
signal to support information forwarding. In particular, the relay node deploys
power splitting based energy harvesting scheme. The capacity maximization
problem subject to power constraints at both the source and relay nodes is
considered for both fixed source covariance matrix and optimal source
covariance matrix cases. Instead of using existing software solvers, iterative
approaches using dual decomposition technique are developed based on the
structures of the optimal relay precoding and source covariance matrices.
Simulation results demonstrate the performance gain of the joint optimization
against the fixed source covariance matrix case.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge graph embedding aims to embed entities and relations of knowledge
graphs into low-dimensional vector spaces. Translating embedding methods regard
relations as the translation from head entities to tail entities, which achieve
the state-of-the-art results among knowledge graph embedding methods. However,
a major limitation of these methods is the time consuming training process,
which may take several days or even weeks for large knowledge graphs, and
result in great difficulty in practical applications. In this paper, we propose
an efficient parallel framework for translating embedding methods, called
ParTrans-X, which enables the methods to be paralleled without locks by
utilizing the distinguished structures of knowledge graphs. Experiments on two
datasets with three typical translating embedding methods, i.e., TransE [3],
TransH [17], and a more efficient variant TransE- AdaGrad [10] validate that
ParTrans-X can speed up the training process by more than an order of
magnitude.

 <dc:description>  Small-scale clouds (SCs) often suffer from resource under-provisioning during
peak demand, leading to inability to satisfy service level agreements (SLAs)
and consequent loss of customers. One approach to address this problem is for a
set of autonomous SCs to share resources among themselves in a cost-induced
cooperative fashion, thereby increasing their individual capacities (when
needed) without having to significantly invest in more resources. A central
problem (in this context) is how to properly share resources (for a price) to
achieve profitable service while maintaining customer SLAs. To address this
problem, in this paper, we propose the SC-Share framework that utilizes two
interacting models: (i) a stochastic performance model that estimates the
achieved performance characteristics under given SLA requirements, and (ii) a
market-based game-theoretic model that (as shown empirically) converges to
efficient resource sharing decisions at market equilibrium. Our results include
extensive evaluations that illustrate the utility of the proposed framework.

 <dc:title>Randomness extraction via a quantum generalization of the conditional

 <dc:description>  Randomness extraction against side information is the art of distilling from
a given source a key which is almost uniform conditioned on the side
information. This paper provides randomness extraction against quantum side
information whose extractable key length is given by a quantum generalization
of the conditional collision entropy defined without the conventional
smoothing. Based on the fact that the collision entropy is not subadditive, the
quantum conditional collision entropy maximized with respect to additional side
information is introduced, and is shown to be asymptotically optimal. The lower
bound on it derived there ensures faster convergence to the conditional von
Neumann entropy than that on the smooth min-entropy.

 <dc:description>  With the advancement of technology in the last few decades, leading to the
widespread availability of miniaturized sensors and internet-connected things
(IoT), security of electronic devices has become a top priority. Side-channel
attack (SCA) is one of the prominent methods to break the security of an
encryption system by exploiting the information leaked from the physical
devices. Correlational power attack (CPA) is an efficient power side-channel
attack technique, which analyses the correlation between the estimated and
measured supply current traces to extract the secret key. The existing
countermeasures to the power attacks are mainly based on reducing the SNR of
the leaked data, or introducing large overhead using techniques like power
balancing. This paper presents an attenuated signature AES (AS-AES), which
resists SCA with minimal noise current overhead. AS-AES uses a shunt
low-drop-out (LDO) regulator to suppress the AES current signature by 400x in
the supply current traces. The shunt LDO has been fabricated and validated in
130 nm CMOS technology. System-level implementation of the AS-AES along with
noise injection, shows that the system remains secure even after 50K
encryptions, with 10x reduction in power overhead compared to that of noise
addition alone.

 <dc:description>  Next generation of wireless networks will likely rely on large-scale antenna
systems, either in the form of massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) or
millimeter wave (mmWave) systems. Therefore, the conventional fully-digital
precoders are not suitable for physical layer multicasting as they require a
dedicated radio frequency chain per antenna element. In this paper, we show
that in a multi-group multicasting system with an arbitrary number of transmit
antennas, $G$ multicasting groups, and an arbitrary number of users in each
group, one can achieve the performance of any fully-digital precoder with just
$G$ radio frequency chains using the proposed hybrid multi-group multicasting
structure.

 <dc:title>Static Contract Simplification</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Contracts and contract monitoring are a powerful mechanism for specifying
properties and guaranteeing them at run time. However, run time monitoring of
contracts imposes a significant overhead. The execution time is impacted by the
insertion of contract checks as well as by the introduction of proxy objects
that perform delayed contract checks on demand.
  Static contract simplification attacks this issue using program
transformation. It applies compile-time transformations to programs with
contracts to reduce the overall run time while preserving the original
behavior. Our key technique is to statically propagate contracts through the
program and to evaluate and merge contracts where possible. The goal is to
obtain residual contracts that are collectively cheaper to check at run time.
We distinguish different levels of preservation of behavior, which impose
different limitations on the admissible transformations: Strong blame
preservation, where the transformation is a behavioral equivalence, and weak
blame preservation, where the transformed program is equivalent up to the
particular violation reported. Our transformations never increase the overall
number of contract checks.

 <dc:description>  We propose a dynamic computational time model to accelerate the average
processing time for recurrent visual attention (RAM). Rather than attention
with a fixed number of steps for each input image, the model learns to decide
when to stop on the fly. To achieve this, we add an additional continue/stop
action per time step to RAM and use reinforcement learning to learn both the
optimal attention policy and stopping policy. The modification is simple but
could dramatically save the average computational time while keeping the same
recognition performance as RAM. Experimental results on CUB-200-2011 and
Stanford Cars dataset demonstrate the dynamic computational model can work
effectively for fine-grained image recognition.The source code of this paper

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an online adaptation algorithm for bipedal walking on uneven
surfaces with height uncertainty is proposed. In order to generate walking
patterns on flat terrains, the trajectories in the task space are planned to
satisfy the dynamic balance and slippage avoidance constraints, and also to
guarantee smooth landing of the swing foot. To ensure smooth landing of the
swing foot on surfaces with height uncertainty, the preplanned trajectories in
the task space should be adapted. The proposed adaptation algorithm consists of
two stages. In the first stage, once the swing foot reaches its maximum height,
the supervisory control is initiated until the touch is detected. After the
detection, the trajectories in the task space are modified to guarantee smooth
landing. In the second stage, this modification is preserved during the Double
Support Phase (DSP), and released in the next Single Support Phase (SSP).
Effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation algorithm is experimentally
verified through realization of the walking patterns on the SURENA III humanoid
robot, designed and fabricated at CAST. The walking is tested on a surface with
various flat obstacles, where the swing foot is prone to either land on the
ground soon or late.

 <dc:description>  An important editing policy in Wikipedia is to provide citations for added
statements in Wikipedia pages, where statements can be arbitrary pieces of
text, ranging from a sentence to a paragraph. In many cases citations are
either outdated or missing altogether.
  In this work we address the problem of finding and updating news citations
for statements in entity pages. We propose a two-stage supervised approach for
this problem. In the first step, we construct a classifier to find out whether
statements need a news citation or other kinds of citations (web, book,
journal, etc.). In the second step, we develop a news citation algorithm for
Wikipedia statements, which recommends appropriate citations from a given news
collection. Apart from IR techniques that use the statement to query the news
collection, we also formalize three properties of an appropriate citation,
namely: (i) the citation should entail the Wikipedia statement, (ii) the
statement should be central to the citation, and (iii) the citation should be
from an authoritative source.
  We perform an extensive evaluation of both steps, using 20 million articles
from a real-world news collection. Our results are quite promising, and show
that we can perform this task with high precision and at scale.

 <dc:description>  In this article we propose a novel Device-to-Device (D2D) Crowd framework for
5G mobile edge computing, where a massive crowd of devices at the network edge
leverage the network-assisted D2D collaboration for computation and
communication resource sharing among each other. A key objective of this
framework is to achieve energy-efficient collaborative task executions at
network-edge for mobile users. Specifically, we first introduce the D2D Crowd
system model in details, and then formulate the energy-efficient D2D Crowd task
assignment problem by taking into account the necessary constraints. We next
propose a graph matching based optimal task assignment policy, and further
evaluate its performance through extensive numerical study, which shows a
superior performance of more than 50% energy consumption reduction over the
case of local task executions. Finally, we also discuss the directions of
extending the D2D Crowd framework by taking into variety of application
factors.

 <dc:description>  The optimization of algorithm (hyper-)parameters is crucial for achieving
peak performance across a wide range of domains, ranging from deep neural
networks to solvers for hard combinatorial problems. The resulting algorithm
configuration (AC) problem has attracted much attention from the machine
learning community. However, the proper evaluation of new AC procedures is
hindered by two key hurdles. First, AC benchmarks are hard to set up. Second
and even more significantly, they are computationally expensive: a single run
of an AC procedure involves many costly runs of the target algorithm whose
performance is to be optimized in a given AC benchmark scenario. One common
workaround is to optimize cheap-to-evaluate artificial benchmark functions
(e.g., Branin) instead of actual algorithms; however, these have different
properties than realistic AC problems. Here, we propose an alternative
benchmarking approach that is similarly cheap to evaluate but much closer to
the original AC problem: replacing expensive benchmarks by surrogate benchmarks
constructed from AC benchmarks. These surrogate benchmarks approximate the
response surface corresponding to true target algorithm performance using a
regression model, and the original and surrogate benchmark share the same
(hyper-)parameter space. In our experiments, we construct and evaluate
surrogate benchmarks for hyperparameter optimization as well as for AC problems
that involve performance optimization of solvers for hard combinatorial
problems, drawing training data from the runs of existing AC procedures. We
show that our surrogate benchmarks capture overall important characteristics of
the AC scenarios, such as high- and low-performing regions, from which they
were derived, while being much easier to use and orders of magnitude cheaper to
evaluate.

 <dc:description>  Wikipedia entity pages are a valuable source of information for direct
consumption and for knowledge-base construction, update and maintenance. Facts
in these entity pages are typically supported by references. Recent studies
show that as much as 20\% of the references are from online news sources.
However, many entity pages are incomplete even if relevant information is
already available in existing news articles. Even for the already present
references, there is often a delay between the news article publication time
and the reference time. In this work, we therefore look at Wikipedia through
the lens of news and propose a novel news-article suggestion task to improve
news coverage in Wikipedia, and reduce the lag of newsworthy references. Our
work finds direct application, as a precursor, to Wikipedia page generation and
knowledge-base acceleration tasks that rely on relevant and high quality input
sources.
  We propose a two-stage supervised approach for suggesting news articles to
entity pages for a given state of Wikipedia. First, we suggest news articles to
Wikipedia entities (article-entity placement) relying on a rich set of features
which take into account the \emph{salience} and \emph{relative authority} of
entities, and the \emph{novelty} of news articles to entity pages. Second, we
determine the exact section in the entity page for the input article
(article-section placement) guided by class-based section templates. We perform
an extensive evaluation of our approach based on ground-truth data that is
extracted from external references in Wikipedia. We achieve a high precision
value of up to 93\% in the \emph{article-entity} suggestion stage and upto 84\%
for the \emph{article-section placement}. Finally, we compare our approach
against competitive baselines and show significant improvements.

 <dc:description>  Wikipedia, rich in entities and events, is an invaluable resource for various
knowledge harvesting, extraction and mining tasks. Numerous resources like
DBpedia, YAGO and other knowledge bases are based on extracting entity and
event based knowledge from it. Online news, on the other hand, is an
authoritative and rich source for emerging entities, events and facts relating
to existing entities. In this work, we study the creation of entities in
Wikipedia with respect to news by studying how entity and event based
information flows from news to Wikipedia.
  We analyze the lag of Wikipedia (based on the revision history of the English
Wikipedia) with 20 years of \emph{The New York Times} dataset (NYT). We model
and analyze the lag of entities and events, namely their first appearance in
Wikipedia and in NYT, respectively. In our extensive experimental analysis, we
find that almost 20\% of the external references in entity pages are news
articles encoding the importance of news to Wikipedia. Second, we observe that
the entity-based lag follows a normal distribution with a high standard
deviation, whereas the lag for news-based events is typically very low.
Finally, we find that events are responsible for creation of emergent entities
with as many as 12\% of the entities mentioned in the event page are created
after the creation of the event page.

 <dc:description>  The increasing amount of data on the Web, in particular of Linked Data, has
led to a diverse landscape of datasets, which make entity retrieval a
challenging task. Explicit cross-dataset links, for instance to indicate
co-references or related entities can significantly improve entity retrieval.
However, only a small fraction of entities are interlinked through explicit
statements. In this paper, we propose a two-fold entity retrieval approach. In
a first, offline preprocessing step, we cluster entities based on the
\emph{x--means} and \emph{spectral} clustering algorithms. In the second step,
we propose an optimized retrieval model which takes advantage of our
precomputed clusters. For a given set of entities retrieved by the BM25F
retrieval approach and a given user query, we further expand the result set
with relevant entities by considering features of the queries, entities and the
precomputed clusters. Finally, we re-rank the expanded result set with respect
to the relevance to the query. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on
the Billions Triple Challenge (BTC12) dataset. The proposed approach shows
significant improvements compared to the baseline and state of the art
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Regular expressions with capture variables, also known as &quot;regex formulas,&quot;
extract relations of spans (interval positions) from text. These relations can
be further manipulated via Relational Algebra as studied in the context of
document spanners, Fagin et al.'s formal framework for information extraction.
We investigate the complexity of querying text by Conjunctive Queries (CQs) and
Unions of CQs (UCQs) on top of regex formulas. We show that the lower bounds
(NP-completeness and W[1]-hardness) from the relational world also hold in our
setting; in particular, hardness hits already single-character text! Yet, the
upper bounds from the relational world do not carry over. Unlike the relational
world, acyclic CQs, and even gamma-acyclic CQs, are hard to compute. The source
of hardness is that it may be intractable to instantiate the relation defined
by a regex formula, simply because it has an exponential number of tuples. Yet,
we are able to establish general upper bounds. In particular, UCQs can be
evaluated with polynomial delay, provided that every CQ has a bounded number of
atoms (while unions and projection can be arbitrary). Furthermore, UCQ
evaluation is solvable with FPT (Fixed-Parameter Tractable) delay when the
parameter is the size of the UCQ.

 <dc:title>Does Outside-In Teaching Improve the Learning of Object-Oriented
  Programming?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is widely used in the software industry and
university introductory courses today. Following the structure of most
textbooks, such courses frequently are organised starting with the concepts of
imperative and structured programming and only later introducing OOP. An
alternative approach is to begin directly with OOP following the Outside-In
teaching method as proposed by Meyer. Empirical results for the effects of
Outside-In teaching on students and lecturers are sparse, however. We describe
the conceptual design and empirical evaluation of two OOP introductory courses
from different universities based on Outside-In teaching. The evaluation
results are compared to those from a third course serving as the control group,
which was taught OOP the &quot;traditional&quot; way. We evaluate the initial motivation
and knowledge of the participants and the learning outcomes. In addition, we
analyse results of the end-term exams and qualitatively analyse the results of
interviews with the lecturers and tutors. Regarding the learning outcomes, the
results show no signif- icant differences between the Outside-In and the
&quot;traditional&quot; teaching method. In general, students found it harder to solve
and implement algorithmic problems than to understand object oriented (OO)
concepts. Students taught OOP by the Outside-In method, however, were less
afraid that they would not pass the exam at the end of term and understood the
OO paradigm more quickly. Therefore, the Outside-In method is no silver bullet
for teaching OOP regarding the learning outcomes but has positive effects on
motivation and interest.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce transformations of deep rectifier networks,
enabling the conversion of deep rectifier networks into shallow rectifier
networks. We subsequently prove that any rectifier net of any depth can be
represented by a maximum of a number of functions that can be realized by a
shallow network with a single hidden layer. The transformations of both deep
rectifier nets and deep residual nets are conducted to demonstrate the
advantages of the residual nets over the conventional neural nets and the
advantages of the deep neural nets over the shallow neural nets. In summary,
for two rectifier nets with different depths but with same total number of
hidden units, the corresponding single hidden layer representation of the
deeper net is much more complex than the corresponding single hidden
representation of the shallower net. Similarly, for a residual net and a
conventional rectifier net with the same structure except for the skip
connections in the residual net, the corresponding single hidden layer
representation of the residual net is much more complex than the corresponding
single hidden layer representation of the conventional net.

 <dc:description>  A simplified speech recognition system that uses the maximum mutual
information (MMI) criterion is considered. End-to-end training using gradient
descent is suggested, similarly to the training of connectionist temporal
classification (CTC). We use an MMI criterion with a simple language model in
the training stage, and a standard HMM decoder. Our method compares favorably
to CTC in terms of performance, robustness, decoding time, disk footprint and
quality of alignments. The good alignments enable the use of a straightforward
ensemble method, obtained by simply averaging the predictions of several neural
network models, that were trained separately end-to-end. The ensemble method
yields a considerable reduction in the word error rate.

 <dc:description>  Background: Agile software development has become a popular way of developing
software. Scrum is the most frequently used agile framework, but it is often
reported to be adapted in practice. Objective: Thus, we aim to understand how
Scrum is adapted in different contexts and what are the reasons for these
changes. Method: Using a structured interview guideline, we interviewed ten
German companies about their concrete usage of Scrum and analysed the results
qualitatively. Results: All companies vary Scrum in some way. The least
variations are in the Sprint length, events, team size and requirements
engineering. Many users varied the roles, effort estimations and quality
assurance. Conclusions: Many variations constitute a substantial deviation from
Scrum as initially proposed. For some of these variations, there are good
reasons. Sometimes, however, the variations are a result of a previous
non-agile, hierarchical organisation.

 <dc:description>  Biological plastic neural networks are systems of extraordinary computational
capabilities shaped by evolution, development, and lifetime learning. The
interplay of these elements leads to the emergence of adaptive behavior and
intelligence. Inspired by such intricate natural phenomena, Evolved Plastic
Artificial Neural Networks (EPANNs) use simulated evolution in-silico to breed
plastic neural networks with a large variety of dynamics, architectures, and
plasticity rules: these artificial systems are composed of inputs, outputs, and
plastic components that change in response to experiences in an environment.
These systems may autonomously discover novel adaptive algorithms, and lead to
hypotheses on the emergence of biological adaptation. EPANNs have seen
considerable progress over the last two decades. Current scientific and
technological advances in artificial neural networks are now setting the
conditions for radically new approaches and results. In particular, the
limitations of hand-designed networks could be overcome by more flexible and
innovative solutions. This paper brings together a variety of inspiring ideas
that define the field of EPANNs. The main methods and results are reviewed.
Finally, new opportunities and developments are presented.

 <dc:title>Finding Even Cycles Faster via Capped k-Walks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a cycle of length $2k$ (a
$C_{2k}$) in an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges for constant
$k\ge2$. A classic result by Bondy and Simonovits [J.Comb.Th.'74] implies that
if $m \ge100k n^{1+1/k}$, then $G$ contains a $C_{2k}$, further implying that
one needs to consider only graphs with $m = O(n^{1+1/k})$.
  Previously the best known algorithms were an $O(n^2)$ algorithm due to Yuster
and Zwick [J.Disc.Math'97] as well as a $O(m^{2-(1+\lceil
k/2\rceil^{-1})/(k+1)})$ algorithm by Alon et al. [Algorithmica'97].
  We present an algorithm that uses $O(m^{2k/(k+1)})$ time and finds a $C_{2k}$
if one exists. This bound is $O(n^2)$ exactly when $m=\Theta(n^{1+1/k})$. For
$4$-cycles our new bound coincides with Alon et al., while for every $k&gt;2$ our
bound yields a polynomial improvement in $m$.
  Yuster and Zwick noted that it is &quot;plausible to conjecture that $O(n^2)$ is
the best possible bound in terms of $n$&quot;. We show &quot;conditional optimality&quot;: if
this hypothesis holds then our $O(m^{2k/(k+1)})$ algorithm is tight as well.
Furthermore, a folklore reduction implies that no combinatorial algorithm can
determine if a graph contains a $6$-cycle in time $O(m^{3/2-\epsilon})$ for any
$\epsilon&gt;0$ under the widely believed combinatorial BMM conjecture. Coupled
with our main result, this gives tight bounds for finding $6$-cycles
combinatorially and also separates the complexity of finding $4$- and
$6$-cycles giving evidence that the exponent of $m$ in the running time should
indeed increase with $k$.
  The key ingredient in our algorithm is a new notion of capped $k$-walks,
which are walks of length $k$ that visit only nodes according to a fixed
ordering. Our main technical contribution is an involved analysis proving
several properties of such walks which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We study the relational graph models that constitute a natural subclass of
relational models of lambda-calculus. We prove that among the lambda-theories
induced by such models there exists a minimal one, and that the corresponding
relational graph model is very natural and easy to construct. We then study
relational graph models that are fully abstract, in the sense that they capture
some observational equivalence between lambda-terms. We focus on the two main
observational equivalences in the lambda-calculus, the theory H+ generated by
taking as observables the beta-normal forms, and H* generated by considering as
observables the head normal forms. On the one hand we introduce a notion of
lambda-K\&quot;onig} model and prove that a relational graph model is fully abstract
for H+ if and only if it is extensional and lambda-K\&quot;onig. On the other hand
we show that the dual notion of hyperimmune model, together with
extensionality, captures the full abstraction for H*.

 <dc:description>  The integrity of messages in vehicular ad-hoc networks has been extensively
studied by the research community, resulting in the IEEE~1609.2 standard, which
provides typical integrity guarantees. However, the correctness of message
contents is still one of the main challenges of applying dependable and secure
vehicular ad-hoc networks. One important use case is the validity of position
information contained in messages: position verification mechanisms have been
proposed in the literature to provide this functionality. A more general
approach to validate such information is by applying misbehavior detection
mechanisms. In this paper, we consider misbehavior detection by enhancing two
position verification mechanisms and fusing their results in a generalized
framework using subjective logic. We conduct extensive simulations using VEINS
to study the impact of traffic density, as well as several types of attackers
and fractions of attackers on our mechanisms. The obtained results show the
proposed framework can validate position information as effectively as existing
approaches in the literature, without tailoring the framework specifically for
this use case.

 <dc:description>  Digital sculpting is a popular means to create 3D models but remains a
challenging task for many users. This can be alleviated by recent advances in
data-driven and procedural modeling, albeit bounded by the underlying data and
procedures. We propose a 3D sculpting system that assists users in freely
creating models without predefined scope. With a brushing interface similar to
common sculpting tools, our system silently records and analyzes users'
workflows, and predicts what they might or should do in the future to reduce
input labor or enhance output quality. Users can accept, ignore, or modify the
suggestions and thus maintain full control and individual style. They can also
explicitly select and clone past workflows over output model regions. Our key
idea is to consider how a model is authored via dynamic workflows in addition
to what it is shaped in static geometry, for more accurate analysis of user
intentions and more general synthesis of shape structures. The workflows
contain potential repetitions for analysis and synthesis, including user inputs
(e.g. pen strokes on a pressure sensing tablet), model outputs (e.g. extrusions
on an object surface), and camera viewpoints. We evaluate our method via user
feedbacks and authored models.

 <dc:description>  Like it or not, attempts to evaluate and monitor the quality of academic
research have become increasingly prevalent worldwide. Performance reviews
range from at the level of individuals, through research groups and
departments, to entire universities. Many of these are informed by, or
functions of, simple scientometric indicators and the results of such exercises
impact onto careers, funding and prestige. However, there is sometimes a
failure to appreciate that scientometrics are, at best, very blunt instruments
and their incorrect usage can be misleading. Rather than accepting the rise and
fall of individuals and institutions on the basis of such imprecise measures,
calls have been made for indicators be regularly scrutinised and for
improvements to the evidence base in this area. It is thus incumbent upon the
scientific community, especially the physics, complexity-science and
scientometrics communities, to scrutinise metric indicators. Here, we review
recent attempts to do this and show that some metrics in widespread use cannot
be used as reliable indicators research quality.

 <dc:description>  We consider a committee voting setting in which each voter approves of a
subset of candidates and based on the approvals, a target number of candidates
are to be selected. In particular we focus on the axiomatic property called
extended justified representation (EJR). Although a committee satisfying EJR is
guaranteed to exist, the computational complexity of finding such a committee
has been an open problem and explicitly mentioned in multiple recent papers. We
settle the complexity of finding a committee satisfying EJR by presenting a
polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. Our algorithmic approach may be
useful for constructing other voting rules in multi-winner voting.

 <dc:title>On the Performance of MRC Receiver with Unknown Timing Mismatch-A Large
  Scale Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ganji, Mehdi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Jafarkhani, Hamid</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There has been extensive research on large scale multi-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems recently. Researchers have shown that there
are great opportunities in this area, however, there are many obstacles in the
way to achieve full potential of using large number of receive antennas. One of
the main issues, which will be investigated thoroughly in this paper, is timing
asynchrony among signals of different users. Most of the works in the
literature, assume that received signals are perfectly aligned which is not
practical. We show that, neglecting the asynchrony can significantly degrade
the performance of existing designs, particularly maximum ratio combining
(MRC). We quantify the uplink achievable rates obtained by MRC receiver with
perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI while the system is
impaired by unknown time delays among received signals. We then use these
results to design new algorithms in order to alleviate the effects of timing
mismatch. We also analyze the performance of introduced receiver design, which
is called MRC-ZF, with perfect and imperfect CSI. For performing MRC-ZF, the
only required information is the distribution of timing mismatch which
circumvents the necessity of time delay acquisition or synchronization. To
verify our analytical results, we present extensive simulation results which
thoroughly investigate the performance of the traditional MRC receiver and the
introduced MRC-ZF receiver.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel heuristic approach that defines fuzzy geographical
descriptors using data gathered from a survey with human subjects. The
participants were asked to provide graphical interpretations of the descriptors
`north' and `south' for the Galician region (Spain). Based on these
interpretations, our approach builds fuzzy descriptors that are able to compute
membership degrees for geographical locations. We evaluated our approach in
terms of efficiency and precision. The fuzzy descriptors are meant to be used
as the cornerstones of a geographical referring expression generation algorithm
that is able to linguistically characterize geographical locations and regions.
This work is also part of a general research effort that intends to establish a
methodology which reunites the empirical studies traditionally practiced in
data-to-text and the use of fuzzy sets to model imprecision and vagueness in
words and expressions for text generation purposes.

 <dc:description>  The family of Multiscale Hybrid-Mixed (MHM) finite element methods has
received considerable attention from the mathematics and engineering community
in the last few years. The MHM methods allow solving highly heterogeneous
problems on coarse meshes while providing solutions with high-order precision.
It embeds independent local problems which are responsible for upscaling
unresolved scales into the numerical solution. These local contributions are
brought together through a global problem defined on the skeleton of the coarse
partition. Since the local problems are completely independent, they can be
easily computed in parallel. In this paper, we present two simulator prototypes
specifically crafted for the MHM methods, which adopt two different
implementation strategies: (i) a multi-programming language approach, each
language tackling different simulation issues; and (ii) a classical,
single-programming language approach. Specifically, we use C++ for numerical
computation of the global and local problems in a modular way; for process
distribution in the simulator, we adopt the Erlang concurrent language in the
first approach, and the MPI standard in the second approach. The aim of
exploring these different approaches is twofold: (i) allow for the deployment
of the simulator both in high-performance computing (with MPI) and in cloud
computing environments (with Erlang); and (ii) pave the way for further
exploration of quality attributes related to software productivity and
fault-tolerance, which are key to Exascale systems. We present a performance
evaluation of the two simulator prototypes taking into account their
efficiency.

 <dc:description>  The largest eigenvalue of a network's adjacency matrix and its associated
principal eigenvector are key elements for determining the topological
structure and the properties of dynamical processes mediated by it. We present
a physically grounded expression relating the value of the largest eigenvalue
of a given network to the largest eigenvalue of two network subgraphs,
considered as isolated: The hub with its immediate neighbors and the densely
connected set of nodes with maximum $K$-core index. We validate this formula
showing that it predicts with good accuracy the largest eigenvalue of a large
set of synthetic and real-world topologies. We also present evidence of the
consequences of these findings for broad classes of dynamics taking place on
the networks. As a byproduct, we reveal that the spectral properties of
heterogeneous networks built according to the linear preferential attachment
model are qualitatively different from those of their static counterparts.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problems of robust PAC learning from distributed and
streaming data, which may contain malicious errors and outliers, and analyze
their fundamental complexity questions. In particular, we establish lower
bounds on the communication complexity for distributed robust learning
performed on multiple machines, and on the space complexity for robust learning
from streaming data on a single machine. These results demonstrate that gaining
robustness of learning algorithms is usually at the expense of increased
complexities. As far as we know, this work gives the first complexity results
for distributed and online robust PAC learning.

 <dc:description>  Community networks (CNs) have seen an increase in the last fifteen years.
Their members contact nodes which operate Internet proxies, web servers, user
file storage and video streaming services, to name a few. Detecting communities
of nodes with properties (such as co-location) and assessing node eligibility
for service placement is thus a key-factor in optimizing the experience of
users. We present a novel solution for the problem of service placement as a
two-phase approach, based on: 1) community finding using a scalable graph label
propagation technique and 2) a decentralized election procedure to address the
multi-objective challenge of optimizing service placement in CNs. Herein we: i)
highlight the applicability of leader election heuristics which are important
for service placement in community networks and scheduler-dependent scenarios;
ii) present a parallel and distributed solution designed as a scalable
alternative for the problem of service placement, which has mostly seen
computational approaches based on centralization and sequential execution.

 <dc:description>  Modern corporations physically separate their sensitive computational
infrastructure from public or other accessible networks in order to prevent
cyber-attacks. However, attackers still manage to infect these networks, either
by means of an insider or by infiltrating the supply chain. Therefore, an
attacker's main challenge is to determine a way to command and control the
compromised hosts that are isolated from an accessible network (e.g., the
Internet).
  In this paper, we propose a new adversarial model that shows how an air
gapped network can receive communications over a covert thermal channel.
Concretely, we show how attackers may use a compromised air-conditioning system
(connected to the internet) to send commands to infected hosts within an
air-gapped network. Since thermal communication protocols are a rather
unexplored domain, we propose a novel line-encoding and protocol suitable for
this type of channel. Moreover, we provide experimental results to demonstrate
the covert channel's feasibility, and to calculate the channel's bandwidth.
Lastly, we offer a forensic analysis and propose various ways this channel can
be detected and prevented.
  We believe that this study details a previously unseen vector of attack that
security experts should be aware of.

neural networks have seen success in computer vision and natural language
processing, they have not been as useful in stock market trading. To
demonstrate the applicability of a neural network in stock trading, we made a
single-layer neural network that recommends buying or selling shares of a stock
by comparing the highest high of 10 consecutive days with that of the next 10
days, a process repeated for the stock's year-long historical data. A
chi-squared analysis found that the neural network can accurately and
appropriately decide whether to buy or sell shares for a given stock, showing
that a neural network can make simple decisions about the stock market.

 <dc:description>  We introduce novel framework for autonomous learning of the own configuration
in direct current (DC) MicroGrids (MG) with high penetration of power
electronic converters and without access to an external communication system.
The framework is implemented within the decentralized primary droop control
loop, enabling the controllers to learn (i) the generation capacities of
dispatchable power sources, (ii) the load demands, and (iii) the admittances of
the distribution system lines. Its development is founded on the fact that the
steady state bus voltages in droop-controlled MG depend on the generation
capacities, the load and the admittance matrix of the distribution system,
through a non-linear, implicit model that can be estimated via asymptotically
efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure. To define a well-conditioned
estimation problem, we employ solution based on the concept of decentralized,
coordinated training where the primary droop controllers temporarily switch
between operating points, following a protocol that relies on predefined,
amplitude-modulated training sequences. The numerical evaluations verify the
analysis and confirm the practical potential of the framework.

 <dc:description>  While strong progress has been made in image captioning over the last years,
machine and human captions are still quite distinct. A closer look reveals that
this is due to the deficiencies in the generated word distribution, vocabulary
size, and strong bias in the generators towards frequent captions. Furthermore,
humans -- rightfully so -- generate multiple, diverse captions, due to the
inherent ambiguity in the captioning task which is not considered in today's
systems.
  To address these challenges, we change the training objective of the caption
generator from reproducing groundtruth captions to generating a set of captions
that is indistinguishable from human generated captions. Instead of
handcrafting such a learning target, we employ adversarial training in
combination with an approximate Gumbel sampler to implicitly match the
generated distribution to the human one. While our method achieves comparable
performance to the state-of-the-art in terms of the correctness of the
captions, we generate a set of diverse captions, that are significantly less
biased and match the word statistics better in several aspects.

 <dc:description>  Radiation therapy has emerged as one of the preferred techniques to treat
brain cancer patients. During treatment, a very high dose of radiation is
delivered to a very narrow area. Prescribed radiation therapy for brain cancer
requires precisely defining the target treatment area, as well as delineating
vital brain structures which must be spared from radiotoxicity. Nevertheless,
delineation task is usually still manually performed, which is inefficient and
operator-dependent. Several attempts of automatizing this process have
reported. however, marginal results when analyzing organs in the optic region.
In this work we present a deep learning classification scheme based on
augmented-enhanced features to automatically segment organs at risk (OARs) in
the optic region -optic nerves, optic chiasm, pituitary gland and pituitary
stalk-. Fifteen MR images with various types of brain tumors were
retrospectively collected to undergo manual and automatic segmentation. Mean
Dice Similarity coefficients around 0.80 were reported. Incorporation of
proposed features yielded to improvements on the segmentation. Compared with
support vector machines, our method achieved better performance with less
variation on the results, as well as a considerably reduction on the
classification time. Performance of the proposed approach was also evaluated
with respect to manual contours. In this case, results obtained from the
automatic contours mostly lie on the variability of the observers, showing no
significant differences with respect to them. These results suggest therefore
that the proposed system is more accurate than other presented approaches, up
to date, to segment these structures. The speed, reproducibility, and
robustness of the process make the proposed deep learning-based classification
system a valuable tool for assisting in the delineation task of small OARs in
brain cancer.

 <dc:title>Free Energy Approximations for CSMA networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Van Houdt, Benny</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we study how to estimate the back-off rates in an idealized
CSMA network consisting of $n$ links to achieve a given throughput vector using
free energy approximations. More specifically, we introduce the class of
region-based free energy approximations with clique belief and present a closed
form expression for the back-off rates based on the zero gradient points of the
free energy approximation (in terms of the conflict graph, target throughput
vector and counting numbers). Next we introduce the size $k_{max}$ clique free
energy approximation as a special case and derive an explicit expression for
the counting numbers, as well as a recursion to compute the back-off rates. We
subsequently show that the size $k_{max}$ clique approximation coincides with a
Kikuchi free energy approximation and prove that it is exact on chordal
conflict graphs when $k_{max} = n$. As a by-product these results provide us
with an explicit expression of a fixed point of the inverse generalized belief
propagation algorithm for CSMA networks. Using numerical experiments we compare
the accuracy of the novel approximation method with existing methods.

 <dc:description>  The growing presence of devices carrying digital cameras, such as mobile
phones and tablets, combined with ever improving internet networks have enabled
ordinary citizens, victims of human rights abuse, and participants in armed
conflicts, protests, and disaster situations to capture and share via social
media networks images and videos of specific events. This paper discusses the
potential of images in human rights context including the opportunities and
challenges they present. This study demonstrates that real-world images have
the capacity to contribute complementary data to operational human rights
monitoring efforts when combined with novel computer vision approaches. The
analysis is concluded by arguing that if images are to be used effectively to
detect and identify human rights violations by rights advocates, greater
attention to gathering task-specific visual concepts from large-scale web
images is required.

 <dc:description>  A multimodal network encodes relationships between the same set of nodes in
multiple settings, and network alignment is a powerful tool for transferring
information and insight between a pair of networks. We propose a method for
multimodal network alignment that computes a matrix which indicates the
alignment, but produces the result as a low-rank factorization directly. We
then propose new methods to compute approximate maximum weight matchings of
low-rank matrices to produce an alignment. We evaluate our approach by applying
it on synthetic networks and use it to de-anonymize a multimodal transportation
network.

 <dc:title>On Bayesian Exponentially Embedded Family for Model Order Selection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive a Bayesian model order selection rule by using the
exponentially embedded family method, termed Bayesian EEF. Unlike many other
Bayesian model selection methods, the Bayesian EEF can use vague proper priors
and improper noninformative priors to be objective in the elicitation of
parameter priors. Moreover, the penalty term of the rule is shown to be the sum
of half of the parameter dimension and the estimated mutual information between
parameter and observed data. This helps to reveal the EEF mechanism in
selecting model orders and may provide new insights into the open problems of
choosing an optimal penalty term for model order selection and choosing a good
prior from information theoretic viewpoints. The important example of linear
model order selection is given to illustrate the algorithms and arguments.
Lastly, the Bayesian EEF that uses Jeffreys prior coincides with the EEF rule
derived by frequentist strategies. This shows another interesting relationship
between the frequentist and Bayesian philosophies for model selection.

 <dc:description>  The output impedance matrices of three-phase grid-connected voltage source
converters (VSCs) are widely used in power system stability analysis.
Regardless of how the impedance is modeled, there always exist coupling terms
in the impedance matrix, which makes the system a multi-input- multi-output
(MIMO) system. Some approximation approaches omit the coupling terms so that a
three-phase system can be treated like a single-phase one, and the
impedance-based stability criterion for a single-input-single-output (SISO)
system is applicable. However, such handling may result in analytical errors or
even incorrect conclusions in a mirror frequency coupled system. By introducing
the concept of generalized- impedances, this letter proposes a new stability
criterion based on a virtual SISO system, which can effectively handle the
coupling terms. Further, the effects of the phase-locked-loop (PLL) parameters
on system stability are studied based on the proposed criterion. The
effectiveness of the proposed criterion is verified by a hardware-in-the-loop
(HIL) simulation based on RT-LAB.

 <dc:description>  Viterbi Algorithm Decoder Enhanced with Non-transmittable Codewords is one of
the best decoding algorithm which effectively improves forward error correction
performance. HoweverViterbi decoder enhanced with NTCs is not yet designed to
work in storage media devices. Currently Reed Solomon (RS) Algorithm is almost
the dominant algorithm used in correcting error in storage media. Conversely,
recent studies show that there still exist low reliability of data in storage
media while the demand for storage media increases drastically. This study
proposes a design of the Soft Viterbi Algorithm decoder enhanced with
Non-transmittable Codewords (SVAD-NTCs) to be used in storage media for error
correction. Matlab simulation was used in this design in order to investigate
behavior and effectiveness of SVAD-NTCs in correcting errors in data retrieving
from storage media.Sample data of one million bits are randomly generated,
Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) was used as data distortion model and
Binary Phase- Shift Keying (BPSK) was applied for simulation modulation.
Results show that,behaviors of SVAD-NTC performance increase as you increase
the NTCs, but beyond 6NTCs there is no significant change and SVAD-NTCs design
drastically reduce the total residual error from 216,878 of Reed Solomon to
23,900.

 <dc:description>  An energy harvesting (EH) transmitter communicating over a time-correlated
wireless channel is considered. The transmitter is capable of sensing the
current channel state, albeit at the cost of both energy and transmission time.
The EH transmitter aims to maximize its long-term throughput by choosing one of
the following actions: $i)$ defer its transmission to save energy for future
use, $ii)$ transmit reliably at a low rate, $iii)$ transmit at a high rate, and
$iv)$ sense the channel to reveal the channel state at a cost of energy and
transmission time, and then decide to defer or to transmit. The problem is
formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process with a belief on
the channel state. The optimal policy is shown to exhibit a threshold behavior
on the belief state, with battery-dependent threshold values. The optimal
threshold values and performance are characterized numerically via the value
iteration algorithm as well as a policy search algorithm that exploits the
threshold structure of the optimal policy. Our results demonstrate that,
despite the associated time and energy cost, sensing the channel intelligently
to track the channel state improves the achievable long-term throughput
significantly as compared to the performance of those protocols lacking this
ability as well as the one that always senses the channel.

 <dc:description>  We propose an effective optimization algorithm for a general hierarchical
segmentation model with geometric interactions between segments. Any given tree
can specify a partial order over object labels defining a hierarchy. It is
well-established that segment interactions, such as inclusion/exclusion and
margin constraints, make the model significantly more discriminant. However,
existing optimization methods do not allow full use of such models. Generic
-expansion results in weak local minima, while common binary multi-layered
formulations lead to non-submodularity, complex high-order potentials, or polar
domain unwrapping and shape biases. In practice, applying these methods to
arbitrary trees does not work except for simple cases. Our main contribution is
an optimization method for the Hierarchically-structured Interacting Segments
(HINTS) model with arbitrary trees. Our Path-Moves algorithm is based on
multi-label MRF formulation and can be seen as a combination of well-known
a-expansion and Ishikawa techniques. We show state-of-the-art biomedical
segmentation for many diverse examples of complex trees.

 <dc:description>  The learning of mixture models can be viewed as a clustering problem. Indeed,
given data samples independently generated from a mixture of distributions, we
often would like to find the correct target clustering of the samples according
to which component distribution they were generated from. For a clustering
problem, practitioners often choose to use the simple k-means algorithm.
k-means attempts to find an optimal clustering which minimizes the
sum-of-squared distance between each point and its cluster center. In this
paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the closeness of any optimal
clustering and the correct target clustering assuming that the data samples are
generated from a mixture of log-concave distributions. Moreover, we show that
under similar or even weaker conditions on the mixture model, any optimal
clustering for the samples with reduced dimensionality is also close to the
correct target clustering. These results provide intuition for the
informativeness of k-means (with and without dimensionality reduction) as an
algorithm for learning mixture models. We verify the correctness of our
theorems using numerical experiments and demonstrate using datasets with
reduced dimensionality significant speed ups for the time required to perform
clustering.

 <dc:description>  Searching large databases is an important problem with broad applications.
The Grover search algorithm provides a powerful method for quantum computers to
perform searches with a quadratic speedup in the number of required database
queries over classical computers. It is an optimal search algorithm for a
quantum computer, and has further applications as a subroutine for other
quantum algorithms. Searches with two qubits have been demonstrated on a
variety of platforms and proposed for others, but larger search spaces have
only been demonstrated on a non-scalable NMR system. Here, we report results
for a complete three-qubit Grover search algorithm using the scalable quantum
computing technology of trapped atomic ions, with better-than-classical
performance. The algorithm is performed for all 8 possible single-result
oracles and all 28 possible two-result oracles. Two methods of state marking
are used for the oracles: a phase-flip method employed by other experimental
demonstrations, and a Boolean method requiring an ancilla qubit that is
directly equivalent to the state-marking scheme required to perform a classical
search. All quantum solutions are shown to outperform their classical
counterparts. We also report the first implementation of a Toffoli-4 gate,
which is used along with Toffoli-3 gates to construct the algorithms; these

 <dc:description>  Rating platforms enable large-scale collection of user opinion about items
(products, other users, etc.). However, many untrustworthy users give
fraudulent ratings for excessive monetary gains. In the paper, we present
FairJudge, a system to identify such fraudulent users. We propose three
metrics: (i) the fairness of a user that quantifies how trustworthy the user is
in rating the products, (ii) the reliability of a rating that measures how
reliable the rating is, and (iii) the goodness of a product that measures the
quality of the product. Intuitively, a user is fair if it provides reliable
ratings that are close to the goodness of the product. We formulate a mutually
recursive definition of these metrics, and further address cold start problems
and incorporate behavioral properties of users and products in the formulation.
We propose an iterative algorithm, FairJudge, to predict the values of the
three metrics. We prove that FairJudge is guaranteed to converge in a bounded
number of iterations, with linear time complexity. By conducting five different
experiments on five rating platforms, we show that FairJudge significantly
outperforms nine existing algorithms in predicting fair and unfair users. We
reported the 100 most unfair users in the Flipkart network to their review
fraud investigators, and 80 users were correctly identified (80% accuracy). The
FairJudge algorithm is already being deployed at Flipkart.

 <dc:description>  Next generation cellular networks will have to leverage large cell
densifications to accomplish the ambitious goals for aggregate multi-user sum
rates, for which CRAN architecture is a favored network design. This shifts the
attention back to applicable resource allocation (RA), which need to be
applicable for very short radio frames, large and dense sets of radio heads,
and large user populations in the coordination area. So far, mainly CSI-based
RA schemes have been proposed for this task. However, they have considerable
complexity and also incur a significant CSI acquisition overhead on the system.
In this paper, we study an alternative approach which promises lower complexity
with also a lower overhead. We propose to base the RA in multi-antenna CRAN
systems on the position information of user terminals only. We use Random
Forests as supervised machine learning approach to determine the multi-user
RAs. This likely leads to lower overhead costs, as the acquisition of position
information requires less radio resources in comparison to the acquisition of
instantaneous CSI. The results show the following findings: I) In general,
learning-based RA schemes can achieve comparable spectral efficiency to
CSI-based scheme; II) If taking the system overhead into account,
learning-based RA scheme utilizing position information outperform legacy
CSI-based scheme by up to 100%; III) Despite their dependency on the training
data, Random Forests based RA scheme is robust against position inaccuracies
and changes in the propagation scenario; IV) The most important factor
influencing the performance of learning-based RA scheme is the antenna
orientation, for which we present three approaches that restore most of the
original performance results. To the best of our knowledge, these insights are
new and indicate a novel as well as promising approach to master the complexity
in future cellular networks.

 <dc:description>  Lossy image compression is generally formulated as a joint rate-distortion
optimization to learn encoder, quantizer, and decoder. However, the quantizer
is non-differentiable, and discrete entropy estimation usually is required for
rate control. These make it very challenging to develop a convolutional network
(CNN)-based image compression system. In this paper, motivated by that the
local information content is spatially variant in an image, we suggest that the
bit rate of the different parts of the image should be adapted to local
content. And the content aware bit rate is allocated under the guidance of a
content-weighted importance map. Thus, the sum of the importance map can serve
as a continuous alternative of discrete entropy estimation to control
compression rate. And binarizer is adopted to quantize the output of encoder
due to the binarization scheme is also directly defined by the importance map.
Furthermore, a proxy function is introduced for binary operation in backward
propagation to make it differentiable. Therefore, the encoder, decoder,
binarizer and importance map can be jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner
by using a subset of the ImageNet database. In low bit rate image compression,
experiments show that our system significantly outperforms JPEG and JPEG 2000
by structural similarity (SSIM) index, and can produce the much better visual
result with sharp edges, rich textures, and fewer artifacts.

 <dc:title>Sparse Signal Recovery via Generalized Entropy Functions Minimization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Shuai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tran, Trac D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Compressive sensing relies on the sparse prior imposed on the signal to solve
the ill-posed recovery problem in an under-determined linear system. The
objective function that enforces the sparse prior information should be both
effective and easily optimizable. Motivated by the entropy concept from
information theory, in this paper we propose the generalized Shannon entropy
function and R\'{e}nyi entropy function of the signal as the sparsity promoting
objectives. Both entropy functions are nonconvex, and their local minimums only
occur on the boundaries of the orthants in the Euclidean space. Compared to
other popular objective functions such as the $\|\boldsymbol
x\|_1$,$\|\boldsymbol x\|_p^p$, minimizing the proposed entropy functions not
only promotes sparsity in the recovered signals, but also encourages the signal
energy to be concentrated towards a few significant entries. The corresponding
optimization problem can be converted into a series of reweighted $l_1$
minimization problems and solved efficiently. Sparse signal recovery
experiments on both the simulated and real data show the proposed entropy
function minimization approaches are better than other popular approaches and
achieve state-of-the-art performances.

 <dc:title>Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization of Coded Caching in Small-Cell

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Coded caching is able to exploit accumulated cache size and hence superior to
uncoded caching by distributing different fractions of a file in different
nodes. This work investigates coded caching in a large-scale small-cell network
(SCN) where the locations of small base stations (SBSs) are modeled by
stochastic geometry. We first propose a content delivery framework, where
multiple SBSs that cache different coded packets of a desired file transmit
concurrently upon a user request and the user decodes the signals using
successive interference cancellation (SIC). We characterize the performance of
coded caching by two performance metrics, average fractional offloaded traffic
(AFOT) and average ergodic rate (AER), for which a closed-form expression and a
tractable expression are derived, respectively, in the high signal-to-noise
ratio region. We then formulate the coded cache placement problem for AFOT
maximization as a multiple-choice knapsack problem (MCKP). By utilizing the
analytical properties of AFOT, a greedy but optimal algorithm is proposed. We
also consider the coded cache placement problem for AER maximization. By
converting this problem into a standard MCKP, a heuristic algorithm is
proposed. Analytical and numerical results reveal several design and
performance insights of coded caching in conjunction with SIC receiver in
interference-limited SCNs.

 <dc:description>  The VIPAFLEET project consists in developing models and algorithms for man-
aging a fleet of Individual Public Autonomous Vehicles (VIPA). Hereby, we
consider a fleet of cars distributed at specified stations in an industrial
area to supply internal transportation, where the cars can be used in different
modes of circulation (tram mode, elevator mode, taxi mode). One goal is to
develop and implement suitable algorithms for each mode in order to satisfy all
the requests under an economic point of view by minimizing the total tour
length. The innovative idea and challenge of the project is to develop and
install a dynamic fleet management system that allows the operator to switch
between the different modes within the different periods of the day according
to the dynamic transportation demands of the users. We model the underlying
online transportation system and propose a correspond- ing fleet management
framework, to handle modes, demands and commands. We consider two modes of
circulation, tram and elevator mode, propose for each mode appropriate on- line
algorithms and evaluate their performance, both in terms of competitive
analysis and practical behavior.

 <dc:title>The Impact of Crowds on News Engagement: A Reddit Case Study</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Today, users are reading the news through social platforms. These platforms
are built to facilitate crowd engagement, but not necessarily disseminate
useful news to inform the masses. Hence, the news that is highly engaged with
may not be the news that best informs. While predicting news popularity has
been well studied, it has not been studied in the context of crowd
manipulations. In this paper, we provide some preliminary results to a longer
term project on crowd and platform manipulations of news and news popularity.
In particular, we choose to study known features for predicting news popularity
and how those features may change on reddit.com, a social platform used
commonly for news aggregation. Along with this, we explore ways in which users
can alter the perception of news through changing the title of an article. We
find that news on reddit is predictable using previously studied sentiment and
content features and that posts with titles changed by reddit users tend to be
more popular than posts with the original article title.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new approach to the long-term tracking of an object
in a challenging environment. The object is a cow and the environment is an
enclosure in a cowshed. Some of the key challenges in this domain are a
cluttered background, low contrast and high similarity between moving objects
which greatly reduces the efficiency of most existing approaches, including
those based on background subtraction. Our approach is split into object
localization, instance segmentation, learning and tracking stages. Our solution
is compared to a range of semi-supervised object tracking algorithms and we
show that the performance is strong and well suited to subsequent analysis. We
present our solution as a first step towards broader tracking and behavior
monitoring for cows in precision agriculture with the ultimate objective of
early detection of lameness.

 <dc:title>Delay versus Stickiness Violation Trade-offs for Load Balancing in
  Large-Scale Data Centers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liang, Qingkai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Borst, Sem</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most load balancing techniques implemented in current data centers tend to
rely on a mapping from packets to server IP addresses through a hash value
calculated from the flow five-tuple. The hash calculation allows extremely fast
packet forwarding and provides flow `stickiness', meaning that all packets
belonging to the same flow get dispatched to the same server. Unfortunately,
such static hashing may not yield an optimal degree of load balancing, e.g.,
due to variations in server processing speeds or traffic patterns. On the other
hand, dynamic schemes, such as the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ) scheme,
provide a natural way to mitigate load imbalances, but at the expense of
stickiness violation.
  In the present paper we examine the fundamental trade-off between stickiness
violation and packet-level latency performance in large-scale data centers. We
establish that stringent flow stickiness carries a significant performance
penalty in terms of packet-level delay. Moreover, relaxing the stickiness
requirement by a minuscule amount is highly effective in clipping the tail of
the latency distribution. We further propose a bin-based load balancing scheme
that achieves a good balance among scalability, stickiness violation and
packet-level delay performance. Extensive simulation experiments corroborate
the analytical results and validate the effectiveness of the bin-based load
balancing scheme.

 <dc:title>Evaluating Complex Task through Crowdsourcing: Multiple Views Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  With the popularity of massive open online courses, grading through
crowdsourcing has become a prevalent approach towards large scale classes.
However, for getting grades for complex tasks, which require specific skills
and efforts for grading, crowdsourcing encounters a restriction of insufficient
knowledge of the workers from the crowd. Due to knowledge limitation of the
crowd graders, grading based on partial perspectives becomes a big challenge
for evaluating complex tasks through crowdsourcing. Especially for those tasks
which not only need specific knowledge for grading, but also should be graded
as a whole instead of being decomposed into smaller and simpler subtasks. We
propose a framework for grading complex tasks via multiple views, which are
different grading perspectives defined by experts for the task, to provide
uniformity. Aggregation algorithm based on graders variances are used to
combine the grades for each view. We also detect bias patterns of the graders,
and debias them regarding each view of the task. Bias pattern determines how
the behavior is biased among graders, which is detected by a statistical
technique. The proposed approach is analyzed on a synthetic data set. We show
that our model gives more accurate results compared to the grading approaches
without different views and debiasing algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this work we propose a novel model-based deep convolutional autoencoder
that addresses the highly challenging problem of reconstructing a 3D human face
from a single in-the-wild color image. To this end, we combine a convolutional
encoder network with an expert-designed generative model that serves as
decoder. The core innovation is our new differentiable parametric decoder that
encapsulates image formation analytically based on a generative model. Our
decoder takes as input a code vector with exactly defined semantic meaning that
encodes detailed face pose, shape, expression, skin reflectance and scene
illumination. Due to this new way of combining CNN-based with model-based face
reconstruction, the CNN-based encoder learns to extract semantically meaningful
parameters from a single monocular input image. For the first time, a CNN
encoder and an expert-designed generative model can be trained end-to-end in an
unsupervised manner, which renders training on very large (unlabeled) real
world data feasible. The obtained reconstructions compare favorably to current
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quality and richness of representation.

 <dc:title>Geometric Affordances from a Single Example via the Interaction Tensor</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper develops and evaluates a new tensor field representation to
express the geometric affordance of one object over another. We expand the well
known bisector surface representation to one that is weight-driven and that
retains the provenance of surface points with directional vectors. We also
incorporate the notion of affordance keypoints which allow for faster decisions
at a point of query and with a compact and straightforward descriptor. Using a
single interaction example, we are able to generalize to previously-unseen
scenarios; both synthetic and also real scenes captured with RGBD sensors. We
show how our interaction tensor allows for significantly better performance
over alternative formulations. Evaluations also include crowdsourcing
comparisons that confirm the validity of our affordance proposals, which agree
on average 84% of the time with human judgments, and which is 20-40% better
than the baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  Image-to-image translation is a class of vision and graphics problems where
the goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image
using a training set of aligned image pairs. However, for many tasks, paired
training data will not be available. We present an approach for learning to
translate an image from a source domain $X$ to a target domain $Y$ in the
absence of paired examples. Our goal is to learn a mapping $G: X \rightarrow Y$
such that the distribution of images from $G(X)$ is indistinguishable from the
distribution $Y$ using an adversarial loss. Because this mapping is highly
under-constrained, we couple it with an inverse mapping $F: Y \rightarrow X$
and introduce a cycle consistency loss to push $F(G(X)) \approx X$ (and vice
versa). Qualitative results are presented on several tasks where paired
training data does not exist, including collection style transfer, object
transfiguration, season transfer, photo enhancement, etc. Quantitative
comparisons against several prior methods demonstrate the superiority of our
approach.

 <dc:title>The Dynamics of Rank-Maximal and Popular Matchings</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Given a bipartite graph, where the two sets of vertices are applicants and
posts and ranks on the edges represent preferences of applicants over posts, a
{\em rank-maximal} matching is one in which the maximum number of applicants is
matched to their rank one posts and subject to this condition, the maximum
number of applicants is matched to their rank two posts, and so on. A
rank-maximal matching can be computed in $O(\min(c \sqrt{n},n) m)$ time, where
$n$ denotes the number of applicants, $m$ the number of edges and $c$ the
maximum rank of an edge in an optimal solution \cite{IrvingKMMP06}.
  We study the dynamic version of the problem in which a new applicant or post
may be added to the graph and we would like to maintain a rank-maximal
matching. We show that after the arrival of one vertex, we are always able to
update the existing rank-maximal matching in $O(\min(cn ,n^2) + m)$ time;
moreover, by the application of just one alternating path. The time bound can
be considered optimal under the circumstances, as improving it would imply a
better running time for the rank-maximal matching problem. Additionally, our
solution has the property that enables to minimize the number of needed
changes.
  As a by-product we also get an analogous $O(m)$ result for the dynamic
version of the (one-sided) popular matching problem.

 <dc:description>  We study variants of the stable marriage and college admissions models in
which the agents are allowed to express weak preferences over the set of agents
on the other side of the market and the option of remaining unmatched. For the
problems that we address, previous authors have presented polynomial-time
algorithms for computing a &quot;Pareto-stable&quot; matching. In the case of college
admissions, these algorithms require the preferences of the colleges over
groups of students to satisfy a technical condition related to responsiveness.
We design new polynomial-time Pareto-stable algorithms for stable marriage and
college admissions that correspond to strategyproof mechanisms. For stable
marriage, it is known that no Pareto-stable mechanism is strategyproof for all
of the agents; our algorithm provides a mechanism that is strategyproof for the
agents on one side of the market. For college admissions, it is known that no
Pareto-stable mechanism can be strategyproof for the colleges; our algorithm
provides a mechanism that is strategyproof for the students.

 <dc:description>  Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or
cheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular
docking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and
binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models
require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded
as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model
to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general
3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical
interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application
to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural
network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of
a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with
the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding
pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the
protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the
interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by
predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes
found in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics
and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve
experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform
or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all
previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are
end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven,
physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for
future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.

 <dc:description>  3-dimensional Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (3D MIMO) systems have received
great interest recently because of the spatial diversity advantage and
capability for full-dimensional beamforming, making them promising candidates
for practical realization of massive MIMO. In this paper, we present a low-cost
test equipment (channel sounder) and post-processing algorithms suitable for
investigating 3D MIMO channels, as well as the results from a measurement
campaign for obtaining elevation and azimuth characteristics in an
outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) environment. Due to limitations in available antenna
switches, our channel sounder consists of a hybrid switched/virtual cylindrical
array with effectively 480 antenna elements at the base station (BS). The
virtual setup increased the overall MIMO measurement duration, thereby
introducing phase drift errors in the measurements. Using a reference antenna
measurements, we estimate and correct for the phase errors during
post-processing. We provide the elevation and azimuth angular spreads, for the
measurements done in an urban macro-cellular (UMa) and urban micro-cellular
(UMi) environments, and study their dependence on the UE height.
  Based on the measurements done with UE placed on different floors, we study
the feasibility of separating users in the elevation domain. The measured
channel impulse responses are also used to study the channel hardening aspects
of Massive MIMO and the optimality of Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC) receiver.

 <dc:title>Diving into the shallows: a computational perspective on large-scale
  shallow learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we first identify a basic limitation in gradient descent-based
optimization methods when used in conjunctions with smooth kernels. An analysis
based on the spectral properties of the kernel demonstrates that only a
vanishingly small portion of the function space is reachable after a polynomial
number of gradient descent iterations. This lack of approximating power
drastically limits gradient descent for a fixed computational budget leading to
serious over-regularization/underfitting. The issue is purely algorithmic,
persisting even in the limit of infinite data.
  To address this shortcoming in practice, we introduce EigenPro iteration,
based on a preconditioning scheme using a small number of approximately
computed eigenvectors. It can also be viewed as learning a new kernel optimized
for gradient descent. It turns out that injecting this small (computationally
inexpensive and SGD-compatible) amount of approximate second-order information
leads to major improvements in convergence. For large data, this translates
into significant performance boost over the standard kernel methods. In
particular, we are able to consistently match or improve the state-of-the-art
results recently reported in the literature with a small fraction of their
computational budget.
  Finally, we feel that these results show a need for a broader computational
perspective on modern large-scale learning to complement more traditional
statistical and convergence analyses. In particular, many phenomena of
large-scale high-dimensional inference are best understood in terms of
optimization on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where standard algorithms
can sometimes have properties at odds with finite-dimensional intuition. A
systematic analysis concentrating on the approximation power of such algorithms
within a budget of computation may lead to progress both in theory and
practice.

 <dc:description>  Graphs may be used to represent many different problem domains -- a concrete
example is that of detecting communities in social networks, which are
represented as graphs. With big data and more sophisticated applications
becoming widespread in recent years, graph processing has seen an emergence of
requirements pertaining data volume and volatility. This multidisciplinary
study presents a review of relevant distributed graph processing systems.
Herein they are presented in groups defined by common traits (distributed
processing paradigm, type of graph operations, among others), with an overview
of each system's strengths and weaknesses. The set of systems is then narrowed
down to a set of two, upon which quantitative analysis was performed. For this
quantitative comparison of systems, focus was cast on evaluating the
performance of algorithms for the problem of detecting communities. To help
further understand the evaluations performed, a background is provided on graph
clustering.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural perception and control networks are likely to be a key component
of self-driving vehicles. These models need to be explainable - they should
provide easy-to-interpret rationales for their behavior - so that passengers,
insurance companies, law enforcement, developers etc., can understand what
triggered a particular behavior. Here we explore the use of visual
explanations. These explanations take the form of real-time highlighted regions
of an image that causally influence the network's output (steering control).
Our approach is two-stage. In the first stage, we use a visual attention model
to train a convolution network end-to-end from images to steering angle. The
attention model highlights image regions that potentially influence the
network's output. Some of these are true influences, but some are spurious. We
then apply a causal filtering step to determine which input regions actually
influence the output. This produces more succinct visual explanations and more
accurately exposes the network's behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our model on three datasets totaling 16 hours of driving. We first show that
training with attention does not degrade the performance of the end-to-end
network. Then we show that the network causally cues on a variety of features
that are used by humans while driving.

 <dc:description>  Grigni and Hung~\cite{GH12} conjectured that H-minor-free graphs have
$(1+\epsilon)$-spanners that are light, that is, of weight $g(|H|,\epsilon)$
times the weight of the minimum spanning tree for some function $g$. This
conjecture implies the {\em efficient} polynomial-time approximation scheme
(PTAS) of the traveling salesperson problem in $H$-minor free graphs; that is,
a PTAS whose running time is of the form $2^{f(\epsilon)}n^{O(1)}$ for some
function $f$. The state of the art PTAS for TSP in H-minor-free-graphs has
running time $n^{1/\epsilon^c}$. We take a further step toward proving this
conjecture by showing that if the bounded treewidth graphs have light greedy
spanners, then the conjecture is true. We also prove that the greedy spanner of
a bounded pathwidth graph is light and discuss the possibility of extending our
proof to bounded treewidth graphs.

 <dc:description>  Configuring the antenna arrays is the main source of overhead in millimeter
wave (mmWave) communication systems. In high mobility scenarios, the problem is
exacerbated, as achieving the highest rates requires frequent link
reconfiguration. One solution is to exploit spatial congruence between signals
at different frequency bands and extract mmWave channel parameters from side
information obtained in another band. In this paper we propose the concept of
out-of-band information aided mmWave communication. We analyze different
strategies to leverage information derived from sensors or from other
communication systems operating at sub-6 GHz bands to help configure the mmWave
communication link. The overhead reductions that can be obtained when
exploiting out-of-band information are characterized in a preliminary study.
Finally, the challenges associated with using out-of-band signals as a source
of side information at mmWave are analyzed in detail.

 <dc:description>  Artificial Neural Network computation relies on intensive vector-matrix
multiplications. Recently, the emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) crossbar array
showed a feasibility of implementing such operations with high energy
efficiency, thus there are many works on efficiently utilizing emerging NVM
crossbar array as analog vector-matrix multiplier. However, its nonlinear I-V
characteristics restrain critical design parameters, such as the read voltage
and weight range, resulting in substantial accuracy loss. In this paper,
instead of optimizing hardware parameters to a given neural network, we propose
a methodology of reconstructing a neural network itself optimized to resistive
memory crossbar arrays. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we
simulated various neural network with MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset using two
different specific Resistive Random Access Memory (RRAM) model. Simulation
results show that our proposed neural network produces significantly higher
inference accuracies than conventional neural network when the synapse devices
have nonlinear I-V characteristics.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method called the Relevance Subject Machine (RSM) to solve
the person re-identification (re-id) problem. RSM falls under the category of
Bayesian sparse recovery algorithms and uses the sparse representation of the
input video under a pre-defined dictionary to identify the subject in the
video. Our approach focuses on the multi-shot re-id problem, which is the
prevalent problem in many video analytics applications. RSM captures the
essence of the multi-shot re-id problem by constraining the support of the
sparse codes for each input video frame to be the same. Our proposed approach
is also robust enough to deal with time varying outliers and occlusions by
introducing a sparse, non-stationary noise term in the model error. We provide
a novel Variational Bayesian based inference procedure along with an intuitive
interpretation of the proposed update rules. We evaluate our approach over
several commonly used re-id datasets and show superior performance over current
state-of-the-art algorithms. Specifically, for ILIDS-VID, a recent large scale
re-id dataset, RSM shows significant improvement over all published approaches,
achieving an 11.5% (absolute) improvement in rank 1 accuracy over the closest
competing algorithm considered.

 <dc:description>  Making a good decision involves considering the likely outcomes under each
possible action. For example, would drug A or drug B lead to a better outcome
for this patient? Ideally, we answer these questions using an experiment, but
this is not always possible (e.g., it may be unethical). As an alternative, we
can use non-experimental data to learn models that make counterfactual
predictions of what we would observe had we run an experiment. To learn such
models for decision-making problems, we propose the use of counterfactual
objectives in lieu of classical supervised learning objectives. We implement
this idea in a challenging and frequently occurring context, and propose the
counterfactual GP (CGP), a counterfactual model of continuous-time trajectories
(time series) under sequences of actions taken in continuous-time. We develop
our model within the potential outcomes framework of Neyman and Rubin. The
counterfactual GP is trained using a joint maximum likelihood objective that
adjusts for dependencies between observed actions and outcomes in the training
data. We report two sets of experimental results. First, we show that the CGP's
predictions are reliable; they are stable to changes in certain characteristics
of the training data that are not relevant to the decision-making problem.
Predictive models trained using classical supervised learning objectives,
however, are not stable to such perturbations. In the second experiment, we use
data from a real intensive care unit (ICU) and qualitatively demonstrate how
the CGP's ability to answer &quot;What if?&quot; questions offers medical decision-makers
a powerful new tool for planning treatment.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of implementing proportionate-type LMS
family of algorithms in hardware for sparse adaptive filtering applications
especially the network echo cancelation. We derive a re-formulated
proportionate type algorithm through algorithm-architecture co-design
methodology that can be pipelined and has an efficient architecture for
hardware implementation. We study the convergence, steady-state and tracking
performances of these re-formulated algorithms for white, color and speech
inputs before implementing them in hardware. To the best of our knowledge this
is the first attempt to implement proportionate-type algorithms in hardware. We
show that Delayed $\mu$-law Proportionate LMS (DMPLMS) algorithm for white
input and Delayed Wavelet MPLMS (DWMPLMS) for colored input are the robust VLSI
solutions for network echo cancellation where the sparsity of the echo paths
can vary with time. We implemented all the designs considering $16$-bit fixed
point representation in hardware, synthesized the designs and synthesis results
show that DMPLMS algorithm with $\approx25\%$ increase in hardware over
conventional DLMS architecture, achieves $3X$ improvement in convergence rate
for white input and DWMPLMS algorithm with $\approx58\%$ increase in hardware
achieves $15X$ improvement in convergence rate for correlated input conditions.

 <dc:description>  With an increasing number of users sharing information online, privacy
implications entailing such actions are a major concern. For explicit content,
such as user profile or GPS data, devices (e.g. mobile phones) as well as web
services (e.g. Facebook) offer to set privacy settings in order to enforce the
users' privacy preferences. We propose the first approach that extends this
concept to image content in the spirit of a Visual Privacy Advisor. First, we
categorize personal information in images into 68 image attributes and collect
a dataset, which allows us to train models that predict such information
directly from images. Second, we run a user study to understand the privacy
preferences of different users w.r.t. such attributes. Third, we propose models
that predict user specific privacy score from images in order to enforce the
users' privacy preferences. Our model is trained to predict the user specific
privacy risk and even outperforms the judgment of the users, who often fail to
follow their own privacy preferences on image data.

 <dc:description>  Bangla handwriting recognition is becoming a very important issue nowadays.
It is potentially a very important task specially for Bangla speaking
population of Bangladesh and West Bengal. By keeping that in our mind we are
introducing a comprehensive Bangla handwritten character dataset named
BanglaLekha-Isolated. This dataset contains Bangla handwritten numerals, basic
characters and compound characters. This dataset was collected from multiple
geographical location within Bangladesh and includes sample collected from a
variety of aged groups. This dataset can also be used for other classification
problems i.e: gender, age, district. This is the largest dataset on Bangla
handwritten characters yet.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for image
classification and object detection. However, the impact of deep learning on
video analysis (e.g. action detection and recognition) has been limited due to
complexity of video data and lack of annotations. Previous convolutional neural
networks (CNN) based video action detection approaches usually consist of two
major steps: frame-level action proposal detection and association of proposals
across frames. Also, these methods employ two-stream CNN framework to handle
spatial and temporal feature separately. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end deep network called Tube Convolutional Neural Network (T-CNN) for
action detection in videos. The proposed architecture is a unified network that
is able to recognize and localize action based on 3D convolution features. A
video is first divided into equal length clips and for each clip a set of tube
proposals are generated next based on 3D Convolutional Network (ConvNet)
features. Finally, the tube proposals of different clips are linked together
employing network flow and spatio-temporal action detection is performed using
these linked video proposals. Extensive experiments on several video datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of T-CNN for classifying and localizing
actions in both trimmed and untrimmed videos compared to state-of-the-arts.

  Interference Power for Both Uplink and Downlink Power Savings</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a multiuser full-duplex (FD) wireless communication
system, where a FD radio base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna
half-duplex (HD) uplink and downlink users simultaneously. Unlike conventional
interference mitigation approaches, we propose to use the knowledge of the data
symbols and the channel state information (CSI) at the FD radio BS to exploit
the multi-user interference constructively rather than to suppress it. We
propose a multi-objective optimisation problem (MOOP) via the weighted
Tchebycheff method to study the trade-off between the two desirable system
design objectives namely the total downlink transmit power minimisation and the
total uplink transmit power minimisation problems at the same time ensuring the
required quality-of-service (QoS) for all users. In the proposed MOOP, we adapt
the QoS constraints for the downlink users to accommodate constructive
interference (CI) for both generic phase shift keying (PSK) modulated signals
as well as for quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) signals. We also extended
our work to a robust design to study the system with imperfect uplink, downlink
and self-interference CSI. Simulation results and analysis show that,
significant power savings can be obtained. More importantly, however, the MOOP
approach here allows for the power saved to be traded off for both uplink and
downlink power savings, leading to an overall energy efficiency improvement in
the wireless link.

 <dc:description>  Recent two-stream deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have made
significant progress in recognizing human actions in videos. Despite their
success, methods extending the basic two-stream ConvNet have not systematically
explored possible network architectures to further exploit spatiotemporal
dynamics within video sequences. Further, such networks often use different
baseline two-stream networks. Therefore, the differences and the distinguishing
factors between various methods using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or
convolutional networks on temporally-constructed feature vectors
(Temporal-ConvNet) are unclear. In this work, we first demonstrate a strong
baseline two-stream ConvNet using ResNet-101. We use this baseline to
thoroughly examine the use of both RNNs and Temporal-ConvNets for extracting
spatiotemporal information. Building upon our experimental results, we then
propose and investigate two different networks to further integrate
spatiotemporal information: 1) temporal segment RNN and 2) Inception-style
Temporal-ConvNet. We demonstrate that using both RNNs (using LSTMs) and
Temporal-ConvNets on spatiotemporal feature matrices are able to exploit
spatiotemporal dynamics to improve the overall performance. However, each of
these methods require proper care to achieve state-of-the-art performance; for
example, LSTMs require pre-segmented data or else they cannot fully exploit
temporal information. Our analysis identifies specific limitations for each
method that could form the basis of future work. Our experimental results on
UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performances, 94.1% and
69.0%, respectively, without requiring extensive temporal augmentation.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by runtime verification of QoS requirements in self-adaptive and
self-organizing systems that are able to reconfigure their structure and
behavior in response to runtime data, we propose a QoS-aware variant of
Thompson sampling for multi-armed bandits. It is applicable in settings where
QoS satisfaction of an arm has to be ensured with high confidence efficiently,
rather than finding the optimal arm while minimizing regret. Preliminary
experimental results encourage further research in the field of QoS-aware
decision making.

 <dc:title>Learning and Trust in Auction Markets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study behavior of bidders in an experimental launch of a
new advertising auction platform by Zillow, as Zillow switched from negotiated
contracts to using auctions in several geographically isolated markets. A
unique feature of this experiment is that the bidders in this market are real
estate agents that bid on their own behalf, not using third-party
intermediaries. To help bidders, Zillow also provided a recommendation tool
that suggested a bid for each bidder.
  Our main focus in this paper is on the decisions of bidders whether or not to
adopt the platform-provided bid recommendation. We observe that a significant
proportion of bidders do not use the recommended bid. Using the bid history of
the agents we infer their value, and compare the agents' regret with their
actual bidding history with results they would have obtained following the
recommendation. We find that for half of the agents not following the
recommendation, the increased effort of experimenting with alternate bids
results in increased regret, i.e., they get decreased net value out of the
system. The proportion of agents not following the recommendation slowly
declines as markets mature, but it remains large in most markets that we
observe. We argue that the main reason for this phenomenon is the lack of trust
in the platform-provided tool.
  Our work provides an empirical insight into possible design choices for
auction-based online advertising platforms. While search advertising platforms
(such as Google or Bing) allow bidders to submit bids on their own, many
display advertising platforms (such as Facebook) optimize bids on bidders'
behalf and eliminate the need for bids. Our empirical analysis shows that the
latter approach is preferred for markets where bidders are individuals, who
don't have access to third party tools, and who may question the fairness of
platform-provided suggestions.

 <dc:description>  User Interfaces (UIs) intensively rely on event-driven programming: widgets
send UI events, which capture users' interactions, to dedicated objects called
controllers. Controllers use several UI listeners that handle these events to
produce UI commands. First, we reveal the presence of design smells in the code
that describes and controls UIs. Second, we demonstrate that specific code
analyses are necessary to analyze and refactor UI code, because of its coupling
with the rest of the code. We conducted an empirical study on four large Java
Swing and SWT open-source software systems. We study to what extent the number
of UI commands that a UI listener can produce has an impact on the change- and
fault-proneness of the UI listener code. We develop a static code analysis for
detecting UI commands in the code. We identify a new type of design smell,
called Blob Listener that characterizes UI listeners that can produce more than
two UI commands. We propose a systematic static code analysis procedure that
searches for Blob Listeners that we implement in InspectorGuidget. We conducted
experiments on the four software systems for which we manually identified 53
instances of Blob Listener. InspectorGuidget successfully detected 52 Blob
Listeners out of 53. The results exhibit a precision of 81.25% and a recall of
98.11%. We then developed a semi-automatically and behavior-preserving
refactoring process to remove Blob Listeners. 49.06% of the 53 Blob Listeners
were automatically refactored. Patches for JabRef, and FreeCol have been
accepted and merged. Discussions with developers of the four software systems
assess the relevance of the Blob Listener. This work shows that UI code also
suffers from design smells that have to be identified and characterized. We
argue that studies have to be conducted to find other UI design smells and
tools that analyze UI code must be developed.

 <dc:description>  Traditional manifold learning algorithms often bear an assumption that the
local neighborhood of any point on embedded manifold is roughly equal to the
tangent space at that point without considering the curvature. The curvature
indifferent way of manifold processing often makes traditional dimension
reduction poorly neighborhood preserving. To overcome this drawback we propose
a new algorithm called RF-ML to perform an operation on the manifold with help
of Ricci flow before reducing the dimension of manifold.

 <dc:title>Set Matching: An Enhancement of the Hales-Jewett Pairing Strategy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  When solving k-in-a-Row games, the Hales-Jewett pairing strategy [4] is a
well-known strategy to prove that specific positions are (at most) a draw. It
requires two empty squares per possible winning line (group) to be marked,
i.e., with a coverage ratio of 2.0. In this paper we present a new strategy,
called Set Matching. A matching set consists of a set of nodes (the markers), a
set of possible winning lines (the groups), and a coverage set indicating how
all groups are covered after every first initial move. This strategy needs less
than two markers per group. As such it is able to prove positions in k-in-a-Row
games to be draws, which cannot be proven using the Hales-Jewett pairing
strategy. We show several efficient configurations with their matching sets.
These include Cycle Configurations, BiCycle Configurations, and PolyCycle
Configurations involving more than two cycles. Depending on configuration, the
coverage ratio can be reduced to 1.14. Many examples in the domain of solving
k-in-a-Row games are given, including the direct proof (without further
investigation) that the empty 4 x 4 board is a draw for 4-in-a-Row.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that the complex system operation requires the use of new
scientific tools and computer simulation. This paper presents a modular
approach for modeling and analysis of the complex systems (in communication or
transport systems area) using Hybrid Petri nets. The performance evaluation of
the hybrid model is made by a simulation methodology that allows building up
various functioning scenarios. A Decision Support System based on the above
mentioned methodologies of modeling and analysis will be designed for
performance evaluation and time optimization of large scale communication

 <dc:title>Simple and Efficient Budget Feasible Mechanisms for Monotone Submodular
  Valuations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jalaly, Pooya</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tardos, Eva</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of a budget limited buyer who wants to buy a set of
items, each from a different seller, to maximize her value. The budget feasible
mechanism design problem aims to design a mechanism which incentivizes the
sellers to truthfully report their cost, and maximizes the buyer's value while
guaranteeing that the total payment does not exceed her budget. Such budget
feasible mechanisms can model a buyer in a crowdsourcing market interested in
recruiting a set of workers (sellers) to accomplish a task for her.
  This budget feasible mechanism design problem was introduced by Singer in
2010. There have been a number of improvements on the approximation guarantee
of such mechanisms since then. We consider the general case where the buyer's
valuation is a monotone submodular function. We offer two general frameworks
for simple mechanisms, and by combining these frameworks, we significantly
improve on the best known results for this problem, while also simplifying the
analysis. For example, we improve the approximation guarantee for the general
monotone submodular case from 7.91 to 5; and for the case of large markets
(where each individual item has negligible value) from 3 to 2.58. More
generally, given an $r$ approximation algorithm for the optimization problem
(ignoring incentives), our mechanism is a $r+1$ approximation mechanism for
large markets, an improvement from $2r^2$. We also provide a similar
parameterized mechanism without the large market assumption, where we achieve a
$4r+1$ approximation guarantee.

 <dc:title>Computing Equilibrium in Matching Markets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Market equilibria of matching markets offer an intuitive and fair solution
for matching problems without money with agents who have preferences over the
items. Such a matching market can be viewed as a variation of Fisher market,
albeit with rather peculiar preferences of agents. These preferences can be
described by piece-wise linear concave (PLC) functions, which however, are not
separable (due to each agent only asking for one item), are not monotone, and
do not satisfy the gross substitute property-- increase in price of an item can
result in increased demand for the item. Devanur and Kannan in FOCS 08 showed
that market clearing prices can be found in polynomial time in markets with
fixed number of items and general PLC preferences. They also consider Fischer
markets with fixed number of agents (instead of fixed number of items), and
give a polynomial time algorithm for this case if preferences are separable
functions of the items, in addition to being PLC functions.
  Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm for finding market clearing
prices in matching markets with fixed number of different agent preferences,
despite that the utility corresponding to matching markets is not separable. We
also give a simpler algorithm for the case of matching markets with fixed
number of different items.

 <dc:title>Knowledge Rich Natural Language Queries over Structured Biological
  Databases</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jamil, Hasan M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Increasingly, keyword, natural language and NoSQL queries are being used for
information retrieval from traditional as well as non-traditional databases
such as web, document, image, GIS, legal, and health databases. While their
popularity are undeniable for obvious reasons, their engineering is far from
simple. In most part, semantics and intent preserving mapping of a well
understood natural language query expressed over a structured database schema
to a structured query language is still a difficult task, and research to tame
the complexity is intense. In this paper, we propose a multi-level
knowledge-based middleware to facilitate such mappings that separate the
conceptual level from the physical level. We augment these multi-level
abstractions with a concept reasoner and a query strategy engine to dynamically
link arbitrary natural language querying to well defined structured queries. We
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by presenting a Datalog based
prototype system, called BioSmart, that can compute responses to arbitrary
natural language queries over arbitrary databases once a syntactic
classification of the natural language query is made.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a decode-and-forward (DF) multi-way massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay system where many users exchange
their data with the aid of a relay station equipped with a massive antenna
array. We propose a new transmission protocol which leverages successive
cancelation decoding and zero-forcing (ZF) at the users. By using properties of
massive MIMO, a tight analytical approximation of the spectral efficiency is
derived. We show that our proposed scheme uses only half of the time-slots
required in the conventional scheme (in which the number of time-slots is equal
to the number of users [1]), to exchange data across different users. As a
result, the sum spectral efficiency of our proposed scheme is nearly double the
one of the conventional scheme, thereby boosting the performance of multi-way
massive MIMO to unprecedented levels.

 <dc:description>  Here we test Neutral models against the evolution of English word frequency
and vocabulary at the population scale, as recorded in annual word frequencies
from three centuries of English language books. Against these data, we test
both static and dynamic predictions of two neutral models, including the
relation between corpus size and vocabulary size, frequency distributions, and
turnover within those frequency distributions. Although a commonly used Neutral
model fails to replicate all these emergent properties at once, we find that
modified two-stage Neutral model does replicate the static and dynamic
properties of the corpus data. This two-stage model is meant to represent a
relatively small corpus (population) of English books, analogous to a `canon',
sampled by an exponentially increasing corpus of books in the wider population
of authors. More broadly, this mode -- a smaller neutral model within a larger
neutral model -- could represent more broadly those situations where mass
attention is focused on a small subset of the cultural variants.

 <dc:description>  Real-time instrument tracking is a crucial requirement for various
computer-assisted interventions. In order to overcome problems such as specular
reflections and motion blur, we propose a novel method that takes advantage of
the interdependency between localization and segmentation of the surgical tool.
In particular, we reformulate the 2D instrument pose estimation as heatmap
regression and thereby enable a concurrent, robust and near real-time
regression of both tasks via deep learning. As demonstrated by our experimental
results, this modeling leads to a significantly improved performance than
directly regressing the tool position and allows our method to outperform the
state of the art on a Retinal Microsurgery benchmark and the MICCAI EndoVis
Challenge 2015.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel 3D face recognition algorithm using a deep convolutional
neural network (DCNN) and a 3D augmentation technique. The performance of 2D
face recognition algorithms has significantly increased by leveraging the
representational power of deep neural networks and the use of large-scale
labeled training data. As opposed to 2D face recognition, training
discriminative deep features for 3D face recognition is very difficult due to
the lack of large-scale 3D face datasets. In this paper, we show that transfer
learning from a CNN trained on 2D face images can effectively work for 3D face
recognition by fine-tuning the CNN with a relatively small number of 3D facial
scans. We also propose a 3D face augmentation technique which synthesizes a
number of different facial expressions from a single 3D face scan. Our proposed
method shows excellent recognition results on Bosphorus, BU-3DFE, and 3D-TEC
datasets, without using hand-crafted features. The 3D identification using our
deep features also scales well for large databases.

Additionally, it provides a new approximate convergence measure, fast and

generation task, setting a new milestone in visual quality, even at higher

 <dc:description>  Emerging device centric systems (DCS) such as device-to-device (D2D)
communications are considered as a standard part of future mobile networks,
where operators/consumers involve the devices in direct communication to
improve the cellular system throughput, latency, fairness, and energy
efficiency. However, battery life of mobile devices involved in such
communications is crucial for 5G smartphone users to explore the emerging
applications in DCS. It is anticipated that the owners of 5G-enabled
smartphones use their devices more extensively to talk, text, email, and surf
the Web more often than do customers with 4G smartphones or traditional
handsets, which puts a significantly higher demand on the battery life.
Smartphones are currently equipped with multiple radio interfaces that enable
them to access different types of wireless networks including LTE-direct and
Wi-Fi-direct, besides cellular networks. Such a capability is not well explored
within the context of DCS. This article proposes a new scheme to support the
emerging features in DCS where a D2D-enabled mobile device (sink device or a
file/content requester) aggregates the radio resources of multiple mobile
devices (source devices or file/content providers) via its multiple radio
interfaces such that the scheme is referred to as devices-to-device (Ds2D)
communications. Ds2D communication scheme ensures an optimal packet split among
the source mobile devices to improve the file/content transfer latency (FTL),
energy efficiency, and battery life. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed optimal packet split scheme among multiple source devices
participating in Ds2D communication scheme guarantees an improvement in mobile
battery life over wide range of data rate levels in comparison with the random
packet split strategy and traditional D2D communication paradigm between the
sink and source mobile devices.

 <dc:description>  We present two simple ways of reducing the number of parameters and
accelerating the training of large Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks: the
first one is &quot;matrix factorization by design&quot; of LSTM matrix into the product
of two smaller matrices, and the second one is partitioning of LSTM matrix, its
inputs and states into the independent groups. Both approaches allow us to
train large LSTM networks significantly faster to the state-of the art
perplexity. On the One Billion Word Benchmark we improve single model
perplexity down to 23.36.

 <dc:title>N-gram Language Modeling using Recurrent Neural Network Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We investigate the effective memory depth of RNN models by using them for
$n$-gram language model (LM) smoothing.
  Experiments on a small corpus (UPenn Treebank, one million words of training
data and 10k vocabulary) have found the LSTM cell with dropout to be the best
model for encoding the $n$-gram state when compared with feed-forward and
vanilla RNN models. When preserving the sentence independence assumption the
LSTM $n$-gram matches the LSTM LM performance for $n=9$ and slightly
outperforms it for $n=13$. When allowing dependencies across sentence
boundaries, the LSTM $13$-gram almost matches the perplexity of the unlimited
history LSTM LM.
  LSTM $n$-gram smoothing also has the desirable property of improving with
increasing $n$-gram order, unlike the Katz or Kneser-Ney back-off estimators.
Using multinomial distributions as targets in training instead of the usual
one-hot target is only slightly beneficial for low $n$-gram orders.
  Experiments on the One Billion Words benchmark show that the results hold at
larger scale: while LSTM smoothing for short $n$-gram contexts does not provide
significant advantages over classic N-gram models, it becomes effective with
long contexts ($n &gt; 5$); depending on the task and amount of data it can match
fully recurrent LSTM models at about $n=13$. This may have implications when
modeling short-format text, e.g. voice search/query LMs.
  Building LSTM $n$-gram LMs may be appealing for some practical situations:
the state in a $n$-gram LM can be succinctly represented with $(n-1)*4$ bytes
storing the identity of the words in the context and batches of $n$-gram
contexts can be processed in parallel. On the downside, the $n$-gram context
encoding computed by the LSTM is discarded, making the model more expensive
than a regular recurrent LSTM LM.

 <dc:description>  The Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a promising hardware security
primitive because of its inherent uniqueness and low cost. To extract the
device-specific variation from delay-based strong PUFs, complex routing
constraints are imposed to achieve symmetric path delays; and systematic
variations can severely compromise the uniqueness of the PUF. In addition, the
metastability of the arbiter circuit of an Arbiter PUF can also degrade the
quality of the PUF due to the induced instability. In this paper we propose a
novel strong UNBIAS PUF that can be implemented purely by Register Transfer
Language (RTL), such as verilog, without imposing any physical design
constraints or delay characterization effort to solve the aforementioned
issues. Efficient inspection bit prediction models for unbiased response
extraction are proposed and validated. Our experimental results of the strong
UNBIAS PUF show 5.9% intra-Fractional Hamming Distance (FHD) and 45.1%
inter-FHD on 7 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) boards without applying any
physical layout constraints or additional XOR gates. The UNBIAS PUF is also
scalable because no characterization cost is required for each challenge to
compensate the implementation bias. The averaged intra-FHD measured at worst
temperature and voltage variation conditions is 12%, which is still below the
margin of practical Error Correction Code (ECC) with error reduction techniques
for PUFs.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a deep domain adaptation based method for video smoke
detection is proposed to extract a powerful feature representation of smoke.
Due to the smoke image samples limited in scale and diversity for deep CNN
training, we systematically produced adequate synthetic smoke images with a
wide variation in the smoke shape, background and lighting conditions.
Considering that the appearance gap (dataset bias) between synthetic and real
smoke images degrades significantly the performance of the trained model on the
test set composed fully of real images, we build deep architectures based on
domain adaptation to confuse the distributions of features extracted from
synthetic and real smoke images. This approach expands the domain-invariant
feature space for smoke image samples. With their approximate feature
distribution off non-smoke images, the recognition rate of the trained model is
improved significantly compared to the model trained directly on mixed dataset
of synthetic and real images. Experimentally, several deep architectures with
different design choices are applied to the smoke detector. The ultimate
framework can get a satisfactory result on the test set. We believe that our
approach is a start in the direction of utilizing deep neural networks enhanced
with synthetic smoke images for video smoke detection.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new problem of generating an image based on a small number of
key local patches without any geometric prior. In this work, key local patches
are defined as informative regions of the target object or scene. This is a
challenging problem since it requires generating realistic images and
predicting locations of parts at the same time. We construct adversarial
networks to tackle this problem. A generator network generates a fake image as
well as a mask based on the encoder-decoder framework. On the other hand, a
discriminator network aims to detect fake images. The network is trained with
three losses to consider spatial, appearance, and adversarial information. The
spatial loss determines whether the locations of predicted parts are correct.
Input patches are restored in the output image without much modification due to
the appearance loss. The adversarial loss ensures output images are realistic.
The proposed network is trained without supervisory signals since no labels of
key parts are required. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm performs favorably on challenging objects and scenes.

 <dc:description>  Recently Avis and Jordan have demonstrated the efficiency of a simple
technique called budgeting for the parallelization of a number of tree search
algorithms. The idea is to limit the amount of work that a processor performs
before it terminates its search and returns any unexplored nodes to a master
process. This limit is set by a critical budget parameter which determines the
overhead of the process. In this paper we study the behaviour of the budget
parameter on conditional Galton-Watson trees obtaining asymptotically tight
bounds on this overhead. We present empirical results to show that this bound
is surprisingly accurate in practice.

 <dc:description>  Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which utilize a large
number of antennas at the base station, are expected to enhance network
throughput by enabling improved multiuser MIMO techniques. To deploy many
antennas in reasonable form factors, base stations are expected to employ
antenna arrays in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, which is known as
full-dimension (FD) MIMO. The most popular two-dimensional array is the uniform
planar array (UPA), where antennas are placed in a grid pattern. To exploit the
full benefit of massive MIMO in frequency division duplexing (FDD), the
downlink channel state information (CSI) should be estimated, quantized, and
fed back from the receiver to the transmitter. However, it is difficult to
accurately quantize the channel in a computationally efficient manner due to
the high dimensionality of the massive MIMO channel. In this paper, we develop
both narrowband and wideband CSI quantizers for FD-MIMO taking the properties
of realistic channels and the UPA into consideration. To improve quantization
quality, we focus on not only quantizing dominant radio paths in the channel,
but also combining the quantized beams. We also develop a hierarchical beam
search approach, which scans both vertical and horizontal domains jointly with
moderate computational complexity. Numerical simulations verify that the
performance of the proposed quantizers is better than that of previous CSI
quantization techniques.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of low canonical polyadic (CP) rank tensor
completion. A completion is a tensor whose entries agree with the observed
entries and its rank matches the given CP rank. We analyze the manifold
structure corresponding to the tensors with the given rank and define a set of
polynomials based on the sampling pattern and CP decomposition. Then, we show
that finite completability of the sampled tensor is equivalent to having a
certain number of algebraically independent polynomials among the defined
polynomials. Our proposed approach results in characterizing the maximum number
of algebraically independent polynomials in terms of a simple geometric
structure of the sampling pattern, and therefore we obtain the deterministic
necessary and sufficient condition on the sampling pattern for finite
completability of the sampled tensor. Moreover, assuming that the entries of
the tensor are sampled independently with probability $p$ and using the
mentioned deterministic analysis, we propose a combinatorial method to derive a
lower bound on the sampling probability $p$, or equivalently, the number of
sampled entries that guarantees finite completability with high probability. We
also show that the existing result for the matrix completion problem can be
used to obtain a loose lower bound on the sampling probability $p$. In
addition, we obtain deterministic and probabilistic conditions for unique
completability. It is seen that the number of samples required for finite or
unique completability obtained by the proposed analysis on the CP manifold is
orders-of-magnitude lower than that is obtained by the existing analysis on the
Grassmannian manifold.

 <dc:description>  Time-triggered and event-triggered control strategies for stabilization of an
unstable plant over a rate-limited communication channel subject to unknown,
bounded delay are studied and compared. Event triggering carries implicit
information, revealing the state of the plant. However, the delay in the
communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state
information out of date. There is a critical delay value, when the loss of
information due to the communication delay perfectly compensates the implicit
information carried by the triggering events. This occurs when the maximum
delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant. In this context,
extensions of our previous results for event triggering strategies are
presented for vector systems and are compared with the data-rate theorem for
time-triggered control, that is extended here to a setting with unknown delay.

 <dc:description>  As the explosive growth of smart devices and the advent of many new
applications, traffic volume has been growing exponentially. The traditional
centralized network architecture cannot accommodate such user demands due to
heavy burden on the backhaul links and long latency. Therefore, new
architectures which bring network functions and contents to the network edge
are proposed, i.e., mobile edge computing and caching. Mobile edge networks
provide cloud computing and caching capabilities at the edge of cellular
networks. In this survey, we make an exhaustive review on the state-of-the-art
research efforts on mobile edge networks. We first give an overview of mobile
edge networks including definition, architecture and advantages. Next, a
comprehensive survey of issues on computing, caching and communication
techniques at the network edge is presented respectively. The applications and
use cases of mobile edge networks are discussed. Subsequently, the key enablers
of mobile edge networks such as cloud technology, SDN/NFV and smart devices are
discussed. Finally, open research challenges and future directions are
presented as well.

 <dc:title>On Self-Adaptive Mutation Restarts for Evolutionary Robotics with Real
  Rotorcraft</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Self-adaptive parameters are increasingly used in the field of Evolutionary
Robotics, as they allow key evolutionary rates to vary autonomously in a
context-sensitive manner throughout the optimisation process. A significant
limitation to self-adaptive mutation is that rates can be set unfavourably,
which hinders convergence. Rate restarts are typically employed to remedy this,
but thus far have only been applied in Evolutionary Robotics for mutation-only
algorithms. This paper focuses on the level at which evolutionary rate restarts
are applied in population-based algorithms with more than 1 evolutionary
operator. After testing on a real hexacopter hovering task, we conclude that
individual-level restarting results in higher fitness solutions without fitness
stagnation, and population restarts provide a more stable rate evolution.
Without restarts, experiments can become stuck in suboptimal controller/rate
combinations which can be difficult to escape from.

 <dc:title>Novel Framework for Spectral Clustering using Topological Node
  Features(TNF)</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spectral clustering has gained importance in recent years due to its ability
to cluster complex data as it requires only pairwise similarity among data
points with its ease of implementation. The central point in spectral
clustering is the process of capturing pair-wise similarity. In the literature,
many research techniques have been proposed for effective construction of
affinity matrix with suitable pair- wise similarity. In this paper a general
framework for capturing pairwise affinity using local features such as density,
proximity and structural similarity is been proposed. Topological Node Features
are exploited to define the notion of density and local structure. These local
features are incorporated into the construction of the affinity matrix.
Experimental results, on widely used datasets such as synthetic shape datasets,
UCI real datasets and MNIST handwritten datasets show that the proposed
framework outperforms standard spectral clustering methods.

 <dc:title>Diabetic Retinopathy Detection via Deep Convolutional Networks for
  Discriminative Localization and Visual Explanation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We proposed a deep learning method for interpretable diabetic retinopathy
(DR) detection. The visual-interpretable feature of the proposed method is
achieved by adding the regression activation map (RAM) after the global
averaging pooling layer of the convolutional networks (CNN). With RAM, the
proposed model can localize the discriminative regions of an retina image to
show the specific region of interest in terms of its severity level. We believe
this advantage of the proposed deep learning model is highly desired for DR
detection because in practice, users are not only interested with high
prediction performance, but also keen to understand the insights of DR
detection and why the adopted learning model works. In the experiments
conducted on a large scale of retina image dataset, we show that the proposed
CNN model can achieve high performance on DR detection compared with the
state-of-the-art while achieving the merits of providing the RAM to highlight
the salient regions of the input image.

 <dc:title>On cyclic codes of composite length and the minimal distance</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>94B15, 94B65</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In an interesting paper Professor Cunsheng Ding provided three constructions
of cyclic codes of length being a product of two primes. Numerical data shows
that many codes from these constructions are best cyclic codes of the same
length and dimension over the same finite field. However, not much is known
about these codes. In this paper we explain some of the mysteries of the
numerical data by developing a general method on cyclic codes of composite
length and on estimating the minimal distance. Inspired by the new method, we
also provide a general construction of cyclic codes of composite length.
Numerical data shows that it produces many best cyclic codes as well. Finally,
we point out how these cyclic codes can be used to construct convolutional
codes with large free distance.

 <dc:description>  Global optimization algorithms have shown impressive performance in
data-association based multi-object tracking, but handling online data remains
a difficult hurdle to overcome. In this paper, we present a hybrid data
association framework with a min-cost multi-commodity network flow for robust
online multi-object tracking. We build local target-specific models interleaved
with global optimization of the optimal data association over multiple video
frames. More specifically, in the min-cost multi-commodity network flow, the
target-specific similarities are online learned to enforce the local
consistency for reducing the complexity of the global data association.
Meanwhile, the global data association taking multiple video frames into
account alleviates irrecoverable errors caused by the local data association
between adjacent frames. To ensure the efficiency of online tracking, we give
an efficient near-optimal solution to the proposed min-cost multi-commodity
flow problem, and provide the empirical proof of its sub-optimality. The
comprehensive experiments on real data demonstrate the superior tracking
performance of our approach in various challenging situations.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present measurement results for pure line-of-sight MIMO

condition numbers and capacities of the measured channels are in good agreement
with the theory for various transmission distances and antenna setups.
Furthermore, the results show that orthogonal channel vectors can be observed
if the spacing criterion is fulfilled, thus facilitating spatial multiplexing
and achieving high spectral efficiencies even over fairly long distances.
Spacings generating ill-conditioned channel matrices show on the other hand
significantly reduced performance.

 <dc:description>  Caching popular contents at the edge of cellular networks has been proposed
to reduce the load, and hence the cost of backhaul links. It is significant to
decide which files should be cached and where to cache them. In this paper, we
propose a distributed caching scheme considering the tradeoff between the
diversity and redundancy of base stations' cached contents. Whether it is
better to cache the same or different contents in different base stations? To
find out this, we formulate an optimal redundancy caching problem. Our goal is
to minimize the total transmission cost of the network, including cost within
the radio access network (RAN) and cost incurred by transmission to the core
network via backhaul links. The optimal redundancy ratio under given system
configuration is obtained with adapted particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm. We analyze the impact of important system parameters through
Monte-Carlo simulation. Results show that the optimal redundancy ratio is
mainly influenced by two parameters, which are the backhaul to RAN unit cost
ratio and the steepness of file popularity distribution. The total cost can be
reduced by up to 54% at given unit cost ratio of backhaul to RAN when the
optimal redundancy ratio is selected. Under typical file request pattern, the
reduction amount can be up to 57%.

 <dc:description>  We present a system for converting a fully panoramic ($360^\circ$) video into
a normal field-of-view (NFOV) hyperlapse for an optimal viewing experience. Our
system exploits visual saliency and semantics to non-uniformly sample in space
and time for generating hyperlapses. In addition, users can optionally choose
objects of interest for customizing the hyperlapses. We first stabilize an
input $360^\circ$ video by smoothing the rotation between adjacent frames and
then compute regions of interest and saliency scores. An initial hyperlapse is
generated by optimizing the saliency and motion smoothness followed by the
saliency-aware frame selection. We further smooth the result using an efficient
2D video stabilization approach that adaptively selects the motion model to
generate the final hyperlapse. We validate the design of our system by showing
results for a variety of scenes and comparing against the state-of-the-art
method through a user study.

 <dc:description>  The volume and types of traffic data in mobile cellular networks have been
increasing continuously. Meanwhile, traffic data change dynamically in several
dimensions such as time and space. Thus, traffic modeling is essential for
theoretical analysis and energy efficient design of future ultra-dense cellular
networks. In this paper, the authors try to build a tractable and accurate
model to describe the traffic variation pattern for a single base station in
real cellular networks. Firstly a sinusoid superposition model is proposed for
describing the temporal traffic variation of multiple base stations based on
real data in a current cellular network. It shows that the mean traffic volume
of many base stations in an area changes periodically and has three main
frequency components. Then, lognormal distribution is verified for spatial
modeling of real traffic data. The spatial traffic distributions at both spare
time and busy time are analyzed. Moreover, the parameters of the model are
presented in three typical regions: park, campus and central business district.
Finally, an approach for combined spatial-temporal traffic modeling of single
base station is proposed based on the temporal and spatial traffic distribution
of multiple base stations. All the three models are evaluated through
comparison with real data in current cellular networks. The results show that
these models can accurately describe the variation pattern of real traffic data
in cellular networks.

 <dc:description>  Communication in teams is an important but difficult issue. In a Scrum
development process, we use the Daily Scrum meetings to inform others about
important problems, news and events in the project. When persons are absent due
to holiday, illness or travel, they miss relevant information because there is
no document that protocols the content of these meetings. We present a concept
and a Twitter-like tool that improves communication in a Scrum development
process. We take advantage out of the observation that many people do not like
to create documentation but they do like to share what they did. We used the
tool in industrial practice and observed an improvement in communication.

 <dc:description>  Plenty of face detection and recognition methods have been proposed and got
delightful results in decades. Common face recognition pipeline consists of: 1)
face detection, 2) face alignment, 3) feature extraction, 4) similarity
calculation, which are separated and independent from each other. The separated
face analyzing stages lead the model redundant calculation and are hard for
end-to-end training. In this paper, we proposed a novel end-to-end trainable
convolutional network framework for face detection and recognition, in which a
geometric transformation matrix was directly learned to align the faces,
instead of predicting the facial landmarks. In training stage, our single CNN
model is supervised only by face bounding boxes and personal identities, which
are publicly available from WIDER FACE \cite{Yang2016} dataset and
CASIA-WebFace \cite{Yi2014} dataset. Tested on Face Detection Dataset and
Benchmark (FDDB) \cite{Jain2010} dataset and Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW)
\cite{Huang2007} dataset, we have achieved 89.24\% recall for face detection
task and 98.63\% verification accuracy for face recognition task
simultaneously, which are comparable to state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  In this article we study the treewidth of the \emph{display graph}, an
auxiliary graph structure obtained from the fusion of phylogenetic (i.e.,
evolutionary) trees at their leaves. Earlier work has shown that the treewidth
of the display graph is bounded if the trees are in some formal sense
topologically similar. Here we further expand upon this relationship. We
analyse a number of reduction rules which are commonly used in the
phylogenetics literature to obtain fixed parameter tractable algorithms. In
some cases (the \emph{subtree} reduction) the reduction rules behave similarly
with respect to treewidth, while others (the \emph{cluster} reduction) behave
very differently, and the behaviour of the \emph{chain reduction} is
particularly intriguing because of its link with graph separators and forbidden
minors. We also show that the gap between treewidth and Tree Bisection and
Reconnect (TBR) distance can be infinitely large, and that unlike, for example,
planar graphs the treewidth of the display graph can be as much as linear in
its number of vertices. On a slightly different note we show that if a display
graph is formed from the fusion of a phylogenetic network and a tree, rather
than from two trees, the treewidth of the display graph is bounded whenever the
tree can be topologically embedded (&quot;displayed&quot;) within the network. This opens
the door to the formulation of the display problem in Monadic Second Order
Logic (MSOL). A number of other auxiliary results are given. We conclude with a
discussion and list a number of open problems.

 <dc:description>  Most existing neural network models for music generation use recurrent neural
networks. However, the recent WaveNet model proposed by DeepMind shows that
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can also generate realistic musical
waveforms in the audio domain. Following this light, we investigate using CNNs
for generating melody (a series of MIDI notes) one bar after another in the
symbolic domain. In addition to the generator, we use a discriminator to learn
the distributions of melodies, making it a generative adversarial network
(GAN). Moreover, we propose a novel conditional mechanism to exploit available
prior knowledge, so that the model can generate melodies either from scratch,
by following a chord sequence, or by conditioning on the melody of previous
bars (e.g. a priming melody), among other possibilities. The resulting model,
named MidiNet, can be expanded to generate music with multiple MIDI channels
(i.e. tracks). We conduct a user study to compare the melody of eight-bar long
generated by MidiNet and by Google's MelodyRNN models, each time using the same
priming melody. Result shows that MidiNet performs comparably with MelodyRNN
models in being realistic and pleasant to listen to, yet MidiNet's melodies are
reported to be much more interesting.

 <dc:title>Profunctor Optics: Modular Data Accessors</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  CONTEXT: Data accessors allow one to read and write components of a data
structure, such as the fields of a record, the variants of a union, or the
elements of a container. These data accessors are collectively known as optics;
they are fundamental to programs that manipulate complex data. INQUIRY:
Individual data accessors for simple data structures are easy to write, for
example as pairs of &quot;getter&quot; and &quot;setter&quot; methods. However, it is not obvious
how to combine data accessors, in such a way that data accessors for a compound
data structure are composed out of smaller data accessors for the parts of that
structure. Generally, one has to write a sequence of statements or declarations
that navigate step by step through the data structure, accessing one level at a
time - which is to say, data accessors are traditionally not first-class
citizens, combinable in their own right. APPROACH: We present a framework for
modular data access, in which individual data accessors for simple data
structures may be freely combined to obtain more complex data accessors for
compound data structures. Data accessors become first-class citizens. The
framework is based around the notion of profunctors, a flexible generalization
of functions. KNOWLEDGE: The language features required are higher-order
functions (&quot;lambdas&quot; or &quot;closures&quot;), parametrized types (&quot;generics&quot; or
&quot;abstract types&quot;), and some mechanism for separating interfaces from
implementations (&quot;abstract classes&quot; or &quot;modules&quot;). We use Haskell as a vehicle
in which to present our constructions, but languages such as Java, C#, or Scala
that provide the necessary features should work just as well. GROUNDING: We
provide implementations of all our constructions, in the form of a literate
program: the manuscript file for the paper is also the source code for the
program, and the extracted code is available separately for evaluation. We also
prove the essential properties demonstrating that our profunctor-based
representations are precisely equivalent to the more familiar concrete
representations. IMPORTANCE: Our results should pave the way to simpler ways of
writing programs that access the components of compound data structures.

 <dc:title>Language Oriented Modularity: From Theory to Practice</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Language-oriented modularity (LOM) is a methodology that complements
language-oriented programming (LOP) in providing on-demand language abstraction
solutions during software development. It involves the implementation and
immediate utilization of domain-specific languages (DSLs) that are also
aspect-oriented (DSALs). However, while DSL development is affordable thanks to
modern language workbenches, DSAL development lacks similar tool support.
Consequently, LOM is often impractical and underutilized. The challenge we
address is making the complexity of DSAL implementation comparable to that of
DSLs and the effectiveness of programming with DSALs comparable to that of
general-purpose aspect languages (GPALs). Today, despite being essentially both
domain-specific and aspect-oriented, DSALs seem to be second-class. Aspect
development tools (e.g., AJDT) do not work on DSAL code. DSL development tools
like language workbenches (e.g., Spoofax) neither deal with the backend weaving
nor handle the composition of DSALs. DSAL composition frameworks (e.g.,
Awesome) do not provide frontend development tools. DSAL code transformation
approaches (e.g., XAspects) do not preserve the semantics of DSAL programs in
the presence of other aspect languages. We extend AspectJ with a small set of
annotations and interfaces that allows DSAL designers to define a
semantic-preserving transformation to AspectJ and interface with AspectJ tools.
Our transformation approach enables the use of standard language workbench to
implement DSALs and use of standard aspect development tools to program with
those DSALs. As a result, DSALs regain first-class status with respect to both
DSLs and aspect languages. This, on the one hand, lowers the cost of developing
DSALs to the level of DSLs and, on the other hand, raises the effectiveness of
using a DSAL to the level of a GPAL. Consequently, LOM becomes cost-effective
compared to the LOP baseline. We modified the ajc compiler to support our
approach. Using two different language workbenches (Spoofax and Xtext) we then
implemented several DSALs. AspectJ was supported out-of-the-box. We implemented
Cool to demonstrate that the non-trivial composition of AspectJ and Cool can be
accommodated using our approach. We applied LOM to crosscutting concerns in two
open source projects (oVirt and muCommander), implementing in the process
application-specific DSALs, thus providing a sense of the decrease in the cost
of developing composable DSALs and the increase in the effectiveness of
programming with them. Crosscutting concerns remain a problem in modern
real-world projects (e.g., as observed in oVirt). DSALs are often the right
tool for addressing these concerns. Our work makes LOM practical, thus
facilitating use of DSAL solutions in the software development process.

 <dc:description>  Modern software development without reactive programming is hard to imagine.
Reactive programming favors a wide class of contemporary software systems that
respond to user input, network messages, and other events. While reactive
programming is an active field of research, the implementation of reactive
concepts remains challenging. In particular, change detection represents a hard
but inevitable necessity when implementing reactive concepts. Typically, change
detection mechanisms are not intended for reuse but are tightly coupled to the
particular change resolution mechanism. As a result, developers often have to
re-implement similar abstractions. A reusable primitive for change detection is
still missing. To find a suitable primitive, we identify commonalities in
existing reactive concepts. We discover a class of reactive concepts,
state-based reactive concepts. All state-based reactive concepts share a common
change detection mechanism: they detect changes in the evaluation result of an
expression. On the basis of the identified common change detection mechanism,
we propose active expressions as a reusable primitive. By abstracting the
tedious implementation details of change detection, active expressions can ease
the implementation of reactive programming concepts. We evaluate the design of
active expressions by re-implementing a number of existing state-based reactive
concepts using them. The resulting implementations highlight the expressiveness
of active expressions. Active expressions enable the separation of essential
from non-essential parts when reasoning about reactive programming concepts. By
using active expressions as a primitive for change detection, developers of
reactive language constructs and runtime support can now focus on the design of
how application programmers should be able to react to change. Ultimately, we
would like active expressions to encourage experiments with novel reactive
programming concepts and with that to yield a wider variety of them to explore.

 <dc:description>  The occurrence of similar code, or `code clones', can make program code
difficult to read, modify and maintain. This paper describes industrial case
studies of clone detection and elimination using a refactoring and clone
detection tool. We discuss how the studies have informed the design of the
tool; more importantly, we use the studies to illustrate the complex set of
decisions that have to be taken when performing clone elimination in practice.
The case studies were performed in collaboration with engineers from Ericsson
AB, and used the refactoring tool Wrangler for Erlang. However, the conclusions
we draw are largely language-independent, and set out the pragmatics of clone
detection and elimination in real-world projects as well as design principles
for clone detection decision-support tools.

 <dc:title>User-Defined Operators Including Name Binding for New Language
  Constructs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  User-defined syntax extensions are useful to implement an embedded domain
specific language (EDSL) with good code-readability. They allow EDSL authors to
define domain-natural notation, which is often different from the host language
syntax. Nowadays, there are several research works of powerful user-defined
syntax extensions. One promising approach uses user-defined operators. A
user-defined operator is a function with user-defined syntax. It can be
regarded as a syntax extension implemented without macros. An advantage of
user-defined operators is that an operator can be statically typed. The
compiler can find type errors in the definition of an operator before the
operator is used. In addition, the compiler can resolve syntactic ambiguities
by using static types. However, user-defined operators are difficult to
implement language constructs involving static name binding. Name binding is
association between names and values (or memory locations). Our inquiry is
whether we can design a system for user-defined operators involving a new
custom name binding. This paper proposes a module system for user-defined
operators named a dsl class. A dsl class is similar to a normal class in Java
but it contains operators instead of methods. We use operators for implementing
custom name binding. For example, we use a nullary operator for emulating a
variable name. An instance of a dsl class, called a dsl object, reifies an
environment that expresses name binding. Programmers can control a scope of
instance operators by specifying where the dsl object is active. We extend the
host type system so that it can express the activation of a dsl object. In our
system, a bound name is propagated through a type parameter to a dsl object.
This enables us to implement user-defined language constructs involving static
name binding. A contribution of this paper is that we reveal we can integrate a
system for managing names and their scopes with a module and type system of an
object-oriented language like Java. This allows us to implement a proposed
system by adopting eager disambiguation based on expected types so that the
compilation time will be acceptable. Eager disambiguation, which prunes out
semantically invalid abstract parsing trees (ASTs) while a parser is running,
is needed because the parser may generate a huge number of potentially valid
ASTs for the same source code. We have implemented ProteaJ2, which is a
programming language based on Java and it supports our proposal. We describe a
parsing method that adopts eager disambiguation for fast parsing and discuss
its time complexity. To show the practicality of our proposal, we have
conducted two micro benchmarks to see the performance of our compiler. We also
show several use cases of dsl classes for demonstrating dsl classes can express
various language constructs. Our ultimate goal is to let programmers add any
kind of new language construct to a host language. To do this, programmers
should be able to define new syntax, name binding, and type system within the
host language. This paper shows programmers can define the former two: their
own syntax and name binding.

 <dc:description>  Live programming environments enable programmers to edit a running program
and obtain immediate feedback on each individual change. The liveness quality
is valued by programmers to help work in small steps and continuously add or
correct small functionality while maintaining the impression of a direct
connection between each edit and its manifestation at run-time. Such immediacy
may conflict with the desire to perform a combined set of intermediate steps,
such as a refactoring, without immediately taking effect after each individual
edit. This becomes important when an incomplete sequence of small-scale changes
can easily break the running program. State-of-the-art solutions focus on
retroactive recovery mechanisms, such as debugging or version control. In
contrast, we propose a proactive approach: Multiple individual changes to the
program are collected in an Edit Transaction, which can be made effective if
deemed complete. Upon activation, the combined steps become visible together.
Edit Transactions are capable of dynamic scoping, allowing a set of changes to
be tested in isolation before being extended to the running application. This
enables a live programming workflow with full control over change granularity,
immediate feedback on tests, delayed effect on the running application, and
coarse-grained undos. We present an implementation of Edit Transactions along
with Edit-Transaction-aware tools in Squeak/Smalltalk. We asses this
implementation by conducting a case study with and without the new tool
support, comparing programming activities, errors, and detours for implementing
new functionality in a running simulation. We conclude that workflows using
Edit Transactions have the potential to increase confidence in a change, reduce
potential for run-time errors, and eventually make live programming more
predictable and engaging.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Computer programs do not always work as expected. In fact, ominous warnings
about the desperate state of the software industry continue to be released with
almost ritualistic regularity. In this paper, we look at the 60 years history
of programming and at the different practical methods that software community
developed to live with programming errors. We do so by observing a class of
students discussing different approaches to programming errors. While learning
about the different methods for dealing with errors, we uncover basic
assumptions that proponents of different paradigms follow. We learn about the
mathematical attempt to eliminate errors through formal methods, scientific
method based on testing, a way of building reliable systems through engineering
methods, as well as an artistic approach to live coding that accepts errors as
a creative inspiration. This way, we can explore the differences and
similarities among the different paradigms. By inviting proponents of different
methods into a single discussion, we hope to open potential for new thinking
about errors. When should we use which of the approaches? And what can software
development learn from mathematics, science, engineering and art? When
programming or studying programming, we are often enclosed in small communities
and we take our basic assumptions for granted. Through the discussion in this
paper, we attempt to map the large and rich space of programming ideas and
provide reference points for exploring, perhaps foreign, ideas that can
challenge some of our assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Reversible debuggers and process replay have been developed at least since
1970. This vision enables one to execute backwards in time under a debugger.
Two important problems in practice are that, first, current reversible
debuggers are slow when reversing over long time periods, and, second, after
building one reversible debugger, it is difficult to transfer that achievement
to a new programming environment. The user observes a bug when arriving at an
error. Searching backwards for the corresponding fault may require many reverse
steps. Ultimately, the user prefers to write an expression that will transition
to false upon arriving at the fault. The solution is an expression-transition
watchpoint facility based on top of snapshots and record/replay.
Expression-transition watch- points are implemented as binary search through
the timeline of a program execution, while using the snapshots as landmarks
within that timeline. This allows for debugging of subtle bugs that appear only
after minutes or more of program execution. When a bug occurs within seconds of
program startup, repeated debugging sessions suffice. Reversible debugging is
preferred for bugs seen only after minutes. This architecture allows for an
efficient and easy-to-write snapshot-based reversibe debugger on top of a
conventional debugger. The validity of this approach was tested by developing
four personalities (for GDB, MATLAB, Perl, and Python), with each personality
typically requiring just 100 lines of code.

 <dc:description>  The computation of (i) $\varepsilon$-kernels, (ii) approximate diameter, and
(iii) approximate bichromatic closest pair are fundamental problems in
geometric approximation. In this paper, we describe new algorithms that offer
significant improvements to their running times. In each case the input is a
set of $n$ points in $R^d$ for a constant dimension $d \geq 3$ and an
approximation parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We reduce the respective running
times (i) from $O((n + 1/\varepsilon^{d-2})\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to $O(n
\log(1/\varepsilon) + 1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2+\alpha})$, (ii) from $O((n +
1/\varepsilon^{d-2})\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to $O(n \log(1/\varepsilon) +
1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2+\alpha})$, and (iii) from $O(n / \varepsilon^{d/3})$ to
$O(n / \varepsilon^{d/4+\alpha}),$ for an arbitrarily small constant $\alpha &gt;
0$. Result (i) is nearly optimal since the size of the output
$\varepsilon$-kernel is $\Theta(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ in the worst case.
  These results are all based on an efficient decomposition of a convex body
using a hierarchy of Macbeath regions, and contrast to previous solutions that
decompose space using quadtrees and grids. By further application of these
techniques, we also show that it is possible to obtain near-optimal
preprocessing time for the most efficient data structures to approximately
answer queries for (iv) nearest-neighbor searching, (v) directional width, and
(vi) polytope membership.

 <dc:title>Open Programming Language Interpreters</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Context: This paper presents the concept of open programming language
interpreters and the implementation of a framework-level metaobject protocol
(MOP) to support them. Inquiry: We address the problem of dynamic interpreter
adaptation to tailor the interpreter's behavior on the task to be solved and to
introduce new features to fulfill unforeseen requirements. Many languages
provide a MOP that to some degree supports reflection. However, MOPs are
typically language-specific, their reflective functionality is often
restricted, and the adaptation and application logic are often mixed which
hardens the understanding and maintenance of the source code. Our system
overcomes these limitations. Approach: We designed and implemented a system to
support open programming language interpreters. The prototype implementation is
integrated in the Neverlang framework. The system exposes the structure,
behavior and the runtime state of any Neverlang-based interpreter with the
ability to modify it. Knowledge: Our system provides a complete control over
interpreter's structure, behavior and its runtime state. The approach is
applicable to every Neverlang-based interpreter. Adaptation code can
potentially be reused across different language implementations. Grounding:
Having a prototype implementation we focused on feasibility evaluation. The
paper shows that our approach well addresses problems commonly found in the
research literature. We have a demonstrative video and examples that illustrate
our approach on dynamic software adaptation, aspect-oriented programming,
debugging and context-aware interpreters. Importance: To our knowledge, our
paper presents the first reflective approach targeting a general framework for
language development. Our system provides full reflective support for free to
any Neverlang-based interpreter. We are not aware of any prior application of
open implementations to programming language interpreters in the sense defined
in this paper. Rather than substituting other approaches, we believe our system
can be used as a complementary technique in situations where other approaches
present serious limitations.

 <dc:description>  The ability to classify objects is fundamental for robots. Besides knowledge
about their visual appearance, captured by the RGB channel, robots heavily need
also depth information to make sense of the world. While the use of deep
networks on RGB robot images has benefited from the plethora of results
obtained on databases like ImageNet, using convnets on depth images requires
mapping them into three dimensional channels. This transfer learning procedure
makes them processable by pre-trained deep architectures. Current mappings are
based on heuristic assumptions over preprocessing steps and on what depth
properties should be most preserved, resulting often in cumbersome data
visualizations, and in sub-optimal performance in terms of generality and
recognition results. Here we take an alternative route and we attempt instead
to learn an optimal colorization mapping for any given pre-trained
architecture, using as training data a reference RGB-D database. We propose a
deep network architecture, exploiting the residual paradigm, that learns how to
map depth data to three channel images. A qualitative analysis of the images
obtained with this approach clearly indicates that learning the optimal mapping
preserves the richness of depth information better than current hand-crafted
approaches. Experiments on the Washington, JHUIT-50 and BigBIRD public
benchmark databases, using CaffeNet, VGG16, GoogleNet, and ResNet50 clearly
showcase the power of our approach, with gains in performance of up to 16%
compared to state of the art competitors on the depth channel only, leading to
top performances when dealing with RGB-D data

 <dc:title>Does Python Smell Like Java? Tool Support for Design Defect Discovery in

 <dc:description>  The context of this work is specification, detection and ultimately removal
of detectable harmful patterns in source code that are associated with defects
in design and implementation of software. In particular, we investigate five
code smells and four antipatterns previously defined in papers and books. Our
inquiry is about detecting those in source code written in Python programming
language, which is substantially different from all prior research, most of
which concerns Java or C-like languages. Our approach was that of software
engineers: we have processed existing research literature on the topic,
extracted both the abstract definitions of nine design defects and their
concrete implementation specifications, implemented them all in a tool we have
programmed and let it loose on a huge test set obtained from open source code
from thousands of GitHub projects. When it comes to knowledge, we have found
that more than twice as many methods in Python can be considered too long
(statistically extremely longer than their neighbours within the same project)
than in Java, but long parameter lists are seven times less likely to be found
in Python code than in Java code. We have also found that Functional
Decomposition, the way it was defined for Java, is not found in the Python code
at all, and Spaghetti Code and God Classes are extremely rare there as well.
The grounding and the confidence in these results comes from the fact that we
have performed our experiments on 32'058'823 lines of Python code, which is by
far the largest test set for a freely available Python parser. We have also
designed the experiment in such a way that it aligned with prior research on
design defect detection in Java in order to ease the comparison if we treat our
own actions as a replication. Thus, the importance of the work is both in the
unique open Python grammar of highest quality, tested on millions of lines of
code, and in the design defect detection tool which works on something else
than Java.

time-varying background noises is a current challenge for scientists. In this
paper, we explore the applicability of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) method
for this task. In the evaluation stage, we present 6 bi-class classification
experimentations of whale sound detection against different background noise
types (e.g., rain, wind). In comparison to classical FFT-based representation
like spectrograms, we showed that the use of image-based pretrained CNN
features brought higher performance to classify whale sounds and background

 <dc:description>  In the recent years impressive advances were made for single image
super-resolution. Deep learning is behind a big part of this success. Deep(er)
architecture design and external priors modeling are the key ingredients. The
internal contents of the low resolution input image is neglected with deep
modeling despite the earlier works showing the power of using such internal
priors. In this paper we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network
carefully designed for robustness and efficiency at both learning and testing.
Moreover, we propose a couple of model adaptation strategies to the internal
contents of the low resolution input image and analyze their strong points and
weaknesses. By trading runtime and using internal priors we achieve 0.1 up to
0.3dB PSNR improvements over best reported results on standard datasets. Our
adaptation especially favors images with repetitive structures or under large
resolutions. Moreover, it can be combined with other simple techniques, such as
back-projection or enhanced prediction, for further improvements.

 <dc:description>  Recently, efforts have been made to improve ptychography phase retrieval
algorithms so that they are more robust against noise. Often the algorithm is
adapted by changing the cost functional that needs to be minimized. In
particular, it has been suggested that the cost functional should be obtained
using a maximum-likelihood approach that takes the noise statistics into
account. Here, we consider the different choices of cost functional, and to how
they affect the reconstruction results. We find that seemingly the only
consistently reliable way to improve reconstruction results in the presence of
noise is to reduce the step size of the update function. In addition, a
noise-robust ptychographic reconstruction method has been proposed that relies
on adapting the intensity constraints

 <dc:description>  Speech enhancement (SE) aims to reduce noise in speech signals. Most SE
techniques focus only on addressing audio information. In this work, inspired
by multimodal learning, which utilizes data from different modalities, and the
recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in SE, we propose an
audio-visual deep CNNs (AVDCNN) SE model, which incorporates audio and visual
streams into a unified network model. We also propose a multi-task learning
framework for reconstructing audio and visual signals at the output layer.
Precisely speaking, the proposed AVDCNN model is structured as an audio-visual
encoder-decoder network, in which audio and visual data are first processed
using individual CNNs, and then fused into a joint network to generate enhanced
speech (the primary task) and reconstructed images (the secondary task) at the
output layer. The model is trained in an end-to-end manner, and parameters are
jointly learned through back-propagation. We evaluate enhanced speech using
five instrumental criteria. Results show that the AVDCNN model yields a notably
superior performance compared with an audio-only CNN-based SE model and two
conventional SE approaches, confirming the effectiveness of integrating visual
information into the SE process. In addition, the AVDCNN model also outperforms
an existing audio-visual SE model, confirming its capability of effectively
combining audio and visual information in SE.

 <dc:description>  Model-driven development is a pragmatic approach to software development that
embraces domain-specific languages (DSLs), where models correspond to DSL
programs. A distinguishing feature of model-driven development is that clients
of a model can select from an open set of alternative semantics of the model by
applying different model transformation. However, in existing model-driven
frameworks, dependencies between models, model transformations, and generated
code artifacts are either implicit or globally declared in build scripts, which
impedes modular reasoning, separate compilation, and programmability in
general. We propose the design of a new module system that incorporates models
and model transformations as modules. A programmer can apply transformations in
import statements, thus declaring a dependency on generated code artifacts. Our
design enables modular reasoning and separate compilation by preventing hidden
dependencies, and it supports mixing modeling artifacts with conventional code
artifacts as well as higher-order transformations. We have formalized our
design and the aforementioned properties and have validated it by an
implementation and case studies that show that our module system successfully
integrates model-driven development into conventional programming languages.

 <dc:title>BB8: A Scalable, Accurate, Robust to Partial Occlusion Method for
  Predicting the 3D Poses of Challenging Objects without Using Depth</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rad, Mahdi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lepetit, Vincent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel method for 3D object detection and pose estimation from
color images only. We first use segmentation to detect the objects of interest
in 2D even in presence of partial occlusions and cluttered background. By
contrast with recent patch-based methods, we rely on a &quot;holistic&quot; approach: We
apply to the detected objects a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to
predict their 3D poses in the form of 2D projections of the corners of their 3D
bounding boxes for the pose of objects' parts. This, however, is not sufficient
for handling objects from the recent T-LESS dataset: These objects exhibit an
axis of rotational symmetry, and the similarity of two images of such an object
under two different poses makes training the CNN challenging. We solve this
problem by restricting the range of poses used for training, and by introducing
a classifier to identify the range of a pose at run-time before estimating it.
We also use an optional additional step that refines the predicted poses for
hand pose estimation. We improve the state-of-the-art on the LINEMOD dataset
from 73.7% to 89.3% of correctly registered RGB frames. We are also the first
to report results on the Occlusion dataset using color images only. We obtain
54% of frames passing the Pose 6D criterion on average on several sequences of
the T-LESS dataset, compared to the 67% of the state-of-the-art on the same
sequences which uses both color and depth. The full approach is also scalable,
as a single network can be trained for multiple objects simultaneously.

 <dc:description>  We study the random multi-unit assignment problem in which the number of
goods to be distributed depends on players' preferences.
  In this setup, the egalitarian solution is more appealing than the
competitive equilibrium with equal incomes because it is Lorenz dominant,
unique in utilities, and impossible to manipulate by groups when agents have
dichotomous preferences. Moreover, it can be adapted to satisfy a new fairness
axiom that arises naturally in this context. Both solutions are disjoint.
  Two standard results disappear. The competitive solution can no longer be
computed with the Eisenberg-Gale program maximizing the Nash product, and the
competitive equilibrium with equal incomes is no longer unique in its
corresponding utility profile.

 <dc:description>  Deep ConvNets have been shown to be effective for the task of human pose
estimation from single images. However, several challenging issues arise in the
video-based case such as self-occlusion, motion blur, and uncommon poses with
few or no examples in training data sets. Temporal information can provide
additional cues about the location of body joints and help to alleviate these
issues. In this paper, we propose a deep structured model to estimate a
sequence of human poses in unconstrained videos. This model can be efficiently
trained in an end-to-end manner and is capable of representing appearance of
body joints and their spatio-temporal relationships simultaneously. Domain
knowledge about the human body is explicitly incorporated into the network
providing effective priors to regularize the skeletal structure and to enforce
temporal consistency. The proposed end-to-end architecture is evaluated on two
widely used benchmarks (Penn Action dataset and JHMDB dataset) for video-based
pose estimation. Our approach significantly outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning from visual data is one of the most difficult
challenges in computer vision, being a fundamental task for understanding how
visual recognition works. From a practical point of view, learning from
unsupervised visual input has an immense practical value, as very large
quantities of unlabeled videos can be collected at low cost. In this paper, we
address the task of unsupervised learning to detect and segment foreground
objects in single images. We achieve our goal by training a student pathway,
consisting of a deep neural network. It learns to predict from a single input
image (a video frame) the output for that particular frame, of a teacher
pathway that performs unsupervised object discovery in video. Our approach is
different from the published literature that performs unsupervised discovery in
videos or in collections of images at test time. We move the unsupervised
discovery phase during the training stage, while at test time we apply the
standard feed-forward processing along the student pathway. This has a dual
benefit: firstly, it allows in principle unlimited possibilities of learning
and generalization during training, while remaining very fast at testing.
Secondly, the student not only becomes able to detect in single images
significantly better than its unsupervised video discovery teacher, but it also
achieves state of the art results on two important current benchmarks, YouTube
Objects and Object Discovery datasets. Moreover, at test time, our system is at
least two orders of magnitude faster than other previous methods.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a deep encoder-decoder architecture for image deformation
prediction from multimodal images. Specifically, we design an image-patch-based
deep network that jointly (i) learns an image similarity measure and (ii) the
relationship between image patches and deformation parameters. While our method
can be applied to general image registration formulations, we focus on the
Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) registration model. By
predicting the initial momentum of the shooting formulation of LDDMM, we
preserve its mathematical properties and drastically reduce the computation
time, compared to optimization-based approaches. Furthermore, we create a
Bayesian probabilistic version of the network that allows evaluation of
registration uncertainty via sampling of the network at test time. We evaluate
our method on a 3D brain MRI dataset using both T1- and T2-weighted images. Our
experiments show that our method generates accurate predictions and that
learning the similarity measure leads to more consistent registrations than
relying on generic multimodal image similarity measures, such as mutual
information. Our approach is an order of magnitude faster than
optimization-based LDDMM.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces Quicksilver, a fast deformable image registration
method. Quicksilver registration for image-pairs works by patch-wise prediction
of a deformation model based directly on image appearance. A deep
encoder-decoder network is used as the prediction model. While the prediction
strategy is general, we focus on predictions for the Large Deformation
Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) model. Specifically, we predict the
momentum-parameterization of LDDMM, which facilitates a patch-wise prediction
strategy while maintaining the theoretical properties of LDDMM, such as
guaranteed diffeomorphic mappings for sufficiently strong regularization. We
also provide a probabilistic version of our prediction network which can be
sampled during the testing time to calculate uncertainties in the predicted
deformations. Finally, we introduce a new correction network which greatly
increases the prediction accuracy of an already existing prediction network. We
show experimental results for uni-modal atlas-to-image as well as uni- / multi-
modal image-to-image registrations. These experiments demonstrate that our
method accurately predicts registrations obtained by numerical optimization, is
very fast, achieves state-of-the-art registration results on four standard
validation datasets, and can jointly learn an image similarity measure.
Quicksilver is freely available as an open-source software.

 <dc:description>  Network virtualization and SDN-based routing allow carriers to flexibly
configure their networks in response to demand and unexpected network
disruptions. However, cellular networks, by nature, pose some unique challenges
because of user mobility and control/data plane partitioning, which calls for
new architectures and provisioning paradigms. In this paper, we address the
latter part by devising algorithms that can provision the data plane to create
a distributed Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC), which provides opportunities for lower
latencies and increased resilience (through placement of network functions at
more distributed datacenter locations) and accounts for service disruption that
could be incurred because of user mobility between the service areas of
different datacenters. Through evaluations with topology and traffic data from
a major carriers's network, we show that, compared to static, centralized
networks, careful virtualized provisioning can yield significant savings in
network costs while still minimizing service disruption due to mobility. We
demonstrate that up to a 75% reduction in redundant datacenter capacity over
the operator's current topology (while achieving the same level of resilience)
is possible by distributing load over many mobile cloud datacenters.

 <dc:title>Unlocking of predicate: application to non-anticipating selections</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider an approach to constructing a non-anticipating selection of a
multivalued mapping; such a problem arises in control theory under conditions
of uncertainty. The approach is called &quot;unlocking of predicate&quot; and consists in
the reduction of finding the truth set of a predicate to searching fixed points
of some mappings. Unlocking of predicate gives an extra opportunity to analyze
the truth set and to build its elements with desired properties.
  In this article, we outline how to build &quot;unlocking mappings&quot; for some
general types of predicates: we give a formal definition of the predicate
unlocking operation, the rules for the construction and calculation of
&quot;unlocking mappings&quot; and their basic properties. As an illustration, we
routinely construct two unlocking mappings for the predicate &quot;be
non-anticipating mapping&quot; and then on this base we provide the expression for
the greatest non-anticipating selection of a given multifunction.

 <dc:description>  The Android operating system has become the most popular operating system for
smartphones and tablets leading to a rapid rise in malware. Sophisticated
Android malware employ detection avoidance techniques in order to hide their
malicious activities from analysis tools. These include a wide range of
anti-emulator techniques, where the malware programs attempt to hide their
malicious activities by detecting the emulator. For this reason,
countermeasures against antiemulation are becoming increasingly important in
Android malware detection. Analysis and detection based on real devices can
alleviate the problems of anti-emulation as well as improve the effectiveness
of dynamic analysis. Hence, in this paper we present an investigation of
machine learning based malware detection using dynamic analysis on real
devices. A tool is implemented to automatically extract dynamic features from
Android phones and through several experiments, a comparative analysis of
emulator based vs. device based detection by means of several machine learning
algorithms is undertaken. Our study shows that several features could be
extracted more effectively from the on-device dynamic analysis compared to
emulators. It was also found that approximately 24% more apps were successfully
analysed on the phone. Furthermore, all of the studied machine learning based
detection performed better when applied to features extracted from the
on-device dynamic analysis.

 <dc:description>  We present a feature functional theory - binding predictor (FFT-BP) for the
protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. The underpinning assumptions of
FFT-BP are as follows: i) representability: there exists a microscopic feature
vector that can uniquely characterize and distinguish one protein-ligand
complex from another; ii) feature-function relationship: the macroscopic
features, including binding free energy, of a complex is a functional of
microscopic feature vectors; and iii) similarity: molecules with similar
microscopic features have similar macroscopic features, such as binding
affinity. Physical models, such as implicit solvent models and quantum theory,
are utilized to extract microscopic features, while machine learning algorithms
are employed to rank the similarity among protein-ligand complexes. A large
variety of numerical validations and tests confirms the accuracy and robustness
of the proposed FFT-BP model. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of FFT-BP
blind predictions of a benchmark set of 100 complexes, the PDBBind v2007 core
set of 195 complexes and the PDBBind v2015 core set of 195 complexes are 1.99,
2.02 and 1.92 kcal/mol, respectively. Their corresponding Pearson correlation
coefficients are 0.75, 0.80, and 0.78, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Sentence simplification aims to make sentences easier to read and understand.
Most recent approaches draw on insights from machine translation to learn
simplification rewrites from monolingual corpora of complex and simple
sentences. We address the simplification problem with an encoder-decoder model
coupled with a deep reinforcement learning framework. Our model, which we call
{\sc Dress} (as shorthand for {\bf D}eep {\bf RE}inforcement {\bf S}entence
{\bf S}implification), explores the space of possible simplifications while
learning to optimize a reward function that encourages outputs which are
simple, fluent, and preserve the meaning of the input. Experiments on three
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive simplification
systems.

 <dc:description>  Variational message passing (VMP), belief propagation (BP) and expectation
propagation (EP) have found their wide uses in complex statistical signal
processing problems. In addition to view them as a class of algorithms
operating on graphical models, this paper unifies them under an optimization
framework, namely, Bethe free energy minimization with differently and
appropriately imposed constraints. This new perspective in terms of constraint
manipulation can offer additional insights on the connection between message
passing algorithms and it is valid for a generic statistical model. It also
founds a theoretical framework to systematically derive message passing
variants. Taking the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) problem as an example, a
low-complexity EP variant can be obtained by simple constraint reformulation,
delivering better estimation performance with lower complexity than the
standard EP algorithm. Furthermore, we can resort to the framework for
systematic derivation of hybrid message passing for complex inference tasks. A
hybrid message passing algorithm is exemplarily derived for joint sparse signal
reconstruction and statistical model learning. It achieves near-ideal inference
performance with manageable complexity.

 <dc:description>  Polarized topics often spark discussion and debate on social media. Recent
studies have shown that polarized debates have a specific clustered structure
in the endorsement net- work, which indicates that users direct their
endorsements mostly to ideas they already agree with. Understanding these
polarized discussions and exposing social media users to content that broadens
their views is of paramount importance.
  The contribution of this demonstration is two-fold. (i) A tool to visualize
retweet networks about controversial issues on Twitter. By using our
visualization, users can understand how polarized discussions are shaped on
Twitter, and explore the positions of the various actors. (ii) A solution to
reduce polarization of such discussions. We do so by exposing users to
information which presents a contrarian point of view. Users can visually
inspect our recommendations and understand why and how these would play out in
terms of the retweet network.
  Our demo (https://users.ics.aalto.fi/kiran/reducingControversy/ homepage)
provides one of the first steps in developing automated tools that help users
explore, and possibly escape, their echo chambers. The ideas in the demo can
also help content providers design tools to broaden their reach to people with
different political and ideological backgrounds.

 <dc:description>  B-terms are built from the B combinator alone defined by B f g x = f (g x),
which is well-known as a function composition operator. This paper investigates
an interesting property of B-terms, that is, whether repetitive right
applications of a B-term circulates or not. We discuss conditions for B-terms
to and not to have the property through a sound and complete equational
axiomatization. Specifically, we give examples of B-terms which have the
property and show that there are infinitely many B-terms which does not have
the property. Also, we introduce a canonical representation of B-terms that is
useful to detect cycles, or equivalently, to prove the property, with an
efficient algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Toxicity analysis and prediction are of paramount importance to human health
and environmental protection. Existing computational methods are built from a
wide variety of descriptors and regressors, which makes their performance
analysis difficult. For example, deep neural network (DNN), a successful
approach in many occasions, acts like a black box and offers little conceptual
elegance or physical understanding. The present work constructs a common set of
microscopic descriptors based on established physical models for charges,
surface areas and free energies to assess the performance of multi-task
convolutional neural network (MT-CNN) architectures and a few other approaches,
including random forest (RF) and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), on an
equal footing. Comparison is also given to convolutional neural network (CNN)
and non-convolutional deep neural network (DNN) algorithms. Four benchmark
toxicity data sets (i.e., endpoints) are used to evaluate various approaches.
Extensive numerical studies indicate that the present MT-CNN architecture is
able to outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We introduce InverseFaceNet, a deep convolutional inverse rendering framework
for faces that jointly estimates facial pose, shape, expression, reflectance
and illumination from a single input image in a single shot. By estimating all
these parameters from just a single image, advanced editing possibilities on a
single face image, such as appearance editing and relighting, become feasible.
Previous learning-based face reconstruction approaches do not jointly recover
all dimensions, or are severely limited in terms of visual quality. In
contrast, we propose to recover high-quality facial pose, shape, expression,
reflectance and illumination using a deep neural network that is trained using
a large, synthetically created dataset. Our approach builds on a novel loss
function that measures model-space similarity directly in parameter space and
significantly improves reconstruction accuracy. In addition, we propose an
analysis-by-synthesis breeding approach which iteratively updates the synthetic
training corpus based on the distribution of real-world images, and we
demonstrate that this strategy outperforms completely synthetically trained
networks. Finally, we show high-quality reconstructions and compare our
approach to several state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:title>Parallelism, Concurrency and Distribution in Constraint Handling Rules:
  A Survey</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Constraint Handling Rules is an effective concurrent declarative programming
language and a versatile computational logic formalism. CHR programs consist of
guarded reactive rules that transform multisets of constraints. One of the main
features of CHR is its inherent concurrency. Intuitively, rules can be applied
to parts of a multiset in parallel. In this comprehensive survey, we give an
overview of concurrent and parallel as well as distributed CHR semantics,
standard and more exotic, that have been proposed over the years at various
levels of refinement. These semantics range from the abstract to the concrete.
They are related by formal soundness results. Their correctness is established
as correspondence between parallel and sequential computations. We present
common concise sample CHR programs that have been widely used in experiments
and benchmarks. We review parallel CHR implementations in software and
hardware. The experimental results obtained show a consistent parallel speedup.
Most implementations are available online. The CHR formalism can also be used
to implement and reason with models for concurrency. To this end, the Software
Transaction Model, the Actor Model, Colored Petri Nets and the Join-Calculus
have been faithfully encoded in CHR.

 <dc:description>  While recent neural encoder-decoder models have shown great promise in
modeling open-domain conversations, they often generate dull and generic
responses. Unlike past work that has focused on diversifying the output of the
decoder at word-level to alleviate this problem, we present a novel framework
based on conditional variational autoencoders that captures the discourse-level
diversity in the encoder. Our model uses latent variables to learn a
distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse
responses using only greedy decoders. We have further developed a novel variant
that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance.
Finally, the training procedure is improved by introducing a bag-of-word loss.
Our proposed models have been validated to generate significantly more diverse
responses than baseline approaches and exhibit competence in discourse-level
decision-making.

 <dc:description>  In search engines, online marketplaces and other human-computer interfaces
large collectives of individuals sequentially interact with numerous
alternatives of varying quality. In these contexts, trial and error
(exploration) is crucial for uncovering novel high-quality items or solutions,
but entails a high cost for individual users. Self-interested decision makers,
are often better off imitating the choices of individuals who have already
incurred the costs of exploration. Although imitation makes sense at the
individual level, it deprives the group of additional information that could
have been gleaned by individual explorers. In this paper we show that in such
problems, preference diversity can function as a welfare enhancing mechanism.
It leads to a consistent increase in the quality of the consumed alternatives
that outweighs the increased cost of search for the users.

 <dc:description>  We study the minimum diameter problem for a set of inexact points. By
inexact, we mean that the precise location of the points is not known. Instead,
the location of each point is restricted to a contineus region ($\impre$ model)
or a finite set of points ($\indec$ model). Given a set of inexact points in
one of $\impre$ or $\indec$ models, we wish to provide a lower-bound on the
diameter of the real points.
  In the first part of the paper, we focus on $\indec$ model. We present an
$O(2^{\frac{1}{\epsilon^d}} \cdot \epsilon^{-2d} \cdot n^3 )$ time
approximation algorithm of factor $(1+\epsilon)$ for finding minimum diameter
of a set of points in $d$ dimensions. This improves the previously proposed
algorithms for this problem substantially.
  Next, we consider the problem in $\impre$ model. In $d$-dimensional space, we
propose a polynomial time $\sqrt{d}$-approximation algorithm. In addition, for
$d=2$, we define the notion of $\alpha$-separability and use our algorithm for
$\indec$ model to obtain $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a set of
$\alpha$-separable regions in time $O(2^{\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}}\allowbreak .
\frac{n^3}{\epsilon^{10} .\sin(\alpha/2)^3} )$.

 <dc:title>Formalization of some central theorems in combinatorics of finite sets</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present fully formalized proofs of some central theorems from
combinatorics. These are Dilworth's decomposition theorem, Mirsky's theorem,
Hall's marriage theorem and the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem. Dilworth's
decomposition theorem is the key result among these. It states that in any
finite partially ordered set (poset), the size of a smallest chain cover and a
largest antichain are the same. Mirsky's theorem is a dual of Dilworth's
decomposition theorem, which states that in any finite poset, the size of a
smallest antichain cover and a largest chain are the same. We use Dilworth's
theorem in the proofs of Hall's Marriage theorem and the Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres
theorem. The combinatorial objects involved in these theorems are sets and
sequences. All the proofs are formalized in the Coq proof assistant. We develop
a library of definitions and facts that can be used as a framework for
formalizing other theorems on finite posets.

 <dc:description>  Due to high penetration losses, millimeter wave channels are formed of few
paths. Most channel estimation procedures exploit this property by sounding the
channel in multiple directions and then identifying those yielding the largest
power. Whether in initial access or tracking mode, the beams for sweeping the
channel have maximum gain towards a small range of angles. These beams are
generally heuristic in nature and may not lead to the best estimation/tracking
performance. In this paper, we derive optimal precoders for estimating the
parameters of a single path, when prior knowledge is available, according to
the Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound.

 <dc:description>  Effective applications of vehicular ad hoc networks in traffic signal control
require new methods for detection of malicious data. Injection of malicious
data can result in significantly decreased performance of such applications,
increased vehicle delays, fuel consumption, congestion, or even safety threats.
This paper introduces a method, which combines a model of expected driver
behaviour with position verification in order to detect the malicious data
injected by vehicle nodes that perform Sybil attacks. Effectiveness of this
approach was demonstrated in simulation experiments for a decentralized
self-organizing system that controls the traffic signals at multiple
intersections in an urban road network. Experimental results show that the
proposed method is useful for mitigating the negative impact of malicious data
on the performance of traffic signal control.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, a number of prominent computer scientists, along with
academics in fields such as philosophy and physics, have lent credence to the
notion that machines may one day become as large as humans. Many have further
argued that machines could even come to exceed human size by a significant
margin. However, there are at least seven distinct arguments that preclude this
outcome. We show that it is not only implausible that machines will ever exceed
human size, but in fact impossible.

 <dc:description>  Separation Logic is an effective Program Logic for proving programs that
involve pointers. Reasoning with pointers becomes difficult especially when
there is aliasing arising due to several pointers to a given cell location. In
this paper, we try to explore the problems with aliasing through some simple
examples and introduce the notion of separating conjunction as a tool to deal
with it. We introduce Separation Logic as an extension of the standard Hoare
Logic with the help pf a programming language that has four pointer
manipulating commands. These commands perform the usual heap operations such as
lookup, update, allocation and deallocation. The new set of assertions and
axioms of Separation Logic is presented in a semi-formal style. Examples are
given to illustrate the unique features of the new assertions and axioms.
Finally the paper concludes with the proofs of some real programs using the
axioms of Separation Logic.

 <dc:description>  A new detection scheme for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems is analytically presented. In particular, the transmitting users are
being categorized in two distinct priority service groups, while they
communicate directly with a multi-antenna receiver. The linear zero-forcing
scheme is applied in two consecutive detection stages upon the signal
reception. In the first stage, the signals of one service group are detected,
followed by the second stage including the corresponding detection of the
remaining signals. An appropriate switching scheme based on specific
transmission quality requirements is utilized prior to the detection so as to
allocate the signals of a given service group to the suitable detection stage.
The objective is the enhancement of the reception quality for both service
groups. The proposed approach can be implemented directly in cognitive radio
communication assigning the secondary users to the appropriate service group.
The exact outage probability of the considered system is derived in closed
form. The special case of massive MIMO is further studied yielding some useful
engineering outcomes; the effective channel coherence time and a certain
optimality condition defining both the transmission quality and effective
number of independent transmissions.

 <dc:description>  Visual servoing involves choosing actions that move a robot in response to
observations from a camera, in order to reach a goal configuration in the
world. Standard visual servoing approaches typically rely on manually designed
features and analytical dynamics models, which limits their generalization
capability and often requires extensive application-specific feature and model
engineering. In this work, we study how learned visual features, learned
predictive dynamics models, and reinforcement learning can be combined to learn
visual servoing mechanisms. We focus on target following, with the goal of
designing algorithms that can learn a visual servo using low amounts of data of
the target in question, to enable quick adaptation to new targets. Our approach
is based on servoing the camera in the space of learned visual features, rather
than image pixels or manually-designed keypoints. We demonstrate that standard
deep features, in our case taken from a model trained for object
classification, can be used together with a bilinear predictive model to learn
an effective visual servo that is robust to visual variation, changes in
viewing angle and appearance, and occlusions. A key component of our approach
is to use a sample-efficient fitted Q-iteration algorithm to learn which
features are best suited for the task at hand. We show that we can learn an
effective visual servo on a complex synthetic car following benchmark using
just 20 training trajectory samples for reinforcement learning. We demonstrate
substantial improvement over a conventional approach based on image pixels or
hand-designed keypoints, and we show an improvement in sample-efficiency of
more than two orders of magnitude over standard model-free deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Videos are available at

 <dc:title>A simplicial complex model of dynamic epistemic logic for fault-tolerant

 <dc:description>  The usual epistemic S5 model for multi-agent systems is a Kripke graph, whose
edges are labeled with the agents that do not distinguish between two states.
We propose to uncover the higher dimensional information implicit in the Kripke
graph, by using as a model its dual, a chromatic simplicial complex. For each
state of the Kripke model there is a facet in the complex, with one vertex per
agent. If an edge (u,v) is labeled with a set of agents S, the facets
corresponding to u and v intersect in a simplex consisting of one vertex for
each agent of S. Then we use dynamic epistemic logic to study how the
simplicial complex epistemic model changes after the agents communicate with
each other. We show that there are topological invariants preserved from the
initial epistemic complex to the epistemic complex after an action model is
applied, that depend on how reliable the communication is. In turn these
topological properties determine the knowledge that the agents may gain after
the communication happens.

 <dc:title>Computing Nonvacuous Generalization Bounds for Deep (Stochastic) Neural
  Networks with Many More Parameters than Training Data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dziugaite, Gintare Karolina</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Roy, Daniel M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the defining properties of deep learning is that models are chosen to
have many more parameters than available training data. In light of this
capacity for overfitting, it is remarkable that simple algorithms like SGD
reliably return solutions with low test error. One roadblock to explaining
these phenomena in terms of implicit regularization, structural properties of
the solution, and/or easiness of the data is that many learning bounds are
quantitatively vacuous when applied to networks learned by SGD in this &quot;deep
learning&quot; regime. Logically, in order to explain generalization, we need
nonvacuous bounds. We return to an idea by Langford and Caruana (2001), who
used PAC-Bayes bounds to compute nonvacuous numerical bounds on generalization
error for stochastic two-layer two-hidden-unit neural networks via a
sensitivity analysis. By optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound directly, we are able
to extend their approach and obtain nonvacuous generalization bounds for deep
stochastic neural network classifiers with millions of parameters trained on
only tens of thousands of examples. We connect our findings to recent and old
work on flat minima and MDL-based explanations of generalization.

 <dc:description>  Nonparametric models are versatile, albeit computationally expensive, tool
for modeling mixture models. In this paper, we introduce spectral methods for
the two most popular nonparametric models: the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) and
the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). We show that using spectral methods
for the inference of nonparametric models are computationally and statistically
efficient. In particular, we derive the lower-order moments of the IBP and the
HDP, propose spectral algorithms for both models, and provide reconstruction
guarantees for the algorithms. For the HDP, we further show that applying
hierarchical models on dataset with hierarchical structure, which can be solved
with the generalized spectral HDP, produces better solutions to that of flat
models regarding likelihood performance.

 <dc:description>  As the type and the number of such venues increase, automated analysis of
sentiment on textual resources has become an essential data mining task. In
this paper, we investigate the problem of mining opinions on the collection of
informal short texts. Both positive and negative sentiment strength of texts
are detected. We focus on a non-English language that has few resources for
text mining. This approach would help enhance the sentiment analysis in
languages where a list of opinionated words does not exist. We propose a new
method projects the text into dense and low dimensional feature vectors
according to the sentiment strength of the words. We detect the mixture of
positive and negative sentiments on a multi-variant scale. Empirical evaluation
of the proposed framework on Turkish tweets shows that our approach gets good
results for opinion mining.

 <dc:title>On the Reliable Detection of Concept Drift from Streaming Unlabeled Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Classifiers deployed in the real world operate in a dynamic environment,
where the data distribution can change over time. These changes, referred to as
concept drift, can cause the predictive performance of the classifier to drop
over time, thereby making it obsolete. To be of any real use, these classifiers
need to detect drifts and be able to adapt to them, over time. Detecting drifts
has traditionally been approached as a supervised task, with labeled data
constantly being used for validating the learned model. Although effective in
detecting drifts, these techniques are impractical, as labeling is a difficult,
costly and time consuming activity. On the other hand, unsupervised change
detection techniques are unreliable, as they produce a large number of false
alarms. The inefficacy of the unsupervised techniques stems from the exclusion
of the characteristics of the learned classifier, from the detection process.
In this paper, we propose the Margin Density Drift Detection (MD3) algorithm,
which tracks the number of samples in the uncertainty region of a classifier,
as a metric to detect drift. The MD3 algorithm is a distribution independent,
application independent, model independent, unsupervised and incremental
algorithm for reliably detecting drifts from data streams. Experimental
evaluation on 6 drift induced datasets and 4 additional datasets from the
cybersecurity domain demonstrates that the MD3 approach can reliably detect
drifts, with significantly fewer false alarms compared to unsupervised feature
based drift detectors. The reduced false alarms enables the signaling of drifts
only when they are most likely to affect classification performance. As such,
the MD3 approach leads to a detection scheme which is credible, label efficient
and general in its applicability.

 <dc:title>Upper Bounds on the Runtime of the Univariate Marginal Distribution
  Algorithm on OneMax</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Witt, Carsten</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A runtime analysis of the Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA)
is presented on the OneMax function for wide ranges of its parameters $\mu$ and
$\lambda$. If $\mu\ge c\log n$ for some constant $c&gt;0$ and
$\lambda=(1+\Theta(1))\mu$, a general bound $O(\mu n)$ on the expected runtime
is obtained. This bound crucially assumes that all marginal probabilities of
the algorithm are confined to the interval $[1/n,1-1/n]$. If $\mu\ge c'
\sqrt{n}\log n$ for a constant $c'&gt;0$ and $\lambda=(1+\Theta(1))\mu$, the
behavior of the algorithm changes and the bound on the expected runtime becomes
$O(\mu\sqrt{n})$, which typically even holds if the borders on the marginal
probabilities are omitted.
  The results supplement the recently derived lower bound
$\Omega(\mu\sqrt{n}+n\log n)$ by Krejca and Witt (FOGA 2017) and turn out as
tight for the two very different values $\mu=c\log n$ and $\mu=c'\sqrt{n}\log
n$. They also improve the previously best known upper bound $O(n\log n\log\log
n)$ by Dang and Lehre (GECCO 2015).

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful generative models, but
suffer from training instability. The recently proposed Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
makes progress toward stable training of GANs, but sometimes can still generate
only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are
often due to the use of weight clipping in WGAN to enforce a Lipschitz
constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an
alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic
with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard
WGAN and enables stable training of a wide variety of GAN architectures with
almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer ResNets and language
models over discrete data. We also achieve high quality generations on CIFAR-10
and LSUN bedrooms.

 <dc:description>  Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are of increasing importance in scientific
high-performance computing to reduce development costs, raise the level of
abstraction and, thus, ease scientific programming. However, designing and
implementing DSLs is not an easy task, as it requires knowledge of the
application domain and experience in language engineering and compilers.
Consequently, many DSLs follow a weak approach using macros or text generators,
which lack many of the features that make a DSL a comfortable for programmers.
Some of these features---e.g., syntax highlighting, type inference, error
reporting, and code completion---are easily provided by language workbenches,
which combine language engineering techniques and tools in a common ecosystem.
In this paper, we present the Parallel Particle-Mesh Environment (PPME), a DSL
and development environment for numerical simulations based on particle methods
and hybrid particle-mesh methods. PPME uses the meta programming system (MPS),
a projectional language workbench. PPME is the successor of the Parallel
Particle-Mesh Language (PPML), a Fortran-based DSL that used conventional
implementation strategies. We analyze and compare both languages and
demonstrate how the programmer's experience can be improved using static
analyses and projectional editing. Furthermore, we present an explicit domain
model for particle abstractions and the first formal type system for particle
methods.

 <dc:description>  We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a
deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views
of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in
our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance
metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the
view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance
between the representations of different views of the same object without
compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects,
resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects
within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the
model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category,
independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the
trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained
categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic
objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance
metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels
of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced
during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature
representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match
human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object
persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual
similarity judgment in biological neural networks.

 <dc:description>  Registration involving one or more images containing pathologies is
challenging, as standard image similarity measures and spatial transforms
cannot account for common changes due to pathologies. Low-rank/Sparse (LRS)
decomposition removes pathologies prior to registration; however, LRS is
memory-demanding and slow, which limits its use on larger data sets.
Additionally, LRS blurs normal tissue regions, which may degrade registration
performance. This paper proposes an efficient alternative to LRS: (1) normal
tissue appearance is captured by principal component analysis (PCA) and (2)
blurring is avoided by an integrated model for pathology removal and image
reconstruction. Results on synthetic and BRATS 2015 data demonstrate its
utility.

 <dc:title>Comparison of ontology alignment algorithms across single matching task

 <dc:description>  Ontology alignment is widely used to find the correspondences between
different ontologies in diverse fields. After discovering the alignment by
methods, several performance scores are available to evaluate them. The scores
require the produced alignment by a method and the reference alignment
containing the underlying actual correspondences of the given ontologies. The
current trend in alignment evaluation is to put forward a new score and to
compare various alignments by juxtaposing their performance scores. However, it
is substantially provocative to select one performance score among others for
comparison. On top of that, claiming if one method has a better performance
than one another can not be substantiated by solely comparing the scores. In
this paper, we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to
theoretically favor one method over one another. The McNemar test is considered
as a reliable and suitable means for comparing two ontology alignment methods
over one matching task. The test applies to a 2 x 2 contingency table which can
be constructed in two different ways based on the alignments, each of which has
their own merits/pitfalls. The ways of the contingency table construction and
various apposite statistics from the McNemar test are elaborated in minute
detail. In the case of having more than two alignment methods for comparison,
the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. Thus, the ways of preventing
such an error are also discussed. A directed graph visualizes the outcome of
the McNemar test in the presence of multiple alignment methods. From this
graph, it is readily understood if one method is better than one another or if
their differences are imperceptible. Our investigation on the methods
participated in the anatomy track of OAEI 2016 demonstrates that AML and
CroMatcher are the top two methods and DKP-AOM and Alin are the bottom two
ones.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes to tackle open- domain question answering using Wikipedia
as the unique knowledge source: the answer to any factoid question is a text
span in a Wikipedia article. This task of machine reading at scale combines the
challenges of document retrieval (finding the relevant articles) with that of
machine comprehension of text (identifying the answer spans from those
articles). Our approach combines a search component based on bigram hashing and
TF-IDF matching with a multi-layer recurrent neural network model trained to
detect answers in Wikipedia paragraphs. Our experiments on multiple existing QA
datasets indicate that (1) both modules are highly competitive with respect to
existing counterparts and (2) multitask learning using distant supervision on
their combination is an effective complete system on this challenging task.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel cross-lingual transfer method for paradigm completion, the
task of mapping a lemma to its inflected forms, using a neural encoder-decoder
model, the state of the art for the monolingual task. We use labeled data from
a high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In
experiments on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we
obtain up to 58% higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even
zero-shot and one-shot learning are possible. We further find that the degree
of language relatedness strongly influences the ability to transfer
morphological knowledge.

http://datasets.maluuba.com/Frames), a corpus of 1369 human-human dialogues
with an average of 15 turns per dialogue. We developed this dataset to study
the role of memory in goal-oriented dialogue systems. Based on Frames, we
introduce a task called frame tracking, which extends state tracking to a
setting where several states are tracked simultaneously. We propose a baseline
model for this task. We show that Frames can also be used to study memory in
dialogue management and information presentation through natural language
generation.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of battery-powered mobile
devices, e.g., smartphones, tablets, sensors, and laptops, which leads a
significant demand for high capacity wireless communication with high energy
efficiency. Among technologies to provide the efficiency is full-duplex
wireless communication. Full-duplex wireless enhances capacity by
simultaneously transmitting uplink and downlink data with limited frequency
resources. Previous studies on full-duplex wireless mostly focuses on doubling
the network capacity, whereas in this paper we discuss that full-duplex
wireless can also provide higher energy efficiency. We propose low power
communication by wireless full-duplexing (LPFD), focusing on the fact that the
full-duplex communication duration becomes half of the halfduplex communication
duration. In the LPFD, by using the sleep state in which the transceiver
provided in the wireless communication terminal is turned off, power
consumption of the wireless communication terminal is reduced and energy
efficiency in wireless full duplex is improved. Simulation results show that
the energy efficiency achieved by LPFD is up to approximately 17.3 times higher
than the energy efficiency achieved by existing full-duplex medium access
protocol. Further, it is up to approximately 27.5 times higher than the energy
efficiency using power saving mode of half-duplex communication.

 <dc:description>  A full squashed flat antichain (FSFA) in the Boolean lattice $B_n$ is a
family $\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{B}$ of subsets of $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ such
that, for some $k\in [n]$ and $0\le m\le \binom n k$, $\mathcal{A}$ is the
family of the first $m$ $k$-sets in squashed (reverse-lexicographic) order and
$\mathcal{B}$ contains exactly those $(k-1)$-subsets of $[n]$ that are not
contained in some $A\in\mathcal{A}$. If, in addition, every $k$-subset of $[n]$
which is not in $\mathcal{A}$ contains some $B\in\mathcal{B}$, then
$\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{B}$ is a maximal squashed flat antichain (MSFA). For
any $n,k$ and positive real numbers $\alpha,\beta$, we determine all FSFA and
all MSFA of minimum weight $\alpha\cdot|\mathcal{A}|+\beta\cdot|\mathcal{B}|$.
Based on this, asymptotic results on MSFA with minimum size and minimum BLYM
value, respectively, are derived.

 <dc:description>  Interconnected smart vehicles offer a range of sophisticated services that
benefit the vehicle owners, transport authorities, car manufacturers and other
service providers. This potentially exposes smart vehicles to a range of
security and privacy threats such as location tracking or remote hijacking of
the vehicle. In this article, we argue that BlockChain (BC), a disruptive
technology that has found many applications from cryptocurrencies to smart
contracts, is a potential solution to these challenges. We propose a BC-based
architecture to protect the privacy of the users and to increase the security
of the vehicular ecosystem. Wireless remote software updates and other emerging
services such as dynamic vehicle insurance fees, are used to illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed security architecture. We also qualitatively argue the
resilience of the architecture against common security attacks.

 <dc:title>What Is the Best Way For Developers to Learn New Software Tools? An
  Empirical Comparison Between a Text and a Video Tutorial</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The better developers can learn software tools, the faster they can start
using them and the more efficiently they can later work with them. Tutorials
are supposed to help here. While in the early days of computing, mostly text
tutorials were available, nowadays software developers can choose among a huge
number of tutorials for almost any popular software tool. However, only little
research was conducted to understand how text tutorials differ from other
tutorials, which tutorial types are preferred and, especially, which tutorial
types yield the best learning experience in terms of efficiency and
effectiveness, especially for programmers. To evaluate these questions, we
converted an existing video tutorial for a novel software tool into a
content-equivalent text tutorial. We then conducted an experiment in three
groups where 42 undergraduate students from a software engineering course were
commissioned to operate the software tool after using a tutorial: the first
group was provided only with the video tutorial, the second group only with the
text tutorial and the third group with both. In this context, the differences
in terms of efficiency were almost negligible: We could observe that
participants using only the text tutorial completed the tutorial faster than
the participants with the video tutorial. However, the participants using only
the video tutorial applied the learned content faster, achieving roughly the
same bottom line performance. We also found that if both tutorial types are
offered, participants prefer video tutorials for learning new content but text
tutorials for looking up &quot;missed&quot; information. We mainly gathered our data
through questionnaires and screen recordings and analyzed it with suitable
statistical hypotheses tests. The data is available at [12]. Since producing
tutorials requires effort, knowing with which type of tutorial learnability can
be increased to which extent has an immense practical relevance. We conclude
that in contexts similar to ours, while it would be ideal if software tool
makers would offer both tutorial types, it seems more efficient to produce only
text tutorials instead of a passive video tutorial - provided you manage to
motivate your learners to use them.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a geodesic-distance-based feature that encodes global
information for improved video segmentation algorithms. The feature is a joint
histogram of intensity and geodesic distances, where the geodesic distances are
computed as the shortest paths between superpixels via their boundaries. We
also incorporate adaptive voting weights and spatial pyramid configurations to
include spatial information into the geodesic histogram feature and show that
this further improves results. The feature is generic and can be used as part
of various algorithms. In experiments, we test the geodesic histogram feature
by incorporating it into two existing video segmentation frameworks. This leads
to significantly better performance in 3D video segmentation benchmarks on two
datasets.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of planning a tour for an energy-limited Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) to visit a set of sites in the least amount of time. We envision
scenarios where the UAV can be recharged along the way either by landing on
stationary recharging stations or on Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) acting as
mobile recharging stations. This leads to a new variant of the Traveling
Salesperson Problem (TSP) with mobile recharging stations. We present an
algorithm that finds not only the order in which to visit the sites but also
when and where to land on the charging stations to recharge. Our algorithm
plans tours for the UGVs as well as determines best locations to place
stationary charging stations. While the problems we study are NP-Hard, we
present a practical solution using Generalized TSP that finds the optimal
solution. If the UGVs are slower, the algorithm also finds the minimum number
of UGVs required to support the UAV mission such that the UAV is not required
to wait for the UGV. Our simulation results show that the running time is
acceptable for reasonably sized instances in practice.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents simpler specifications of more complex variants of the
Paxos algorithm for distributed consensus, as a case study of high-level
specification of distributed algorithms. The development of the specifications
uses a method and language for expressing complex control flows and
synchronization conditions precisely at a high level.
  We show that English and pseudocode descriptions of algorithms can be
captured precisely at a high level, yielding clearer and simpler specifications
than ever before. The resulting specifications have allowed us to easily
discover a main liveness violation that was unknown in a previous
specification. We also show that the resulting specifications can be executed
directly and optimized cleanly, yielding drastic performance improvement.
Finally, we show that the resulting specifications can be formally verified
using a proof system, with proofs an order of magnitude smaller than prior
proofs, and allowing us to detect and fix a subtle safety violation that was
unknown in an early specification.

 <dc:description>  Adaptive tracking-by-detection approaches are popular for tracking arbitrary
objects. They treat the tracking problem as a classification task and use
online learning techniques to update the object model. However, these
approaches are heavily invested in the efficiency and effectiveness of their
detectors. Evaluating a massive number of samples for each frame (e.g.,
obtained by a sliding window) forces the detector to trade the accuracy in
favor of speed. Furthermore, misclassification of borderline samples in the
detector introduce accumulating errors in tracking. In this study, we propose a
co-tracking based on the efficient cooperation of two detectors: a rapid
adaptive exemplar-based detector and another more sophisticated but slower
detector with a long-term memory. The sampling labeling and co-learning of the
detectors are conducted by an uncertainty sampling unit, which improves the
speed and accuracy of the system. We also introduce a budgeting mechanism which
prevents the unbounded growth in the number of examples in the first detector
to maintain its rapid response. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of the proposed tracker against its baselines and its superior
performance against state-of-the-art trackers on various benchmark videos.

 <dc:title>Optimal Reconstruction with a Small Number of Views</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Estimating positions of world points from features observed in images is a
key problem in 3D reconstruction, image mosaicking, simultaneous localization
and mapping and structure from motion. We consider a special instance in which
there is a dominant ground plane $\mathcal{G}$ viewed from a parallel viewing
plane $\mathcal{S}$ above it. Such instances commonly arise, for example, in
aerial photography.
  Consider a world point $g \in \mathcal{G}$ and its worst case reconstruction
uncertainty $\varepsilon(g,\mathcal{S})$ obtained by merging \emph{all}
possible views of $g$ chosen from $\mathcal{S}$. We first show that one can
pick two views $s_p$ and $s_q$ such that the uncertainty
$\varepsilon(g,\{s_p,s_q\})$ obtained using only these two views is almost as
good as (i.e. within a small constant factor of) $\varepsilon(g,\mathcal{S})$.
Next, we extend the result to the entire ground plane $\mathcal{G}$ and show
that one can pick a small subset of $\mathcal{S'} \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ (which
grows only linearly with the area of $\mathcal{G}$) and still obtain a constant
factor approximation, for every point $g \in \mathcal{G}$, to the minimum worst
case estimate obtained by merging all views in $\mathcal{S}$.
  Our results provide a view selection mechanism with provable performance
guarantees which can drastically increase the speed of scene reconstruction
algorithms. In addition to theoretical results, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an application where aerial imagery is used for monitoring
farms and orchards.

 <dc:description>  We propose an automatic method to infer high dynamic range illumination from
a single, limited field-of-view, low dynamic range photograph of an indoor
scene. In contrast to previous work that relies on specialized image capture,
user input, and/or simple scene models, we train an end-to-end deep neural
network that directly regresses a limited field-of-view photo to HDR
illumination, without strong assumptions on scene geometry, material
properties, or lighting. We show that this can be accomplished in a three step
process: 1) we train a robust lighting classifier to automatically annotate the
location of light sources in a large dataset of LDR environment maps, 2) we use
these annotations to train a deep neural network that predicts the location of
lights in a scene from a single limited field-of-view photo, and 3) we
fine-tune this network using a small dataset of HDR environment maps to predict
light intensities. This allows us to automatically recover high-quality HDR
illumination estimates that significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art
methods. Consequently, using our illumination estimates for applications like
3D object insertion, we can achieve results that are photo-realistic, which is
validated via a perceptual user study.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies a problem of inverse visual path planning: creating a
visual scene from a first person action. Our conjecture is that the spatial
arrangement of a first person visual scene is deployed to afford an action, and
therefore, the action can be inversely used to synthesize a new scene such that
the action is feasible. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on linking visual
experiences induced by walking.
  A key innovation of this paper is a concept of ActionTunnel---a 3D virtual
tunnel along the future trajectory encoding what the wearer will visually
experience as moving into the scene. This connects two distinctive first person
images through similar walking paths. Our method takes a first person image
with a user defined future trajectory and outputs a new image that can afford
the future motion. The image is created by combining present and future
ActionTunnels in 3D where the missing pixels in adjoining area are computed by
a generative adversarial network. Our work can provide a travel across
different first person experiences in diverse real world scenes.

Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme for uncertainty propagation, and a
variant, the Laugesen-Mehta-Meyn-Raginsky (LMMR) scheme for filtering. We point
out that these variational schemes can be understood as proximal operators in
the space of density functions, realizing gradient flows. These schemes hold
the promise of leading to efficient ways for solving the Fokker-Planck equation
as well as the equations of non-linear filtering. Our aim in this paper is to
develop in detail the underlying ideas in the setting of linear stochastic
systems with Gaussian noise and recover known results.

 <dc:description>  We describe a method to produce a network where current methods such as
DeepFool have great difficulty producing adversarial samples. Our construction
suggests some insights into how deep networks work. We provide a reasonable
analyses that our construction is difficult to defeat, and show experimentally
that our method is hard to defeat with both Type I and Type II attacks using
several standard networks and datasets. This SafetyNet architecture is used to
an important and novel application SceneProof, which can reliably detect
whether an image is a picture of a real scene or not. SceneProof applies to
images captured with depth maps (RGBD images) and checks if a pair of image and
depth map is consistent. It relies on the relative difficulty of producing
naturalistic depth maps for images in post processing. We demonstrate that our
SafetyNet is robust to adversarial examples built from currently known
attacking approaches.

 <dc:description>  Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to
enable low-latency and location-aware data processing at the edge of mobile
networks. Since providing grid power supply in support of MEC can be costly and
even infeasible in some scenarios, on-site renewable energy is mandated as a
major or even sole power supply. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and
unpredictability of energy harvesting creates many new challenges of performing
effective MEC. In this paper, we develop an algorithm called GLOBE that
performs joint geographical load balancing (GLB) and admission control for
optimizing the system performance of a network of MEC-enabled and energy
harvesting-powered base stations. By leveraging and extending the Lyapunov
optimization with perturbation technique, GLOBE operates online without
requiring future system information and addresses significant challenges caused
by battery state dynamics and energy causality constraints. Moreover, GLOBE
works in a distributed manner, which makes our algorithm scalable to large
networks. We prove that GLOBE achieves a close-to-optimal system performance
compared to the offline algorithm that knows full future information, and
present a critical tradeoff between battery capacity and system performance.
Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate the superior
performance of GLOBE compared to benchmark algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by e-commerce, we study the online assortment optimization problem.
The seller offers an assortment, i.e. a subset of products, to each arriving
customer, who then purchases one or no product from her offered assortment. A
customer's purchase decision is governed by the underlying MultiNomial Logit
(MNL) choice model. The seller aims to maximize the total revenue in a finite
sales horizon, subject to resource constraints and uncertainty in the MNL
choice model. We first propose an efficient online policy which incurs a regret
$\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, where $T$ is the number of customers in the sales
horizon. Then, we propose a UCB policy that achieves a regret
$\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$. Both regret bounds are sublinear in the number of
assortments.

 <dc:description>  Ensembles of neural networks are known to be much more robust and accurate
than individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model
averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to
obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks
at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single
neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path
and saving the model parameters. To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we
leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting
technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet
surprisingly effective. We show in a series of experiments that our approach is
compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It
consistently yields lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no
additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network
ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain
error rates of 3.4% and 17.4% respectively.

 <dc:description>  We propose the configurable rendering of massive quantities of photorealistic
images with ground truth for the purposes of training, benchmarking, and
diagnosing computer vision models. In contrast to the conventional
(crowd-sourced) manual labeling of ground truth for a relatively modest number
of RGB-D images captured by Kinect-like sensors, we devise a non-trivial
configurable pipeline of algorithms capable of generating a potentially
infinite variety of indoor scenes using a stochastic grammar, specifically, one
represented by an attributed spatial And-Or graph. We employ physics-based
rendering to synthesize photorealistic RGB images while automatically
synthesizing detailed, per-pixel ground truth data, including visible surface
depth and normal, object identity and material information, as well as
illumination. Our pipeline is configurable inasmuch as it enables the precise
customization and control of important attributes of the generated scenes. We
demonstrate that our generated scenes achieve a performance similar to the NYU
v2 Dataset on pre-trained deep learning models. By modifying pipeline
components in a controllable manner, we furthermore provide diagnostics on
common scene understanding tasks; eg., depth and surface normal prediction,
semantic segmentation, etc.

for additional analysis, processing, and quality data extraction. The resulting
contexts allow for the representation of dimensions, and multidimensional data
quality assessment becomes possible. At the core of a multidimensional context
we include a generalized multidimensional data model and a Datalog+/- ontology
with provably good properties in terms of query answering. These main
components are used to represent dimension hierarchies, dimensional
constraints, dimensional rules, and define predicates for quality data
specification. Query answering relies upon and triggers navigation through
dimension hierarchies, and becomes the basic tool for the extraction of quality
data. The OMD model is interesting per se, beyond applications to data quality.
It allows for a logic-based, and computationally tractable representation of
multidimensional data, extending previous multidimensional data models with
additional expressive power and functionalities.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the stochastic limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) algorithm. By
proposing a new framework for the convergence analysis, we prove improved
convergence rates and computational complexities of the stochastic L-BFGS
algorithms compared to previous works. In addition, we propose several
practical acceleration strategies to speed up the empirical performance of such
algorithms. We also provide theoretical analyses for most of the strategies.
Experiments on large-scale logistic and ridge regression problems demonstrate
that our proposed strategies yield significant improvements vis-\`a-vis
competing state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Global recruitment into radical Islamic movements has spurred renewed
interest in the appeal of political extremism. Is the appeal a rational
response to material conditions or is it the expression of psychological and
personality disorders associated with aggressive behavior, intolerance,
conspiratorial imagination, and paranoia? Empirical answers using surveys have
been limited by lack of access to extremist groups, while field studies have
lacked psychological measures and failed to compare extremists with contrast
groups. We revisit the debate over the appeal of extremism in the U.S. context
by comparing publicly available Twitter messages written by over 355,000
political extremist followers with messages written by non-extremist U.S.
users. Analysis of text-based psychological indicators supports the moral
foundation theory which identifies emotion as a critical factor in determining
political orientation of individuals. Extremist followers also differ from
others in four of the Big Five personality traits.

 <dc:description>  Baker devised a powerful technique to obtain approximation schemes for
various problems restricted to planar graphs. Her technique can be directly
extended to various other graph classes, among the most general ones the graphs
avoiding a fixed apex graph as a minor. Further generalizations (e.g., to all
proper minor closed graph classes) are known, but they use a combination of
techniques and usually focus on somewhat restricted classes of problems. We
present a new type of graph decompositions (thin systems of overlays)
generalizing Baker's technique and leading to straightforward polynomial-time
approximation schemes. We also show that many graph classes (all proper
minor-closed classes, and all subgraph-closed classes with bounded maximum
degree and strongly sublinear separators) admit such decompositions.

 <dc:description>  Programming languages themselves have a limited number of reserved keywords
and character based tokens that define the language specification. However,
programmers have a rich use of natural language within their code through
comments, text literals and naming entities. The programmer defined names that
can be found in source code are a rich source of information to build a high
level understanding of the project. The goal of this paper is to apply topic
modeling to names used in over 13.6 million repositories and perceive the
inferred topics. One of the problems in such a study is the occurrence of
duplicate repositories not officially marked as forks (obscure forks). We show
how to address it using the same identifiers which are extracted for topic
modeling.
  We open with a discussion on naming in source code, we then elaborate on our
approach to remove exact duplicate and fuzzy duplicate repositories using
Locality Sensitive Hashing on the bag-of-words model and then discuss our work
on topic modeling; and finally present the results from our data analysis
together with open-access to the source code, tools and datasets.

 <dc:description>  Of late, weakly supervised object detection is with great importance in
object recognition. Based on deep learning, weakly supervised detectors have
achieved many promising results. However, compared with fully supervised
detection, it is more challenging to train deep network based detectors in a
weakly supervised manner. Here we formulate weakly supervised detection as a
Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, where instance classifiers (object
detectors) are put into the network as hidden nodes. We propose a novel online
instance classifier refinement algorithm to integrate MIL and the instance
classifier refinement procedure into a single deep network, and train the
network end-to-end with only image-level supervision, i.e., without object
location information. More precisely, instance labels inferred from weak
supervision are propagated to their spatially overlapped instances to refine
instance classifier online. The iterative instance classifier refinement
procedure is implemented using multiple streams in deep network, where each
stream supervises its latter stream. Weakly supervised object detection
experiments are carried out on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012
benchmarks. We obtain 47% mAP on VOC 2007 that significantly outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Users of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter rely on crowdsourced
content recommendation systems (e.g., Trending Topics) to retrieve important
and useful information. Contents selected for recommendation indirectly give
the initial users who promoted (by liking or posting) the content an
opportunity to propagate their messages to a wider audience. Hence, it is
important to understand the demographics of people who make a content worthy of
recommendation, and explore whether they are representative of the media site's
overall population. In this work, using extensive data collected from Twitter,
we make the first attempt to quantify and explore the demographic biases in the
crowdsourced recommendations. Our analysis, focusing on the selection of
trending topics, finds that a large fraction of trends are promoted by crowds
whose demographics are significantly different from the overall Twitter
population. More worryingly, we find that certain demographic groups are
systematically under-represented among the promoters of the trending topics. To
make the demographic biases in Twitter trends more transparent, we developed
and deployed a Web-based service 'Who-Makes-Trends' at
twitter-app.mpi-sws.org/who-makes-trends.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a novel algorithm to combine two or more cellular
complexes, providing a minimal fragmentation of the cells of the resulting
complex. We introduce here the idea of arrangement generated by a collection of
cellular complexes, producing a cellular decomposition of the embedding space.
The algorithm that executes this computation is called \emph{Merge} of
complexes. The arrangements of line segments in 2D and polygons in 3D are
special cases, as well as the combination of closed triangulated surfaces or
meshed models. This algorithm has several important applications, including
Boolean and other set operations over large geometric models, the extraction of
solid models of biomedical structures at the cellular scale, the detailed
geometric modeling of buildings, the combination of 3D meshes, and the repair
of graphical models. The algorithm is efficiently implemented using the Linear
Algebraic Representation (LAR) of argument complexes, i.e., on sparse
representation of binary characteristic matrices of $d$-cell bases, well-suited
for implementation in last generation accelerators and GPGPU applications.

However, only in this century they were stated, proved and applied to obtain
interesting results, most notably by Mabillard and Wagner. Here we prove and
apply a version of the $r$-fold Whitney trick when general position $r$-tuple
intersections have positive dimension.
  Theorem. Assume that $D=D_1\sqcup\ldots\sqcup D_r$ is disjoint union of
$k$-dimensional disks, $rd\ge (r+1)k+3$, and $f:D\to B^d$ a proper PL (smooth)
map such that $f\partial D_1\cap\ldots\cap f\partial D_r=\emptyset$. If the map
$$f^r:\partial(D_1\times\ldots\times D_r)\to
(B^d)^r-\{(x,x,\ldots,x)\in(B^d)^r\ |\ x\in B^d\}$$ extends to
$D_1\times\ldots\times D_r$, then there is a proper PL (smooth) map $\overline
f:D\to B^d$ such that $\overline f=f$ on $\partial D$ and $\overline
fD_1\cap\ldots\cap \overline fD_r=\emptyset$.

 <dc:description>  We address in this paper the problem of modifying both profits and costs of a
fractional knapsack problem optimally such that a prespecified solution becomes
an optimal solution with prespect to new parameters. This problem is called the
inverse fractional knapsack problem. Concerning the $l_1$-norm, we first prove
that the problem is NP-hard. The problem can be however solved in quadratic
time if we only modify profit parameters. Additionally, we develop a
quadratic-time algorithm that solves the inverse fractional knapsack problem
under $l_\infty$-norm.

people in such environment using just the ubiquitous geomagnetic field sensor
on the smart phone. Essentially, given that all passengers must share the same
journey between at least two consecutive stations, we have a long window to
match the user trajectory. Our idea was assessed over a painstakingly survey of
over 150 kilometres of travelling distance, covering different parts of London,
using the overground trains, the underground tubes and the buses.

 <dc:description>  Research on recommender systems is a challenging task, as is building and
operating such systems. Major challenges include non-reproducible research
results, dealing with noisy data, and answering many questions such as how many
recommendations to display, how often, and, of course, how to generate
recommendations most effectively. In the past six years, we built three
research-article recommender systems for digital libraries and reference
managers, and conducted research on these systems. In this paper, we share some
experiences we made during that time. Among others, we discuss the required
skills to build recommender systems, and why the literature provides little
help in identifying promising recommendation approaches. We explain the
challenge in creating a randomization engine to run A/B tests, and how low data
quality impacts the calculation of bibliometrics. We further discuss why
several of our experiments delivered disappointing results, and provide
statistics on how many researchers showed interest in our recommendation
dataset.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel validation framework to measure the true robustness of
learning models for real-world applications by creating source-inclusive and
source-exclusive partitions in a dataset via clustering. We develop a
robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model
accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly
demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging
training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework
for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning
model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings
not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model
complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize
their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more
challenging class labels.

 <dc:description>  Regression based methods are not performing as well as detection based
methods for human pose estimation. A central problem is that the structural
information in the pose is not well exploited in the previous regression
methods. In this work, we propose a structure-aware regression approach. It
adopts a reparameterized pose representation using bones instead of joints. It
exploits the joint connection structure to define a compositional loss function
that encodes the long range interactions in the pose. It is simple, effective,
and general for both 2D and 3D pose estimation in a unified setting.
Comprehensive evaluation validates the effectiveness of our approach. It
significantly advances the state-of-the-art on Human3.6M and is competitive
with state-of-the-art results on MPII.

 <dc:description>  By offloading intensive computation tasks to the edge cloud located at the
cellular base stations, mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) has been
regarded as a promising means to accomplish the ambitious millisecond-scale
end-to-end latency requirement of the fifth-generation networks. In this paper,
we investigate the latency-minimization problem in a multi-user time-division
multiple access MECO system with joint communication and computation resource
allocation. Three different computation models are studied, i.e., local
compression, edge cloud compression, and partial compression offloading. First,
closed-form expressions of optimal resource allocation and minimum system delay
for both local and edge cloud compression models are derived. Then, for the
partial compression offloading model, we formulate a piecewise optimization
problem and prove that the optimal data segmentation strategy has a piecewise
structure. Based on this result, an optimal joint communication and computation
resource allocation algorithm is developed. To gain more insights, we also
analyze a specific scenario where communication resource is adequate while
computation resource is limited. In this special case, the closed-form solution
of the piecewise optimization problem can be derived. Our proposed algorithms
are finally verified by numerical results, which show that the novel partial
compression offloading model can significantly reduce the end-to-end latency.

 <dc:description>  Socio-technical systems play an important role in public health screening
programs to prevent cancer. Cervical cancer incidence has significantly
decreased in countries that developed systems for organized screening engaging
medical practitioners, laboratories and patients. The system automatically
identifies individuals at risk of developing the disease and invites them for a
screening exam or a follow-up exam conducted by medical professionals. A triage
algorithm in the system aims to reduce unnecessary screening exams for
individuals at low-risk while detecting and treating individuals at high-risk.
Despite the general success of screening, the triage algorithm is a
one-size-fits all approach that is not personalized to a patient. This can
easily be observed in historical data from screening exams. Often patients rely
on personal factors to determine that they are either at high risk or not at
risk at all and take action at their own discretion. Can exploring patient
trajectories help hypothesize personal factors leading to their decisions? We
present Portinari, a data exploration tool to query and visualize future
trajectories of patients who have undergone a specific sequence of screening
exams. The web-based tool contains (a) a visual query interface (b) a backend
graph database of events in patients' lives (c) trajectory visualization using
sankey diagrams. We use Portinari to explore diverse trajectories of patients
following the Norwegian triage algorithm. The trajectories demonstrated
variable degrees of adherence to the triage algorithm and allowed
epidemiologists to hypothesize about the possible causes.

 <dc:title>Sentiment Analysis of Citations Using Word2vec</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Haixia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Citation sentiment analysis is an important task in scientific paper
analysis. Existing machine learning techniques for citation sentiment analysis
are focusing on labor-intensive feature engineering, which requires large
annotated corpus. As an automatic feature extraction tool, word2vec has been
successfully applied to sentiment analysis of short texts. In this work, I
conducted empirical research with the question: how well does word2vec work on
the sentiment analysis of citations? The proposed method constructed sentence
vectors (sent2vec) by averaging the word embeddings, which were learned from
Anthology Collections (ACL-Embeddings). I also investigated polarity-specific
word embeddings (PS-Embeddings) for classifying positive and negative
citations. The sentence vectors formed a feature space, to which the examined
citation sentence was mapped to. Those features were input into classifiers
(support vector machines) for supervised classification. Using
10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on a set of annotated
citations. The results showed that word embeddings are effective on classifying
positive and negative citations. However, hand-crafted features performed
better for the overall classification.

 <dc:description>  Many of the state-of-the-art algorithms for gesture recognition are based on
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Successful approaches, such as the
Latent-Dynamic CRFs, extend the CRF by incorporating latent variables, whose
values are mapped to the values of the labels. In this paper we propose a novel
methodology to set the latent values according to the gesture complexity. We
use an heuristic that iterates through the samples associated with each label
value, stimating their complexity. We then use it to assign the latent values
to the label values. We evaluate our method on the task of recognizing human
gestures from video streams. The experiments were performed in binary datasets,
generated by grouping different labels. Our results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the arbitrary one in many cases, increasing the accuracy
by up to 10%.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the structural controllability of the systems over F(z) is
studied using a new mathematical method-matroids. Firstly, a vector matroid is
defined over F(z). Secondly, the full rank conditions of [sI-A|B] are derived
in terms of the concept related to matroid theory, such as rank, base and
union. Then the sufficient condition for the linear system and composite system
over F(z) to be structurally controllable is obtained. Finally, this paper
gives several examples to demonstrate that the married-theoretic approach is
simpler than other existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this manuscript is to derive new convergence results for
several subgradient methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions with
H\&quot;olderian growth. The growth condition is satisfied in many applications and
includes functions with quadratic growth and functions with weakly sharp minima
as special cases. To this end there are four main contributions. First, for a
constant and sufficiently small stepsize, we show that the subgradient method
achieves linear convergence up to a certain region including the optimal set
with error of the order of the stepsize. Second, we derive nonergodic
convergence rates for the subgradient method under nonsummable decaying
stepsizes. Thirdly if appropriate problem parameters are known we derive a
possibly-summable stepsize which obtains a much faster convergence rate.
Finally we develop a novel &quot;descending stairs&quot; stepsize which obtains this
faster convergence rate but also obtains linear convergence for the special
case of weakly sharp functions. We also develop a variant of the &quot;descending
stairs&quot; stepsize which achieves essentially the same convergence rate without
requiring an error bound constant which is difficult to estimate in practice.

 <dc:description>  While multimodal conversation agents are gaining importance in several
domains such as retail, travel etc., deep learning research in this area has
been limited primarily due to the lack of availability of large-scale, open
chatlogs. To overcome this bottleneck, in this paper we introduce the task of
multimodal, domain-aware conversations, and propose the MMD benchmark dataset.
This dataset was gathered by working in close coordination with large number of
domain experts in the retail domain and consists of over 150K conversation
sessions between shoppers and sales agents, with over 6.5Million utterances.
With this dataset, we propose 5 new sub-tasks for multimodal conversations
along with their evaluation methodology. We also propose two novel multimodal
neural models in the encode-attend-decode paradigm and demonstrate their
performance on two of the sub-tasks, namely text response generation and best
image response selection. These experiments serve to establish baseline
performance and open new research directions for each of these sub-tasks.

 <dc:description>  Keyword search provides ordinary users an easy-to-use interface for querying
RDF data. Given the input keywords, in this paper, we study how to assemble a
query graph that is to represent user's query intention accurately and
efficiently. Based on the input keywords, we first obtain the elementary query
graph building blocks, such as entity/class vertices and predicate edges. Then,
we formally define the query graph assembly (QGA) problem. Unfortunately, we
prove theoretically that QGA is a NP-complete problem. In order to solve that,
we design some heuristic lower bounds and propose a bipartite graph
matching-based best-first search algorithm. The algorithm's time complexity is
$O(k^{2l} \cdot l^{3l})$, where $l$ is the number of the keywords and $k$ is a
tunable parameter, i.e., the maximum number of candidate entity/class vertices
and predicate edges allowed to match each keyword. Although QGA is intractable,
both $l$ and $k$ are small in practice. Furthermore, the algorithm's time
complexity does not depend on the RDF graph size, which guarantees the good
scalability of our system in large RDF graphs. Experiments on DBpedia and
Freebase confirm the superiority of our system on both effectiveness and
efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Background: Component-based modeling language Modelica (OpenModelica is open
source implementation) is used for the numerical simulation of complex
processes of different nature represented by ODE system. However, in
OpenModelica standard library there is no routines for pseudo-random numbers
generation, which makes it impossible to use for stochastic modeling processes.
Purpose: The goal of this article is a brief overview of a number of algorithms
for generation a sequence of uniformly distributed pseudo random numbers and
quality assessment of the sequence given by them, as well as the ways to
implement some of these algorithms in OpenModelica system. Methods: All the
algorithms are implemented in C language, and the results of their work tested
using open source package DieHarder. For those algorithms that do not use bit
operations, we describe there realisation using OpwnModelica. The other
algorithms can be called in OpenModelica as C functions Results: We have
implemented and tested about nine algorithms. DieHarder testing revealed the
highest quality pseudo-random number generators. Also we have reviewed
libraries Noise and AdvancedNoise, who claim to be adding to the Modelica
Standard Library. Conclusions: In OpenModelica system can be implemented
generators of uniformly distributed pseudo-random numbers, which is the first
step towards to make OpenModelica suitable for simulation of stochastic
processes.

 <dc:description>  Implicit discourse relation classification is of great challenge due to the
lack of connectives as strong linguistic cues, which motivates the use of
annotated implicit connectives to improve the recognition. We propose a feature
imitation framework in which an implicit relation network is driven to learn
from another neural network with access to connectives, and thus encouraged to
extract similarly salient features for accurate classification. We develop an
adversarial model to enable an adaptive imitation scheme through competition
between the implicit network and a rival feature discriminator. Our method
effectively transfers discriminability of connectives to the implicit features,
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PDTB benchmark.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of fair allocation for indivisible goods. We use the the
maxmin share paradigm introduced by Budish as a measure for fairness. Procaccia
and Wang (EC'14) were first to investigate this fundamental problem in the
additive setting. In contrast to what real-world experiments suggest, they show
that a maxmin guarantee (1-MMS allocation) is not always possible even when the
number of agents is limited to 3. While the existence of an approximation
solution (e.g. a $1/2$-MMS allocation) is quite straightforward, improving the
guarantee becomes subtler for larger constants. Procaccia provide a proof for
existence of a $2/3$-MMS allocation and leave the question open for better
guarantees.
  Our main contribution is an answer to the above question. We improve the
result of [Procaccia and Wang] to a $3/4$ factor in the additive setting. The
main idea for our $3/4$-MMS allocation method is clustering the agents. To this
end, we introduce three notions and techniques, namely reducibility, matching
allocation, and cycle-envy-freeness, and prove the approximation guarantee of
our algorithm via non-trivial applications of these techniques. Our analysis
involves coloring and double counting arguments that might be of independent
interest.
  One major shortcoming of the current studies on fair allocation is the
additivity assumption on the valuations. We alleviate this by extending our
results to the case of submodular, fractionally subadditive, and subadditive
settings. More precisely, we give constant approximation guarantees for
submodular and XOS agents, and a logarithmic approximation for the case of
subadditive agents. Furthermore, we complement our results by providing close
upper bounds for each class of valuation functions. Finally, we present
algorithms to find such allocations for additive, submodular, and XOS settings
in polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  In this paper two sequential algorithms for learning analysis operators are
presented, which are built upon the same optimisation principle underlying both
Analysis K-SVD and Analysis SimCO and use a stochastic gradient descent
approach similar to ASimCO. The sequential analysis operator learning (SAOL)
algorithm is based on projected gradient descent with an appropriately chosen
step size while the implicit SAOL (ISAOL) algorithm avoids choosing a step size
altogether by using a strategy inspired by the implicit Euler scheme for
solving ordinary differential equations. Both algorithms are tested on
synthetic and image data in comparison to Analysis SimCO and found to give
slightly better recovery rates resp. decay of the objective function. In a
final denoising experiment the presented algorithms are again shown to perform
well in comparison to the state of the art algorithm ASimCO.

 <dc:description>  We construct a dense point set of $n$ points in the plane with
$ne^{\Omega\left({\sqrt{\log n}}\right)}$ halving lines. This improves the
bound $O(n\log n)$ of Edelsbrunner, Valtr and Welzl from 1997. We also observe
that the upper bound on the maximum number of halving lines of dense point set
can be improved to $O(n^{7/6})$.
  Our construction can be generalized to higher dimensions, for any $d$ we
construct a dense point set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with
$n^{d-1}e^{\Omega\left({\sqrt{\log n}}\right)}$ halving hyperplanes. Our lower
bounds are asymptotically the same as the best known lower bounds for general
point sets.

 <dc:description>  Modern software systems are built to be used in dynamic environments using
configuration capabilities to adapt to changes and external uncertainties. In a
self-adaptation context, we are often interested in reasoning about the
performance of the systems under different configurations. Usually, we learn a
black-box model based on real measurements to predict the performance of the
system given a specific configuration. However, as modern systems become more
complex, there are many configuration parameters that may interact and we end
up learning an exponentially large configuration space. Naturally, this does
not scale when relying on real measurements in the actual changing environment.
We propose a different solution: Instead of taking the measurements from the
real system, we learn the model using samples from other sources, such as
simulators that approximate performance of the real system at low cost. We
define a cost model that transform the traditional view of model learning into
a multi-objective problem that not only takes into account model accuracy but
also measurements effort as well. We evaluate our cost-aware transfer learning
solution using real-world configurable software including (i) a robotic system,
(ii) 3 different stream processing applications, and (iii) a NoSQL database
system. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve (a)
a high prediction accuracy, as well as (b) a high model reliability.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A Network Control System (NCS) consists of control components that interact
with the plant over a shared network. The system dynamics of a NCS could be
subject to noise arising from randomness in the times at which the data is
transmitted over the network, corruption of the transmitted data by the
communication network, and external disturbances that might affect the plant. A
question of interest is to understand how the statistics of the data
transmission times affects the system dynamics, and under what conditions the
system is stable. Another related issue is designing a controller that meets
desired performance specifications (e.g., a specific mean and variance of the
system state). Here, we consider a minimal NCS that consists of a plant and a
controller, and it is subject to random transmission times, channel corruption
and external disturbances. We derive exact dynamics of the first two moments of
the system, and use them to derive the stability conditions of the system. We
further design a control law that steers the system to a desired mean and
variance. Finally, we demonstrate our results using different examples, and
show that under some specific conditions, randomness in the data transmission
times can even reduce the variability contributed from disturbance.

 <dc:description>  The solution space of many classical optimization problems breaks up into
clusters which are extensively distant from one another in the Hamming metric.
Here, we show that an analogous quantum clustering phenomenon takes place in
the ground state subspace of a certain quantum optimization problem. This
involves extending the notion of clustering to Hilbert space, where the
classical Hamming distance is not immediately useful. Quantum clusters
correspond to macroscopically distinct subspaces of the full quantum ground
state space which grow with the system size. We explicitly demonstrate that
such clusters arise in the solution space of random quantum satisfiability
(3-QSAT) at its satisfiability transition. We estimate both the number of these
clusters and their internal entropy. The former are given by the number of
hardcore dimer coverings of the core of the interaction graph, while the latter
is related to the underconstrained degrees of freedom not touched by the
dimers. We additionally provide new numerical evidence suggesting that the
3-QSAT satisfiability transition may coincide with the product satisfiability
transition, which would imply the absence of an intermediate entangled
satisfiable phase.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm for crime prediction based on the near-repeat
victimization model solved by a Green's function scheme. The Green's function
is generated from spatio-temporal correlations of a density of crime events in
a historical dataset. We examine the accuracy of our method by applying it to
the open data of burglaries in Chicago and New York City. We find that the
cascade of the crimes has a long-time, logarithmic tail, which is consistent
with an earlier study on other data of burglaries. The presented method is a
powerful tool not only to predict crimes but also to analyze their
correlations, because the Green's function can describe how a past crime
influences the future events.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently been shown to generate
promising results for aesthetics assessment. However, the performance of these
deep CNN methods is often compromised by the constraint that the neural network
only takes the fixed-size input. To accommodate this requirement, input images
need to be transformed via cropping, warping, or padding, which often alter
image composition, reduce image resolution, or cause image distortion. Thus the
aesthetics of the original images is impaired because of potential loss of fine
grained details and holistic image layout. However, such fine grained details
and holistic image layout is critical for evaluating an image's aesthetics. In
this paper, we present an Adaptive Layout-Aware Multi-Patch Convolutional
Neural Network (A-Lamp CNN) architecture for photo aesthetic assessment. This
novel scheme is able to accept arbitrary sized images, and learn from both
fined grained details and holistic image layout simultaneously. To enable
training on these hybrid inputs, we extend the method by developing a dedicated
double-subnet neural network structure, i.e. a Multi-Patch subnet and a
Layout-Aware subnet. We further construct an aggregation layer to effectively
combine the hybrid features from these two subnets. Extensive experiments on
the large-scale aesthetics assessment benchmark (AVA) demonstrate significant
performance improvement over the state-of-the-art in photo aesthetic
assessment.

Here by &quot;short&quot; we mean sentences with a bounded number of variables,
quantifiers, inequalities and Boolean operations; the input consists only of
the integers involved in the inequalities. We prove that assuming Kannan's
partition can be found in polynomial time, the satisfiability of Short-PA
sentences can be decided in polynomial time. Furthermore, under the same
assumption, we show that the numbers of satisfying assignments of short
Presburger sentences can also be computed in polynomial time.

 <dc:title>Private Multi-File Retrieval From Distributed Databases</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Suppose there are $N$ distributed databases each storing a full set of $M$
independent files. A user wants to retrieve $r$ out of the $M$ files without
revealing the identity of the $r$ files. When $r=1$ it is the classic problem
of private information retrieval (PIR). In this paper we study the problem of
private multi-file retrieval (PMFR) which covers the case of general $r$. We
first prove an upper bound on the capacity of PMFR schemes which indicates the
minimum possible download size per unit of retrieved files. Then we design a
general PMFR scheme which happens to attain the upper bound when
$r\geq\frac{M}{2}$, thus achieving the optimal communication cost. As $r$ goes
down we show the trivial approach of executing $r$ independent PIR instances
achieves the near optimal communication cost. Comparing with the
capacity-achieving PIR schemes, our PMFR scheme reduces the number of
subpackages needed for each file from $N^M$ to $N^2$, which implies a great
reduction of implementation complexity.

 <dc:description>  Recent works have shown that synthetic parallel data automatically generated
by translation models can be effective for various neural machine translation
(NMT) issues. In this study, we build NMT systems using only synthetic parallel
data. As an efficient alternative to real parallel data, we also present a new
type of synthetic parallel corpus. The proposed pseudo parallel data are
distinct from previous works in that ground truth and synthetic examples are
mixed on both sides of sentence pairs. Experiments on Czech-German and
French-German translations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pseudo
parallel corpus, which shows not only enhanced results for bidirectional
translation tasks but also substantial improvement with the aid of a ground
truth real parallel corpus.

 <dc:description>  An important goal of computer vision is to build systems that learn visual
representations over time that can be applied to many tasks. In this paper, we
investigate a vision-language embedding as a core representation and show that
it leads to better cross-task transfer than standard multi-task learning. In
particular, the task of visual recognition is aligned to the task of visual
question answering by forcing each to use the same word-region embeddings. We
show this leads to greater inductive transfer from recognition to VQA than
standard multitask learning. Visual recognition also improves, especially for
categories that have relatively few recognition training labels but appear
often in the VQA setting. Thus, our paper takes a small step towards creating
more general vision systems by showing the benefit of interpretable, flexible,
and trainable core representations.

 <dc:description>  Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star(RRT*) is a recently proposed extension of
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm that provides a collision-free,
asymptotically optimal path regardless of obstacle's geometry in a given
environment. However, one of the limitations in the RRT* algorithm is slow
convergence to optimal path solution. As a result, it consumes high memory as
well as time due to a large number of iterations utilised in achieving optimal
path solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Potential Function
Based-RRT* (P-RRT*) that incorporates the Artificial Potential Field Algorithm
in RRT*. The proposed algorithm allows a considerable decrease in the number of
iterations and thus leads to more efficient memory utilization and an
accelerated convergence rate. In order to illustrate the usefulness of the
proposed algorithm in terms of space execution and convergence rate, this paper
presents rigorous simulation based comparisons between the proposed techniques
and RRT* under different environmental conditions. Moreover, both algorithms
are also tested and compared under non-holonomic differential constraints.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world multilayer systems such as critical infrastructure are
interdependent and embedded in space with links of a characteristic length.
They are also vulnerable to localized attacks or failures, such as terrorist
attacks or natural catastrophes, which affect all nodes within a given radius.
Here we study the effects of localized attacks on spatial multiplex networks of
two layers. We find a metastable region where a localized attack larger than a
critical size induces a nucleation transition as a cascade of failures spreads
throughout the system, leading to its collapse. We develop a theory to predict
the critical attack size and find that it exhibits novel scaling behavior. We
further find that localized attacks in these multiplex systems can induce a
previously unobserved combination of random and spatial cascades. Our results
demonstrate important vulnerabilities in real-world interdependent networks and
show new theoretical features of spatial networks.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an intersection type system for the lambda-mu calculus that is
invariant under subject reduction and expansion. The system is obtained by
describing Streicher and Reus's denotational model of continuations in the
category of omega-algebraic lattices via Abramsky's domain-logic approach. This
provides at the same time an interpretation of the type system and a proof of
the completeness of the system with respect to the continuation models by means
of a filter model construction. We then define a restriction of our system,
such that a lambda-mu term is typeable if and only if it is strongly
normalising. We also show that Parigot's typing of lambda-mu terms with
classically valid propositional formulas can be translated into the restricted
system, which then provides an alternative proof of strong normalisability for
the typed lambda-mu calculus.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the use of discriminative model learning through
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for SAR image despeckling. The network
uses a residual learning strategy, hence it does not recover the filtered
image, but the speckle component, which is then subtracted from the noisy one.
Training is carried out by considering a large multitemporal SAR image and its
multilook version, in order to approximate a clean image. Experimental results,
both on synthetic and real SAR data, show the method to achieve better
performance with respect to state-of-the-art techniques.

 <dc:description>  Recent progress in advanced driver assistance systems and the race towards
autonomous vehicles is mainly driven by two factors: (1) increasingly
sophisticated algorithms that interpret the environment around the vehicle and
react accordingly, and (2) the continuous improvements of sensor technology
itself. In terms of cameras, these improvements typically include higher
spatial resolution, which as a consequence requires more data to be processed.
The trend to add multiple cameras to cover the entire surrounding of the
vehicle is not conducive in that matter. At the same time, an increasing number
of special purpose algorithms need access to the sensor input data to correctly
interpret the various complex situations that can occur, particularly in urban
traffic.
  By observing those trends, it becomes clear that a key challenge for vision
architectures in intelligent vehicles is to share computational resources. We
believe this challenge should be faced by introducing a representation of the
sensory data that provides compressed and structured access to all relevant
visual content of the scene. The Stixel World discussed in this paper is such a
representation. It is a medium-level model of the environment that is
specifically designed to compress information about obstacles by leveraging the
typical layout of outdoor traffic scenes. It has proven useful for a multitude
of automotive vision applications, including object detection, tracking,
segmentation, and mapping.
  In this paper, we summarize the ideas behind the model and generalize it to
take into account multiple dense input streams: the image itself, stereo depth
maps, and semantic class probability maps that can be generated, e.g., by CNNs.
Our generalization is embedded into a novel mathematical formulation for the
Stixel model. We further sketch how the free parameters of the model can be
learned using structured SVMs.

 <dc:description>  In this short note, we describe an approval-based committee selection rule
that admits a polynomial-time algorithm and satisfies the Extended Justified
Representation (EJR) axiom. This rule is based on approximately maximizing the
PAV score, by means of local search. Our proof strategy is to show that this
rule provides almost optimal average satisfaction to all cohesive groups of
voters, and that high average satisfaction for cohesive groups implies extended
justified representation.

 <dc:description>  The entropy of a finite probability space $X$ measures the observable
cardinality of large independent products $X^{\otimes n}$ of the probability
space. If two probability spaces $X$ and $Y$ have the same entropy, there is an
almost measure-preserving bijection between large parts of $X^{\otimes n}$ and
$Y^{\otimes n}$. In this way, $X$ and $Y$ are asymptotically equivalent.
  It turns out to be challenging to generalize this notion of asymptotic
equivalence to configurations of probability spaces, which are collections of
probability spaces with measure-preserving maps between some of them.
  In this article we introduce the intrinsic Kolmogorov-Sinai distance on the
space of configurations of probability spaces. Concentrating on the large-scale
geometry we pass to the asymptotic Kolmogorov-Sinai distance. It induces an
asymptotic equivalence relation on sequences of configurations of probability
spaces. We will call the equivalence classes \emph{tropical probability
spaces}.
  In this context we prove an Asymptotic Equipartition Property for
configurations. It states that tropical configurations can always be
approximated by homogeneous configurations. In addition, we show that the
solutions to certain Information-Optimization problems are
Lipschitz-con\-tinuous with respect to the asymptotic Kolmogorov-Sinai
distance. It follows from these two statements that in order to solve an
Information-Optimization problem, it suffices to consider homogeneous
configurations.
  Finally, we show that spaces of trajectories of length $n$ of certain
stochastic processes, in particular stationary Markov chains, have a tropical
limit.

 <dc:description>  Discrminative trackers, employ a classification approach to separate the
target from its background. To cope with variations of the target shape and
appearance, the classifier is updated online with different samples of the
target and the background. Sample selection, labeling and updating the
classifier is prone to various sources of errors that drift the tracker. We
introduce the use of an efficient version space shrinking strategy to reduce
the labeling errors and enhance its sampling strategy by measuring the
uncertainty of the tracker about the samples. The proposed tracker, utilize an
ensemble of classifiers that represents different hypotheses about the target,
diversify them using boosting to provide a larger and more consistent coverage
of the version-space and tune the classifiers' weights in voting. The proposed
system adjusts the model update rate by promoting the co-training of the
short-memory ensemble with a long-memory oracle. The proposed tracker
outperformed state-of-the-art trackers on different sequences bearing various
tracking challenges.

 <dc:description>  Game Theory (GT) has been used with significant success to formulate, and
either design or optimize, the operation of many representative communications
and networking scenarios. The games in these scenarios involve, as usual,
diverse players with conflicting goals. This paper primarily surveys the
literature that has applied theoretical games to wireless networks, emphasizing
use cases of upcoming Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC). MEC is relatively new
and offers cloud services at the network periphery, aiming to reduce service
latency backhaul load, and enhance Quality of Experience. Our presentation of
GT is focused on the major challenges imposed by MEC services over the wireless
resources. The survey is divided into classical, evolutionary, and incomplete
information games. Our discussion then proceeds to more specific aspects which
have a considerable impact on the game usefulness, namely: rational vs.
evolving strategies, cooperation among players, available environmental
information, the way the game is played (single turn, repeated), the game model
evaluation, and how the model results can be applied for both optimizing
resource-constrained resources and balancing diverse trade-offs in real edge
networking scenarios. Finally, we reflect on learned lessons, highlighting
future trends and research directions for applying theoretical model games in
upcoming MEC services, considering both network design issues and usage
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a new algorithm for parallel Monte Carlo tree
search (MCTS). It is based on the pipeline pattern and allows flexible
management of the control flow of the operations in parallel MCTS. The pipeline
pattern provides for the first structured parallel programming approach to
MCTS. Moreover, we propose a new lock-free tree data structure for parallel
MCTS which removes synchronization overhead. The Pipeline Pattern for Parallel
MCTS algorithm (called 3PMCTS), scales very well to higher numbers of cores
when compared to the existing methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two novel approaches for people counting in crowded and
open environments that combine the information gathered by multiple views.
Multiple camera are used to expand the field of view as well as to mitigate the
problem of occlusion that commonly affects the performance of counting methods
using single cameras. The first approach is regarded as a direct approach and
it attempts to segment and count each individual in the crowd. For such an aim,
two head detectors trained with head images are employed: one based on support
vector machines and another based on Adaboost perceptron. The second approach,
regarded as an indirect approach employs learning algorithms and statistical
analysis on the whole crowd to achieve counting. For such an aim, corner points
are extracted from groups of people in a foreground image and computed by a
learning algorithm which estimates the number of people in the scene. Both
approaches count the number of people on the scene and not only on a given
image or video frame of the scene. The experimental results obtained on the
benchmark PETS2009 video dataset show that proposed indirect method surpasses
other methods with improvements of up to 46.7% and provides accurate counting
results for the crowded scenes. On the other hand, the direct method shows high
error rates due to the fact that the latter has much more complex problems to
solve, such as segmentation of heads.

 <dc:description>  We systematically study the deep representation of random weight CNN
(convolutional neural network) using the DeCNN (deconvolutional neural network)
architecture. We first fix the weights of an untrained CNN, and for each layer
of its feature representation, we train a corresponding DeCNN to reconstruct
the input image. As compared with the pre-trained CNN, the DeCNN trained on a
random weight CNN can reconstruct images more quickly and accurately, no matter
which type of random distribution for the CNN's weights. It reveals that every
layer of the random CNN can retain photographically accurate information about
the image. We then let the DeCNN be untrained, i.e. the overall CNN-DeCNN
architecture uses only random weights. Strikingly, we can reconstruct all
position information of the image for low layer representations but the colors
change. For high layer representations, we can still capture the rough contours
of the image. We also change the number of feature maps and the shape of the
feature maps and gain more insight on the random function of the CNN-DeCNN
structure. Our work reveals that the purely random CNN-DeCNN architecture
substantially contributes to the geometric and photometric invariance due to
the intrinsic symmetry and invertible structure, but it discards the
colormetric information due to the random projection.

 <dc:description>  This contribution deals with image restoration in optical systems with
coherent illumination, which is an important topic in astronomy, coherent
microscopy and radar imaging. Such optical systems suffer from wavefront
distortions, which are caused by imperfect imaging components and conditions.
Known image restoration algorithms work well for incoherent imaging, they fail
in case of coherent images. In this paper a novel wavefront correction
algorithm is presented, which allows image restoration under coherent
conditions. In most coherent imaging systems, especially in astronomy, the
wavefront deformation is known. Using this information, the proposed algorithm
allows a high quality restoration even in case of severe wavefront distortions.
We present two versions of this algorithm, which are an evolution of the
Gerchberg-Saxton and the Hybrid-Input-Output algorithm. The algorithm is
verified on simulated and real microscopic images.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on wireless powered 5G dense cellular networks, where base
station (BS) delivers energy to user equipment (UE) via the microwave radiation
in sub-6 GHz or millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, and UE uses the harvested
energy for uplink information transmission. By addressing the impacts of
employing different number of antennas and bandwidths at lower and higher
frequencies, we evaluate the amount of harvested energy and throughput in such
networks. Based on the derived results, we obtain the required small cell
density to achieve an expected level of harvested energy or throughput. Also,
we obtain that when the ratio of the number of sub-6 GHz BSs to that of the
mmWave BSs is lower than a given threshold, UE harvests more energy from a
mmWave BS than a sub-6 GHz BS. We find how many mmWave small cells are needed
to perform better than the sub-6 GHz small cells from the perspectives of
harvested energy and throughput. Our results reveal that the amount of
harvested energy from the mmWave tier can be comparable to the sub-6 GHz
counterpart in the dense scenarios. For the same tier scale, mmWave tier can
achieve higher throughput. Furthermore, the throughput gap between different
mmWave frequencies increases with the mmWave BS density.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a variational method for multi-view shape-from-shading under
natural illumination. The key idea is to couple PDE-based solutions for
single-image based shape-from-shading problems across multiple images and
multiple color channels by means of a variational formulation. Rather than
alternatingly solving the individual SFS problems and optimizing the
consistency across images and channels which is known to lead to suboptimal
results, we propose an efficient solution of the coupled problem by means of an
ADMM algorithm. In numerous experiments on both simulated and real imagery, we
demonstrate that the proposed fusion of multiple-view reconstruction and
shape-from-shading provides highly accurate dense reconstructions without the
need to compute dense correspondences. With the proposed variational
integration across multiple views shape-from-shading techniques become
applicable to challenging real-world reconstruction problems, giving rise to
highly detailed geometry even in areas of smooth brightness variation and
lacking texture.

 <dc:title>Local Guarantees in Graph Cuts and Clustering</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Correlation Clustering is an elegant model that captures fundamental graph
cut problems such as Min $s-t$ Cut, Multiway Cut, and Multicut, extensively
studied in combinatorial optimization. Here, we are given a graph with edges
labeled $+$ or $-$ and the goal is to produce a clustering that agrees with the
labels as much as possible: $+$ edges within clusters and $-$ edges across
clusters. The classical approach towards Correlation Clustering (and other
graph cut problems) is to optimize a global objective. We depart from this and
study local objectives: minimizing the maximum number of disagreements for
edges incident on a single node, and the analogous max min agreements
objective. This naturally gives rise to a family of basic min-max graph cut
problems. A prototypical representative is Min Max $s-t$ Cut: find an $s-t$ cut
minimizing the largest number of cut edges incident on any node. We present the
following results: $(1)$ an $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation for the problem of
minimizing the maximum total weight of disagreement edges incident on any node
(thus providing the first known approximation for the above family of min-max
graph cut problems), $(2)$ a remarkably simple $7$-approximation for minimizing
local disagreements in complete graphs (improving upon the previous best known
approximation of $48$), and $(3)$ a $1/(2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for
maximizing the minimum total weight of agreement edges incident on any node,
hence improving upon the $1/(4+\varepsilon)$-approximation that follows from
the study of approximate pure Nash equilibria in cut and party affiliation
games.

to tackle concept drift it is important to develop the capacity to describe and
analyze it. We propose tools for this purpose, arguing for the importance of
quantitative descriptions of drift in marginal distributions. We present
quantitative drift analysis techniques along with methods for communicating
their results. We demonstrate their effectiveness by application to three
real-world learning tasks.

 <dc:description>  The robust PCA problem, wherein, given an input data matrix that is the
superposition of a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, we aim to separate out
the low-rank and sparse components, is a well-studied problem in machine
learning. One natural question that arises is that, as in the inductive
setting, if features are provided as input as well, can we hope to do better?
Answering this in the affirmative, the main goal of this paper is to study the
robust PCA problem while incorporating feature information. In contrast to
previous works in which recovery guarantees are based on the convex relaxation
of the problem, we propose a simple iterative algorithm based on
hard-thresholding of appropriate residuals. Under weaker assumptions than
previous works, we prove the global convergence of our iterative procedure;
moreover, it admits a much faster convergence rate and lesser computational
complexity per iteration. In practice, through systematic synthetic and real
data simulations, we confirm our theoretical findings regarding improvements
obtained by using feature information.

 <dc:description>  Wholesale electricity market designs in practice do not provide the market
participants with adequate mechanisms to hedge their financial risks. Demanders
and suppliers will likely face even greater risks with the deepening
penetration of variable renewable resources like wind and solar. This paper
explores the design of a centralized cash-settled call option market to
mitigate such risks. A cash-settled call option is a financial instrument that
allows its holder the right to claim a monetary reward equal to the positive
difference between the real-time price of an underlying commodity and a
pre-negotiated strike price for an upfront fee. Through an example, we
illustrate that a bilateral call option can reduce the payment volatility of
market participants. Then, we design a centralized clearing mechanism for call
options that generalizes the bilateral trade. We illustrate through an example
how the centralized clearing mechanism generalizes the bilateral trade.
Finally, the effect of risk preference of the market participants, as well as
some generalizations are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Graphs with bounded thinness were defined in 2007 as a generalization of
interval graphs. In this paper we introduce the concept of proper thinness,
such that graphs with bounded proper thinness generalize proper interval
graphs. We study the complexity of problems related to the computation of these
parameters, describe the behavior of the thinness and proper thinness under
three graph operations, and relate thinness and proper thinness with other
graph invariants in the literature. Finally, we describe a wide family of
problems that can be solved in polynomial time for graphs with bounded
thinness, generalizing for example list matrix partition problems with bounded
size matrix, and enlarge this family of problems for graphs with bounded proper
thinness, including domination problems.

 <dc:description>  One of the most important problems in machine translation (MT) evaluation is
to evaluate the similarity between translation hypotheses with different
surface forms from the reference, especially at the segment level. We propose
to use word embeddings to perform word alignment for segment-level MT
evaluation. We performed experiments with three types of alignment methods
using word embeddings. We evaluated our proposed methods with various
translation datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed methods
outperform previous word embeddings-based methods.

 <dc:title>Third time is the charm - Why the World just might be ready for the
  Internet of Things this time around</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Corcoran, Peter M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The technology to connect 'things' to the Internet has existed for more than
20 years, so if we take a look back at recent history we might well be tempted
to ask the question why will IoT 'happen' this time around. In this paper we
examine the origins of the Internet of Things, answer the question &quot;Why Now?&quot;,
and look forward to the next wave of disruptive technologies that will be
coming to a device near you in the next few years.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: Originally submitted to WF_IoT 2016 but was not considered to be an
  'archival' paper by the reviewers; it seems they didn't feel they could
  &quot;learn&quot; from the historical past of the IoT, especially from past mistakes in
  introducing IoT technology</dc:description>

 <dc:title>Parallel Local Algorithms for Core, Truss, and Nucleus Decompositions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Finding the dense regions of a graph and relations among them is a
fundamental task in network analysis. Nucleus decomposition is a principled
framework of algorithms that generalizes the k-core and k-truss decompositions.
It can leverage the higher-order structures to locate the dense subgraphs with
hierarchical relations. Computation of the nucleus decomposition is performed
in multiple steps, known as the peeling process, and it requires global
information about the graph at any time. This prevents the scalable
parallelization of the computation. Also, it is not possible to compute
approximate and fast results by the peeling process, because it does not
produce the densest regions until the algorithm is complete. In a previous
work, Lu et al. proposed to iteratively compute the h-indices of vertex degrees
to obtain the core numbers and prove that the convergence is obtained after a
finite number of iterations. In this work, we generalize the iterative h-index
computation for any nucleus decomposition and prove convergence bounds. We
present a framework of local algorithms to obtain the exact and approximate
nucleus decompositions. Our algorithms are pleasingly parallel and can provide
approximations to explore time and quality trade-offs. Our shared-memory
implementation verifies the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our
algorithms on real-world networks. In particular, using 24 threads, we obtain
up to 4.04x and 7.98x speedups for k-truss and (3, 4) nucleus decompositions.

 <dc:description>  Many complex systems can be represented as networks, and the problem of
network comparison is becoming increasingly relevant. There are many techniques
for network comparison, from simply comparing network summary statistics to
sophisticated but computationally costly alignment-based approaches. Yet it
remains challenging to accurately cluster networks that are of a different size
and density, but hypothesized to be structurally similar. In this paper, we
address this problem by introducing a new network comparison methodology that
is aimed at identifying common organizational principles in networks. The
methodology is simple, intuitive and applicable in a wide variety of settings
ranging from the functional classification of proteins to tracking the
evolution of a world trade network.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing videos of human actions involves understanding the temporal
relationships among video frames. CNNs are the current state-of-the-art methods
for action recognition in videos. However, the CNN architectures currently
being used have difficulty in capturing these relationships. State-of-the-art
action recognition approaches rely on traditional local optical flow estimation
methods to pre-compute motion information for CNNs. Such a two-stage approach
is computationally expensive, storage demanding, and not end-to-end trainable.
In this paper, we present a novel CNN architecture that implicitly captures
motion information between adjacent frames. We then plug it into a
state-of-the-art action recognition framework called two-stream CNNs. We name
our approach hidden two-stream CNNs because it only takes raw video frames as
input and directly predicts action classes without explicitly computing optical
flow. Our end-to-end approach is 10x faster than a two-stage one and maintains
similar accuracy. Experimental results on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets show that
our approach significantly outperforms previous best real-time approaches.

 <dc:title>Geometric Loss Functions for Camera Pose Regression with Deep Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep learning has shown to be effective for robust and real-time monocular
image relocalisation. In particular, PoseNet is a deep convolutional neural
network which learns to regress the 6-DOF camera pose from a single image. It
learns to localize using high level features and is robust to difficult
lighting, motion blur and unknown camera intrinsics, where point based SIFT
registration fails. However, it was trained using a naive loss function, with
hyper-parameters which require expensive tuning. In this paper, we give the
problem a more fundamental theoretical treatment. We explore a number of novel
loss functions for learning camera pose which are based on geometry and scene
reprojection error. Additionally we show how to automatically learn an optimal
weighting to simultaneously regress position and orientation. By leveraging
geometry, we demonstrate that our technique significantly improves PoseNet's
performance across datasets ranging from indoor rooms to a small city.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of choice overload - the difficulty of making a
decision when faced with many options - when displaying related-article
recommendations in digital libraries. So far, research regarding to how many
items should be displayed has mostly been done in the fields of media
recommendations and search engines. We analyze the number of recommendations in
current digital libraries. When browsing fullscreen with a laptop or desktop
PC, all display a fixed number of recommendations. 72% display three, four, or
five recommendations, none display more than ten. We provide results from an
empirical evaluation conducted with GESIS' digital library Sowiport, with
recommendations delivered by recommendations-as-a-service provider Mr. DLib. We
use click-through rate as a measure of recommendation effectiveness based on
3.4 million delivered recommendations. Our results show lower click-through
rates for higher numbers of recommendations and twice as many clicked
recommendations when displaying ten instead of one related-articles. Our
results indicate that users might quickly feel overloaded by choice.

 <dc:description>  A message-passing procedure for solving the graph isomorphism problem is
proposed. The procedure resembles the belief-propagation algorithm in the
context of graphical models inference and LDPC decoding. To enable the
algorithm, the input graphs are transformed into intermediate canonical
representations of bipartite graphs. The matching procedure injects specially
designed input patterns to the canonical graphs and runs a message-passing
algorithm to generate two output fingerprints that are matched if and only if
the input graphs are isomorphic.

 <dc:description>  The aggressive spatial spectrum reuse (SSR) by network densification using
smaller cells has successfully driven the wireless communication industry
onward in the past decades. In our future journey toward ultra-dense networks
(UDNs), a fundamental question needs to be answered. Is there a limit to SSR?
In other words, when we deploy thousands or millions of small cell base
stations (BSs) per square kilometer, is activating all BSs on the same
time/frequency resource the best strategy? In this paper, we present
theoretical analyses to answer such question. In particular, we find that both
the signal and interference powers become bounded in practical UDNs with a
non-zero BS-to-UE antenna height difference and a finite UE density, which
leads to a constant capacity scaling law. As a result, there exists an optimal
SSR density that can maximize the network capacity. Hence, the limit to SSR
should be considered in the operation of future UDNs.

Aware Long Short Time Memory(SA-LSTM). The structure of SA-LSTM modifies

information directly in an architecture engineering way instead of feature
engineering way. We experimentally demonstrate that SA-LSTM gains more

 <dc:description>  Histopathology images are crucial to the study of complex diseases such as
cancer. The histologic characteristics of nuclei play a key role in disease
diagnosis, prognosis and analysis. In this work, we propose a sparse
Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) for fully unsupervised, simultaneous nucleus
detection and feature extraction in histopathology tissue images. Our CAE
detects and encodes nuclei in image patches in tissue images into sparse
feature maps that encode both the location and appearance of nuclei. Our CAE is
the first unsupervised detection network for computer vision applications. The
pretrained nucleus detection and feature extraction modules in our CAE can be
fine-tuned for supervised learning in an end-to-end fashion. We evaluate our
method on four datasets and reduce the errors of state-of-the-art methods up to
42%. We are able to achieve comparable performance with only 5% of the
fully-supervised annotation cost.

 <dc:description>  This paper surveys the message brokers that are in vogue today for
distributed communication. Their primary goal is to facilitate the construction
of decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault
tolerance and high availability. These characteristics make them optimal for
usage within distributed architectures. However, there are multiple protocols
built to achieve this, and it would be beneficial to have a empirical
comparison between their features and performance to determine their real-world
applicability.
  This paper focuses on two popular protocols (Kafka and AMQP) and explores the
divergence in their features as well as their performance under varied testing
workloads.

 <dc:description>  Collaborative crowdsourcing has become a popular approach to organizing work
across the globe. Being global also means being vulnerable to shocks --
unforeseen events that disrupt crowds -- that originate from any country. In
this study, we examine changes in collaborative behavior of editors of Chinese
Wikipedia that arise due to the 2005 government censor- ship in mainland China.
Using the exogenous variation in the fraction of editors blocked across
different articles due to the censorship, we examine the impact of reduction in
group size, which we denote as the shock level, on three collaborative behavior
measures: volume of activity, centralization, and conflict. We find that
activity and conflict drop on articles that face a shock, whereas
centralization increases. The impact of a shock on activity increases with
shock level, whereas the impact on centralization and conflict is higher for
moderate shock levels than for very small or very high shock levels. These
findings provide support for threat rigidity theory -- originally introduced in
the organizational theory literature -- in the context of large-scale
collaborative crowds.

 <dc:description>  Self-adaptive system (SAS) is capable of adjusting its behavior in response
to meaningful changes in the operational context and itself. Due to the
inherent volatility of the open and changeable environment in which SAS is
embedded, the ability of adaptation is highly demanded by many
software-intensive systems. Two concerns, i.e., the requirements uncertainty
and the context uncertainty are most important among others. An essential issue
to be addressed is how to dynamically adapt non-functional requirements (NFRs)
and task configurations of SASs with context uncertainty. In this paper, we
propose a model-based fuzzy control approach that is underpinned by the
feedforward-feedback control mechanism. This approach identifies and represents
NFR uncertainties, task uncertainties and context uncertainties with linguistic
variables, and then designs an inference structure and rules for the fuzzy
controller based on the relations between the requirements model and the
context model. The adaptation of NFRs and task configurations is achieved
through fuzzification, inference, defuzzification and readaptation. Our
approach is demonstrated with a mobile computing application and is evaluated
through a series of simulation experiments.

 <dc:description>  Self-adaptive systems are capable of adjusting their behavior to cope with
the changes in environment and itself. These changes may cause runtime
uncertainty, which refers to the system state of failing to achieve appropriate
reconfigurations. However, it is often infeasible to exhaustively anticipate
all the changes. Thus, providing dynamic adaptation mechanisms for mitigating
runtime uncertainty becomes a big challenge. This paper suggests solving this
challenge at requirements phase by presenting REDAPT, short for
REquirement-Driven adAPTation. We propose an adaptive goal model (AGM) by
introducing adaptive elements, specify dynamic properties of AGM by providing
logic based grammar, derive adaptation mechanisms with AGM specifications and
achieve adaptation by monitoring variables, diagnosing requirements violations,
determining reconfigurations and execution. Our approach is demonstrated with
an example from the Intelligent Transportation System domain and evaluated
through a series of simulation experiments.

 <dc:description>  Over the last decade, researchers and engineers have developed a vast body of
methodologies and technologies in requirements engineering for self-adaptive
systems. Although existing studies have explored various aspects of this topic,
few of them have categorized and summarized these areas of research in
require-ments modeling and analysis. This study aims to investigate the
research themes based on the utilized modeling methods and RE activities. We
conduct a thematic study in the systematic literature review. The results are
derived by synthesizing the extracted data with statistical methods. This paper
provides an updated review of the research literature, enabling researchers and
practitioners to better understand the research themes in these areas and
identify research gaps which need to be further studied.

 <dc:description>  Context: Over the last decade, software researchers and engineers have
developed a vast body of methodologies and technologies in requirements
engineering for self-adaptive systems. Although existing studies have explored
various aspects of this field, no systematic study has been performed on
summarizing modeling methods and corresponding requirements activities.
Objective: This study summarizes the state-of-the-art research trends, details
the modeling methods and corresponding requirements activities, identifies
relevant quality attributes and application domains and assesses the quality of
each study. Method: We perform a systematic literature review underpinned by a
rigorously established and reviewed protocol. To ensure the quality of the
study, we choose 21 highly regarded publication venues and 8 popular digital
libraries. In addition, we apply text mining to derive search strings and use
Kappa coefficient to mitigate disagreements of researchers. Results: We
selected 109 papers during the period of 2003-2013 and presented the research
distributions over various kinds of factors. We extracted 29 modeling methods
which are classified into 8 categories and identified 14 requirements
activities which are classified into 4 requirements timelines. We captured 8
concerned software quality attributes based on the ISO 9126 standard and 12
application domains. Conclusion: The frequency of application of modeling
methods varies greatly. Enterprise models were more widely used while behavior
models were more rigorously evaluated. Requirements-driven runtime adaptation
was the most frequently studied requirements activity. Activities at runtime
were conveyed with more details. Finally, we draw other conclusions by
discussing how well modeling dimensions were considered in these modeling
methods and how well assurance dimensions were conveyed in requirements
activities.

 <dc:description>  Sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) has emerged as a fast and competitive method
to perform sparse processing. The SBL algorithm, which is developed using a
Bayesian framework, approximately solves a non-convex optimization problem
using fixed point updates. It provides comparable performance and is
significantly faster than convex optimization techniques used in sparse
processing. We propose a signal model which accounts for dictionary mismatch
and the presence of errors in the weight vector at low signal-to-noise ratios.
A fixed point update equation is derived which incorporates the statistics of
mismatch and weight errors. We also process observations from multiple
dictionaries. Noise variances are estimated using stochastic maximum
likelihood. The derived update equations are studied quantitatively using
beamforming simulations applied to direction-of-arrival (DoA). Performance of
SBL using single- and multi-frequency observations, and in the presence of
aliasing, is evaluated. SwellEx-96 experimental data demonstrates qualitatively
the advantages of SBL.

 <dc:description>  Unconstrained face recognition performance evaluations have traditionally
focused on Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset for imagery and the
YouTubeFaces (YTF) dataset for videos in the last couple of years. Spectacular
progress in this field has resulted in a saturation on verification and
identification accuracies for those benchmark datasets. In this paper, we
propose a unified learning framework named transferred deep feature fusion
targeting at the new IARPA Janus Bechmark A (IJB-A) face recognition dataset
released by NIST face challenge. The IJB-A dataset includes real-world
unconstrained faces from 500 subjects with full pose and illumination
variations which are much harder than the LFW and YTF datasets. Inspired by
transfer learning, we train two advanced deep convolutional neural networks
(DCNN) with two different large datasets in source domain, respectively. By
exploring the complementarity of two distinct DCNNs, deep feature fusion is
utilized after feature extraction in target domain. Then, template specific
linear SVMs is adopted to enhance the discrimination of framework. Finally,
multiple matching scores corresponding different templates are merged as the
final results. This simple unified framework outperforms the state-of-the-art
by a wide margin on IJB-A dataset. Based on the proposed approach, we have
submitted our IJB-A results to National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) for official evaluation.

 <dc:title>Combining Lexical and Syntactic Features for Detecting Content-dense
  Texts in News</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Content-dense news report important factual information about an event in
direct, succinct manner. Information seeking applications such as information
extraction, question answering and summarization normally assume all text they
deal with is content-dense. Here we empirically test this assumption on news
articles from the business, U.S. international relations, sports and science
journalism domains. Our findings clearly indicate that about half of the news
texts in our study are in fact not content-dense and motivate the development
of a supervised content-density detector. We heuristically label a large
training corpus for the task and train a two-layer classifying model based on
lexical and unlexicalized syntactic features. On manually annotated data, we
compare the performance of domain-specific classifiers, trained on data only
from a given news domain and a general classifier in which data from all four
domains is pooled together. Our annotation and prediction experiments
demonstrate that the concept of content density varies depending on the domain
and that naive annotators provide judgement biased toward the stereotypical
domain label. Domain-specific classifiers are more accurate for domains in
which content-dense texts are typically fewer. Domain independent classifiers
reproduce better naive crowdsourced judgements. Classification prediction is
high across all conditions, around 80%.

 <dc:description>  We consider the stochastic bandit problem with a continuous set of arms, with
the expected reward function over the arms assumed to be fixed but unknown. We
provide two new Gaussian process-based algorithms for continuous bandit
optimization-Improved GP-UCB (IGP-UCB) and GP-Thomson sampling (GP-TS), and
derive corresponding regret bounds. Specifically, the bounds hold when the
expected reward function belongs to the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)
that naturally corresponds to a Gaussian process kernel used as input by the
algorithms. Along the way, we derive a new self-normalized concentration
inequality for vector- valued martingales of arbitrary, possibly infinite,
dimension. Finally, experimental evaluation and comparisons to existing
algorithms on synthetic and real-world environments are carried out that
highlight the favorable gains of the proposed strategies in many cases.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: To allow fast and high-quality reconstruction of clinical
accelerated multi-coil MR data by learning a variational network that combines
the mathematical structure of variational models with deep learning.
  Theory and Methods: Generalized compressed sensing reconstruction formulated
as a variational model is embedded in an unrolled gradient descent scheme. All
parameters of this formulation, including the prior model defined by filter
kernels and activation functions as well as the data term weights, are learned
during an offline training procedure. The learned model can then be applied
online to previously unseen data.
  Results: The variational network approach is evaluated on a clinical knee
imaging protocol. The variational network reconstructions outperform standard
reconstruction algorithms in terms of image quality and residual artifacts for
all tested acceleration factors and sampling patterns.
  Conclusion: Variational network reconstructions preserve the natural
appearance of MR images as well as pathologies that were not included in the
training data set. Due to its high computational performance, i.e.,
reconstruction time of 193 ms on a single graphics card, and the omission of
parameter tuning once the network is trained, this new approach to image
reconstruction can easily be integrated into clinical workflow.

 <dc:description>  In this report we present an analysis of the non-random and the Bayesian
Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the joint estimation of angle-of-arrival
(AoA), angle-of-departure (AoD), and the multipath amplitudes, for the
millimeter-wave (mmWave) wireless networks. Our analysis is applicable to
multipath channels with Gaussian noise and independent path parameters.
Numerical results based on uniform AoA and AoD in $[0,\pi)$, and Rician fading
path amplitudes, reveal that the Bayesian CRLB decreases monotonically with an
increase in the Rice factor. Further, the CRLB obtained by using beamforming
and combining code books generated by quantizing directly the domain of AoA and
AoD was found to be lower than those obtained with other types of beamforming
and combining code books.

 <dc:description>  Clustering categorical distributions in the probability simplex is a
fundamental primitive often met in applications dealing with histograms or
mixtures of multinomials. Traditionally, the differential-geometric structure
of the probability simplex has been used either by (i) setting the Riemannian
metric tensor to the Fisher information matrix of the categorical
distributions, or (ii) defining the information-geometric structure induced by
a smooth dissimilarity measure, called a divergence. In this paper, we
introduce a novel computationally-friendly non-Riemannian framework for
modeling the probability simplex: Hilbert simplex geometry. We discuss the pros
and cons of those three statistical modelings, and compare them experimentally
for clustering tasks.

 <dc:description>  In millimeter-wave communication systems with large-scale antenna arrays,
conventional digital beamforming may not be cost-effective. A promising
solution is the implementation of hybrid beamforming techniques, which consist
of low-dimensional digital beamforming followed by analog radio frequency (RF)
beamforming. This work studies the optimization of hybrid beamforming in the
context of a cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture. In a C-RAN
system, digital baseband signal processing functionalities are migrated from
remote radio heads (RRHs) to a baseband processing unit (BBU) in the &quot;cloud&quot; by
means of finite-capacity fronthaul links. Specifically, this work tackles the
problem of jointly optimizing digital beamforming and fronthaul quantization
strategies at the BBU, as well as RF beamforming at the RRHs, with the goal of
maximizing the weighted downlink sum-rate. Fronthaul capacity and per-RRH power
constraints are enforced along with constant modulus constraints on the RF
beamforming matrices. An iterative algorithm is proposed that is based on
successive convex approximation and on the relaxation of the constant modulus
constraint. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by numerical
simulation results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel Secured Outsourced Content Based Image
Retrieval solution, which allows looking for similar images stored into the
cloud in a homomorphically encrypted form. Its originality is fourfold. In a
first time, it extracts from a Paillier encrypted image a wavelet based global
image signature. In second, this signature is extracted in an encrypted form
and gives no clues about the image content. In a third time, its calculation
does not require the cloud to communicate with a trusted third party as usually
proposed by other existing schemes. More clearly, all computations required in
order to look for similar images are conducted by the cloud only with no
extra-communications. To make possible such a computation, we propose a new
fast way to compare encrypted data, these ones being encrypted by the same
public key or not, and using a recursive relationship in-between Paillier
random values when computing the different resolution levels of the image
wavelet transform. Experiments conducted in two distinct frameworks: medical
image retrieval with as purpose diagnosis aid support, and face recognition for
user authentication; indicate that the proposed SOCBIR does not change image
retrieval performance.

 <dc:title>Approximately certifying the restricted isometry property is hard</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weed, Jonathan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A matrix is said to possess the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) if it acts
as an approximate isometry when restricted to sparse vectors. Previous work has
shown it to be NP-hard to determine whether a matrix possess this property, but
only in a narrow range of parameters. In this work, we show that it is NP-hard
to make this determination for any accuracy parameter, even when we restrict
ourselves to instances which are either RIP or far from being RIP. This result
implies that it is NP-hard to approximate the range of parameters for which a
matrix possesses the Restricted Isometry Property with accuracy better than
some constant. Ours is the first work to prove such a claim without any
additional assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning (ML) over relational data is a booming area of the database
industry and academia. While several projects aim to build scalable and fast ML
systems, little work has addressed the pains of sourcing data and features for
ML tasks. Real-world relational databases typically have many tables (often,
dozens) and data scientists often struggle to even obtain and join all possible
tables that provide features for ML. In this context, Kumar et al. showed
recently that key-foreign key dependencies (KFKDs) between tables often lets us
avoid such joins without significantly affecting prediction accuracy--an idea
they called avoiding joins safely. While initially controversial, this idea has
since been used by multiple companies to reduce the burden of data sourcing for
ML. But their work applied only to linear classifiers. In this work, we verify
if their results hold for three popular complex classifiers: decision trees,
SVMs, and ANNs. We conduct an extensive experimental study using both
real-world datasets and simulations to analyze the effects of avoiding KFK
joins on such models. Our results show that these high-capacity classifiers are
surprisingly and counter-intuitively more robust to avoiding KFK joins compared
to linear classifiers, refuting an intuition from the prior work's analysis. We
explain this behavior intuitively and identify open questions at the
intersection of data management and ML theoretical research. All of our code
and datasets are available for download from

 <dc:title>A Comparison of Directional Distances for Hand Pose Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Benchmarking methods for 3d hand tracking is still an open problem due to the
difficulty of acquiring ground truth data. We introduce a new dataset and
benchmarking protocol that is insensitive to the accumulative error of other
protocols. To this end, we create testing frame pairs of increasing difficulty
and measure the pose estimation error separately for each of them. This
approach gives new insights and allows to accurately study the performance of
each feature or method without employing a full tracking pipeline. Following
this protocol, we evaluate various directional distances in the context of
silhouette-based 3d hand tracking, expressed as special cases of a generalized
Chamfer distance form. An appropriate parameter setup is proposed for each of
them, and a comparative study reveals the best performing method in this
context.

 <dc:description>  UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) is a widely used
clustering method. Here we show that UPGMA is a greedy heuristic for the
normalized equidistant minimum evolution (NEME) problem, that is, finding a
rooted tree that minimizes the minimum evolution score relative to the
dissimilarity matrix among all rooted trees with the same leaf-set in which all
leaves have the same distance to the root. We prove that the NEME problem is
NP-hard. In addition, we present some heuristic and approximation algorithms
for solving the NEME problem, including a polynomial time algorithm that yields
a binary, rooted tree whose NEME score is within O(log^2 n) of the optimum. We
expect that these results to eventually provide further insights into the
behavior of the UPGMA algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We compare a set of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for the
task of segmenting and detecting human sperm cells in an image taken from a
semen sample. In contrast to previous work, samples are not stained or washed
to allow for full sperm quality analysis, making analysis harder due to
clutter. Our results indicate that training on full images is superior to
training on patches when class-skew is properly handled. Full image training
including up-sampling during training proves to be beneficial in deep CNNs for
pixel wise accuracy and detection performance. Predicted sperm cells are found
by using connected components on the CNN predictions. We investigate
optimization of a threshold parameter on the size of detected components. Our
best network achieves 93.87% precision and 91.89% recall on our test dataset
after thresholding outperforming a classical mage analysis approach.

 <dc:description>  Recent study shows that a wide deep network can obtain accuracy comparable to
a deeper but narrower network. Compared to narrower and deeper networks, wide
networks employ relatively less number of layers and have various important
benefits, such that they have less running time on parallel computing devices,
and they are less affected by gradient vanishing problems. However, the
parameter size of a wide network can be very large due to use of large width of
each layer in the network. In order to keep the benefits of wide networks
meanwhile improve the parameter size and accuracy trade-off of wide networks,
we propose a binary tree architecture to truncate architecture of wide networks
by reducing the width of the networks. More precisely, in the proposed
architecture, the width is continuously reduced from lower layers to higher
layers in order to increase the expressive capacity of network with a less
increase on parameter size. Also, to ease the gradient vanishing problem,
features obtained at different layers are concatenated to form the output of
our architecture. By employing the proposed architecture on a baseline wide
network, we can construct and train a new network with same depth but
considerably less number of parameters. In our experimental analyses, we
observe that the proposed architecture enables us to obtain better parameter
size and accuracy trade-off compared to baseline networks using various
benchmark image classification datasets. The results show that our model can
decrease the classification error of baseline from 20.43% to 19.22% on
Cifar-100 using only 28% of parameters that baseline has. Code is available at

of many higher graph-based operations such as spanning trees, shortest paths
and betweenness centrality. The importance of this algorithm increases each day
due to it is a key requirement for many data structures which are becoming
popular nowadays. When the BFS algorithm is parallelized by distributing the
graph between several processors the interconnection network limits the
performance. Hence, improvements on this area may benefit the overall
performance of the algorithm.
  This work presents an alternative compression scheme for communications in
distributed BFS processing. It focuses on BFS processors using General-Purpose

 <dc:description>  Keyphrase boundary classification (KBC) is the task of detecting keyphrases
in scientific articles and labelling them with respect to predefined types.
Although important in practice, this task is so far underexplored, partly due
to the lack of labelled data. To overcome this, we explore several auxiliary
tasks, including semantic super-sense tagging and identification of multi-word
expressions, and cast the task as a multi-task learning problem with deep
recurrent neural networks. Our multi-task models perform significantly better
than previous state of the art approaches on two scientific KBC datasets,
particularly for long keyphrases.

 <dc:description>  Hand motion capture has been an active research topic in recent years,
following the success of full-body pose tracking. Despite similarities, hand
tracking proves to be more challenging, characterized by a higher
dimensionality, severe occlusions and self-similarity between fingers. For this
reason, most approaches rely on strong assumptions, like hands in isolation or
expensive multi-camera systems, that limit the practical use. In this work, we
propose a framework for hand tracking that can capture the motion of two
interacting hands using only a single, inexpensive RGB-D camera. Our approach
combines a generative model with collision detection and discriminatively
learned salient points. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on 14 new
sequences with challenging interactions.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of power control in Massive MIMO systems
taking into account the pilot contamination issue and the arrivals and
departures of users in the network. Contrary to most of existing work in MIMO
systems that focuses on the physical layer with fixed number of users, we
consider in this work that the users arrive dynamically and leave the network
once they are served. We provide a power control strategy, having a polynomial
complexity, and prove that this policy stabilizes the network whenever
possible. We then provide a distributed implementation of the power control
policy requiring low information exchange between the BSs and show that it
achieves the same stability region as the centralized policy.

 <dc:title>Block-Matching Convolutional Neural Network for Image Denoising</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ahn, Byeongyong</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are two main streams in up-to-date image denoising algorithms:
non-local self similarity (NSS) prior based methods and convolutional neural
network (CNN) based methods. The NSS based methods are favorable on images with
regular and repetitive patterns while the CNN based methods perform better on
irregular structures. In this paper, we propose a block-matching convolutional
neural network (BMCNN) method that combines NSS prior and CNN. Initially,
similar local patches in the input image are integrated into a 3D block. In
order to prevent the noise from messing up the block matching, we first apply
an existing denoising algorithm on the noisy image. The denoised image is
employed as a pilot signal for the block matching, and then denoising function
for the block is learned by a CNN structure. Experimental results show that the
proposed BMCNN algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. In detail,
BMCNN can restore both repetitive and irregular structures.

 <dc:title>Truthfulness in Repeated Predictions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ban, Amir</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Proper scoring rules elicit truth-telling when making predictions, or
otherwise revealing information. However, when multiple predictions are made of
the same event, telling the truth is in general no longer optimal, as agents
are motivated to distort early predictions to mislead competitors. We
demonstrate this, and then prove a significant exception: In a multi-agent
prediction setting where all agent signals belong to a jointly multivariate
normal distribution, and signal variances are common knowledge, the (proper)
logarithmic scoring rule will elicit truthful predictions from every agent at
every prediction, regardless of the number, order and timing of predictions.
The result applies in several financial models.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: The main result is not correct when there is more than one agent. The
  proof considers the effect of untruthfulness on the belief of the public, but
  errs in not considering the effect on the beliefs of other agents</dc:description>

 <dc:title>3D Object Reconstruction from Hand-Object Interactions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent advances have enabled 3d object reconstruction approaches using a
single off-the-shelf RGB-D camera. Although these approaches are successful for
a wide range of object classes, they rely on stable and distinctive geometric
or texture features. Many objects like mechanical parts, toys, household or
decorative articles, however, are textureless and characterized by minimalistic
shapes that are simple and symmetric. Existing in-hand scanning systems and 3d
reconstruction techniques fail for such symmetric objects in the absence of
highly distinctive features. In this work, we show that extracting 3d hand
motion for in-hand scanning effectively facilitates the reconstruction of even
featureless and highly symmetric objects and we present an approach that fuses
the rich additional information of hands into a 3d reconstruction pipeline,
significantly contributing to the state-of-the-art of in-hand scanning.

 <dc:description>  In formation control, triangular formations consisting of three autonomous
agents serve as a class of benchmarks that can be used to test and compare the
performances of different controllers. We present an algorithm that combines
the advantages of both position- and distance-based gradient descent control
laws. For example, only two pairs of neighboring agents need to be controlled,
agents can work in their own local frame of coordinates and the orientation of
the formation with respect to a global frame of coordinates is not prescribed.
We first present a novel technique based on adding artificial biases to
neighboring agents' range sensors such that their eventual positions correspond
to a collinear configuration. Right after, a small modification in the bias
terms by introducing a prescribed rotation matrix will allow the control of the
bearing of the neighboring agents.

 <dc:description>  Exploratory testing (ET) is a powerful and efficient way of testing software
by integrating design, execution, and analysis of tests during a testing
session. ET is often contrasted with scripted testing, and seen as a choice
between black and white. We pose that there are different levels of exploratory
testing from fully exploratory to fully scripted and propose a scale for the
degree of exploration for ET. The degree is defined through levels of ET, which
correspond to the way test charters are formulated. We have evaluated the
classification through focus groups at four companies and identified factors
that influence the level of exploratory testing. The results show that the
proposed ET levels have distinguishing characteristics and that the levels can
be used as a guide to structure test charters. Our study also indicates that
applying a combination of ET levels can be beneficial in achieving effective
testing.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Collaborative filtering (CF) has been successfully used to provide users with
personalized products and services. However, dealing with the increasing
sparseness of user-item matrix still remains a challenge. To tackle such issue,
hybrid CF such as combining with content based filtering and leveraging side
information of users and items has been extensively studied to enhance
performance. However, most of these approaches depend on hand-crafted feature
engineering, which are usually noise-prone and biased by different feature
extraction and selection schemes. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid model
by generalizing contractive auto-encoder paradigm into matrix factorization
framework with good scalability and computational efficiency, which jointly
model content information as representations of effectiveness and compactness,
and leverage implicit user feedback to make accurate recommendations. Extensive
experiments conducted over three large scale real datasets indicate the
proposed approach outperforms the compared methods for item recommendation.

 <dc:description>  We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable
framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological
work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing
techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures),
discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex
semantic units. To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is
not supported by any existing parser. Our transition-based parser, which uses a
novel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not
just for UCCA parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can
inform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in
languages that frequently use discontinuous structures.

 <dc:description>  Various forms of Peer-Learning Environments are increasingly being used in
post-secondary education, often to help build repositories of student generated
learning objects. However, large classes can result in an extensive repository,
which can make it more challenging for students to search for suitable objects
that both reflect their interests and address their knowledge gaps. Recommender
Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (RecSysTEL) offer a potential solution
to this problem by providing sophisticated filtering techniques to help
students to find the resources that they need in a timely manner. Here, a new
RecSysTEL for Recommendation in Peer-Learning Environments (RiPLE) is
presented. The approach uses a collaborative filtering algorithm based upon
matrix factorization to create personalized recommendations for individual
students that address their interests and their current knowledge gaps. The
approach is validated using both synthetic and real data sets. The results are
promising, indicating RiPLE is able to provide sensible personalized
recommendations for both regular and cold-start users under reasonable
assumptions about parameters and user behavior.

 <dc:description>  The input to a neural sequence-to-sequence model is often determined by an
up-stream system, e.g. a word segmenter, part of speech tagger, or speech
recognizer. These up-stream models are potentially error-prone. Representing
inputs through word lattices allows making this uncertainty explicit by
capturing alternative sequences and their posterior probabilities in a compact
form. In this work, we extend the TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015) into a
LatticeLSTM that is able to consume word lattices, and can be used as encoder
in an attentional encoder-decoder model. We integrate lattice posterior scores
into this architecture by extending the TreeLSTM's child-sum and forget gates
and introducing a bias term into the attention mechanism. We experiment with
speech translation lattices and report consistent improvements over baselines
that translate either the 1-best hypothesis or the lattice without posterior
scores.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Planar Embeddings of Dynamic Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm to support the dynamic embedding in the plane of a
dynamic graph. An edge can be inserted across a face between two vertices on
the face boundary (we call such a vertex pair linkable), and edges can be
deleted. The planar embedding can also be changed locally by flipping
components that are connected to the rest of the graph by at most two vertices.
  Given vertices $u,v$, linkable$(u,v)$ decides whether $u$ and $v$ are
linkable in the current embedding, and if so, returns a list of suggestions for
the placement of $(u,v)$ in the embedding. For non-linkable vertices $u,v$, we
define a new query, one-flip-linkable$(u,v)$ providing a suggestion for a flip
that will make them linkable if one exists. We support all updates and queries
in O(log$^2 n$) time. Our time bounds match those of Italiano et al. for a
static (flipless) embedding of a dynamic graph.
  Our new algorithm is simpler, exploiting that the complement of a spanning
tree of a connected plane graph is a spanning tree of the dual graph. The
primal and dual trees are interpreted as having the same Euler tour, and a main
idea of the new algorithm is an elegant interaction between top trees over the
two trees via their common Euler tour.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a parametric level-set method for tomographic
reconstruction of partially discrete images. Such images consist of a
continuously varying background and an anomaly with a constant (known)
grey-value. We represent the geometry of the anomaly using a level-set
function, which we represent using radial basis functions. We pose the
reconstruction problem as a bi-level optimization problem in terms of the
background and coefficients for the level-set function. To constrain the
background reconstruction we impose smoothness through Tikhonov regularization.
The bi-level optimization problem is solved in an alternating fashion; in each
iteration we first reconstruct the background and consequently update the
level-set function. We test our method on numerical phantoms and show that we
can successfully reconstruct the geometry of the anomaly, even from limited
data. On these phantoms, our method outperforms Total Variation reconstruction,
DART and P-DART.

 <dc:title>Effects of Degree Correlations in Interdependent Security: Good or Bad?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>La, Richard J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the influence of degree correlations or network mixing in
interdependent security. We model the interdependence in security among agents
using a dependence graph and employ a population game model to capture the
interaction among many agents when they are strategic and have various security
measures they can choose to defend themselves. The overall network security is
measured by what we call the average risk exposure (ARE) from neighbors, which
is proportional to the total (expected) number of attacks in the network.
  We first show that there exists a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of a
population game. Then, we prove that as the agents with larger degrees in the
dependence graph see higher risks than those with smaller degrees, the overall
network security deteriorates in that the ARE experienced by agents increases
and there are more attacks in the network. Finally, using this finding, we
demonstrate that the effects of network mixing on ARE depend on the (cost)
effectiveness of security measures available to agents; if the security
measures are not effective, increasing assortativity of dependence graph
results in higher ARE. On the other hand, if the security measures are
effective at fending off the damages and losses from attacks, increasing
assortativity reduces the ARE experienced by agents.

reference frame. The update law for the path variable is chosen such that the
motion of the path-tangential frame ensures that the vessel remains on the
normal of the path-tangential reference frame. As shown in the seminal work
[20] such a parametrisation is only possible locally. A tube is defined in
which the aforementioned parametrisation is valid and the path-following
problem is solved within this tube. The size of the tube is proportional to the
maximum curvature of the path. It is shown that within this tube, the
closed-loop system of the proposed controller, guidance law, and the ocean
current observer provides exponential stability of the path-following error
dynamics. The sway velocity dynamics are analysed taking into account couplings
previously overlooked in the literature, and is shown to remain bounded.
Simulation results are presented.

 <dc:title>Sparse mean localization by information theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Diaz, Emiliano</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sparse feature selection is necessary when we fit statistical models, we have
access to a large group of features, don't know which are relevant, but assume
that most are not. Alternatively, when the number of features is larger than
the available data the model becomes over parametrized and the sparse feature
selection task involves selecting the most informative variables for the model.
When the model is a simple location model and the number of relevant features
does not grow with the total number of features, sparse feature selection
corresponds to sparse mean estimation. We deal with a simplified mean
estimation problem consisting of an additive model with gaussian noise and mean
that is in a restricted, finite hypothesis space. This restriction simplifies
the mean estimation problem into a selection problem of combinatorial nature.
Although the hypothesis space is finite, its size is exponential in the
dimension of the mean. In limited data settings and when the size of the
hypothesis space depends on the amount of data or on the dimension of the data,
choosing an approximation set of hypotheses is a desirable approach. Choosing a
set of hypotheses instead of a single one implies replacing the bias-variance
trade off with a resolution-stability trade off. Generalization capacity
provides a resolution selection criterion based on allowing the learning
algorithm to communicate the largest amount of information in the data to the
learner without error. In this work the theory of approximation set coding and
generalization capacity is explored in order to understand this approach. We
then apply the generalization capacity criterion to the simplified sparse mean
estimation problem and detail an importance sampling algorithm which at once
solves the difficulty posed by large hypothesis spaces and the slow convergence
of uniform sampling algorithms.

 <dc:title>A Passivity-Based Design for Stability and Robustness in Event-Triggered

 <dc:description>  In this report, we introduce a comprehensive design framework for
Event-Triggered Networked Control Systems based on the passivity-based concept
of Input Feed-Forward Output Feedback Passive (IF-OFP) systems. Our approach is
comprehensive in the sense that we show finite-gain $L_2$-stability and
robustness for the networked control system by considering the effects of
time-varying or constant network induced delays, signal quantizations, and data
losses in communication links from the plant to controller and the controller
to plant. Our design is based on the need for a more efficient utilization of
band-limited shared communication networks which is a necessity for the design
of Large-Scale Cyber-Physical systems. To achieve this, we introduce simple
triggering conditions that do not require the exact knowledge of the
sub-systems and are located on both sides of the communication network: the
plant's output and the controller's output. This specifically leads to a great
decrease in the communication rate between the controller and plant.
Additionally, we show lower-bounds on inter-event time intervals for the
triggering conditions and show the design's robustness against external noise
and disturbance. We illustrate the relationship amongst stability, robustness
and passivity levels for the plant and controller. We analyze our design's
robustness against packet dropouts and loss of communication. Our results are
design-oriented in the sense that based on our proposed framework, the designer
can easily observe the trade-offs amongst different components of the networked
control system, time-varying delays, effects of signal quantizations and
triggering conditions, stability, robustness and performance of networked
control system and make design decisions accordingly.

 <dc:description>  Web developers use base64 formats to include images, fonts, sounds and other
resources directly inside HTML, JavaScript, JSON and XML files. We estimate
that billions of base64 messages are decoded every day. We are motivated to
improve the efficiency of base64 encoding and decoding. Compared to
state-of-the-art implementations, we multiply the speeds of both the encoding
(~10x) and the decoding (~7x). We achieve these good results by using the
single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) instructions available on recent Intel
processors (AVX2). Our accelerated software abides by the specification and
reports errors when encountering characters outside of the base64 set. It is
available online as free software under a liberal license.

 <dc:title>A New Measure of Conditional Dependence</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Measuring conditional dependencies among the variables of a network is of
great interest to many disciplines. This paper studies some shortcomings of the
existing dependency measures in detecting direct causal influences or their
lack of ability for group selection to capture strong dependencies and
accordingly introduces a new statistical dependency measure to overcome them.
This measure is inspired by Dobrushin's coefficients and based on the fact that
there is no dependency between $X$ and $Y$ given another variable $Z$, if and
only if the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ and $Z=z$ does not
change when $X$ takes another realization $x'$ while $Z$ takes the same
realization $z$. We show the advantages of this measure over the related
measures in the literature. Moreover, we establish the connection between our
measure and the integral probability metric (IPM) that helps to develop
estimators of the measure with lower complexity compared to other relevant
information theoretic based measures. Finally, we show the performance of this
measure through numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  General human action recognition requires understanding of various visual
cues. In this paper, we propose a network architecture that computes and
integrates the most important visual cues for action recognition: pose, motion,
and the raw images. For the integration, we introduce a Markov chain model
which adds cues successively. The resulting approach is efficient and
applicable to action classification as well as to spatial and temporal action
localization. The two contributions clearly improve the performance over
respective baselines. The overall approach achieves state-of-the-art action
classification performance on HMDB51, J-HMDB and NTU RGB+D datasets. Moreover,
it yields state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action localization results on
UCF101 and J-HMDB.

 <dc:description>  The problem of mechanically formalizing and proving metatheoretic properties
of programming language calculi, type systems, operational semantics, and
related formal systems has received considerable attention recently. However,
the dual problem of searching for errors in such formalizations has attracted
comparatively little attention. In this article, we present $\alpha$Check, a
bounded model-checker for metatheoretic properties of formal systems specified
using nominal logic. In contrast to the current state of the art for metatheory
verification, our approach is fully automatic, does not require expertise in
theorem proving on the part of the user, and produces counterexamples in the
case that a flaw is detected. We present two implementations of this technique,
one based on negation-as-failure and one based on negation elimination, along
with experimental results showing that these techniques are fast enough to be
used interactively to debug systems as they are developed.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a two-dimensional phase extraction system using passive
WiFi sensing to monitor three basic elderly care activities including breathing
rate, essential tremor and falls. Specifically, a WiFi signal is acquired
through two channels where the first channel is the reference one, whereas the
other signal is acquired by a passive receiver after reflection from the human
target. Using signal processing of cross-ambiguity function, various features
in the signal are extracted. The entire implementations are performed using
software defined radios having directional antennas. We report the accuracy of
our system in different conditions and environments and show that breathing
rate can be measured with an accuracy of 87% when there are no obstacles. We
also show a 98% accuracy in detecting falls and 93% accuracy in classifying
tremor. The results indicate that passive WiFi systems show great promise in
replacing typical invasive health devices as standard tools for health care.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses algorithms for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs)
that have monotone optimal policies. We propose a two-stage alternating convex
optimization scheme that can accelerate the search for an optimal policy by
exploiting the monotone property. The first stage is a linear program
formulated in terms of the joint state-action probabilities. The second stage
is a regularized problem formulated in terms of the conditional probabilities
of actions given states. The regularization uses techniques from
nearly-isotonic regression. While a variety of iterative method can be used in
the first formulation of the problem, we show in numerical simulations that, in
particular, the alternating method of multipliers (ADMM) can be significantly
accelerated using the regularization step.

 <dc:description>  Downlink beamforming in Massive MIMO either relies on uplink pilot
measurements - exploiting reciprocity and TDD operation, or on the use of a
predetermined grid of beams with user equipments reporting their preferred
beams, mostly in FDD operation. Massive MIMO in its originally conceived form
uses the first strategy, with uplink pilots, whereas there is currently
significant commercial interest in the second, grid-of-beams. It has been
analytically shown that in isotropic scattering (independent Rayleigh fading)
the first approach outperforms the second. Nevertheless there remains
controversy regarding their relative performance in practice. In this
contribution, the performances of these two strategies are compared using
measured channel data at 2.6 GHz.

 <dc:description>  The use of synthetic graph generators is a common practice among
graph-oriented benchmark designers, as it allows obtaining graphs with the
required scale and characteristics. However, finding a graph generator that
accurately fits the needs of a given benchmark is very difficult, thus
practitioners end up creating ad-hoc ones. Such a task is usually
time-consuming, and often leads to reinventing the wheel. In this paper, we
introduce the conceptual design of DataSynth, a framework for property graphs
generation with customizable schemas and characteristics. The goal of DataSynth
is to assist benchmark designers in generating graphs efficiently and at scale,
saving from implementing their own generators. Additionally, DataSynth
introduces novel features barely explored so far, such as modeling the
correlation between properties and the structure of the graph. This is achieved
by a novel property-to-node matching algorithm for which we present preliminary
promising results.

 <dc:description>  Copy-move forgery is one of the simple and effective operations to create
forged images. Recently, techniques based on singular value decomposition (SVD)
are widely used to detect copy-move forgery (CMF). Some approaches based on SVD
are most acceptable to detect copy-move forgery but some copy-move forgery
detection approaches can not produce satisfactory detection results. Sometimes
these approaches may even produce error results. According to our observation,
detection result produced using SVD depend highly on those parameters whose
values are often determined with experiences. These values are only applicable
to a few images, which limit their application. To solve this problem, a novel
approach named as copy-move forgery detection using Cuckoo search algorithm
(CMFD-CS) is proposed in this paper. CMFD-CS integrates the CS algorithm into
SVD. It utilizes the CS algorithm to generate customized parameter values for
images, which are used CMFD under block-based framework.

that $x_i\neq y_i$. We prove that the randomized one-way communication
complexity of this problem in the public coin model is exactly
$\Theta(\min\{n,\log(1/\delta)\log^2(\frac n{\log(1/\delta)})\})$ for failure
probability $\delta$. Our lower bound holds even if promised
$\mathop{support}(y)\subset \mathop{support}(x)$. As a corollary, we obtain
optimal lower bounds for $\ell_p$-sampling in strict turnstile streams for
$0\le p &lt; 2$, as well as for the problem of finding duplicates in a stream. Our
lower bounds do not need to use large weights, and hold even if promised
$x\in\{0,1\}^n$ at all points in the stream.
  We give two different proofs of our main result. The first proof demonstrates
that any algorithm $\mathcal A$ solving sampling problems in turnstile streams
in low memory can be used to encode subsets of $[n]$ of certain sizes into a
number of bits below the information theoretic minimum. Our encoder makes
adaptive queries to $\mathcal A$ throughout its execution, but done carefully
so as to not violate correctness. This is accomplished by injecting random
noise into the encoder's interactions with $\mathcal A$, which is loosely
motivated by techniques in differential privacy. Our second proof is via a
novel randomized reduction from Augmented Indexing [MNSW98] which needs to
interact with $\mathcal A$ adaptively. To handle the adaptivity we identify
certain likely interaction patterns and union bound over them to guarantee
correct interaction on all of them. To guarantee correctness, it is important
that the interaction hides some of its randomness from $\mathcal A$ in the
reduction.

 <dc:description>  Deep generative models trained with large amounts of unlabelled data have
proven to be powerful within the domain of unsupervised learning. Many real
life data sets contain a small amount of labelled data points, that are
typically disregarded when training generative models. We propose the
Cluster-aware Generative Model, that uses unlabelled information to infer a
latent representation that models the natural clustering of the data, and
additional labelled data points to refine this clustering. The generative
performances of the model significantly improve when labelled information is
exploited, obtaining a log-likelihood of -79.38 nats on permutation invariant
MNIST, while also achieving competitive semi-supervised classification
accuracies. The model can also be trained fully unsupervised, and still improve
the log-likelihood performance with respect to related methods.

 <dc:description>  We derive a new asymptotic expansion for the global excess risk of a local
$k$-nearest neighbour classifier, where the choice of $k$ may depend upon the
test point. This expansion elucidates conditions under which the dominant
contribution to the excess risk comes from the locus of points at which each
class label is equally likely to occur, but we also show that if these
conditions are not satisfied, the dominant contribution may arise from the
tails of the marginal distribution of the features. Moreover, we prove that,
provided the $d$-dimensional marginal distribution of the features has a finite
$\rho$th moment for some $\rho &gt; 4$ (as well as other regularity conditions), a
local choice of $k$ can yield a rate of convergence of the excess risk of
$O(n^{-4/(d+4)})$, where $n$ is the sample size, whereas for the standard
$k$-nearest neighbour classifier, our theory would require $d \geq 5$ and $\rho
&gt; 4d/(d-4)$ finite moments to achieve this rate. Our results motivate a new
$k$-nearest neighbour classifier for semi-supervised learning problems, where
the unlabelled data are used to obtain an estimate of the marginal feature
density, and fewer neighbours are used for classification when this density
estimate is small. The potential improvements over the standard $k$-nearest
neighbour classifier are illustrated both through our theory and via a
simulation study.

 <dc:title>A correlation game for unsupervised learning yields computational

 <dc:description>  Much has been learned about plasticity of biological synapses from empirical
studies. Hebbian plasticity is driven by correlated activity of presynaptic and
postsynaptic neurons. Synapses that converge onto the same neuron often behave
as if they compete for a fixed resource; some survive the competition while
others are eliminated. To provide computational interpretations of these
aspects of synaptic plasticity, we formulate unsupervised learning as a
zero-sum game between Hebbian excitation and anti-Hebbian inhibition in a
neural network model. The game formalizes the intuition that Hebbian excitation
tries to maximize correlations of neurons with their inputs, while anti-Hebbian
inhibition tries to decorrelate neurons from each other. We further include a
model of synaptic competition, which enables a neuron to eliminate all
connections except those from its most strongly correlated inputs. Through
empirical studies, we show that this facilitates the learning of sensory
features that resemble parts of objects.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the next evolution of FD-MIMO technology for beyond 5G,
where antennas of the FD-MIMO system are placed in a distributed manner
throughout the cell in a multi-cell deployment scenario. This system, referred
to as Distributed FD-MIMO (D-FD-MIMO) system, is capable of providing higher
cell average throughput as well as more uniform user experience compared to the
conventional FD-MIMO system. System level simulations are performed to evaluate
performance. Our results show that the proposed D-FD-MIMO system achieves 1.4-2
times cell average throughput gain compared to the FD-MIMO system. The insights
of performance gain are provided. Hardware implementation challenges and
potential standards impact are also presented.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach to learn compressible representations in deep
architectures with an end-to-end training strategy. Our method is based on a
soft (continuous) relaxation of quantization and entropy, which we anneal to
their discrete counterparts throughout training. We showcase this method for
two challenging applications: Image compression and neural network compression.
While these tasks have typically been approached with different methods, our
soft-to-hard quantization approach gives results competitive with the
state-of-the-art for both.

 <dc:description>  Despite the increasing use of social media platforms for information and news
gathering, its unmoderated nature often leads to the emergence and spread of
rumours, i.e. pieces of information that are unverified at the time of posting.
At the same time, the openness of social media platforms provides opportunities
to study how users share and discuss rumours, and to explore how natural
language processing and data mining techniques may be used to find ways of
determining their veracity. In this survey we introduce and discuss two types
of rumours that circulate on social media; long-standing rumours that circulate
for long periods of time, and newly-emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced
events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often
with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of
research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a
rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour
detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification and rumour veracity
classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific
literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise
the efforts and achievements so far towards the development of rumour
classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future
research in social media mining for detection and resolution of rumours.

 <dc:description>  Channel feedback is essential in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Unfortunately, previous work on
multiuser MIMO has shown that the codebook size for channel feedback should
scale exponentially with the number of base station (BS) antennas, which is
greatly increased in massive MIMO systems. To reduce the codebook size and
feedback overhead, we propose an angle-of-departure (AoD)-adaptive subspace
codebook for channel feedback in FDD massive MIMO systems. Our key insight is
to leverage the observation that path AoDs vary more slowly than the path
gains. Within the angle coherence time, by utilizing the constant AoD
information, the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace codebook is able to quantize
the channel vector in a more accurate way. We also provide performance analysis
of the proposed codebook in the large-dimensional regime, where we prove that
to limit the capacity degradation within an acceptable level, the required
number of feedback bits only scales linearly with the number of resolvable
(path) AoDs, which is much smaller than the number of BS antennas. Moreover, we
compare quantized channel feedback using the proposed AoD-adaptive subspace
codebook with analog channel feedback. Extensive simulations that verify the
analytical results are provided.

 <dc:title>Polar Codes over Fading Channels with Power and Delay Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The inherent nature of polar codes being channel specific makes it difficult
to use them in a setting where the communication channel changes with time. In
particular, to be able to use polar codes in a wireless scenario, varying
attenuation due to fading needs to be mitigated. To the best of our knowledge,
there has been no comprehensive work in this direction thus far. In this work,
a practical scheme involving channel inversion with the knowledge of the
channel state at the transmitter, is proposed. An additional practical
constraint on the permissible average and peak power is imposed, which in turn
makes the channel equivalent to an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel
cascaded with an erasure channel. It is shown that the constructed polar code
could be made to achieve the symmetric capacity of this channel. Further, a
means to compute the optimal design rate of the polar code for a given power
constraint is also discussed.

other successful initiatives, such as ILSVRC and PASCAL VOC, which established
the avenue of research in the fields of scene classification and semantic
segmentation, the DAVIS Challenge comprises a dataset, an evaluation
methodology, and a public competition with a dedicated workshop co-located with
CVPR 2017. The DAVIS Challenge follows up on the recent publication of DAVIS
(Densely-Annotated VIdeo Segmentation), which has fostered the development of
several novel state-of-the-art video object segmentation techniques. In this

 <dc:description>  The initial phase of the deployment of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) has
begun and many research challenges still need to be addressed. Location privacy
continues to be in the top of these challenges. Indeed, both of academia and
industry agreed to apply the pseudonym changing approach as a solution to
protect the location privacy of VANETs'users. However, due to the pseudonyms
linking attack, a simple changing of pseudonym shown to be inefficient to
provide the required protection. For this reason, many pseudonym changing
strategies have been suggested to provide an effective pseudonym changing.
Unfortunately, the development of an effective pseudonym changing strategy for
VANETs is still an open issue. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey
and classification of pseudonym changing strategies. We then discuss and
compare them with respect to some relevant criteria. Finally, we highlight some
current researches, and open issues and give some future directions.

algorithms are exponential. Finding large empty rectangles or boxes in a set of
points in 2D and 3D space has been well studied. Efficient algorithms exist to
identify the empty regions in these low-dimensional spaces. Unfortunately such
efficiency is lacking in higher dimensions where the problem has been shown to
be NP-complete when the dimensions are included in the input. Applications for
algorithms that find large empty spaces include big data analysis, recommender
systems, automated knowledge discovery, and query optimization. Our Monte
Carlo-based algorithm discovers interesting maximal empty hyper-rectangles in
cases where dimensionality and input size would otherwise make analysis
impractical. The run-time is polynomial in the size of the input and the number
of dimensions. We apply the algorithm on a 39-dimensional data set for protein
structures and discover interesting properties that we think could not be
inferred otherwise.

 <dc:description>  An index coding (IC) problem consisting of a server and multiple receivers
with different side-information and demand sets can be equivalently represented
using a fitting matrix. A scalar linear index code to a given IC problem is a
matrix representing the transmitted linear combinations of the message symbols.
The length of an index code is then the number of transmissions (or
equivalently, the number of rows in the index code). An IC problem ${\cal
I}_{ext}$ is called an extension of another IC problem ${\cal I}$ if the
fitting matrix of ${\cal I}$ is a submatrix of the fitting matrix of ${\cal
I}_{ext}$. We first present a straightforward $m$\textit{-order} extension
${\cal I}_{ext}$ of an IC problem ${\cal I}$ for which an index code is
obtained by concatenating $m$ copies of an index code of ${\cal I}$. The length
of the codes is the same for both ${\cal I}$ and ${\cal I}_{ext}$, and if the
index code for ${\cal I}$ has optimal length then so does the extended code for
${\cal I}_{ext}$. More generally, an extended IC problem of ${\cal I}$ having
the same optimal length as ${\cal I}$ is said to be a \textit{rank-invariant}
extension of ${\cal I}$. We then focus on $2$-order rank-invariant extensions
of ${\cal I}$, and present constructions of such extensions based on involutory
permutation matrices.

 <dc:description>  We prove that constant-depth quantum circuits are more powerful than their
classical counterparts. To this end we introduce a non-oracular version of the
Bernstein-Vazirani problem which we call the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem.
An instance of the problem is specified by a quadratic form q that maps n-bit
strings to integers modulo four. The goal is to identify a linear boolean
function which describes the action of q on a certain subset of n-bit strings.
We prove that any classical probabilistic circuit composed of bounded fan-in
gates that solves the 2D Hidden Linear Function problem with high probability
must have depth logarithmic in n. In contrast, we show that this problem can be
solved with certainty by a constant-depth quantum circuit composed of one- and
two-qubit gates acting locally on a two-dimensional grid.

 <dc:description>  The key common bottleneck in most stencil codes is data movement, and prior
research has shown that improving data locality through optimisations that
schedule across loops do particularly well. However, in many large PDE
applications it is not possible to apply such optimisations through compilers
because there are many options, execution paths and data per grid point, many
dependent on run-time parameters, and the code is distributed across different
compilation units. In this paper, we adapt the data locality improving
optimisation called iteration space slicing for use in large OPS applications
both in shared-memory and distributed-memory systems, relying on run-time
analysis and delayed execution. We evaluate our approach on a number of
applications, observing speedups of 2$\times$ on the Cloverleaf 2D/3D proxy
application, which contain 83/141 loops respectively, $3.5\times$ on the linear
solver TeaLeaf, and $1.7\times$ on the compressible Navier-Stokes solver
OpenSBLI. We demonstrate strong and weak scalability up to 4608 cores of
CINECA's Marconi supercomputer. We also evaluate our algorithms on Intel's
Knights Landing, demonstrating maintained throughput as the problem size grows
beyond 16GB, and we do scaling studies up to 8704 cores. The approach is
generally applicable to any stencil DSL that provides per loop data access
information.

 <dc:description>  The design of spacecraft trajectories for missions visiting multiple
celestial bodies is here framed as a multi-objective bilevel optimization
problem. A comparative study is performed to assess the performance of
different Beam Search algorithms at tackling the combinatorial problem of
finding the ideal sequence of bodies. Special focus is placed on the
development of a new hybridization between Beam Search and the Population-based
Ant Colony Optimization algorithm. An experimental evaluation shows all
algorithms achieving exceptional performance on a hard benchmark problem. It is
found that a properly tuned deterministic Beam Search always outperforms the
remaining variants. Beam P-ACO, however, demonstrates lower parameter
sensitivity, while offering superior worst-case performance. Being an anytime
algorithm, it is then found to be the preferable choice for certain practical
applications.

 <dc:description>  Graphs are widely used to model execution dependencies in applications. In
particular, the NP-complete problem of partitioning a graph under constraints
receives enormous attention by researchers because of its applicability in
multiprocessor scheduling. We identified the additional constraint of acyclic
dependencies between blocks when mapping computer vision and imaging
applications to a heterogeneous embedded multiprocessor. Existing algorithms
and heuristics do not address this requirement and deliver results that are not
applicable for our use-case. In this work, we show that this more constrained
version of the graph partitioning problem is NP-complete and present heuristics
that achieve a close approximation of the optimal solution found by an
exhaustive search for small problem instances and much better scalability for
larger instances. In addition, we can show a positive impact on the schedule of
a real imaging application that improves communication volume and execution
time.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we develop a new framework that captures the common landscape
underlying the common non-convex low-rank matrix problems including matrix
sensing, matrix completion and robust PCA. In particular, we show for all above
problems (including asymmetric cases): 1) all local minima are also globally
optimal; 2) no high-order saddle points exists. These results explain why
simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent have global converge, and
efficiently optimize these non-convex objective functions in practice. Our
framework connects and simplifies the existing analyses on optimization
landscapes for matrix sensing and symmetric matrix completion. The framework
naturally leads to new results for asymmetric matrix completion and robust PCA.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks have shown promising results for 3D
geometry prediction. They can make predictions from very little input data such
as a single color image. A major limitation of such approaches is that they
only predict a coarse resolution voxel grid, which does not capture the surface
of the objects well. We propose a general framework, called hierarchical
surface prediction (HSP), which facilitates prediction of high resolution voxel
grids. The main insight is that it is sufficient to predict high resolution
voxels around the predicted surfaces. The exterior and interior of the objects
can be represented with coarse resolution voxels. Our approach is not dependent
on a specific input type. We show results for geometry prediction from color
images, depth images and shape completion from partial voxel grids. Our
analysis shows that our high resolution predictions are more accurate than low
resolution predictions.

 <dc:description>  Arikan's Polar codes attracted much attention as the first efficiently
decodable and capacity achieving codes. Furthermore, Polar codes exhibit an
exponentially decreasing block error probability with an asymptotic error
exponent upper bounded by 1/2. Since their discovery, many attempts have been
made to improve the error exponent and the finite block-length performance,
while keeping the bloc-structured kernel. Recently, two of us introduced a new
family of efficiently decodable error-correction codes based on a recently
discovered efficiently-contractible tensor network family in quantum many-body
physics, called branching MERA. These codes, called branching MERA codes,
include Polar codes and also extend them in a non-trivial way by substituting
the bloc-structured kernel by a convolutional structure. Here, we perform an
in-depth study of a particular example that can be thought of as a direct
extension to Arikan's Polar code, which we therefore name Convolutional Polar
codes. We prove that these codes polarize and exponentially suppress the
channel's error probability, with an asymptotic error exponent log_2(3)/2 which
is provably better than for Polar codes under successive cancellation decoding.
We also perform finite block-size numerical simulations which display improved
error-correcting capability with only a minor impact on decoding complexity.

 <dc:description>  Theory of Mind is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, intents,
knowledge, perspectives, etc.) to others and recognize that these mental states
may differ from one's own. Theory of Mind is critical to effective
communication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To
effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our
lives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together
in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI
more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human
intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI
more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds. In this work, we
argue that for human-AI teams to be effective, humans must also develop a
theory of AI's mind (ToAIM) - get to know its strengths, weaknesses, beliefs,
and quirks. We instantiate these ideas within the domain of Visual Question
Answering (VQA). We find that using just a few examples (50), lay people can be
trained to better predict responses and oncoming failures of a complex VQA
model. We further evaluate the role existing explanation (or interpretability)
modalities play in helping humans build ToAIM. Explainable AI has received
considerable scientific and popular attention in recent times. Surprisingly, we
find that having access to the model's internal states - its confidence in its
top-k predictions, explicit or implicit attention maps which highlight regions
in the image (and words in the question) the model is looking at (and listening
to) while answering a question about an image - do not help people better
predict its behavior.

 <dc:description>  There is a heterogeneous resource that contains both good parts and bad
parts, for example, a cake with some parts burnt, a land-estate with some parts
heavily taxed, or a chore with some parts fun to do. The resource has to be
divided fairly among n agents, each of whom has a personal value-density
function on the resource. The value-density functions can accept any real value
- positive or negative. Can standard cake-cutting procedures, developed for
positive valuations, be adapted to this setting? This paper focuses on the
question of envy-free cake-cutting with connected pieces. It is proved that
such a division exists for 3 agents. The proof uses a generalization of
Sperner's lemma, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Consider a stochastic process being controlled across a communication
channel. The control signal that is transmitted across the control channel can
be replaced by a malicious attacker. The controller is allowed to implement any
arbitrary detection algorithm to detect if an attacker is present. This work
characterizes some fundamental limitations of when such an attack can be
detected, and quantifies the performance degradation that an attacker that
seeks to be undetected or stealthy can introduce.

 <dc:description>  We consider tackling a single-agent RL problem by distributing it to $n$
learners. These learners, called advisors, endeavour to solve the problem from
a different focus. Their advice, taking the form of action values, is then
communicated to an aggregator, which is in control of the system. We show that
the local planning method for the advisors is critical and that none of the
ones found in the literature is flawless: the egocentric planning overestimates
values of states where the other advisors disagree, and the agnostic planning
is inefficient around danger zones. We introduce a novel approach called
empathic and discuss its theoretical aspects. We empirically examine and
validate our theoretical findings on a fruit collection task.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised Action Proposal Ranking through Proposal Recombination</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently, action proposal methods have played an important role in action
recognition tasks, as they reduce the search space dramatically. Most
unsupervised action proposal methods tend to generate hundreds of action
proposals which include many noisy, inconsistent, and unranked action
proposals, while supervised action proposal methods take advantage of
predefined object detectors (e.g., human detector) to refine and score the
action proposals, but they require thousands of manual annotations to train.
  Given the action proposals in a video, the goal of the proposed work is to
generate a few better action proposals that are ranked properly. In our
approach, we first divide action proposal into sub-proposal and then use
Dynamic Programming based graph optimization scheme to select the optimal
combinations of sub-proposals from different proposals and assign each new
proposal a score. We propose a new unsupervised image-based actioness detector
that leverages web images and employs it as one of the node scores in our graph
formulation. Moreover, we capture motion information by estimating the number
of motion contours within each action proposal patch. The proposed method is an
unsupervised method that neither needs bounding box annotations nor video level
labels, which is desirable with the current explosion of large-scale action
datasets. Our approach is generic and does not depend on a specific action
proposal method. We evaluate our approach on several publicly available trimmed
and un-trimmed datasets and obtain better performance compared to several
proposal ranking methods. In addition, we demonstrate that properly ranked
proposals produce significantly better action detection as compared to
state-of-the-art proposal based methods.

 <dc:description>  Given a user's query, traditional image search systems rank images according
to its relevance to a single modality (e.g., image content or surrounding
text). Nowadays, an increasing number of images on the Internet are available
with associated meta data in rich modalities (e.g., titles, keywords, tags,
etc.), which can be exploited for better similarity measure with queries. In
this paper, we leverage visual and textual modalities for image search by
learning their correlation with input query. According to the intent of query,
attention mechanism can be introduced to adaptively balance the importance of
different modalities. We propose a novel Attention guided Multi-modal
Correlation (AMC) learning method which consists of a jointly learned hierarchy
of intra and inter-attention networks. Conditioned on query's intent,
intra-attention networks (i.e., visual intra-attention network and language
intra-attention network) attend on informative parts within each modality; a
multi-modal inter-attention network promotes the importance of the most
query-relevant modalities. In experiments, we evaluate AMC models on the search
logs from two real world image search engines and show a significant boost on
the ranking of user-clicked images in search results. Additionally, we extend
AMC models to caption ranking task on COCO dataset and achieve competitive
results compared with recent state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  The convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the deep learning
models, has seen much success in a variety of computer vision tasks. However,
designing CNN architectures still requires expert knowledge and a lot of trial
and error. In this paper, we attempt to automatically construct CNN
architectures for an image classification task based on Cartesian genetic
programming (CGP). In our method, we adopt highly functional modules, such as
convolutional blocks and tensor concatenation, as the node functions in CGP.
The CNN structure and connectivity represented by the CGP encoding method are
optimized to maximize the validation accuracy. To evaluate the proposed method,
we constructed a CNN architecture for the image classification task with the
CIFAR-10 dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed method can be
used to automatically find the competitive CNN architecture compared with
state-of-the-art models.

 <dc:description>  We give a new upper bound on the quantum query complexity of deciding
$st$-connectivity on certain classes of planar graphs, and show the bound is
sometimes exponentially better than previous results. We then show Boolean
formula evaluation reduces to deciding connectivity on just such a class of
graphs. Applying the algorithm for $st$-connectivity to Boolean formula
evaluation problems, we match the $O(\sqrt{N})$ bound on the quantum query
complexity of evaluating formulas on $N$ variables, give a quadratic speed-up
over the classical query complexity of a certain class of promise Boolean
formulas, and show this approach can yield superpolynomial quantum/classical
separations. These results indicate that this $st$-connectivity-based approach
may be the &quot;right&quot; way of looking at quantum algorithms for formula evaluation.

 <dc:description>  An active inference problem of detecting an anomalous process among $M$
heterogeneous processes is considered. At each time, a subset of processes can
be probed. The objective is to design a sequential probing strategy that
dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to
terminate the search so that the expected detection time is minimized under a
constraint on the probability of misclassifying any process. This problem falls
into the general setting of sequential design of experiments pioneered by
Chernoff in 1959, in which a randomized strategy, referred to as the Chernoff
test, was proposed and shown to be asymptotically optimal as the error
probability approaches zero. For the problem considered in this paper, a
low-complexity deterministic test is shown to enjoy the same asymptotic
optimality while offering significantly better performance in the finite regime
and faster convergence to the optimal rate function, especially when the number
of processes is large. Furthermore, the proposed test offers considerable
reduction in implementation complexity. Extensions to detecting multiple
anomalous processes are also discussed.

 <dc:description>  The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used classification
algorithm. Its performance is well known to be impacted by a tuning parameter
which is frequently selected by cross-validation. This paper uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to provide rigorous mathematical proof for new
insights into the behavior of SVM in the large and small tuning parameter
regimes. These insights provide perhaps unexpected relationships between SVM
and naive Bayes and maximal data piling directions. We explore how
characteristics of the training data affect the behavior of SVM in many cases
including: balanced vs. unbalanced classes, low vs. high dimension, separable
vs. non-separable data. These results present a simple explanation of SVM's
behavior as a function of the tuning parameter. We also elaborate on the
geometry of complete data piling directions in high dimensional space. The
results proved in this paper suggest important implications for tuning SVM with
cross-validation.

 <dc:description>  We explore the design of an effective crowdsourcing system for an $M$-ary
classification task. Crowd workers complete simple binary microtasks whose
results are aggregated to give the final classification decision. We consider
the scenario where the workers have a reject option so that they are allowed to
skip microtasks when they are unable to or choose not to respond to binary
microtasks. Additionally, the workers report quantized confidence levels when
they are able to submit definitive answers. We present an aggregation approach
using a weighted majority voting rule, where each worker's response is assigned
an optimized weight to maximize crowd's classification performance. We obtain a
couterintuitive result that the classification performance does not benefit
from workers reporting quantized confidence. Therefore, the crowdsourcing
system designer should employ the reject option without requiring confidence
reporting.

 <dc:title>Restricted Recurrent Neural Tensor Networks: Exploiting Word Frequency

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Increasing the capacity of recurrent neural networks (RNN) usually involves
augmenting the size of the hidden layer, resulting in a significant increase of
computational cost. An alternative is the recurrent neural tensor network
(RNTN), which increases capacity by employing distinct hidden layer weights for
each vocabulary word. However, memory usage scales linearly with vocabulary
size, which can reach millions for word-level language models. In this paper,
we introduce restricted recurrent neural tensor networks (r-RNTN) which reserve
distinct hidden layer weights for frequent vocabulary words while sharing a
single set of weights for infrequent words. Perplexity evaluations show that
r-RNTNs improve language model performance over standard RNNs using only a
small fraction of the parameters of unrestricted RNTNs.

 <dc:title>Studying the Prevalence of Exception Handling Anti-Patterns</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Modern programming languages, such as Java and C#, typically provide features
that handle exceptions. These features separate error-handling code from
regular source code and are proven to enhance the practice of software
reliability, comprehension, and maintenance. Having acknowledged the advantages
of exception handling features, the misuse of them can still cause catastrophic
software failures, such as application crash. Prior studies suggested
anti-patterns of exception handling; while little knowledge was shared about
the prevalence of these anti-patterns. In this paper, we investigate the
prevalence of exception-handling anti-patterns. We collected a thorough list of
exception anti-patterns from 16 open-source Java and C# libraries and
applications using an automated exception flow analysis tool. We found that
although exception handling anti- patterns widely exist in all of our subjects,
only a few anti- patterns (e.g. Unhandled Exceptions, Catch Generic,
Unreachable Handler, Over-catch, and Destructive Wrapping) can be commonly
identified. On the other hand, we find that the prevalence of anti- patterns
illustrates differences between C# and Java. Our results call for further
in-depth analyses on the exception handling practices across different
languages.

plane abstractions, it also defines a clear interface between these two layers.
An underlying network state is represented as a view to act upon in the control
plane. We are interested in studying some fundamental properties of this
interface, both in a general framework, and in the specific case of content
routing. We try to evaluate the traffic between the two planes based on
allowing a minimum level of acceptable distortion in the network state
representation in the control plane.
  We apply our framework to content distribution, and see how we can compute
the overhead of maintaining the location of content in the control plane. This
is of importance to evaluate resolution-based content discovery in
content-oriented network architectures: we identify scenarios where the cost of
updating the control plane for content routing overwhelms the benefit of
fetching the nearest copy. We also show how to minimize the cost of this
overhead when associating costs to peering traffic and to internal traffic for
network of caches.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural network models with an attention mechanism have proven to be
extremely effective on a wide variety of sequence-to-sequence problems.
However, the fact that soft attention mechanisms perform a pass over the entire
input sequence when producing each element in the output sequence precludes
their use in online settings and results in a quadratic time complexity. Based
on the insight that the alignment between input and output sequence elements is
monotonic in many problems of interest, we propose an end-to-end differentiable
method for learning monotonic alignments which, at test time, enables computing
attention online and in linear time. We validate our approach on sentence
summarization, machine translation, and online speech recognition problems and
achieve results competitive with existing sequence-to-sequence models.

 <dc:description>  In its more than ten years of existence, the Tor network has seen hundreds of
thousands of relays come and go. Each relay maintains several RSA keys,
amounting to millions of keys, all archived by The Tor Project. In this paper,
we analyze 3.7 million RSA public keys of Tor relays. We (i) check if any
relays share prime factors or moduli, (ii) identify relays that use
non-standard exponents, (iii) characterize malicious relays that we discovered
in the first two steps, and (iv) develop a tool that can determine what onion
services fell prey to said malicious relays. Our experiments revealed that ten
relays shared moduli and 3,557 relays -- almost all part of a research project
-- shared prime factors, allowing adversaries to reconstruct private keys. We
further discovered 122 relays that used non-standard RSA exponents, presumably
in an attempt to attack onion services. By simulating how onion services are
positioned in Tor's distributed hash table, we identified four onion services
that were targeted by these malicious relays. Our work provides both The Tor
Project and onion service operators with tools to identify misconfigured and
malicious Tor relays to stop attacks before they pose a threat to Tor users.

 <dc:description>  Similarity-based approaches represent a promising direction for time series
analysis. However, many such methods rely on parameter tuning, and some have
shortcomings if the time series are multivariate (MTS), due to dependencies
between attributes, or the time series contain missing data. In this paper, we
address these challenges within the powerful context of kernel methods by
proposing the robust \emph{time series cluster kernel} (TCK). The approach
taken leverages the missing data handling properties of Gaussian mixture models
(GMM) augmented with informative prior distributions. An ensemble learning
approach is exploited to ensure robustness to parameters by combining the
clustering results of many GMM to form the final kernel.
  We evaluate the TCK on synthetic and real data and compare to other
state-of-the-art techniques. The experimental results demonstrate that the TCK
is robust to parameter choices, provides competitive results for MTS without
missing data and outstanding results for missing data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the idea of a new artificial intelligence based optimization
algorithm, which is inspired from the nature of vortex, has been provided
briefly. As also a bio-inspired computation algorithm, the idea is generally
focused on a typical vortex flow / behavior in nature and inspires from some
dynamics that are occurred in the sense of vortex nature. Briefly, the
algorithm is also a swarm-oriented evolutional problem solution approach;
because it includes many methods related to elimination of weak swarm members
and trying to improve the solution process by supporting the solution space via
new swarm members. In order have better idea about success of the algorithm; it
has been tested via some benchmark functions. At this point, the obtained
results show that the algorithm can be an alternative to the literature in
terms of single-objective optimization solution ways. Vortex Optimization
Algorithm (VOA) is the name suggestion by the authors; for this new idea of
intelligent optimization approach.

 <dc:description>  It is impossible to separate the human factors from software engineering
expertise during software development, because software is developed by people
and for people. The intangible nature of software has made it a difficult
product to successfully create, and an examination of the many reasons for
major software system failures show that the reasons for failures eventually
come down to human issues. Software developers, immersed as they are in the
technological aspect of the product, can quickly learn lessons from
technological failures and readily come up with solutions to avoid them in the
future, yet they do not learn lessons from human aspects in software
engineering. Dealing with human errors is much more difficult for developers
and often this aspect is overlooked in the evaluation process as developers
move on to issues that they are more comfortable solving. A major reason for
this oversight is that software psychology (the softer side) has not developed
as extensively.

 <dc:title>Synchronization Strings: Codes for Insertions and Deletions Approaching
  the Singleton Bound</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haeupler, Bernhard</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shahrasbi, Amirbehshad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce synchronization strings as a novel way of efficiently dealing
with synchronization errors, i.e., insertions and deletions. Synchronization
errors are strictly more general and much harder to deal with than commonly
considered half-errors, i.e., symbol corruptions and erasures. For every
$\epsilon &gt;0$, synchronization strings allow to index a sequence with an
$\epsilon^{-O(1)}$ size alphabet such that one can efficiently transform $k$
synchronization errors into $(1+\epsilon)k$ half-errors. This powerful new
technique has many applications. In this paper, we focus on designing insdel
codes, i.e., error correcting block codes (ECCs) for insertion deletion
channels.
  While ECCs for both half-errors and synchronization errors have been
intensely studied, the later has largely resisted progress. Indeed, it took
until 1999 for the first insdel codes with constant rate, constant distance,
and constant alphabet size to be constructed by Schulman and Zuckerman. Insdel
codes for asymptotically large or small noise rates were given in 2016 by
Guruswami et al. but these codes are still polynomially far from the optimal
rate-distance tradeoff. This makes the understanding of insdel codes up to this
work equivalent to what was known for regular ECCs after Forney introduced
concatenated codes in his doctoral thesis 50 years ago.
  A direct application of our synchronization strings based indexing method
gives a simple black-box construction which transforms any ECC into an equally
efficient insdel code with a slightly larger alphabet size. This instantly
transfers much of the highly developed understanding for regular ECCs over
large constant alphabets into the realm of insdel codes. Most notably, we
obtain efficient insdel codes which get arbitrarily close to the optimal
rate-distance tradeoff given by the Singleton bound for the complete noise
spectrum.

 <dc:description>  We explore properties and applications of the Principal Inertia Components
(PICs) between two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$. The PICs lie in the
intersection of information and estimation theory, and provide a fine-grained
decomposition of the dependence between $X$ and $Y$. Moreover, the PICs
describe which functions of $X$ can or cannot be reliably inferred (in terms of
MMSE) given an observation of $Y$. We demonstrate that the PICs play an
important role in information theory, and they can be used to characterize
information-theoretic limits of certain estimation problems. In privacy
settings, we prove that the PICs are related to fundamental limits of perfect
privacy.

systematic literature review with detailed information about the processes
suggested by several guidelines in the field of evidence-based software
engineering. Method: An analisys of recent systematic literature reviews
published in world leading journals, plus the use of two renowned guidelines
and a textbook to sinthetise a formal plan (the protocol). Results: The
validated protocol Conclusions: We found that most of the published systematic
reviews lack on reporting the protocol, or it is weak. There is a lack of tool
support to develop formal protocols. Although a protocol, like a plan, must
have the flexibility to adapt to unforeseen situations, its objective is that
the actual activities should resemble as far as possible of those already
planned. Therefore, it is a difficult balance to achieve and, researchers must
be careful not to introduce alterations that could become threats to the
validity of the entire work.

 <dc:description>  Traditional Linear Genetic Programming (LGP) algorithms are based only on the
selection mechanism to guide the search. Genetic operators combine or mutate
random portions of the individuals, without knowing if the result will lead to
a fitter individual. Probabilistic Model Building Genetic Programming (PMB-GP)
methods were proposed to overcome this issue through a probability model that
captures the structure of the fit individuals and use it to sample new
individuals. This work proposes the use of LGP with a Stochastic Context-Free
Grammar (SCFG), that has a probability distribution that is updated according
to selected individuals. We proposed a method for adapting the grammar into the
linear representation of LGP. Tests performed with the proposed probabilistic
method, and with two hybrid approaches, on several symbolic regression
benchmark problems show that the results are statistically better than the
obtained by the traditional LGP.

 <dc:description>  Deforestation detection using satellite images can make an important
contribution to forest management. Current approaches can be broadly divided
into those that compare two images taken at similar periods of the year and
those that monitor changes by using multiple images taken during the growing
season. The CMFDA algorithm described in Zhu et al. (2012) is an algorithm that
builds on the latter category by implementing a year-long, continuous,
time-series based approach to monitoring images. This algorithm was developed
for 30m resolution, 16-day frequency reflectance data from the Landsat
satellite. In this work we adapt the algorithm to 1km, 16-day frequency
reflectance data from the modis sensor aboard the Terra satellite. The CMFDA
algorithm is composed of two submodels which are fitted on a pixel-by-pixel
basis. The first estimates the amount of surface reflectance as a function of
the day of the year. The second estimates the occurrence of a deforestation
event by comparing the last few predicted and real reflectance values. For this
comparison, the reflectance observations for six different bands are first
combined into a forest index. Real and predicted values of the forest index are
then compared and high absolute differences for consecutive observation dates
are flagged as deforestation events. Our adapted algorithm also uses the two
model framework. However, since the modis 13A2 dataset used, includes
reflectance data for different spectral bands than those included in the
Landsat dataset, we cannot construct the forest index. Instead we propose two
contrasting approaches: a multivariate and an index approach similar to that of
CMFDA.

 <dc:description>  We present a distributed self-adjusting algorithm for skip graphs that
minimizes the average routing costs between arbitrary communication pairs by
performing topological adaptation to the communication pattern. Our algorithm
is fully decentralized, conforms to the $\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model (i.e. uses
$O(\log n)$ bit messages), and requires $O(\log n)$ bits of memory for each
node, where $n$ is the total number of nodes. Upon each communication request,
our algorithm first establishes communication by using the standard skip graph
routing, and then locally and partially reconstructs the skip graph topology to
perform topological adaptation. We propose a computational model for such
algorithms, as well as a yardstick (working set property) to evaluate them. Our
working set property can also be used to evaluate self-adjusting algorithms for
other graph classes where multiple tree-like subgraphs overlap (e.g. hypercube
networks). We derive a lower bound of the amortized routing cost for any
algorithm that follows our model and serves an unknown sequence of
communication requests. We show that the routing cost of our algorithm is at
most a constant factor more than the amortized routing cost of any algorithm
conforming to our computational model. We also show that the expected
transformation cost for our algorithm is at most a logarithmic factor more than
the amortized routing cost of any algorithm conforming to our computational
model.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an algorithm for word-level text spotting that is able to
accurately and reliably determine the bounding regions of individual words of
text &quot;in the wild&quot;. Our system is formed by the cascade of two convolutional
neural networks. The first network is fully convolutional and is in charge of
detecting areas containing text. This results in a very reliable but possibly
inaccurate segmentation of the input image. The second network (inspired by the
popular YOLO architecture) analyzes each segment produced in the first stage,
and predicts oriented rectangular regions containing individual words. No
post-processing (e.g. text line grouping) is necessary. With execution time of
450 ms for a 1000-by-560 image on a Titan X GPU, our system achieves the
highest score to date among published algorithms on the ICDAR 2015 Incidental
Scene Text dataset benchmark.

 <dc:description>  Tor is vulnerable to network-level adversaries who can observe both ends of
the communication to deanonymize users. Recent work has shown that Tor is
susceptible to the previously unknown active BGP routing attacks, called RAPTOR
attacks, which expose Tor users to more network-level adversaries. In this
paper, we aim to mitigate and detect such active routing attacks against Tor.
First, we present a new measurement study on the resilience of the Tor network
to active BGP prefix attacks. We show that ASes with high Tor bandwidth can be
less resilient to attacks than other ASes. Second, we present a new Tor guard
relay selection algorithm that incorporates resilience of relays into
consideration to proactively mitigate such attacks. We show that the algorithm
successfully improves the security for Tor clients by up to 36% on average (up
to 166% for certain clients). Finally, we build a live BGP monitoring system
that can detect routing anomalies on the Tor network in real time by performing
an AS origin check and novel detection analytics. Our monitoring system
successfully detects simulated attacks that are modeled after multiple known
attack types as well as a real-world hijack attack (performed by us), while
having low false positive rates.

 <dc:description>  Due to increasing concerns about privacy and data control as one of the
factors, many small clouds (SCs) established by different providers are
emerging in an attempt to meet demand locally. The flip-side of this approach
is the problem of resource inelasticity faced by the SCs due to their
relatively scarce resources (e.g., virtual machines), thereby leading to
potential degradation of customer QoS and loss of revenue. A proposed solution
to this problem recommends the sharing of resources between SCs to alleviate
the resource inelasticity issues that might arise. However, effective borrowing
of resources by an SC from its peers involves mutually satisfying the interests
of the stakeholders in question, i.e., the SC customers, the SCs, and a
regulatory agency (e.g., the federal government) overseeing the functioning of
the SCs. In this paper, we model the 'stakeholder satisfaction problem' in SCs
as a socially efficient dynamic market/ecosystem design task, where the market
elements comprise the stakeholders, and the term 'social efficiency' implying
the market reaching a utilitarian maximum social welfare state when in
equilibrium. Our market design approach is based on Arrow and Hurwicz's
disequilibrium process and uses the gradient play technique in game theory to
iteratively converge upon efficient and stable market equilibria. We illustrate
the stability and sustainability of SC markets via both theory and experiments.

 <dc:description>  Automatic cell image segmentation methods in connectomics produce merge and
split errors, which require correction through proofreading. Previous research
has identified the visual search for these errors as the bottleneck in
interactive proofreading. To aid error correction, we develop two classifiers
that automatically recommend candidate merges and splits to the user. These
classifiers use a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained with
errors in automatic segmentations against expert-labeled ground truth. Our
classifiers detect potentially-erroneous regions by considering a large context
region around a segmentation boundary. Corrections can then be performed by a
user with yes/no decisions, which reduces variation of information 7.5x faster
than previous proofreading methods. We also present a fully-automatic mode that
uses a probability threshold to make merge/split decisions. Extensive
experiments using the automatic approach and comparing performance of novice
and expert users demonstrate that our method performs favorably against
state-of-the-art proofreading methods on different connectomics datasets.

 <dc:description>  Building a voice conversion (VC) system from non-parallel speech corpora is
challenging but highly valuable in real application scenarios. In most
situations, the source and the target speakers do not repeat the same texts or
they may even speak different languages. In this case, one possible, although
indirect, solution is to build a generative model for speech. Generative models
focus on explaining the observations with latent variables instead of learning
a pairwise transformation function, thereby bypassing the requirement of speech
frame alignment. In this paper, we propose a non-parallel VC framework with a
variational autoencoding Wasserstein generative adversarial network (VAW-GAN)
that explicitly considers a VC objective when building the speech model.
Experimental results corroborate the capability of our framework for building a
VC system from unaligned data, and demonstrate improved conversion quality.

 <dc:description>  In most state-of-the-art hashing-based visual search systems, local image
descriptors of an image are first aggregated as a single feature vector. This
feature vector is then subjected to a hashing function that produces a binary
hash code. In previous work, the aggregating and the hashing processes are
designed independently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where
feature aggregating and hashing are designed simultaneously and optimized
jointly. Specifically, our joint optimization produces aggregated
representations that can be better reconstructed by some binary codes. This
leads to more discriminative binary hash codes and improved retrieval accuracy.
In addition, we also propose a fast version of the recently-proposed Binary
Autoencoder to be used in our proposed framework. We perform extensive
retrieval experiments on several benchmark datasets with both SIFT and
convolutional features. Our results suggest that the proposed framework
achieves significant improvements over the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  It is widely acknowledged that drivers should remain in the control loop of
automated vehicles before they completely meet real-world operational
conditions. This paper introduces an `indirect shared control' scheme for
steer-by-wire vehicles, which allows the vehicle control authority to be
continuously shared between the driver and automation through unphysical
cooperation. This paper first balances the control objectives of the driver and
automation in a weighted summation, and then models the driver's adaptive
control behavior using a predictive control approach. The driver adaptation
modeling enables off-line evaluations of indirect shared control systems and
thus facilitates the design of the assistant controller. Unlike any
conventional driver model for manual driving, this model assumes that the
driver can learn and incorporate the controller strategy into his internal
model for more accurate path following. To satisfy the driving demands in
different scenarios, a sliding-window detector is designed to continuously
monitor the driver intention and automatically switch the authority weights
between the driver and automation. The simulation results illustrate the
advantages of considering the driver adaptation in path-following and
obstacle-avoidance tasks, and show the effectiveness of indirect shared control
for cooperative driving.

 <dc:description>  Obesity is a chronic disease that can lead to an increased risk of other
serious chronic diseases and even death. We present switching and time-delayed
feedback-based model free control methods for the dynamic management of body
mass and its major components. The estimation of body composition based on
human body weight dynamics is proposed using a soft switching-based observer.
Additionally, this paper addresses the control allocation problem for optimal
body weight management using linear algebraic equivalence of the nonlinear
controllers based on dynamic behavior of body composition described in
literature. A control allocator system computes the required energy intake and
energy expenditure from a controlling range of inputs to track a desired
trajectory of body mass by optimizing a weighted quadratic function. Simulation
results validate the performance of the proposed controllers and the observer
under disturbances in recording energy intake and energy expenditure figures.

 <dc:description>  Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are capable of adjusting its behavior in
response to meaningful changes in the operational con-text and itself. The
adaptation needs to be performed automatically through self-managed reactions
and decision-making processes at runtime. To support this kind of automatic
behavior, SASs must be endowed by a rich runtime support that can detect
requirements violations and reason about adaptation decisions. Requirements
Engineering for SASs primarily aims to model adaptation logic and mechanisms.
Requirements models will guide the design decisions and runtime behaviors of
sys-tem-to-be. This paper proposes a model-driven approach for achieving
adaptation against non-functional requirements (NFRs), i.e. reliability and
performances. The approach begins with the models in RE stage and provides
runtime support for self-adaptation. We capture adaptation mechanisms as
graphical elements in the goal model. By assigning reliability and performance
attributes to related system tasks, we derive the tagged sequential diagram for
specifying the reliability and performances of system behaviors. To formalize
system behavior, we transform the requirements model to the corresponding
behavior model, expressed by Label Transition Systems (LTS). To analyze the
reliability requirements and performance requirements, we merged the sequential
diagram and LTS to a variable Discrete-Time Markov Chains (DTMC) and a variable
Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMC) respectively. Adaptation candidates are
characterized by the variable states. The optimal decision is derived by
verifying the concerned NFRs and reducing the decision space. Our approach is
implemented through the demonstration of a mobile information system.

 <dc:description>  In diffusion-based molecular communication, information particles locomote
via a diffusion process, characterized by random movement and heavy tail
distribution for the random arrival time. As a result, the molecular
communication shows lower transmission rates. To compensate for such low rates,
researchers have recently proposed the molecular multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) technique. Although channel models exist for single-input single-output
(SISO) systems for some simple environments, extending the results to multiple
molecular emitters complicates the modeling process. In this paper, we
introduce a technique for modeling the molecular MIMO channel and confirm the
effectiveness via numerical studies.

 <dc:description>  Self-adaptive software (SAS) is capable of adjusting its behavior in response
to meaningful changes in the operational context and itself. Due to the
inherent volatility of the open and changeable environment in which SAS is
embedded, the ability of adaptation is highly demanded by many
software-intensive systems. Two concerns, i.e., the requirements uncertainty
and the context uncertainty are most important among others at Requirements
Engineering (RE) stage. However, requirements analyzers can hardly figure out
the mathematical relation between requirements, system behavior and context,
especially for complex and nonlinear systems, due to the existence of above
uncertainties, misunderstanding and ambiguity of prior knowledge. An essential
issue to be addressed is how to model and specify these uncertainties at RE
stage and how to utilize the prior knowledge to achieve adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a fuzzy-based approach to modeling uncertainty and achieving
evolution. The approach introduces specifications to describe fuzziness. Based
on the specifications, we derive a series of reasoning rules as knowledge base
for achieving adaptation and evolution. These two targets are implemented
through four reasoning schemas from a control theory perspective. Specifically,
forward reasoning schema is used for direct adaptation; backward reasoning
schema is used for optimal adaptation. Parameter-identified schema implements
learning evolution by considering SAS as the gray-box system, while
system-identified reasoning schema implements learning evolution by considering
SAS as the gray-box system. The former two schemas function as the control
group, while the latter two are de-signed as the experimental groups to
illustrate the learning ability. Our approach is implemented under three types
of context through the demonstration of a mobile computing application.

 <dc:description>  For a rumour spreading protocol, the spread time is defined as the first time
that everyone learns the rumour. We compare the synchronous push&amp;pull rumour
spreading protocol with its asynchronous variant, and show that for any
$n$-vertex graph and any starting vertex, the ratio between their expected
spread times is bounded by $O \left({n}^{1/3}{\log^{2/3} n}\right)$. This
improves the $O(\sqrt n)$ upper bound of Giakkoupis, Nazari, and Woelfel (in
Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing, 2016). Our
bound is tight up to a factor of $O(\log n)$, as illustrated by the string of
diamonds graph. We also show that if for a pair $\alpha,\beta$ of real numbers,
there exists infinitely many graphs for which the two spread times are
$n^{\alpha}$ and $n^{\beta}$ in expectation, then $0\leq\alpha \leq 1$ and
$\alpha \leq \beta \leq \frac13 + \frac23 \alpha$; and we show each such pair
$\alpha,\beta$ is achievable.

 <dc:description>  Even as we advance the frontiers of physics knowledge, our understanding of
how this knowledge evolves remains at the descriptive levels of Popper and
Kuhn. Using the APS publications data sets, we ask in this letter how new
knowledge is built upon old knowledge. We do so by constructing year-to-year
bibliographic coupling networks, and identify in them validated communities
that represent different research fields. We then visualize their evolutionary
relationships in the form of alluvial diagrams, and show how they remain intact
through APS journal splits. Quantitatively, we see that most fields undergo
weak Popperian mixing, and it is rare for a field to remain isolated/undergo
strong mixing. The sizes of fields obey a simple linear growth with
recombination. We can also reliably predict the merging between two fields, but
not for the considerably more complex splitting. Finally, we report a case
study of two fields that underwent repeated merging and splitting around 1995,
and how these Kuhnian events are correlated with breakthroughs on BEC, quantum
teleportation, and slow light. This impact showed up quantitatively in the
citations of the BEC field as a larger proportion of references from during and
shortly after these events.

 <dc:description>  Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a key role in biological sequence
analyses, especially in phylogenetic tree construction. Extreme increase in
next-generation sequencing results in shortage of efficient ultra-large
biological sequence alignment approaches for coping with different sequence
types. Distributed and parallel computing represents a crucial technique for
accelerating ultra-large sequence analyses. Based on HAlign and Spark
distributed computing system, we implement a highly cost-efficient and
time-efficient HAlign-II tool to address ultra-large multiple biological
sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. After comparing with
most available state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results indicate the
following: 1) HAlign-II can efficiently carry out MSA and construct
phylogenetic trees with ultra-large biological sequences; 2) HAlign-II shows
extremely high memory efficiency and scales well with increases in computing
resource; 3) HAlign-II provides a user-friendly web server based on our
distributed computing infrastructure. HAlign-II with open-source codes and
datasets was established at http://lab.malab.cn/soft/halign.

 <dc:description>  The topologies of predictable dynamic networks are continuously dynamic in
terms of node position, network connectivity and link metric. However, their
dynamics are almost predictable compared with the ad-hoc network. The existing
routing protocols specific to static or ad-hoc network do not consider this
predictability and thus are not very efficient for some cases.
  We present a topology model based on Divide-and-Merge methodology to
formulate the dynamic topology into the series of static topologies, which can
reflect the topology dynamics correctly with the least number of static
topologies. Then we design a dynamic programing algorithm to solve that model
and determine the timing of routing update and the topology to be used.
Besides, for the classic predictable dynamic network---space Internet, the
links at some region have shorter delay, which leads to most traffic converge
at these links. Meanwhile, the connectivity and metric of these links
continuously vary, which results in a great end-to-end path variations and
routing updates. In this paper, we propose a stable routing scheme which adds
link life-time into its metric to eliminate these dynamics. And then we take
use of the Dijkstra's greedy feature to release some paths from the dynamic
link, achieving the goal of routing stability. Experimental results show that
our method can significantly decrease the number of changed paths and affected
network nodes, and then greatly improve the network stability. Interestingly,
our method can also achieve better network performance, including the less
number of loss packets, smoother variation of end-to-end delay and higher
throughput.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of camera-to-laser-scanner calibration using a
checkerboard and multiple image-laser scan pairs. Distinguishing which laser
points measure the checkerboard and which lie on the background is essential to
any such system. We formulate the checkerboard extraction as a combinatorial
optimization problem with a clear cut objective function. We propose a
branch-and-bound technique that deterministically and globally optimizes the
objective. Unlike what is available in the literature, the proposed method is
not heuristic and does not require assumptions such as constraints on the
background or relying on discontinuity of the range measurements to partition
the data into line segments. The proposed approach is generic and can be
applied to both 3D or 2D laser scanners as well as the cases where multiple
checkerboards are present. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach by providing numerical simulations as well as experimental results.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a discrete-time geometric attitude observer for fusing
monocular vision with GPS velocity measurements. The observer takes the
relative transformations obtained from processing monocular images with any
visual odometry algorithm and fuses them with GPS velocity measurements. The
objectives of this sensor fusion are twofold; first to mitigate the inherent
drift of the attitude estimates of the visual odometry, and second, to estimate
the orientation directly with respect to the North-East-Down frame. A key
contribution of the paper is to present a rigorous stability analysis showing
that the attitude estimates of the observer converge exponentially to the true
attitude and to provide a lower bound for the convergence rate of the observer.
Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that the observer effectively
compensates for the inherent drift of the pure monocular vision based attitude
estimation and is able to recover the North-East-Down orientation even if it is
initialized with a very large attitude error.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, using the stochastic geometry theory, we present a framework
for analyzing the performance of device-to-device (D2D) communications
underlaid uplink (UL) cellular networks. In our analysis, we consider a D2D
mode selection criterion based on an energy threshold for each user equipment
(UE). Specifically, a UE will operate in a cellular mode, if its received
signal strength from the strongest base station (BS) is large than a threshold
\beta. Otherwise, it will operate in a D2D mode. Furthermore, we consider a
generalized log-normal shadowing in our analysis. The coverage probability and
the area spectral efficiency (ASE) are derived for both the cellular network
and the D2D one. Through our theoretical and numerical analyses, we quantify
the performance gains brought by D2D communications and provide guidelines of
selecting the parameters for network operations.

 <dc:description>  Research in analysis of microblogging platforms is experiencing a renewed
surge with a large number of works applying representation learning models for
applications like sentiment analysis, semantic textual similarity computation,
hashtag prediction, etc. Although the performance of the representation
learning models has been better than the traditional baselines for such tasks,
little is known about the elementary properties of a tweet encoded within these
representations, or why particular representations work better for certain
tasks. Our work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the
black-box of vector embeddings for tweets. Traditional feature engineering
methods for high-level applications have exploited various elementary
properties of tweets. We believe that a tweet representation is effective for
an application because it meticulously encodes the application-specific
elementary properties of tweets. To understand the elementary properties
encoded in a tweet representation, we evaluate the representations on the
accuracy to which they can model each of those properties such as tweet length,
presence of particular words, hashtags, mentions, capitalization, etc. Our
systematic extensive study of nine supervised and four unsupervised tweet
representations against most popular eight textual and five social elementary
properties reveal that Bi-directional LSTMs (BLSTMs) and Skip-Thought Vectors
(STV) best encode the textual and social properties of tweets respectively.
FastText is the best model for low resource settings, providing very little
degradation with reduction in embedding size. Finally, we draw interesting
insights by correlating the model performance obtained for elementary property
prediction tasks with the highlevel downstream applications.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of matching applicants to posts where applicants have
preferences over posts. Thus the input to our problem is a bipartite graph G =
(A U P,E), where A denotes a set of applicants, P is a set of posts, and there
are ranks on edges which denote the preferences of applicants over posts. A
matching M in G is called rank-maximal if it matches the maximum number of
applicants to their rank 1 posts, subject to this the maximum number of
applicants to their rank 2 posts, and so on.
  We consider this problem in a dynamic setting, where vertices and edges can
be added and deleted at any point. Let n and m be the number of vertices and
edges in an instance G, and r be the maximum rank used by any rank-maximal
matching in G. We give a simple O(r(m+n))-time algorithm to update an existing
rank-maximal matching under each of these changes. When r = o(n), this is
faster than recomputing a rank-maximal matching completely using a known
algorithm like that of Irving et al., which takes time O(min((r + n,
r*sqrt(n))m).

 <dc:description>  We introduce quantitative reductions, a novel technique for solving
quantitative games that does not rely on a reduction to qualitative games. We
demonstrate that such reductions exhibit the same desirable properties as
qualitative ones. In addition, they retain the optimality of solutions. As a
general-purpose target for quantitative reductions, we introduce vertex-ranked
games, in which the value of a play is determined only by a qualitative winning
condition and a ranking of the vertices. Moreover, we demonstrate how to solve
such games optimally.
  Finally, we provide quantitative reductions to vertex-ranked games for both
quantitative request-response and Muller games. Thereby, we obtain
Exptime-completeness of solving the former games, while obtaining a new proof
for the membership of solving the latter games in Exptime.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a novel approach that enables users to interact
with a mobile robot in a natural manner. The proposed interaction system does
not require any specific infrastructure or device, but relies on commonly
utilized objects while leaving the user's hands free. Specifically, we propose
to utilize a smartwatch (or a sensorized wristband) for recognizing the motion
of the user's forearm. Measurements of accelerations and angular velocities are
exploited to recognize user's gestures and define velocity commands for the
robot. The proposed interaction system is evaluated experimentally with
different users controlling a mobile robot and compared to the use of a remote
control device for the teleoperation of robots. Results show that the usability
and effectiveness of the proposed natural interaction system based on the use
of a smartwatch provide significant improvement in the human-robot interaction
experience.

 <dc:description>  Given simple undirected graph G = (V, E), the Maximum Clique Problem(MCP) is
that of finding a maximum-cardinality subset Q of V such that any two vertices
in Q are adjacent. We present a modified local search algorithm for this
problem. Our algorithm build some maximal solution and can determine in
polynomial time if a maximal solution can be improved by replacing a single
vertex with k, k &gt; 1, others. We test our algorithms on DIMACS[5], Sloane[15],
BHOSLIB[1], Iovanella[8] and our random instances.

 <dc:title>MIMO Underwater Visible Light Communications: Comprehensive Channel
  Study, Performance Analysis, and Multiple-Symbol Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analytically study the bit error rate (BER) performance of
underwater visible light communication (UVLC) systems with binary pulse
position modulation (BPPM). We simulate the channel fading-free impulse
response (FFIR) based on Monte Carlo numerical method to take into account the
absorption and scattering effects. Additionally, to characterize turbulence
effects, we multiply the aforementioned FFIR by a fading coefficient which for
weak oceanic turbulence can be modeled as a lognormal random variable (RV).
Moreover, to mitigate turbulence effects, we employ multiple transmitters
and/or receivers, i.e., spatial diversity technique over UVLC links.
Closed-form expressions for the system BER are provided, when equal gain
combiner (EGC) is employed at the receiver side, thanks to Gauss-Hermite
quadrature formula and approximation to the sum of lognormal RVs. We further
apply saddle-point approximation, an accurate photon-counting-based method, to
evaluate the system BER in the presence of shot noise. Both laser-based
collimated and light emitting diode (LED)-based diffusive links are
investigated. Since multiple-scattering effect of UVLC channels on the
propagating photons causes considerable inter-symbol interference (ISI),
especially for diffusive channels, we also obtain the optimum multiple-symbol
detection (MSD) algorithm to significantly alleviate ISI effects and improve
the system performance. Our numerical analysis indicates good matches between
the analytical and photon-counting results implying the negligibility of
signal-dependent shot noise, and also between analytical results and numerical
simulations confirming the accuracy of our derived closed-form expressions for
the system BER. Besides, our results show that spatial diversity significantly
mitigates fading impairments while MSD considerably alleviates ISI
deteriorations.

 <dc:description>  Attitudes can have a profound impact on socially relevant behaviours, such as
voting. However, this effect is not uniform across situations or individuals,
and it is at present difficult to predict whether attitudes will predict
behaviour in any given circumstance. Using a network model, we demonstrate that
(a) more strongly connected attitude networks have a stronger impact on
behaviour, and (b) within any given attitude network, the most central attitude
elements have the strongest impact. We test these hypotheses using data on
voting and attitudes toward presidential candidates in the US presidential
elections from 1980 to 2012. These analyses confirm that the predictive value
of attitude networks depends almost entirely on their level of connectivity,
with more central attitude elements having stronger impact. The impact of
attitudes on voting behaviour can thus be reliably determined before elections
take place by using network analyses.

 <dc:description>  The probability density function of a probability distribution is a
fundamental concept in probability theory and a key ingredient in various
widely used machine learning methods. However, the necessary framework for
compiling probabilistic functional programs to density functions has only
recently been developed. In this work, we present a density compiler for a
probabilistic language with failure and both discrete and continuous
distributions, and provide a proof of its soundness. The compiler greatly
reduces the development effort of domain experts, which we demonstrate by
solving inference problems from various scientific applications, such as
modelling the global carbon cycle, using a standard Markov chain Monte Carlo
framework.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Previous approaches to training syntax-based sentiment classification models
required phrase-level annotated corpora, which are not readily available in
many languages other than English. Thus, we propose the use of tree-structured
Long Short-Term Memory with an attention mechanism that pays attention to each
subtree of the parse tree. Experimental results indicate that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a Japanese sentiment
classification task.

 <dc:title>Blind Signal Detection in Massive MIMO: Exploiting the Channel Sparsity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In practical massive MIMO systems, a substantial portion of system resources
are consumed to acquire channel state information (CSI), leading to a
drastically lower system capacity compared with the ideal case where perfect
CSI is available. In this paper, we show that the overhead for CSI acquisition
can be largely compensated by the potential gain due to the sparsity of the
massive MIMO channel in a certain transformed domain. To this end, we propose a
novel blind detection scheme that simultaneously estimates the channel and data
by factorizing the received signal matrix. We show that by exploiting the
channel sparsity, our proposed scheme can achieve a DoF very close to the ideal
case, provided that the channel is sufficiently sparse. Specifically, the
achievable degree of freedom (DoF) has a fractional gap of only $1/T$ from the
ideal DoF, where $T$ is the channel coherence time. This is a remarkable
advance for understanding the performance limit of the massive MIMO system. We
further show that the performance advantage of our proposed scheme in the
asymptotic SNR regime carries over to the practical SNR regime. Numerical
results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms its
counterpart schemes in the practical SNR regime under various system
configurations.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a design of a non-player character (AI) for promoting
balancedness in use of body segments when engaging in full-body motion gaming.
In our experiment, we settle a battle between the proposed AI and a player by
using FightingICE, a fighting game platform for AI development. A middleware
called UKI is used to allow the player to control the game by using body motion
instead of the keyboard and mouse. During gameplay, the proposed AI analyze
health states of the player; it determines its next action by predicting how
each candidate action, recommended by a Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm, will
induce the player to move, and how the player's health tends to be affected.
Our result demonstrates successful improvement in balancedness in use of body
segments on 4 out of 5 subjects.

 <dc:description>  The Web is becoming more and more a wide software framework on which each one
can compose and use contents, software applications and services. It can offer
adequate computational resources to manage the complexity implied by the use of
the five senses when involved in human machine interaction. The core of the
paper describes how SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) can support multimodal
interaction by pushing the I/O processing and reasoning to the cloud, improving
naturalness. The benefits of cloud computing for multimodal interaction have
been identified by emphasizing the flexibility and scalability of a SOA, and
its characteristics to provide a more holistic view of interaction according to
the variety of situations and users.

 <dc:description>  The deep financial and economic crisis, which still characterizes these
years, requires searching for tools in order to enhance knowledge sharing,
creativity and innovation. The Internet is one of these tools that represents a
practically infinite source of resources. In this perspective, the KnowInG
project, funded by the STC programme MED, is aimed at developing the KnowInG
Resource Centre (KRC), a sociotechnical system that works as a multiplier of
innovation. KRC was conceived as a crowdsourcing platform allowing people,
universities, research centres, organizations and companies to be active actors
of creative and innovation processes from a local to a transnational level.

 <dc:description>  The computing systems used by LHC experiments has historically consisted of
the federation of hundreds to thousands of distributed resources, ranging from
small to mid-size resource. In spite of the impressive scale of the existing
distributed computing solutions, the federation of small to mid-size resources
will be insufficient to meet projected future demands. This paper is a case
study of how the ATLAS experiment has embraced Titan---a DOE leadership
facility in conjunction with traditional distributed high- throughput computing
to reach sustained production scales of approximately 52M core-hours a years.
The three main contributions of this paper are: (i) a critical evaluation of
design and operational considerations to support the sustained, scalable and
production usage of Titan; (ii) a preliminary characterization of a next
generation executor for PanDA to support new workloads and advanced execution
modes; and (iii) early lessons for how current and future experimental and
observational systems can be integrated with production supercomputers and
other platforms in a general and extensible manner.

 <dc:title>Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Methods for Glaucoma Detection with
  Modification of U-Net Convolutional Neural Network</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness all over the world, with
approximately 60 million cases reported worldwide in 2010. If undiagnosed in
time, glaucoma causes irreversible damage to the optic nerve leading to
blindness. The optic nerve head examination, which involves measurement of
cup-to-disc ratio, is considered one of the most valuable methods of structural
diagnosis of the disease. Estimation of cup-to-disc ratio requires segmentation
of optic disc and optic cup on eye fundus images and can be performed by modern
computer vision algorithms. This work presents universal approach for automatic
optic disc and cup segmentation, which is based on deep learning, namely,
modification of U-Net convolutional neural network. Our experiments include
comparison with the best known methods on publicly available databases
DRIONS-DB, RIM-ONE v.3, DRISHTI-GS. For both optic disc and cup segmentation,
our method achieves quality comparable to current state-of-the-art methods,
outperforming them in terms of the prediction time.

 <dc:description>  During exploratory testing sessions the tester simultaneously learns, designs
and executes tests. The activity is iterative and utilizes the skills of the
tester and provides flexibility and creativity.Test charters are used as a
vehicle to support the testers during the testing. The aim of this study is to
support practitioners in the design of test charters through checklists. We
aimed to identify factors allowing practitioners to critically reflect on their
designs and contents of test charters to support practitioners in making
informed decisions of what to include in test charters. The factors and
contents have been elicited through interviews. Overall, 30 factors and 35
content elements have been elicited.

transmitted reference pulse cluster (TRPC) modulation scheme is presented. The
TRPC-UWB transmitter integrates, namely, wideband active baluns, wideband I-Q
modulator based up-conversion mixer, and differential to single-ended
converter. The integrated circuits of TRPC-UWB front end is designed and
implemented in the 130-nm CMOS process technology. the measured worst-case
carrier leakage suppression is 22.4 dBc, while the single sideband suppression
is higher than 31.6 dBc, operating at the frequency from 3.1 GHz to 8.2 GHz.
With adjustable data rate of 10 to 300 Mbps, the transmitter achieves a high
energy efficiency of 38.4 pJ/pulse.

 <dc:description>  Exploratory testing is neither black nor white, but rather a continuum of
exploration exists. In this research we propose an approach for decision
support helping practitioners to distribute time between different degrees of
exploratory testing on that continuum. To make the continuum manageable, five
levels have been defined: freestyle testing, high, medium and low degrees of
exploration, and scripted testing. The decision support approach is based on
the repertory grid technique. The approach has been used in one company. The
method for data collection was focus groups. The results showed that the
proposed approach aids practitioners in the reflection of what exploratory
testing levels to use, and aligns their understanding for priorities of
decision criteria and the performance of exploratory testing levels in their
contexts. The findings also showed that the participating company, which is
currently conducting mostly scripted testing, should spend more time on testing
using higher degrees of exploration in comparison to scripted testing.

 <dc:description>  The online feasibility problem (for a set of sporadic tasks) asks whether
there is a scheduler that always prevents deadline misses (if any), whatever
the sequence of job releases, which is a priori} unknown to the scheduler. In
the multiprocessor setting, this problem is notoriously difficult. The only
exact test for this problem has been proposed by Bonifaci and
Marchetti-Spaccamela: it consists in modelling all the possible behaviours of
the scheduler and of the tasks as a graph; and to interpret this graph as a
game between the tasks and the scheduler, which are seen as antagonistic
players. Then, computing a correct scheduler is equivalent to finding a winning
strategy for the `scheduler player', whose objective in the game is to avoid
deadline misses. In practice, however this approach is limited by the
intractable size of the graph. In this work, we consider the classical
attractor algorithm to solve such games, and introduce antichain techniques to
optimise its performance in practice and overcome the huge size of the game
graph. These techniques are inspired from results from the formal methods
community, and exploit the specific structure of the feasibility problem. We
demonstrate empirically that our approach allows to dramatically improve the
performance of the game solving algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Given graphs $G$ and $H$, we consider the problem of decomposing a properly
edge-colored graph $G$ into few parts consisting of rainbow copies of $H$ and
single edges. We establish a close relation to the previously studied problem
of minimum $H$-decompositions, where an edge coloring does not matter and one
is merely interested in decomposing graphs into copies of $H$ and single edges.

 <dc:title>High-Speed Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles Using a Simple

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To improve safety and energy efficiency, autonomous vehicles are expected to
drive smoothly in most situations, while maintaining their velocity below a
predetermined speed limit. However, some scenarios such as low road adherence
or inadequate speed limit may require vehicles to automatically adapt their
velocity without external input, while nearing the limits of their dynamic
capacities. Many of the existing trajectory planning approaches are incapable
of making such adjustments, since they assume a feasible velocity reference is
given. Moreover, near-limits trajectory planning often implies high-complexity
dynamic vehicle models, making computations difficult. In this article, we use
a simple dynamic model derived from numerical simulations to design a
trajectory planner for high-speed driving of an autonomous vehicle based on
model predictive control. Unlike existing techniques, our formulation includes
the selection of a feasible velocity to track a predetermined path while
avoiding obstacles. Simulation results on a highly precise vehicle model show
that our approach can be used in real-time to provide feasible trajectories
that can be tracked using a simple control architecture. Moreover, the use of
our simplified model makes the planner more robust and yields better
trajectories compared to kinematic models commonly used in trajectory planning.

 <dc:description>  The introduction of automated vehicles without permanent human supervision
demands a functional system description, including functional system boundaries
and a comprehensive safety analysis. These inputs to the technical development
can be identified and analyzed by a scenario-based approach. Furthermore, to
establish an economical test and release process, a large number of scenarios
must be identified to obtain meaningful test results. Experts are doing well to
identify scenarios that are difficult to handle or unlikely to happen. However,
experts are unlikely to identify all scenarios possible based on the knowledge
they have on hand. Expert knowledge modeled for computer aided processing may
help for the purpose of providing a wide range of scenarios. This contribution
reviews ontologies as knowledge-based systems in the field of automated
vehicles, and proposes a generation of traffic scenes in natural language as a
basis for a scenario creation.

 <dc:description>  The orbital debris problem presents an opportunity for inter-agency and
international cooperation toward the mutually beneficial goals of debris
prevention, mitigation, remediation, and improved space situational awareness
(SSA). Achieving these goals requires sharing orbital debris and other SSA
data. Toward this, I present an ontological architecture for the orbital debris
domain, taking steps in the creation of an orbital debris ontology (ODO). The
purpose of this ontological system is to (I) represent general orbital debris
and SSA domain knowledge, (II) structure, and standardize where needed, orbital
data and terminology, and (III) foster semantic interoperability and
data-sharing. In doing so I hope to (IV) contribute to solving the orbital
debris problem, improving peaceful global SSA, and ensuring safe space travel
for future generations.

 <dc:description>  The classical Weisfeiler-Lehman method WL[2] uses edge colors to produce a
powerful graph invariant. It is at least as powerful in its ability to
distinguish non-isomorphic graphs as the most prominent algebraic graph
invariants. It determines not only the spectrum of a graph, and the angles
between standard basis vectors and the eigenspaces, but even the angles between
projections of standard basis vectors into the eigenspaces. Here, we
investigate the combinatorial power of WL[2]. For sufficiently large k, WL[k]
determines all combinatorial properties of a graph. Many traditionally used
combinatorial invariants are determined by WL[k] for small k. We focus on two
fundamental invariants, the num- ber of cycles Cp of length p, and the number
of cliques Kp of size p. We show that WL[2] determines the number of cycles of
lengths up to 6, but not those of length 8. Also, WL[2] does not determine the
number of 4-cliques.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide an analytical framework to analyze the uplink
performance of device-to-device (D2D)-enabled millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular
networks. Signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) outage probabilities
are derived for both cellular and D2D links using tools from stochastic
geometry. The distinguishing features of mmWave communications such as
directional beamforming and having different path loss laws for line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) links are incorporated into the outage
analysis by employing a flexible mode selection scheme and Nakagami fading.
Also, the effect of beamforming alignment errors on the outage probability is
investigated to get insight on the performance in practical scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Human mobility is known to be distributed across several orders of magnitude
of physical distances , which makes it generally difficult to endogenously find
or define typical and meaningful scales. Relevant analyses, from movements to
geographical partitions, seem to be relative to some ad-hoc scale, or no scale
at all. Relying on geotagged data collected from photo-sharing social media, we
apply community detection to movement networks constrained by increasing
percentiles of the distance distribution. Using a simple parameter-free
discontinuity detection algorithm, we discover clear phase transitions in the
community partition space. The detection of these phases constitutes the first
objective method of characterising endogenous, natural scales of human
movement. Our study covers nine regions, ranging from cities to countries of
various sizes and a transnational area. For all regions, the number of natural
scales is remarkably low (2 or 3). Further, our results hint at scale-related
behaviours rather than scale-related users. The partitions of the natural
scales allow us to draw discrete multi-scale geographical boundaries,
potentially capable of providing key insights in fields such as epidemiology or
cultural contagion where the introduction of spatial boundaries is pivotal.

 <dc:description>  The problem of Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is about finding a
maximal low-dimensional subspace $E$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ so that data points
projected onto $E$ follow a non-gaussian distribution. Although this is an
appropriate model for some real world data analysis problems, there has been
little progress on this problem over the last decade.
  In this paper, we attempt to address this state of affairs in two ways.
First, we give a new characterization of standard gaussian distributions in
high-dimensions, which lead to effective tests for non-gaussianness. Second, we
propose a simple algorithm, \emph{Reweighted PCA}, as a method for solving the
NGCA problem. We prove that for a general unknown non-gaussian distribution,
this algorithm recovers at least one direction in $E$, with sample and time
complexity depending polynomially on the dimension of the ambient space. We
conjecture that the algorithm actually recovers the entire $E$.

 <dc:description>  Diluted mean-field models are spin systems whose geometry of interactions is
induced by a sparse random graph or hypergraph. Such models play an eminent
role in the statistical mechanics of disordered systems as well as in
combinatorics and computer science. In a path-breaking paper based on the
non-rigorous `cavity method', physicists predicted not only the existence of a
replica symmetry breaking phase transition in such models but also sketched a
detailed picture of the evolution of the Gibbs measure within the replica
symmetric phase and its impact on important problems in combinatorics, computer
science and physics [Krzakala et al.: PNAS 2007]. In this paper we rigorise
this picture completely for a broad class of models, encompassing the Potts
antiferromagnet on the random graph, the $k$-XORSAT model and the diluted
$k$-spin model for even $k$. We also prove a conjecture about the detection
problem in the stochastic block model that has received considerable attention
[Decelle et al.: Phys. Rev. E 2011].

 <dc:title>Estimating the sensitivity of centrality measures w.r.t. measurement

 <dc:description>  Most network studies rely on an observed network that differs from the
underlying network which is obfuscated by measurement errors. It is well known
that such errors can have a severe impact on the reliability of network
metrics, especially on centrality measures: a more central node in the observed
network might be less central in the underlying network.
  We introduce a metric for the reliability of centrality measures -- called
sensitivity. Given two randomly chosen nodes, the sensitivity means the
probability that the more central node in the observed network is also more
central in the underlying network. The sensitivity concept relies on the
underlying network which is usually not accessible. Therefore, we propose two
methods to approximate the sensitivity. The iterative method, which simulates
possible underlying networks for the estimation and the imputation method,
which uses the sensitivity of the observed network for the estimation. Both
methods rely on the observed network and assumptions about the underlying type
of measurement error (e.g., the percentage of missing edges or nodes).
  Our experiments on real-world networks and random graphs show that the
iterative method performs well in many cases. In contrast, the imputation
method does not yield useful estimations for networks other than
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs.

 <dc:description>  Echo state networks are simple recurrent neural networks that are easy to
implement and train. Despite their simplicity, they show a form of memory and
can predict or regenerate sequences of data. We make use of this property to
realize a novel neural cryptography scheme. The key idea is to assume that
Alice and Bob share a copy of an echo state network. If Alice trains her copy
to memorize a message, she can communicate the trained part of the network to
Bob who plugs it into his copy to regenerate the message. Considering a
byte-level representation of in- and output, the technique applies to arbitrary
types of data (texts, images, audio files, etc.) and practical experiments
reveal it to satisfy the fundamental cryptographic properties of diffusion and
confusion.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a learning based approach to depth fusion, i.e.,
dense 3D reconstruction from multiple depth images. The most common approach to
depth fusion is based on averaging truncated signed distance functions, which
was originally proposed by Curless and Levoy in 1996. While this method is
simple and provides great results, it is not able to reconstruct (partially)
occluded surfaces and requires a large number frames to filter out sensor noise
and outliers. Motivated by the availability of large 3D model repositories and
recent advances in deep learning, we present a novel 3D CNN architecture that
learns to predict an implicit surface representation from the input depth maps.
Our learning based method significantly outperforms the traditional volumetric
fusion approach in terms of noise reduction and outlier suppression. By
learning the structure of real world 3D objects and scenes, our approach is
further able to reconstruct occluded regions and to fill in gaps in the
reconstruction. We demonstrate that our learning based approach outperforms
both vanilla TSDF fusion as well as TV-L1 fusion on the task of volumetric
fusion. Further, we demonstrate state-of-the-art 3D shape completion results.

 <dc:description>  We propose a simulated annealing algorithm specifically tailored to optimise
total retrieval times in a multi-level warehouse under complex pre-batched
picking constraints. Experiments on real data from a picker-to-parts order
picking process in the warehouse of a European manufacturer show that optimal
storage assignments do not necessarily display features presumed in heuristics,
such as clustering of positively correlated items or ordering of items by
picking frequency.
  In an experiment run on more than 4000 batched orders with 1 to 150 items per
batch, the storage assignment suggested by the algorithm produces a 21\%
reduction in the total retrieval time with respect to a frequency-based storage
assignment.

 <dc:description>  Assessing whether a given network is typical or atypical for a random-network
ensemble (i.e., network-ensemble comparison) has widespread applications
ranging from null-model selection and hypothesis testing to clustering and
classifying networks. We develop a framework for network-ensemble comparison by
subjecting the network to stochastic rewiring. We study two rewiring processes,
uniform and degree-preserved rewiring, which yield random-network ensembles
that converge to the Erdos-Renyi and configuration-model ensembles,
respectively. We study convergence through von Neumann entropy (VNE), a network
summary statistic measuring information content based on the spectra of a
Laplacian matrix, and develop a perturbation analysis for the expected effect
of rewiring on VNE. Our analysis yields an estimate for how many rewires are
required for a given network to resemble a typical network from an ensemble,
offering a computationally efficient quantity for network-ensemble comparison
that does not require simulation of the corresponding rewiring process.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Multi-Expert Region-based CNN (ME R-CNN) which is equipped with
multiple experts and built on top of the R-CNN framework known to be one of the
state-of-the-art object detection methods. ME R-CNN focuses in better capturing
the appearance variations caused by different shapes, poses, and viewing
angles. The proposed approach consists of three experts each responsible for
objects with particular shapes: horizontally elongated, square-like, and
vertically elongated. On top of using selective search which provides a
compact, yet effective set of region of interests (RoIs) for object detection,
we augmented the set by also employing the exhaustive search for training only.
Incorporating the exhaustive search can provide complementary advantages: i) it
captures the multitude of neighboring RoIs missed by the selective search, and
thus ii) provide significantly larger amount of training examples. We show that
the ME R-CNN architecture provides considerable performance increase over the
baselines on PASCAL VOC 07, 12, and MS COCO datasets.

 <dc:title>An Achilles' Heel of Term-Resolution</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Janota, Mikol&#xe1;&#x161;</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Term-resolution provides an elegant mechanism to prove that a quantified
Boolean formula (QBF) is true. It is a dual to Q-resolution (also referred to
as clause-resolution) and is practically highly important as it enables
certifying answers of DPLL-based QBF solvers. While term-resolution and
Q-resolution are very similar, they're not completely symmetric. In particular,
Q-resolution operates on clauses and term-resolution operates on models of the
matrix. This paper investigates what impact this asymmetry has. We'll see that
there is a large class of formulas (formulas with &quot;big models&quot;) whose
term-resolution proofs are exponential. As a possible remedy, the paper
suggests to prove true QBFs by refuting their negation ({\em negate-refute}),
rather than proving them by term-resolution. The paper shows that from the
theoretical perspective this is indeed a favorable approach. In particular,
negation-refutation can p-simulates term-resolution and there is an exponential
separation between the two calculi. These observations further our
understanding of proof systems for QBFs and provide a strong theoretical
underpinning for the effort towards non-CNF QBF solvers.

 <dc:description>  Perception and expression of emotion are key factors to the success of
dialogue systems or conversational agents. However, this problem has not been
studied in large-scale conversation generation so far. In this paper, we
propose Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM) that can generate appropriate
responses not only in content (relevant and grammatical) but also in emotion
(emotionally consistent). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that addresses the emotion factor in large-scale conversation generation. ECM
addresses the factor using three new mechanisms that respectively (1) models
the high-level abstraction of emotion expressions by embedding emotion
categories, (2) captures the change of implicit internal emotion states, and
(3) uses explicit emotion expressions with an external emotion vocabulary.
Experiments show that the proposed model can generate responses appropriate not
only in content but also in emotion.

 <dc:description>  Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$, the closeness centrality of a vertex $v$
is defined as $\frac{n-1}{\sum_{w \in V} d(v,w)}$. This measure is widely used
in the analysis of real-world complex networks, and the problem of selecting
the $k$ most central vertices has been deeply analysed in the last decade.
However, this problem is computationally not easy, especially for large
networks: in the first part of the paper, we prove that it is not solvable in
time $\O(|E|^{2-\epsilon})$ on directed graphs, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$,
under reasonable complexity assumptions. Furthermore, we propose a new
algorithm for selecting the $k$ most central nodes in a graph: we
experimentally show that this algorithm improves significantly both the
textbook algorithm, which is based on computing the distance between all pairs
of vertices, and the state of the art. For example, we are able to compute the
top $k$ nodes in few dozens of seconds in real-world networks with millions of
nodes and edges. Finally, as a case study, we compute the $10$ most central
actors in the IMDB collaboration network, where two actors are linked if they
played together in a movie, and in the Wikipedia citation network, which
contains a directed edge from a page $p$ to a page $q$ if $p$ contains a link
to $q$.

 <dc:description>  High dimensional sparse learning has imposed a great computational challenge
to large scale data analysis. In this paper, we are interested in a broad class
of sparse learning approaches formulated as linear programs parametrized by a
{\em regularization factor}, and solve them by the parametric simplex method
(PSM). Our parametric simplex method offers significant advantages over other
competing methods: (1) PSM naturally obtains the complete solution path for all
values of the regularization parameter; (2) PSM provides a high precision dual
certificate stopping criterion; (3) PSM yields sparse solutions through very
few iterations, and the solution sparsity significantly reduces the
computational cost per iteration. Particularly, we demonstrate the superiority
of PSM over various sparse learning approaches, including Dantzig selector for
sparse linear regression, LAD-Lasso for sparse robust linear regression, CLIME
for sparse precision matrix estimation, sparse differential network estimation,
and sparse Linear Programming Discriminant (LPD) analysis. We then provide
sufficient conditions under which PSM always outputs sparse solutions such that
its computational performance can be significantly boosted. Thorough numerical
experiments are provided to demonstrate the outstanding performance of the PSM
method.

 <dc:description>  Depth from Focus (DFF) is one of the classical ill-posed inverse problems in
computer vision. Most approaches recover the depth at each pixel based on the
focal setting which exhibits maximal sharpness. Yet, it is not obvious how to
reliably estimate the sharpness level, particularly in low-textured areas. In
this paper, we propose `Deep Depth From Focus (DDFF)' as the first end-to-end
learning approach to this problem. Towards this goal, we create a novel
real-scene indoor benchmark composed of 4D light-field images obtained from a
plenoptic camera and ground truth depth obtained from a registered RGB-D
sensor. Compared to existing benchmarks our dataset is 25 times larger,
enabling the use of machine learning for this inverse problem. We compare our
results with state-of-the-art DFF methods and we also analyze the effect of
several key deep architectural components. These experiments show that DDFFNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance in all scenes, reducing depth error by
more than 75% wrt classic DFF methods.

 <dc:description>  Databases are widespread, yet extracting relevant data can be difficult.
Without substantial domain knowledge, multivariate search queries often return
sparse or uninformative results. This paper introduces an approach for
searching structured data based on probabilistic programming and nonparametric
Bayes. Users specify queries in a probabilistic language that combines standard
SQL database search operators with an information theoretic ranking function
called predictive relevance. Predictive relevance can be calculated by a fast
sparse matrix algorithm based on posterior samples from CrossCat, a
nonparametric Bayesian model for high-dimensional, heterogeneously-typed data
tables. The result is a flexible search technique that applies to a broad class
of information retrieval problems, which we integrate into BayesDB, a
probabilistic programming platform for probabilistic data analysis. This paper
demonstrates applications to databases of US colleges, global macroeconomic
indicators of public health, and classic cars. We found that human evaluators
often prefer the results from probabilistic search to results from a standard
baseline.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, scalable Whole Slide Imaging (sWSI), a novel high-throughput,
cost-effective and robust whole slide imaging system on both Android and iOS
platforms is introduced and analyzed. With sWSI, most mainstream smartphone
connected to a optical eyepiece of any manually controlled microscope can be
automatically controlled to capture sequences of mega-pixel fields of views
that are synthesized into giga-pixel virtual slides. Remote servers carry out
the majority of computation asynchronously to support clients running at
satisfying frame rates without sacrificing image quality nor robustness. A
typical 15x15mm sample can be digitized in 30 seconds with 4X or in 3 minutes
with 10X object magnification, costing under $1. The virtual slide quality is
considered comparable to existing high-end scanners thus satisfying for
clinical usage by surveyed pathologies. The scan procedure with features such
as supporting magnification up to 100x, recoding z-stacks,
specimen-type-neutral and giving real-time feedback, is deemed
work-flow-friendly and reliable.

 <dc:description>  Background: The need for empirical investigations in software engineering is
growing. Many researchers nowadays, conduct and validate their solutions using
empirical research. Survey is one empirical method which enables researchers to
collect data from a large population. Main aim of the survey is to generalize
the findings. Aims: In this study we aim to identify the problems researchers
face during survey design, and mitigation strategies. Method: A literature
review as well as semi-structured interviews with nine software engineering
researchers were conducted to elicit their views on problems and mitigation
strategies. The researchers are all focused on empirical software engineering.
Results: We identified 24 problems and 65 strategies, structured according to
the survey research process. The most commonly discussed problem was sampling,
in particular the ability to obtain a sufficiently large sample. To improve
survey instrument design, evaluation and execution recommendations for question
formulation and survey pre-testing were given. The importance of involving
multiple researchers in the analysis of survey results was stressed.
Conclusions: The elicited problems and strategies may serve researchers during
the design of their studies. However, it was observed that some strategies were
conflicting. This shows that it is important to conduct a trade-off analysis
between strategies.

 <dc:title>On Resource-bounded versions of the van Lambalgen theorem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The van Lambalgen theorem is a surprising result in algorithmic information
theory concerning the symmetry of relative randomness. It establishes that for
any pair of infinite sequences $A$ and $B$, $B$ is Martin-L\&quot;of random and $A$
is Martin-L\&quot;of random relative to $B$ if and only if the interleaved sequence
$A \uplus B$ is Martin-L\&quot;of random. This implies that $A$ is relative random
to $B$ if and only if $B$ is random relative to $A$ \cite{vanLambalgen},
\cite{Nies09}, \cite{HirschfeldtBook}. This paper studies the validity of this
phenomenon for different notions of time-bounded relative randomness.
  We prove the classical van Lambalgen theorem using martingales and Kolmogorov
compressibility. We establish the failure of relative randomness in these
settings, for both time-bounded martingales and time-bounded Kolmogorov
complexity. We adapt our classical proofs when applicable to the time-bounded
setting, and construct counterexamples when they fail. The mode of failure of
the theorem may depend on the notion of time-bounded randomness.

 <dc:description>  We show a communication complexity lower bound for finding a correlated
equilibrium of a two-player game. More precisely, we define a two-player $N
\times N$ game called the 2-cycle game and show that the randomized
communication complexity of finding a 1/poly($N$)-approximate correlated
equilibrium of the 2-cycle game is $\Omega(N)$. For small approximation values,
this answers an open question of Babichenko and Rubinstein (STOC 2017). Our
lower bound is obtained via a direct reduction from the unique set disjointness
problem.

 <dc:description>  Near-term quantum computers will soon reach sizes that are challenging to
directly simulate, even when employing the most powerful supercomputers. Yet,
the ability to simulate these early devices using classical computers is
crucial for calibration, validation, and benchmarking. In order to make use of
the full potential of systems featuring multi- and many-core processors, we use
automatic code generation and optimization of compute kernels, which also
enables performance portability. We apply a scheduling algorithm to quantum
supremacy circuits in order to reduce the required communication and simulate a
45-qubit circuit on the Cori II supercomputer using 8,192 nodes and 0.5
petabytes of memory. To our knowledge, this constitutes the largest quantum
circuit simulation to this date. Our highly-tuned kernels in combination with
the reduced communication requirements allow an improvement in time-to-solution
over state-of-the-art simulations by more than an order of magnitude at every
scale.

 <dc:description>  If spreadsheets are not erroneous then who, or what, is? Research has found
that end-users are. If end-users are erroneous then why are they? Research has
found that responsibility lies with human beings' fast and slow thinking modes
and the inappropriate way they use them. If we are aware of this peculiarity of
human thinking, then why do we not teach students how to train their brains?
This is the main problem, this is the weakest link in the process: teaching. We
have to make teachers realize that end-users are erroneous because of the
erroneous teaching approaches to end-user computing. The proportion of fast and
slow thinking modes is not constant, and teachers are mistaken when they apply
the same proportion in both the teaching and end-user roles. Teachers should
believe in the incremental nature of science and have high self-efficacy to
make students understand and appreciate science. This is not currently the case
in ICT and CS, and it is high time fundamental changes were introduced.

 <dc:description>  We propose a vision-based method that localizes a ground vehicle using
publicly available satellite imagery as the only prior knowledge of the
environment. Our approach takes as input a sequence of ground-level images
acquired by the vehicle as it navigates, and outputs an estimate of the
vehicle's pose relative to a georeferenced satellite image. We overcome the
significant viewpoint and appearance variations between the images through a
neural multi-view model that learns location-discriminative embeddings in which
ground-level images are matched with their corresponding satellite view of the
scene. We use this learned function as an observation model in a filtering
framework to maintain a distribution over the vehicle's pose. We evaluate our
method on different benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability localize
ground-level images in environments novel relative to training, despite the
challenges of significant viewpoint and appearance variations.

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have advanced the state-of-the-art in a variety
of machine learning tasks and are deployed in increasing numbers of products
and services. However, the computational requirements of training and
evaluating large-scale DNNs are growing at a much faster pace than the
capabilities of the underlying hardware platforms that they are executed upon.
In this work, we propose Dynamic Variable Effort Deep Neural Networks
(DyVEDeep) to reduce the computational requirements of DNNs during inference.
Previous efforts propose specialized hardware implementations for DNNs,
statically prune the network, or compress the weights. Complementary to these
approaches, DyVEDeep is a dynamic approach that exploits the heterogeneity in
the inputs to DNNs to improve their compute efficiency with comparable
classification accuracy. DyVEDeep equips DNNs with dynamic effort mechanisms
that, in the course of processing an input, identify how critical a group of
computations are to classify the input. DyVEDeep dynamically focuses its
compute effort only on the critical computa- tions, while skipping or
approximating the rest. We propose 3 effort knobs that operate at different
levels of granularity viz. neuron, feature and layer levels. We build DyVEDeep
versions for 5 popular image recognition benchmarks - one for CIFAR-10 and four
for ImageNet (AlexNet, OverFeat and VGG-16, weight-compressed AlexNet). Across
all benchmarks, DyVEDeep achieves 2.1x-2.6x reduction in the number of scalar
operations, which translates to 1.8x-2.3x performance improvement over a
Caffe-based implementation, with &lt; 0.5% loss in accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, the demand for wireless mobile services is copious, and will
continue increasing in the near future. Mobile cellular operators are therefore
looking at the unlicensed spectrum as an economical supplement to augment the
capacity of their soon-to-be overloaded networks. The same unlicensed bands are
luring internet service providers, venue owners, and authorities into
autonomously setting up and managing their high-performance private networks.
In light of this exciting future, ensuring coexistence between multiple
unlicensed technologies becomes a pivotal issue. So far this issue has been
merely addressed via inefficient sharing schemes based on intermittent
transmission. In this article, we present the fundamentals and the main
challenges behind massive MIMO unlicensed, a brand-new approach for technology
coexistence in the unlicensed bands, which is envisioned to boost spectrum
reuse for a plethora of use cases.

 <dc:title>A Structured Approach to the development of Solutions in Excel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bartholomew, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spreadsheets offer a supremely successful democratisation platform, placing
the manipulation and presentation of numbers within the grasp of users that
have little or no mathematical expertise or IT experience. What appears to be
almost completely lacking within a &quot;normal&quot; solution built using Excel default
settings is the deployment of any structure that extends beyond a single-cell
formula. The structural elements that allow conventional code to scale without
escalating errors appear to be absent. This paper considers the use of
controversial or lesser-used techniques to create a coherent solution strategy
in which the problem is solved by a sequence of formulas resembling the steps
of a programmed language.

 <dc:description>  Recently, two influential PNAS papers have shown how our preferences for
'Hello Kitty' and 'Harley Davidson', obtained through Facebook likes, can
accurately predict details about our personality, religiosity, political
attitude and sexual orientation (Konsinski et al. 2013; Youyou et al 2015). In
this paper, we make the claim that though the wide variety of Facebook likes
might predict such personal traits, even more accurate and generalizable
results can be reached through applying a contexts-specific, parsimonious data
strategy. We built this claim by predicting present day voter intention based
solely on likes directed toward posts from political actors. Combining the
online and offline, we join a subsample of surveyed respondents to their public
Facebook activity and apply machine learning classifiers to explore the link
between their political liking behaviour and actual voting intention. Through
this work, we show how even a single well-chosen Facebook like, can reveal as
much about our political voter intention as hundreds of random likes. Further,
by including the entire political like history of the respondents, our model
reaches prediction accuracies above previous multiparty studies (60-70%). We
conclude the paper by discussing how a parsimonious data strategy applied, with
some limitations, allow us to generalize our findings to the 1,4 million Danes
with at least one political like and even to other political multiparty
systems.

 <dc:description>  FLUSEPA (Registered trademark in France No. 134009261) is an advanced
simulation tool which performs a large panel of aerodynamic studies. It is the
unstructured finite-volume solver developed by Airbus Safran Launchers company
to calculate compressible, multidimensional, unsteady, viscous and reactive
flows around bodies in relative motion. The time integration in FLUSEPA is done
using an explicit temporal adaptive method. The current production version of
the code is based on MPI and OpenMP. This implementation leads to important
synchronizations that must be reduced. To tackle this problem, we present the
study of a task-based parallelization of the aerodynamic solver of FLUSEPA
using the runtime system StarPU and combining up to three levels of
parallelism. We validate our solution by the simulation (using a finite-volume
mesh with 80 million cells) of a take-off blast wave propagation for Ariane 5
launcher.

 <dc:description>  Conical functions appear in a large number of applications in physics and
engineering. In this paper we describe an extension of our module CONICAL for
the computation of conical functions. Specifically, the module includes now a
routine for computing the function ${{\rm R}}^{m}_{-\frac{1}{2}+i\tau}(x)$, a
real-valued numerically satisfactory companion of the function ${\rm
P}^m_{-\tfrac12+i\tau}(x)$ for $x&gt;1$. In this way, a natural basis for solving
Dirichlet problems bounded by conical domains is provided.

 <dc:description>  Spreadsheets are widely used in industry, even for critical business
processes. This implies the need for proper risk assessment in spreadsheets to
evaluate the reliability and validity of the spreadsheet's outcome. As related
research has shown, the risk of spreadsheet errors is strongly related to the
spreadsheet's complexity. Therefore, spreadsheet researchers proposed various
metrics for quantifying different aspects of a spreadsheet in order to assess
its complexity. However, until now there is no shared understanding of
potential complexity drivers for spreadsheets. The present work addresses this
research gap by proposing a conceptual model integrating all aspects which are
identified by related literature as potential drivers to spreadsheet
complexity. In this sense, this model forms the foundation for a structured
definition of complexity metrics, and thus enhances the reproducibility of
their results. At the same time, it forms the foundation for identifying
further applicable complexity metrics from other scientific domains.

 <dc:description>  Human keypoints are a well-studied representation of people.We explore how to
use keypoint models to improve instance-level person segmentation. The main
idea is to harness the notion of a distance transform of oracle provided
keypoints or estimated keypoint heatmaps as a prior for person instance
segmentation task within a deep neural network. For training and evaluation, we
consider all those images from COCO where both instance segmentation and human
keypoints annotations are available. We first show how oracle keypoints can
boost the performance of existing human segmentation model during inference
without any training. Next, we propose a framework to directly learn a deep
instance segmentation model conditioned on human pose. Experimental results
show that at various Intersection Over Union (IOU) thresholds, in a constrained
environment with oracle keypoints, the instance segmentation accuracy achieves
10% to 12% relative improvements over a strong baseline of oracle bounding
boxes. In a more realistic environment, without the oracle keypoints, the
proposed deep person instance segmentation model conditioned on human pose
achieves 3.8% to 10.5% relative improvements comparing with its strongest
baseline of a deep network trained only for segmentation.

 <dc:description>  The Principle of the Glitch states that for any device which makes a discrete
decision based upon a continuous range of possible inputs, there are inputs for
which it will take arbitrarily long to reach a decision. The appropriate
mathematical setting for studying this principle is described. This involves
defining the concept of continuity for mappings on sets of functions. It can

 <dc:description>  Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved great success in many
tasks, they can often be fooled by \emph{adversarial examples} that are
generated by adding small but purposeful distortions to natural examples.
Previous studies to defend against adversarial examples mostly focused on
refining the DNN models, but have either shown limited success or required
expensive computation. We propose a new strategy, \emph{feature squeezing},
that can be used to harden DNN models by detecting adversarial examples.
Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by
coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the
original space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction on
the original input with that on squeezed inputs, feature squeezing detects
adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper
explores two feature squeezing methods: reducing the color bit depth of each
pixel and spatial smoothing. These simple strategies are inexpensive and
complementary to other defenses, and can be combined in a joint detection
framework to achieve high detection rates against state-of-the-art attacks.

 <dc:description>  TD(0) is one of the most commonly used algorithms in reinforcement learning.
Despite this, there is no existing finite sample analysis for TD(0) with
function approximation, even for the linear case. Our work is the first to
provide such results. Existing convergence rates for Temporal Difference (TD)
methods apply only to somewhat modified versions, e.g., projected variants or
ones where stepsizes depend on unknown problem parameters. Our analyses obviate
these artificial alterations by exploiting strong properties of TD(0). We
provide convergence rates both in expectation and with high-probability. The
two are obtained via different approaches that use relatively unknown, recently
developed stochastic approximation techniques.

 <dc:title>Two-Stage Stochastic International Portfolio Optimisation under

 <dc:subject>Quantitative Finance - Risk Management</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a two-stage stochastic international portfolio
optimisation model to find an optimal allocation for the combination of both
assets and currency hedging positions. Our optimisation model allows a
&quot;currency overlay&quot;, or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to
provide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency
exposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are
also included.
  To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return
distributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine
copula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of
the characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and
asymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the
uncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio
optimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated
from the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a
standard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the
proposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios
that give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario
generation approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return
compensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher
returns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the non-normality in
uncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.

 <dc:title>Towards an IT Security Risk Assessment Framework for Railway Automation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Braband, Jens</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Some recent incidents have shown that possibly the vulnerability of IT
systems in railway automation has been underestimated. Fortunately, so far,
almost only denial-of-service attacks were successful, but due to several
trends, such as the use of commercial IT and communication systems or
privatization, the threat potential could increase in the near future. However,
up to now, no harmonized IT security risk assessment framework for railway
automation exists. This paper defines an IT security risk assessment framework
which aims to separate IT security and safety requirements as well as
certification processes as far as possible. It builds on the well-known safety
and approval processes from IEC 62425 and integrates IT security requirements
based on the ISA99/IEC62443 standard series. While the detailed results are
related to railway automation the general concepts are also applicable to other
safety-critical application areas.

 <dc:description>  In cheminformatics, compound-target binding profiles has been a main source
of data for research. For data repositories that only provide positive
profiles, a popular assumption is that unreported profiles are all negative. In
this paper, we caution audience not to take this assumption for granted, and
present empirical evidence of its ineffectiveness from a machine learning
perspective. Our examination is based on a setting where binding profiles are
used as features to train predictive models; we show (1) prediction performance
degrades when the assumption fails and (2) explicit recovery of unreported
profiles improves prediction performance. In particular, we propose a framework
that jointly recovers profiles and learns predictive model, and show it
achieves further performance improvement. The presented study not only suggests
applying matrix recovery methods to recover unreported profiles, but also
initiates a new missing feature problem which we called Learning with Positive
and Unknown Features.

 <dc:description>  Utilizing the concept of observability, in conjunction with tools from graph
theory and optimization, this paper develops an algorithm for network synthesis
with privacy guarantees. In particular, we propose an algorithm for the
selection of optimal weights for the communication graph in order to maximize
the privacy of nodes in the network, from a control theoretic perspective. In
this direction, we propose an observability-based design of the communication
topology that improves the privacy of the network in presence of an intruder.
The resulting adaptive network responds to the intrusion by changing the
topology of the network-in an online manner- in order to reduce the information
exposed to the intruder.

 <dc:description>  Scene-level Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is faced with an important
challenge - perceptual uncertainty. Addressing this problem, we present a
scene-level PbD paradigm that programs robots to perform goal-directed
manipulation in unstructured environments with grounded perception. Scene
estimation is enabled by our discriminatively-informed generative scene
estimation method (DIGEST). Given scene observations, DIGEST utilizes
candidates from discriminative object detectors to generate and evaluate
hypothesized scenes of object poses. Scene graphs are generated from the
estimated object poses, which in turn is used in the PbD system for high-level
task planning. We demonstrate that DIGEST performs better than existing method
and is robust to false positive detections. Building a PbD system on DIGEST, we
show experiments of programming a Fetch robot to set up a tray for delivery
with various objects through demonstration of goal scenes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the problem of human action recognition from video
sequences. Inspired by the exemplary results obtained via automatic feature
learning and deep learning approaches in computer vision, we focus our
attention towards learning salient spatial features via a convolutional neural
network (CNN) and then map their temporal relationship with the aid of
Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) networks. Our contribution in this paper is a
deep fusion framework that more effectively exploits spatial features from CNNs
with temporal features from LSTM models. We also extensively evaluate their
strengths and weaknesses. We find that by combining both the sets of features,
the fully connected features effectively act as an attention mechanism to
direct the LSTM to interesting parts of the convolutional feature sequence. The
significance of our fusion method is its simplicity and effectiveness compared
to other state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation results demonstrate that this
hierarchical multi stream fusion method has higher performance compared to
single stream mapping methods allowing it to achieve high accuracy
outperforming current state-of-the-art methods in three widely used databases:
UCF11, UCFSports, jHMDB.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a preliminary model for interactions in the data
market. Recent research has shown ways in which a data aggregator can design
mechanisms for users to ensure the quality of data, even in situations where
the users are effort-averse (i.e. prefer to submit lower-quality estimates) and
the data aggregator cannot observe the effort exerted by the users (i.e. the
contract suffers from the principal-agent problem). However, we have shown that
these mechanisms often break down in more realistic models, where multiple data
aggregators are in competition. Under minor assumptions on the properties of
the statistical estimators in use by data aggregators, we show that there is
either no Nash equilibrium, or there is an infinite number of Nash equilibrium.
In the latter case, there is a fundamental ambiguity in who bears the burden of
incentivizing different data sources. We are also able to calculate the price
of anarchy, which measures how much social welfare is lost between the Nash
equilibrium and the social optimum, i.e. between non-cooperative strategic play
and cooperation.

 <dc:title>Tackling Diversity and Heterogeneity by Vertical Memory Management</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Lei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Operating Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Existing memory management mechanisms used in commodity computing machines
typically adopt hardware based address interleaving and OS directed random
memory allocation to service generic application requests. These conventional
memory management mechanisms are challenged by contention at multiple memory
levels, a daunting variety of workload behaviors, and an increasingly
complicated memory hierarchy. Our ISCA-41 paper proposes vertical partitioning
to eliminate shared resource contention at multiple levels in the memory
hierarchy. Combined with horizontal memory management policies, our framework
supports a flexible policy space for tackling diverse application needs in
production environment and is suitable for future heterogeneous memory systems.

 <dc:title>All binary linear codes that are invariant under $\PSL_2(n)$</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The projective special linear group $\PSL_2(n)$ is $2$-transitive for all
primes $n$ and $3$-homogeneous for $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ on the set $\{0,1,
\cdots, n-1, \infty\}$. It is known that the extended odd-like quadratic
residue codes are invariant under $\PSL_2(n)$. Hence, the extended quadratic
residue codes hold an infinite family of $2$-designs for primes $n \equiv 1
\pmod{4}$, an infinite family of $3$-designs for primes $n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$.
To construct more $t$-designs with $t \in \{2, 3\}$, one would search for other
extended cyclic codes over finite fields that are invariant under the action of
$\PSL_2(n)$. The objective of this paper is to prove that the extended
quadratic residue binary codes are the only nontrivial extended binary cyclic
codes that are invariant under $\PSL_2(n)$.

 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Supervised learning on molecules has incredible potential to be useful in
chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science. Luckily, several promising
and closely related neural network models invariant to molecular symmetries
have already been described in the literature. These models learn a message
passing algorithm and aggregation procedure to compute a function of their
entire input graph. At this point, the next step is to find a particularly
effective variant of this general approach and apply it to chemical prediction
benchmarks until we either solve them or reach the limits of the approach. In
this paper, we reformulate existing models into a single common framework we
call Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) and explore additional novel
variations within this framework. Using MPNNs we demonstrate state of the art
results on an important molecular property prediction benchmark; these results
are strong enough that we believe future work should focus on datasets with
larger molecules or more accurate ground truth labels.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online marketplaces, search engines, and databases employ aggregated social
information to rank their content for users. Two ranking heuristics commonly
implemented to order the available options are the average review score and
item popularity-that is, the number of users who have experienced an item.
These rules, although easy to implement, only partly reflect actual user
preferences, as people may assign values to both average scores and popularity
and trade off between the two. How do people integrate these two pieces of
social information when making choices? We present two experiments in which we
asked participants to choose 200 times among options drawn directly from two
widely used online venues: Amazon and IMDb. The only information presented to
participants was the average score and the number of reviews, which served as a
proxy for popularity. We found that most people are willing to settle for items
with somewhat lower average scores if they are more popular. Yet, our study
uncovered substantial diversity of preferences among participants, which
indicates a sizable potential for personalizing ranking schemes that rely on
social information.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The adaptive zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels (DMC) with
noiseless feedback has been shown to be positive whenever there exists at least
one channel output &quot;disprover&quot;, i.e. a channel output that cannot be reached
from at least one of the inputs. Furthermore, whenever there exists a
disprover, the adaptive zero-error capacity attains the Shannon (small-error)
capacity. Here, we study the zero-error capacity of a DMC when the channel
feedback is noisy rather than perfect. We show that the adaptive zero-error
capacity with noisy feedback is lower bounded by the forward channel's
zero-undetected error capacity, and show that under certain conditions this is
tight.

 <dc:description>  Our study investigates the role of infrastructures in shaping online news
usage by contrasting use patterns of two social groups,millennials and
boomers,that are specifically located in news infrastructures. Typically based
on self reported data, popular press and academics tend to highlight the
generational gap in news usage and link it to divergence in values and
preferences of the two age cohorts. In contrast, we conduct relational analyses
of shared usage obtained from passively metered usage data across a vast range
of online news outlets for millennials and boomers. We compare each cohort's
usage networks comprising various types of news websites. Our analyses reveal a
smaller than commonly assumed generational gap in online news usage, with
characteristics that manifest the multifarious effects of the infrastructural
aspect of the media environment, alongside those of preferences.

 <dc:description>  More data is currently being collected and shared by software applications
than ever before. In many cases, the user is asked if either all or none of
their data can be shared. We hypothesize that in some cases, users would like
to share data in more complex ways. In order to implement the sharing of data
using more complicated privacy preferences, complex data sharing policies must
be used. These complex sharing policies require more space to store than a
simple &quot;all or nothing&quot; approach to data sharing. In this paper, we present a
new probabilistic data structure, called the Min Mask Sketch, to efficiently
store these complex data sharing policies. We describe an implementation for
the Min Mask Sketch in PostgreSQL and analyze the practicality and feasibility
of using a probabilistic data structure for storing complex data sharing
policies.

 <dc:description>  Clearly, no one likes webpages with poor quality of experience (QoE). Being
perceived as slow or fast is a key element in the overall perceived QoE of web
applications. While extensive effort has been put into optimizing web
applications (both in industry and academia), not a lot of work exists in
characterizing what aspects of webpage loading process truly influence human
end-user's perception of the &quot;Speed&quot; of a page. In this paper we present
&quot;SpeedPerception&quot;, a large-scale web performance crowdsourcing framework
focused on understanding the perceived loading performance of above-the-fold
(ATF) webpage content. Our end goal is to create free open-source benchmarking
datasets to advance the systematic analysis of how humans perceive webpage
loading process. In Phase-1 of our &quot;SpeedPerception&quot; study using Internet
Retailer Top 500 (IR 500) websites
(https://github.com/pahammad/speedperception), we found that commonly used
navigation metrics such as &quot;onLoad&quot; and &quot;Time To First Byte (TTFB)&quot; fail (less
than 60% match) to represent majority human perception when comparing the speed
of two webpages. We present a simple 3-variable-based machine learning model
that explains the majority end-user choices better (with $87 \pm 2\%$
accuracy). In addition, our results suggest that the time needed by end-users
to evaluate relative perceived speed of webpage is far less than the time of
its &quot;visualComplete&quot; event.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new deep learning architecture (called Kd-network) that is
designed for 3D model recognition tasks and works with unstructured point
clouds. The new architecture performs multiplicative transformations and share
parameters of these transformations according to the subdivisions of the point
clouds imposed onto them by Kd-trees. Unlike the currently dominant
convolutional architectures that usually require rasterization on uniform
two-dimensional or three-dimensional grids, Kd-networks do not rely on such
grids in any way and therefore avoid poor scaling behaviour. In a series of
experiments with popular shape recognition benchmarks, Kd-networks demonstrate
competitive performance in a number of shape recognition tasks such as shape
classification, shape retrieval and shape part segmentation.

 <dc:title>Greedy Sampling of Graph Signals</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Sampling is a fundamental topic in graph signal processing, having found
applications in estimation, clustering, and video compression. In contrast to
traditional signal processing, the irregularity of the signal domain makes
selecting a sampling set non-trivial and hard to analyze. Indeed, though
conditions for graph signal interpolation from noiseless samples exist, they do
not lead to a unique sampling set. The presence of noise makes choosing among
these sampling sets a hard combinatorial problem. Although greedy sampling
schemes are commonly used in practice, they have no performance guarantee. This
work takes a twofold approach to address this issue. First, universal
performance bounds are derived for the Bayesian estimation of graph signals
from noisy samples. In contrast to currently available bounds, they are not
restricted to specific sampling schemes and hold for any sampling sets. Second,
this paper provides near-optimal guarantees for greedy sampling by introducing
the concept of approximate submodularity and updating the classical greedy
bound. It then provides explicit bounds on the approximate supermodularity of
the interpolation mean-square error showing that it can be optimized with
worst-case guarantees using greedy search even though it is not supermodular.
Simulations illustrate the derived bound for different graph models and show an
application of graph signal sampling to reduce the complexity of kernel
principal component analysis.

 <dc:title>Joint Regression and Ranking for Image Enhancement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chandakkar, Parag S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Li, Baoxin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Research on automated image enhancement has gained momentum in recent years,
partially due to the need for easy-to-use tools for enhancing pictures captured
by ubiquitous cameras on mobile devices. Many of the existing leading methods
employ machine-learning-based techniques, by which some enhancement parameters
for a given image are found by relating the image to the training images with
known enhancement parameters. While knowing the structure of the parameter
space can facilitate search for the optimal solution, none of the existing
methods has explicitly modeled and learned that structure. This paper presents
an end-to-end, novel joint regression and ranking approach to model the
interaction between desired enhancement parameters and images to be processed,
employing a Gaussian process (GP). GP allows searching for ideal parameters
using only the image features. The model naturally leads to a ranking technique
for comparing images in the induced feature space. Comparative evaluation using
the ground-truth based on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset plus subjective tests on
an additional data-set were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Finite State Multiple-Access Wiretap Channel with Delayed Feedback</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dai, Bin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, the finite state Markov channel (FSMC) with an additional
eavesdropper and delayed feedback from the legitimate receiver to the
transmitter has been shown to be a useful model for the physical layer security
of the practical mobile wireless communication systems. In this paper, we
extend this model to a multiple-access situation (up-link of the wireless
communication systems), which we call the finite state multiple-access wiretap
channel (FS-MAC-WT) with delayed feedback. To be specific, the FS-MAC-WT is a
channel with two inputs (transmitters) and two outputs (a legitimate receiver
and an eavesdropper). The channel depends on a state which undergoes a Markov
process, and the state is entirely known by the legitimate receiver and the
eavesdropper. The legitimate receiver intends to send his channel output and
the perfectly known state back to the transmitters through noiseless feedback
channels after some time delay. The main contribution of this paper is to
provide inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity regions of the FS-MAC-WT
with delayed state feedback, and with or without delayed legitimate receiver's
channel output feedback. The capacity results are further explained via a
degraded Gaussian fading example, and from this example we see that sending the
legitimate receiver's channel output back to the transmitters helps to enhance
the achievable secrecy rate region of the FS-MAC-WT with only delayed state
feedback.

 <dc:description>  With recent advancements in drone technology, researchers are now considering
the possibility of deploying small cells served by base stations mounted on
flying drones. A major advantage of such drone small cells is that the
operators can quickly provide cellular services in areas of urgent demand
without having to pre-install any infrastructure. Since the base station is
attached to the drone, technically it is feasible for the base station to
dynamic reposition itself in response to the changing locations of users for
reducing the communication distance, decreasing the probability of signal
blocking, and ultimately increasing the spectral efficiency. In this paper, we
first propose distributed algorithms for autonomous control of drone movements,
and then model and analyse the spectral efficiency performance of a drone small
cell to shed new light on the fundamental benefits of dynamic repositioning. We
show that, with dynamic repositioning, the spectral efficiency of drone small
cells can be increased by nearly 100\% for realistic drone speed, height, and
user traffic model and without incurring any major increase in drone energy
consumption.

 <dc:title>Estimation of Tissue Microstructure Using a Deep Network Inspired by a
  Sparse Reconstruction Framework</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ye, Chuyang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) provides a unique tool for
noninvasively probing the microstructure of the neuronal tissue. The NODDI
model has been a popular approach to the estimation of tissue microstructure in
many neuroscience studies. It represents the diffusion signals with three types
of diffusion in tissue: intra-cellular, extra-cellular, and cerebrospinal fluid
compartments. However, the original NODDI method uses a computationally
expensive procedure to fit the model and could require a large number of
diffusion gradients for accurate microstructure estimation, which may be
impractical for clinical use. Therefore, efforts have been devoted to efficient
and accurate NODDI microstructure estimation with a reduced number of diffusion
gradients. In this work, we propose a deep network based approach to the NODDI
microstructure estimation, which is named Microstructure Estimation using a
Deep Network (MEDN). Motivated by the AMICO algorithm which accelerates the
computation of NODDI parameters, we formulate the microstructure estimation
problem in a dictionary-based framework. The proposed network comprises two
cascaded stages. The first stage resembles the solution to a dictionary-based
sparse reconstruction problem and the second stage computes the final
microstructure using the output of the first stage. The weights in the two
stages are jointly learned from training data, which is obtained from training
dMRI scans with diffusion gradients that densely sample the q-space. The
proposed method was applied to brain dMRI scans, where two shells each with 30
gradient directions (60 diffusion gradients in total) were used. Estimation
accuracy with respect to the gold standard was measured and the results
demonstrate that MEDN outperforms the competing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Next generation (5G) wireless networks are expected to support the massive
data and accommodate a wide range of services/use cases with distinct
requirements in a cost-effective, flexible, and agile manner. As a promising
solution, wireless network virtualization (WNV), or network slicing, enables
multiple virtual networks to share the common infrastructure on demand, and to
be customized for different services/use cases. This article focuses on
network-wide resource allocation for realizing WNV. Specifically, the
motivations, the enabling platforms, and the benefits of WNV, are first
reviewed. Then, resource allocation for WNV along with the technical challenges
is discussed. Afterwards, a software defined networking (SDN) enabled resource
allocation framework is proposed to facilitate WNV, including the key
procedures and the corresponding modeling approaches. Furthermore, a case study
is provided as an example of resource allocation in WNV. Finally, some open
research topics essential to WNV are discussed.

 <dc:title>A Computational Approach to Relative Aesthetics</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Computational visual aesthetics has recently become an active research area.
Existing state-of-art methods formulate this as a binary classification task
where a given image is predicted to be beautiful or not. In many applications
such as image retrieval and enhancement, it is more important to rank images
based on their aesthetic quality instead of binary-categorizing them.
Furthermore, in such applications, it may be possible that all images belong to
the same category. Hence determining the aesthetic ranking of the images is
more appropriate. To this end, we formulate a novel problem of ranking images
with respect to their aesthetic quality. We construct a new dataset of image
pairs with relative labels by carefully selecting images from the popular AVA
dataset. Unlike in aesthetics classification, there is no single threshold
which would determine the ranking order of the images across our entire
dataset. We propose a deep neural network based approach that is trained on
image pairs by incorporating principles from relative learning. Results show
that such relative training procedure allows our network to rank the images
with a higher accuracy than a state-of-art network trained on the same set of
images using binary labels.

 <dc:title>A Structured Approach to Predicting Image Enhancement Parameters</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Social networking on mobile devices has become a commonplace of everyday
life. In addition, photo capturing process has become trivial due to the
advances in mobile imaging. Hence people capture a lot of photos everyday and
they want them to be visually-attractive. This has given rise to automated,
one-touch enhancement tools. However, the inability of those tools to provide
personalized and content-adaptive enhancement has paved way for machine-learned
methods to do the same. The existing typical machine-learned methods
heuristically (e.g. kNN-search) predict the enhancement parameters for a new
image by relating the image to a set of similar training images. These
heuristic methods need constant interaction with the training images which
makes the parameter prediction sub-optimal and computationally expensive at
test time which is undesired. This paper presents a novel approach to
predicting the enhancement parameters given a new image using only its
features, without using any training images. We propose to model the
interaction between the image features and its corresponding enhancement
parameters using the matrix factorization (MF) principles. We also propose a
way to integrate the image features in the MF formulation. We show that our
approach outperforms heuristic approaches as well as recent approaches in MF
and structured prediction on synthetic as well as real-world data of image
enhancement.

 <dc:description>  Personalized and content-adaptive image enhancement can find many
applications in the age of social media and mobile computing. This paper
presents a relative-learning-based approach, which, unlike previous methods,
does not require matching original and enhanced images for training. This
allows the use of massive online photo collections to train a ranking model for
improved enhancement. We first propose a multi-level ranking model, which is
learned from only relatively-labeled inputs that are automatically crawled.
Then we design a novel parameter sampling scheme under this model to generate
the desired enhancement parameters for a new image. For evaluation, we first
verify the effectiveness and the generalization abilities of our approach,
using images that have been enhanced/labeled by experts. Then we carry out
subjective tests, which show that users prefer images enhanced by our approach
over other existing methods.

 <dc:description>  When a vehicle observes another one, the two vehicles' poses are correlated
by this spatial relative observation, which can be used in cooperative
localization for further increasing localization accuracy and precision. To use
spatial relative observations, we propose to add them into a pose graph for
optimal pose estimation. Before adding them, we need to know the identities of
the observed vehicles. The vehicle identification is formulated as a linear
assignment problem, which can be solved efficiently. By using pose graph
techniques and the start-of-the-art factor composition/decomposition method,
our cooperative localization algorithm is robust against communication delay,
packet loss, and out-of-sequence packet reception. We demonstrate the usability
of our framework and effectiveness of our algorithm through both simulations
and real-world experiments using three vehicles on the road.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of computing a minimum cut in a simple, undirected graph
and give a deterministic $O(m \log^2 n \log\log^2 n)$ time algorithm. This
improves both on the best previously known deterministic running time of $O(m
\log^{12} n)$ (Kawarabayashi and Thorup, STOC 2015) and the best previously
known randomized running time of $O(m \log^{3} n)$ (Karger, J.ACM 2000) for
this problem, though Karger's algorithm can be further applied to weighted
graphs.
  Our approach is using the Kawarabayashi and Thorup graph compression
technique, which repeatedly finds low-conductance cuts. To find these cuts they
use a diffusion-based local algorithm. We use instead a flow-based local
algorithm and suitably adjust their framework to work with our flow-based
subroutine. Both flow and diffusion based methods have a long history of being
applied to finding low conductance cuts. Diffusion algorithms have several
variants that are naturally local while it is more complicated to make flow
methods local. Some prior work has proven nice properties for local flow based
algorithms with respect to improving or cleaning up low conductance cuts. Our
flow subroutine, however, is the first that is both local and produces low
conductance cuts. Thus, it may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We introduce LAMP: the Linear Additive Markov Process. Transitions in LAMP
may be influenced by states visited in the distant history of the process, but
unlike higher-order Markov processes, LAMP retains an efficient
parametrization. LAMP also allows the specific dependence on history to be
learned efficiently from data. We characterize some theoretical properties of
LAMP, including its steady-state and mixing time. We then give an algorithm
based on alternating minimization to learn LAMP models from data. Finally, we
perform a series of real-world experiments to show that LAMP is more powerful
than first-order Markov processes, and even holds its own against deep
sequential models (LSTMs) with a negligible increase in parameter complexity.

 <dc:description>  Traffic congestion is a widespread problem. Dynamic traffic routing systems
and congestion pricing are getting importance in recent research. Lane
prediction and vehicle density estimation is an important component of such
systems. We introduce a novel problem of vehicle self-positioning which
involves predicting the number of lanes on the road and vehicle's position in
those lanes using videos captured by a dashboard camera. We propose an
integrated closed-loop approach where we use the presence of vehicles to aid
the task of self-positioning and vice-versa. To incorporate multiple factors
and high-level semantic knowledge into the solution, we formulate this problem
as a Bayesian framework. In the framework, the number of lanes, the vehicle's
position in those lanes and the presence of other vehicles are considered as
parameters. We also propose a bounding box selection scheme to reduce the
number of false detections and increase the computational efficiency. We show
that the number of box proposals decreases by a factor of 6 using the selection
approach. It also results in large reduction in the number of false detections.
The entire approach is tested on real-world videos and is found to give
acceptable results.

 <dc:description>  A big data service is any data-originated resource that is offered over the
Internet. The performance of a big data service depends on the data bought from
the data collectors. However, the problem of optimal pricing and data
allocation in big data services is not well-studied. In this paper, we propose
an auction-based big data market model. We first define the data cost and
utility based on the impact of data size on the performance of big data
analytics, e.g., machine learning algorithms. The big data services are
considered as digital goods and uniquely characterized with &quot;unlimited supply&quot;
compared to conventional goods which are limited. We therefore propose a
Bayesian profit maximization auction which is truthful, rational, and
computationally efficient. The optimal service price and data size are obtained
by solving the profit maximization auction. Finally, experimental results on a
real-world taxi trip dataset show that our big data market model and auction
mechanism effectively solve the profit maximization problem of the service
provider.

 <dc:description>  In today's age of internet and social media, one can find an enormous volume
of forged images on-line. These images have been used in the past to convey
falsified information and achieve harmful intentions. The spread and the effect
of the social media only makes this problem more severe. While creating forged
images has become easier due to software advancements, there is no automated
algorithm which can reliably detect forgery.
  Image forgery detection can be seen as a subset of image understanding
problem. Human performance is still the gold-standard for these type of
problems when compared to existing state-of-art automated algorithms. We
conduct a subjective evaluation test with the aid of eye-tracker to investigate
into human factors associated with this problem. We compare the performance of
an automated algorithm and humans for forgery detection problem. We also
develop an algorithm which uses the data from the evaluation test to predict
the difficulty-level of an image (the difficulty-level of an image here denotes
how difficult it is for humans to detect forgery in an image. Terms such as
&quot;Easy/difficult image&quot; will be used in the same context). The experimental
results presented in this paper should facilitate development of better
algorithms in the future.

 <dc:title>Classification of Diabetic Retinopathy Images Using Multi-Class

 <dc:description>  All people with diabetes have the risk of developing diabetic retinopathy
(DR), a vision-threatening complication. Early detection and timely treatment
can reduce the occurrence of blindness due to DR. Computer-aided diagnosis has
the potential benefit of improving the accuracy and speed in DR detection. This
study is concerned with automatic classification of images with microaneurysm
(MA) and neovascularization (NV), two important DR clinical findings. Together
with normal images, this presents a 3-class classification problem. We propose
a modified color auto-correlogram feature (AutoCC) with low dimensionality that
is spectrally tuned towards DR images. Recognizing the fact that the images
with or without MA or NV are generally different only in small, localized
regions, we propose to employ a multi-class, multiple-instance learning
framework for performing the classification task using the proposed feature.
Extensive experiments including comparison with a few state-of-art image
classification approaches have been performed and the results suggest that the
proposed approach is promising as it outperforms other methods by a large
margin.

 <dc:description>  This work investigates the geometry of a nonconvex reformulation of
minimizing a general convex loss function $f(X)$ regularized by the matrix
nuclear norm $\|X\|_*$. Nuclear-norm regularized matrix inverse problems are at
the heart of many applications in machine learning, signal processing, and
control. The statistical performance of nuclear norm regularization has been
studied extensively in literature using convex analysis techniques. Despite its
optimal performance, the resulting optimization has high computational
complexity when solved using standard or even tailored fast convex solvers. To
develop faster and more scalable algorithms, we follow the proposal of
Burer-Monteiro to factor the matrix variable $X$ into the product of two
smaller rectangular matrices $X=UV^T$ and also replace the nuclear norm
$\|X\|_*$ with $(\|U\|_F^2+\|V\|_F^2)/2$. In spite of the nonconvexity of the
factored formulation, we prove that when the convex loss function $f(X)$ is
$(2r,4r)$-restricted well-conditioned, each critical point of the factored
problem either corresponds to the optimal solution $X^\star$ of the original
convex optimization or is a strict saddle point where the Hessian matrix has a
strictly negative eigenvalue. Such a geometric structure of the factored
formulation allows many local search algorithms to converge to the global
optimum with random initializations.

 <dc:description>  Outdoor shopping complexes (OSC) are extremely difficult for people with
visual impairment to navigate. Existing GPS devices are mostly designed for
roadside navigation and seldom transition well into an OSC-like setting. We
report our study on the challenges faced by a blind person in navigating OSC
through developing a new mobile application named iExplore. We first report an
exploratory study aiming at deriving specific design principles for building
this system by learning the unique challenges of the problem. Then we present a
methodology that can be used to derive the necessary information for the
development of iExplore, followed by experimental validation of the technology
by a group of visually impaired users in a local outdoor shopping center. User
feedback and other experiments suggest that iExplore, while at its very initial
phase, has the potential of filling a practical gap in existing assistive
technologies for the visually impaired.

 <dc:description>  Step adjustment for humanoid robots has been shown to improve gait
robustness, while timing adjustment is often neglected in control strategies.
In this paper, a new walking controller is proposed that combines both step
location and timing adjustment for generating robust gaits. In this approach,
step location and timing are decided, based on the Divergent Component of
Motion (DCM) measurement. We define the DCM offset as the offset between the
DCM and landing location of the swing foot at landing time, and employ it to
split state space into viable/non-viable parts. Constructing our walking
controller based on the DCM offset, we can exploit the whole capability of a
biped robot in terms of stepping to recover from disturbances. The proposed
approach is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, the nominal step
location and step duration for the next step(s) are decided. In this stage, the
main goal is to schedule the gait variables far from constraint boundaries for
a desired walking velocity. The second stage adapts at each control cycle the
landing position and time of the swing foot. By using the DCM offset and a
change of variable for the step timing, we can formulate the second stage of
our controller as a small sized quadratic program without the need to preview
several steps ahead. To map the adapted gait variables to the full robot, a
hierarchical inverse dynamics is employed. Interestingly, our approach does not
require precise control of the center of pressure and can also be used on
robots with passive ankles or point feet. Simulation experiments show a
significant improvement in robustness to various types of external
disturbances, such as pushes and slippage, compared to state of the art preview
controllers where step timing is not adjusted. In particular, we demonstrate
robust walking behavior for a simulated robot with passive ankles. Keywords

 <dc:description>  Generative models in vision have seen rapid progress due to algorithmic
improvements and the availability of high-quality image datasets. In this
paper, we offer contributions in both these areas to enable similar progress in
audio modeling. First, we detail a powerful new WaveNet-style autoencoder model
that conditions an autoregressive decoder on temporal codes learned from the
raw audio waveform. Second, we introduce NSynth, a large-scale and high-quality
dataset of musical notes that is an order of magnitude larger than comparable
public datasets. Using NSynth, we demonstrate improved qualitative and
quantitative performance of the WaveNet autoencoder over a well-tuned spectral
autoencoder baseline. Finally, we show that the model learns a manifold of
embeddings that allows for morphing between instruments, meaningfully
interpolating in timbre to create new types of sounds that are realistic and
expressive.

 <dc:description>  Being able to predict whether a song can be a hit has impor- tant
applications in the music industry. Although it is true that the popularity of
a song can be greatly affected by exter- nal factors such as social and
commercial influences, to which degree audio features computed from musical
signals (whom we regard as internal factors) can predict song popularity is an
interesting research question on its own. Motivated by the recent success of
deep learning techniques, we attempt to ex- tend previous work on hit song
prediction by jointly learning the audio features and prediction models using
deep learning. Specifically, we experiment with a convolutional neural net-
work model that takes the primitive mel-spectrogram as the input for feature
learning, a more advanced JYnet model that uses an external song dataset for
supervised pre-training and auto-tagging, and the combination of these two
models. We also consider the inception model to characterize audio infor-
mation in different scales. Our experiments suggest that deep structures are
indeed more accurate than shallow structures in predicting the popularity of
either Chinese or Western Pop songs in Taiwan. We also use the tags predicted
by JYnet to gain insights into the result of different models.

between a pair of primary users (PUs) following the principle of two-way
relaying. In return, it gets access to the spectrum of the PUs to enable its
own transmission to SU-receiver (SU-Rx). Further, in order to support
sustainable operation of the network, SU-Tx is assumed to harvest energy from
the RF signals received from the PUs, using the technique of simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). Assuming a decode-and-forward
behaviour and power-splitting based relaying protocol at SU-Tx, closed form
expressions for outage probability of PU and SU are obtained. Simulation
results validate our analytical results and illustrate spectrum-efficiency and
energy-efficiency advantages of the proposed system over one-way relaying.

 <dc:description>  To solve deep metric learning problems and producing feature embeddings,
current methodologies will commonly use a triplet model to minimise the
relative distance between samples from the same class and maximise the relative
distance between samples from different classes. Though successful, the
training convergence of this triplet model can be compromised by the fact that
the vast majority of the training samples will produce gradients with
magnitudes that are close to zero. This issue has motivated the development of
methods that explore the global structure of the embedding and other methods
that explore hard negative/positive mining. The effectiveness of such mining
methods is often associated with intractable computational requirements. In
this paper, we propose a novel deep metric learning method that combines the
triplet model and the global structure of the embedding space. We rely on a
smart mining procedure that produces effective training samples for a low
computational cost. In addition, we propose an adaptive controller that
automatically adjusts the smart mining hyper-parameters and speeds up the
convergence of the training process. We show empirically that our proposed
method allows for fast and more accurate training of triplet ConvNets than
other competing mining methods. Additionally, we show that our method achieves
new state-of-the-art embedding results for CUB-200-2011 and Cars196 datasets.

 <dc:description>  The article investigates classes of queries maintainable by conjunctive
queries (CQs) and their extensions and restrictions in the dynamic complexity
framework of Patnaik and Immerman. Starting from the basic language of
quantifier-free conjunctions of positive atoms, it studies the impact of
additional operators and features - such as union, atomic negation and
quantification - on the dynamic expressiveness, for the standard semantics as
well as for Delta-semantics.
  Although many different combinations of these features are possible, they
basically yield five important fragments for the standard semantics,
characterized by the addition of (1) arbitrary quantification and atomic
negation, (2) existential quantification and atomic negation, (3) existential
quantification, (4) atomic negation (but no quantification), and by (5) no
addition to the basic language at all. While fragments (3), (4) and (5) can be
separated, it remains open whether fragments (1), (2) and (3) are actually
different. The fragments arising from Delta-semantics are also subsumed by the
standard fragments (1), (2) and (4). The main fragments of DynFO that had been
studied in previous work, DynQF and DynProp, characterized by quantifier-free
update programs with or without auxiliary functions, respectively, also fit
into this hierarchy: DynProp coincides with fragment (4) and DynQF is strictly
above fragment (4) and within fragment (3).
  As a further result, all (statically) FO-definable queries are captured by
fragment (2) and a complete characterization of these queries in terms of
non-recursive dynamic programs with existential update formulas with one
existential quantifier is given.

 <dc:description>  Let $d$ be a positive integer and $x$ a real number. Let $A_{d, x}$ be a
$d\times 2d$ matrix with its entries $$ a_{i,j}=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} x\ \
&amp; \mbox{for} \ 1\leqslant j\leqslant d+1-i, 1\ \ &amp; \mbox{for} \ d+2-i\leqslant
j\leqslant d+i, 0\ \ &amp; \mbox{for} \ d+1+i\leqslant j\leqslant 2d. \end{array}
\right. $$ Further, let $R_d$ be a set of sequences of integers as follows:
$$R_d=\{(\rho_1, \rho_2,\ldots, \rho_d)|1\leqslant \rho_i\leqslant d+i,
1\leqslant i \leqslant d,\ \mbox{and}\ \rho_r\neq \rho_s\ \mbox{for}\ r\neq
s\}.$$ and define $$\Omega_d(x)=\sum_{\rho\in R_d}a_{1,\rho_1}a_{2,
\rho_2}\ldots a_{d,\rho_d}.$$ In order to give a better bound on the size of
spheres of permutation codes under the Chebychev distance, Kl{\o}ve introduced
the above function and conjectured that $$\Omega_d(x)=\sum_{m=0}^d{d\choose
m}(m+1)^d(x-1)^{d-m}.$$ In this paper, we settle down this conjecture
positively.

 <dc:description>  Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) mechanisms enable ISPs to share a single IPv4 address
across multiple customers, thus offering an immediate solution to the IPv4
address scarcity problem. In this paper, we perform a large scale active
measurement campaign to detect CGNs in fixed broadband networks using NAT
Revelio, a tool we have developed and validated. Revelio enables us to actively
determine from within residential networks the type of upstream network address
translation, namely NAT at the home gateway (customer-grade NAT) or NAT in the
ISP (Carrier Grade NAT). We demonstrate the generality of the methodology by
deploying Revelio in the FCC Measuring Broadband America testbed operated by
SamKnows and also in the RIPE Atlas testbed. We enhance Revelio to actively
discover from within any home network the type of upstream NAT configuration
(i.e., simple home NAT or Carrier Grade NAT). We ran an active large-scale
measurement study of CGN usage from 5,121 measurement vantage points within
over 60 different ISPs operating in Europe and the United States. We found that
10% of the ISPs we tested have some form of CGN deployment. We validate our
results with four ISPs at the IP level and, reported to the ground truth we
collected, we conclude that Revelio was 100% accurate in determining the
upstream NAT configuration for all the corresponding lines. To the best of our
knowledge, this represents the largest active measurement study of (confirmed)
CGN deployments at the IP level in fixed broadband networks to date.

 <dc:description>  This contribution reports an application of MultiFractal Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis, MFDFA based novel feature extraction technique for
automated detection of epilepsy. In fractal geometry, Multifractal Detrended
Fluctuation Analysis MFDFA is a popular technique to examine the
self-similarity of a nonlinear, chaotic and noisy time series. In the present
research work, EEG signals representing healthy, interictal (seizure free) and
ictal activities (seizure) are acquired from an existing available database.
The acquired EEG signals of different states are at first analyzed using MFDFA.
To requisite the time series singularity quantification at local and global
scales, a novel set of fourteen different features. Suitable feature ranking
employing students t-test has been done to select the most statistically
significant features which are henceforth being used as inputs to a support
vector machines (SVM) classifier for the classification of different EEG
signals. Eight different classification problems have been presented in this
paper and it has been observed that the overall classification accuracy using
MFDFA based features are reasonably satisfactory for all classification
problems. The performance of the proposed method are also found to be quite
commensurable and in some cases even better when compared with the results
published in existing literature studied on the similar data set.

 <dc:title>Packet Throughput Analysis of Static and Dynamic TDD in Small Cell

 <dc:description>  We develop an analytical framework for the perfor- mance comparison of small
cell networks operating under static time division duplexing (S-TDD) and
dynamic TDD (D-TDD). While in S-TDD downlink/uplink (DL/UL) cell transmissions
are synchronized, in D-TDD each cell dynamically allocates resources to the
most demanding direction. By leveraging stochastic geom- etry and queuing
theory, we derive closed-form expressions for the UL and DL packet throughput,
also capturing the impact of random traffic arrivals and packet
retransmissions. Through our analysis, which is validated via simulations, we
confirm that D-TDD outperforms S-TDD in DL, with the vice versa occurring in
UL, since asymmetric transmissions reduce DL interference at the expense of an
increased UL interference. We also find that in asymmetric scenarios, where
most of the traffic is in DL, D-TDD provides a DL packet throughput gain by
better controlling the queuing delay, and that such gain vanishes in the
light-traffic regime.

 <dc:description>  Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) exploit variations in the manufacturing
process to derive bit sequences from integrated circuits, which can be used as
secure cryptographic keys. Instead of storing the keys in an insecure,
non-volatile memory, they can be reproduced when needed. Since the reproduced
sequences are not stable due to physical reasons, error correction must be
applied. Recently, convolutional codes were shown to be suitable for key
reproduction in PUFs based on SRAM. This work shows how to further decrease the
reconstruction failure probability and PUF implementation size using codes with
larger memory length and decoding concepts such as soft-information and list
decoding.

 <dc:description>  Flexibility is a key enabler for the smart grid, required to facilitate
Demand Side Management (DSM) programs, managing electrical consumption to
reduce peaks, balance renewable generation and provide ancillary services to
the grid. Flexibility analysis is required to identify and quantify the
available electrical load of a site or building which can be shed or increased
in response to a DSM signal. A methodology for assessing flexibility is
developed, based on flexibility formulations and optimization requirements. The
methodology characterizes the loads, storage and on-site generation,
incorporates site assessment using the ISO 50002:2014 energy audit standard and
benchmarks performance against documented studies. An example application of
the methodology is detailed using a pilot site demonstrator.

 <dc:description>  Given a pattern of length $m$ and a text of length $n$, the goal in
$k$-mismatch pattern matching is to compute, for every $m$-substring of the
text, the exact Hamming distance to the pattern or report that it exceeds $k$.
This can be solved in either $\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt{k})$ time as shown by Amir
et al. [J. Algorithms 2004] or $\widetilde{O}((m + k^2) \cdot n/m)$ time due to
a result of Clifford et al. [SODA 2016]. We provide a smooth time trade-off
between these two bounds by designing an algorithm working in time
$\widetilde{O}( (m + k \sqrt{m}) \cdot n/m)$. We complement this with a
matching conditional lower bound, showing that a significantly faster
combinatorial algorithm is not possible, unless the combinatorial matrix
multiplication conjecture fails.

 <dc:description>  Why do large neural network generalize so well on complex tasks such as image
classification or speech recognition? What exactly is the role regularization
for them? These are arguably among the most important open questions in machine
learning today. In a recent and thought provoking paper [C. Zhang et al.]
several authors performed a number of numerical experiments that hint at the
need for novel theoretical concepts to account for this phenomenon. The paper
stirred quit a lot of excitement among the machine learning community but at
the same time it created some confusion as discussions on OpenReview.net
testifies. The aim of this pedagogical paper is to make this debate accessible
to a wider audience of data scientists without advanced theoretical knowledge
in statistical learning. The focus here is on explicit mathematical definitions
and on a discussion of relevant concepts, not on proofs for which we provide
references.

 <dc:description>  We present a character-based model for joint segmentation and POS tagging for
Chinese. The bidirectional RNN-CRF architecture for general sequence tagging is
adapted and applied with novel vector representations of Chinese characters
that capture rich contextual information and lower-than-character level
features. The proposed model is extensively evaluated and compared with a
state-of-the-art tagger respectively on CTB5, CTB9 and UD Chinese. The
experimental results indicate that our model is accurate and robust across
datasets in different sizes, genres and annotation schemes. We obtain
state-of-the-art performance on CTB5, achieving 94.38 F1-score for joint
segmentation and POS tagging.

 <dc:description>  Gaining profound insights from collected data of today's application domains
like IoT, cyber-physical systems, health care, or the financial sector is
business-critical and can create the next multi-billion dollar market. However,
analyzing these data and turning it into valuable insights is a huge challenge.
This is often not alone due to the large volume of data but due to an
incredibly high domain complexity, which makes it necessary to combine various
extrapolation and prediction methods to understand the collected data.
Model-driven analytics is a refinement process of raw data driven by a model
reflecting deep domain understanding, connecting data, domain knowledge, and
learning.

 <dc:description>  For more than a century, artificial lighting has served mainly for
illumination. Only recently, we start to transform our lighting infrastructure
to provide new services such as indoor localization and network connectivity.
These innovative advancements rely on two key requirements: the ability to
modulate light sources (for data transmission) and the presence of
photodetectors on objects (for data reception). But not all lights can be
modulated and most objects do not have photodetectors. To overcome these
limitations, researchers are developing novel sensing and communication methods
that exploit passive light sources, such as the sun, and that leverage the
external surfaces of objects, such as fingers and car roofs, to create a new
generation of cyber-physical systems based on visible light. In this article we
propose a taxonomy to analyze these novel contributions. Our taxonomy allows us
to identify the overarching principles, challenges and opportunities of this
new rising area.

 <dc:description>  We analyze large-scale data sets about collaborations from two different
domains: economics, specifically 22.000 R&amp;D alliances between 14.500 firms, and
science, specifically 300.000 co-authorship relations between 95.000
scientists. Considering the different domains of the data sets, we address two
questions: (a) to what extent do the collaboration networks reconstructed from
the data share common structural features, and (b) can their structure be
reproduced by the same agent-based model. In our data-driven modeling approach
we use aggregated network data to calibrate the probabilities at which agents
establish collaborations with either newcomers or established agents. The model
is then validated by its ability to reproduce network features not used for
calibration, including distributions of degrees, path lengths, local clustering
coefficients and sizes of disconnected components. Emphasis is put on comparing
domains, but also sub-domains (economic sectors, scientific specializations).
Interpreting the link probabilities as strategies for link formation, we find
that in R&amp;D collaborations newcomers prefer links with established agents,
while in co-authorship relations newcomers prefer links with other newcomers.
Our results shed new light on the long-standing question about the role of
endogenous and exogenous factors (i.e., different information available to the
initiator of a collaboration) in network formation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel deep layer cascade (LC) method to improve the accuracy and
speed of semantic segmentation. Unlike the conventional model cascade (MC) that
is composed of multiple independent models, LC treats a single deep model as a
cascade of several sub-models. Earlier sub-models are trained to handle easy
and confident regions, and they progressively feed-forward harder regions to
the next sub-model for processing. Convolutions are only calculated on these
regions to reduce computations. The proposed method possesses several
advantages. First, LC classifies most of the easy regions in the shallow stage
and makes deeper stage focuses on a few hard regions. Such an adaptive and
'difficulty-aware' learning improves segmentation performance. Second, LC
accelerates both training and testing of deep network thanks to early decisions
in the shallow stage. Third, in comparison to MC, LC is an end-to-end trainable
framework, allowing joint learning of all sub-models. We evaluate our method on
PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
fast speed.

 <dc:description>  Search systems in online social media sites are frequently used to find
information about ongoing events and people. For topics with multiple competing
perspectives, such as political events or political candidates, bias in the top
ranked results significantly shapes public opinion. However, bias does not
emerge from an algorithm alone. It is important to distinguish between the bias
that arises from the data that serves as the input to the ranking system and
the bias that arises from the ranking system itself. In this paper, we propose
a framework to quantify these distinct biases and apply this framework to
politics-related queries on Twitter. We found that both the input data and the
ranking system contribute significantly to produce varying amounts of bias in
the search results and in different ways. We discuss the consequences of these
biases and possible mechanisms to signal this bias in social media search
systems' interfaces.

 <dc:description>  Snapshot Isolation (SI) is a widely adopted concurrency control mechanism in
database systems, which utilizes timestamps to resolve conflicts between
transactions. However, centralized allocation of timestamps is a potential
bottleneck for parallel transaction management. This bottleneck is becoming
increasingly visible with the rapidly growing degree of parallelism of today's
computing platforms. This paper introduces Posterior Snapshot Isolation
(PostSI), an SI mechanism that allows transactions to determine their
timestamps autonomously, without relying on centralized coordination. As such,
PostSI can scale well, rendering it suitable for various multi-core and MPP
platforms. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate its advantage
over existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  Current state-of-the-art action detection systems are tailored for offline
batch-processing applications. However, for online applications like
human-robot interaction, current systems fall short, either because they only
detect one action per video, or because they assume that the entire video is
available ahead of time. In this work, we introduce a real-time and online
joint-labelling and association algorithm for action detection that can
incrementally construct space-time action tubes on the most challenging action
videos in which different action categories occur concurrently. In contrast to
previous methods, we solve the detection-window association and action
labelling problems jointly in a single pass. We demonstrate superior online
association accuracy and speed (2.2ms per frame) as compared to the current
state-of-the-art offline systems. We further demonstrate that the entire action
detection pipeline can easily be made to work effectively in real-time using
our action tube construction algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a coding technique called position-based coding has been used to
establish achievability statements for various kinds of classical communication
protocols that use quantum channels. In the present paper, we apply this
technique in the entanglement-assisted setting in order to establish lower
bounds for error exponents, lower bounds on the second-order coding rate, and
one-shot lower bounds. We also demonstrate that position-based coding can be a
powerful tool for analyzing other communication settings. In particular, we
reduce the quantum simultaneous decoding conjecture for entanglement-assisted
or unassisted communication over a quantum multiple access channel to open
questions in multiple quantum hypothesis testing. We then determine achievable
rate regions for entanglement-assisted or unassisted classical communication
over a quantum multiple-access channel, when using a particular quantum
simultaneous decoder. The achievable rate regions given in this latter case are
generally suboptimal, involving differences of Renyi-2 entropies and
conditional quantum entropies.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an underlay cognitive radio (CR) multicast network, consisting
of a cognitive base station (CBS) and multiple multicast groups of secondary
users (SUs), is considered. All SUs, belonging to a particular multicast group,
are served by the CBS using a common primary user (PU) channel. The goal is to
maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system, through dynamic adaptation
of target rate and transmit power for each multicast group, under the PUs'
individual interference constraints. The optimization problem formulated for
this is proved to be non quasi-concave with respect to the joint variation of
the CBS's transmit power and target rate. An efficient iterative algorithm for
EE maximization is proposed along with its complexity analysis. Simulation
results illustrate the performance gain of our proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  Large amount of image denoising literature focuses on single channel images
and often experimentally validates the proposed methods on tens of images at
most. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between denoising and
classification on large scale dataset. Inspired by classification models, we
propose a novel deep learning architecture for color (multichannel) image
denoising and report on thousands of images from ImageNet dataset as well as
commonly used imagery. We study the importance of (sufficient) training data,
how semantic class information can be traded for improved denoising results. As
a result, our method greatly improves PSNR performance by 0.34 - 0.51 dB on
average over state-of-the art methods on large scale dataset. We conclude that
it is beneficial to incorporate in classification models. On the other hand, we
also study how noise affect classification performance. In the end, we come to
a number of interesting conclusions, some being counter-intuitive.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, a large body of research has demonstrated that judgments and
behaviors can propagate from person to person. Phenomena as diverse as
political mobilization, health practices, altruism, and emotional states
exhibit similar dynamics of social contagion. The precise mechanisms of
judgment propagation are not well understood, however, because it is difficult
to control for confounding factors such as homophily or dynamic network
structures. We introduce a novel experimental design that renders possible the
stringent study of judgment propagation. In this design, experimental chains of
individuals can revise their initial judgment in a visual perception task after
observing a predecessor's judgment. The positioning of a very good performer at
the top of a chain created a performance gap, which triggered waves of judgment
propagation down the chain. We evaluated the dynamics of judgment propagation
experimentally. Despite strong social influence within pairs of individuals,
the reach of judgment propagation across a chain rarely exceeded a social
distance of three to four degrees of separation. Furthermore, computer
simulations showed that the speed of judgment propagation decayed exponentially
with the social distance from the source. We show that information distortion
and the overweighting of other people's errors are two individual-level
mechanisms hindering judgment propagation at the scale of the chain. Our
results contribute to the understanding of social contagion processes, and our
experimental method offers numerous new opportunities to study judgment
propagation in the laboratory.

 <dc:description>  This communication presents a longitudinal model-free control approach for
computing the wheel torque command to be applied on a vehicle. This setting
enables us to overcome the problem of unknown vehicle parameters for generating
a suitable control law. An important parameter in this control setting is made
time-varying for ensuring finite-time stability. Several convincing computer
simulations are displayed and discussed. Overshoots become therefore smaller.
The driving comfort is increased and the robustness to time-delays is improved.

 <dc:description>  The Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol BB84 has been proven secure
against several important types of attacks: the collective attacks and the
joint attacks. Here we analyze the security of a modified BB84 protocol, for
which information is sent only in the z basis while testing is done in both the
z and the x bases, against collective attacks. The proof follows the framework
of a previous paper (Boyer, Gelles, and Mor, 2009), but it avoids the classical
information-theoretical analysis that caused problems with composability. We
show that this modified BB84 protocol is as secure against collective attacks
as the original BB84 protocol, and that it requires more bits for testing.

 <dc:description>  Seymour's second neighbourhood conjecture asserts that every oriented graph
has a vertex whose second out-neighbourhood is at least as large as its
out-neighbourhood. In this paper, we prove that the conjecture holds for
quasi-transitive oriented graphs, which is a superclass of tournaments and
transitive acyclic digraphs. A digraph $D$ is called quasi-transitive is for
every pair $xy,yz$ of arcs between distinct vertices $x,y,z$, $xz$ or $zx$
(&quot;or&quot; is inclusive here) is in $D$.

 <dc:title>A new algorithm for Solving 3-CNF-SAT problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Qasemi, Belal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  NP-Complete problems have an important attribute that if one NP-Complete
problem can be solved in polynomial time, all NP-Complete problems will have a
polynomial solution. The 3-CNF-SAT problem is a NP-Complete problem and the
primary method to solve it checks all values of the truth table. This task is
of the {\Omega}(2^n) time order. This paper shows that by changing the
viewpoint towards the problem, it is possible to know if a 3-CNF-SAT problem is
satisfiable in time O(n^10) or not? In this paper, the value of all clauses are
considered as false. With this presumption, any of the values inside the truth
table can be shown in string form in order to define the set of compatible
clauses for each of the strings. So, rather than processing strings, their
clauses will be processed implicating that instead of 2^n strings, (O(n^3))
clauses are to be processed; therefore, the time and space complexity of the
algorithm would be polynomial.

 <dc:description>  Relative positioning between multiple mobile users is essential for many
applications, such as search and rescue in disaster areas or human social
interaction. Inertial-measurement unit (IMU) is promising to determine the
change of position over short periods of time, but it is very sensitive to
error accumulation over long term run. By equipping the mobile users with
ranging unit, e.g. ultra-wideband (UWB), it is possible to achieve accurate
relative positioning by trilateration-based approaches. As compared to vision
or laser-based sensors, the UWB does not need to be with in line-of-sight and
provides accurate distance estimation. However, UWB does not provide any
bearing information and the communication range is limited, thus UWB alone
cannot determine the user location without any ambiguity. In this paper, we
propose an approach to combine IMU inertial and UWB ranging measurement for
relative positioning between multiple mobile users without the knowledge of the
infrastructure. We incorporate the UWB and the IMU measurement into a
probabilistic-based framework, which allows to cooperatively position a group
of mobile users and recover from positioning failures. We have conducted
extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of incorporating IMU inertial
and UWB ranging measurements.

 <dc:description>  Problems in modeling and simulation require significantly different workflow
management technologies than standard grid-based workflow management systems.
Computational scientists typically interact with simulation software in a
feedback driven way were solutions and workflows are developed iteratively and
simultaneously. This work describes common activities in workflows and how
combinations of these activities form unique workflows. It presents the Eclipse
Integrated Computational Environment as a workflow management system and
development environment for the modeling and simulation community. Examples of
the Environment's applicability to problems in energy science, general
multiphysics simulations, quantum computing and other areas are presented as
well as its impact on the community.

 <dc:title>Polynomial running times for polynomial-time oracle machines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kawamura, Akitoshi</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a more restrictive notion of feasibility of functionals
on Baire space than the established one from second-order complexity theory.
Thereby making it possible to consider functions on the natural numbers as
running times of oracle Turing machines and avoiding second-order polynomials,
which are notoriously difficult to handle. Furthermore, all machines that
witness this stronger kind of feasibility can be clocked and the different
traditions of treating partial operators from computable analysis and
second-order complexity theory are equated in a precise sense. The new notion
is named &quot;strong polynomial-time computability&quot;, and proven to be a strictly
stronger requirement than polynomial-time computability. It is proven that
within the framework for complexity of operators from analysis introduced by
Kawamura and Cook the classes of strongly polynomial-time computable operators
and polynomial-time computable operators coincide.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we argue that the future of Artificial Intelligence research
resides in two keywords: integration and embodiment. We support this claim by
analyzing the recent advances of the field. Regarding integration, we note that
the most impactful recent contributions have been made possible through the
integration of recent Machine Learning methods (based in particular on Deep
Learning and Recurrent Neural Networks) with more traditional ones (e.g.
Monte-Carlo tree search, goal babbling exploration or addressable memory
systems). Regarding embodiment, we note that the traditional benchmark tasks
(e.g. visual classification or board games) are becoming obsolete as
state-of-the-art learning algorithms approach or even surpass human performance
in most of them, having recently encouraged the development of first-person 3D
game platforms embedding realistic physics. Building upon this analysis, we
first propose an embodied cognitive architecture integrating heterogenous
sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence into a unified framework. We demonstrate
the utility of our approach by showing how major contributions of the field can
be expressed within the proposed framework. We then claim that benchmarking
environments need to reproduce ecologically-valid conditions for bootstrapping
the acquisition of increasingly complex cognitive skills through the concept of
a cognitive arms race between embodied agents.

 <dc:description>  We investigate Bitcoin network monitoring the dynamics of blocks and
transactions. We unveil that 43\% of the transactions are still not included in
the Blockchain after 1h from the first time they were seen in the network and
20\% of the transactions are still not included in the Blockchain after 30
days, revealing therefore great inefficiency in the Bitcoin system. However, we
observe that most of these `forgotten' transactions have low values and in
terms of transferred value the system is less inefficient with 93\% of the
transactions value being included into the Blockchain within 3h. The fact that
a sizeable fraction of transactions is not processed timely casts serious
doubts on the usability of the Bitcoin Blockchain for reliable time-stamping
purposes and calls for a debate about the right systems of incentives which a
peer-to-peer unintermediated system should introduce to promote efficient
transaction recording.

 <dc:description>  It is well-known that exploiting label correlations is important to
multi-label learning. Existing approaches either assume that the label
correlations are global and shared by all instances; or that the label
correlations are local and shared only by a data subset. In fact, in the
real-world applications, both cases may occur that some label correlations are
globally applicable and some are shared only in a local group of instances.
Moreover, it is also a usual case that only partial labels are observed, which
makes the exploitation of the label correlations much more difficult. That is,
it is hard to estimate the label correlations when many labels are absent. In
this paper, we propose a new multi-label approach GLOCAL dealing with both the
full-label and the missing-label cases, exploiting global and local label
correlations simultaneously, through learning a latent label representation and
optimizing label manifolds. The extensive experimental studies validate the
effectiveness of our approach on both full-label and missing-label data.

 <dc:description>  Physics is studying a system based on the information available about it.
There are two approaches to physics, deterministic and the nondeterministic.
The deterministic approaches assume everything is known about the system. Since
everything about the system is almost never known, nondeterministic approaches
such as statistical physics and quantum physics are of high importance. After a
tour through informational interpretation of quantum physics and required
mathematical tools, we go into the notion of time.
  We address the problem of time and a cluster of problems around measurement
in quantum mechanics. I present a new approach to interpreting time in terms of
information changes. Time will emerge from the non-commutativity of quantum
theory. In the third section we review information thermodynamics and later
derive some relations between our notion of time and the thermal time.

orthogonal Procrustes problem.
  We evaluate the proposed approaches on Estonian---a morphologically complex
language, for which the available corpora for training word embeddings are
relatively small. We compare both combined models with each other and with the
input word embedding models using synonym and analogy tests. The results show
that while using the ordinary least squares regression performs poorly in our
experiments, using orthogonal Procrustes to combine several word embedding
models into an ensemble model leads to 7-10% relative improvements over the
mean result of the initial models in synonym tests and 19-47% in analogy tests.

 <dc:description>  Most past work on social network link fraud detection tries to separate
genuine users from fraudsters, implicitly assuming that there is only one type
of fraudulent behavior. But is this assumption true? And, in either case, what
are the characteristics of such fraudulent behaviors? In this work, we set up
honeypots (&quot;dummy&quot; social network accounts), and buy fake followers (after
careful IRB approval). We report the signs of such behaviors including oddities
in local network connectivity, account attributes, and similarities and
differences across fraud providers. Most valuably, we discover and characterize
several types of fraud behaviors. We discuss how to leverage our insights in
practice by engineering strongly performing entropy-based features and
demonstrating high classification accuracy. Our contributions are (a)
instrumentation: we detail our experimental setup and carefully engineered data
collection process to scrape Twitter data while respecting API rate-limits, (b)
observations on fraud multimodality: we analyze our honeypot fraudster
ecosystem and give surprising insights into the multifaceted behaviors of these
fraudster types, and (c) features: we propose novel features that give strong
(&gt;0.95 precision/recall) discriminative power on ground-truth Twitter data.

 <dc:description>  Published by Reporters Without Borders every year, the Press Freedom Index
(PFI) reflects the fear and tension in the newsroom pushed by the government
and private sectors. While the PFI is invaluable in monitoring media
environments worldwide, the current survey-based method has inherent
limitations to updates in terms of cost and time. In this work, we introduce an
alternative way to measure the level of press freedom using media attention
diversity compiled from Unfiltered News.

 <dc:description>  It is known that news topics, covered more frequently and over longer periods
of time, are considered to be important to the public. Hence, what gets media
attention and how media attention evolves over time has been studied for
decades in communication study. However, previous studies are confined to a few
countries or a few topics, mainly due to lack of longitudinal global data. In
this work, we use a large-scale news data compiled from 196 countries to
provide empirical analyses of media attention dynamics.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the technological improvements of low-cost small-scale
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are promoting an ever-increasing use of them in
different tasks. In particular, the use of small-scale UAVs is useful in all
these low-altitude tasks in which common UAVs cannot be adopted, such as
recurrent comprehensive view of wide environments, frequent monitoring of
military areas, real-time classification of static and moving entities (e.g.,
people, cars, etc.). These tasks can be supported by mosaicking and change
detection algorithms achieved at low-altitude. Currently, public datasets for
testing these algorithms are not available. This paper presents the UMCD
dataset, the first collection of geo-referenced video sequences acquired at
low-altitude for mosaicking and change detection purposes. Five reference
scenarios are also reported.

 <dc:description>  The AMIDST Toolbox is a software for scalable probabilistic machine learning
with a spe- cial focus on (massive) streaming data. The toolbox supports a
flexible modeling language based on probabilistic graphical models with latent
variables and temporal dependencies. The specified models can be learnt from
large data sets using parallel or distributed implementa- tions of Bayesian
learning algorithms for either streaming or batch data. These algorithms are
based on a flexible variational message passing scheme, which supports discrete
and continu- ous variables from a wide range of probability distributions.
AMIDST also leverages existing functionality and algorithms by interfacing to
software tools such as Flink, Spark, MOA, Weka, R and HUGIN. AMIDST is an open
source toolbox written in Java and available at http://www.amidsttoolbox.com

 <dc:description>  Nonlocal image representation or group sparsity has attracted considerable
interest in various low-level vision tasks and has led to several
state-of-the-art image denoising techniques, such as BM3D, LSSC. In the past,
convex optimization with sparsity-promoting convex regularization was usually
regarded as a standard scheme for estimating sparse signals in noise. However,
using convex regularization can not still obtain the correct sparsity solution
under some practical problems including image inverse problems. In this paper
we propose a non-convex weighted $\ell_p$ minimization based group sparse
representation (GSR) framework for image denoising. To make the proposed scheme
tractable and robust, the generalized soft-thresholding (GST) algorithm is
adopted to solve the non-convex $\ell_p$ minimization problem. In addition, to
improve the accuracy of the nonlocal similar patches selection, an adaptive
patch search (APS) scheme is proposed. Experimental results have demonstrated
that the proposed approach not only outperforms many state-of-the-art denoising
methods such as BM3D and WNNM, but also results in a competitive speed.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a fully automated procedure for controller synthesis for
multi-agent systems under the presence of uncertainties. We model the motion of
each of the $N$ agents in the environment as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
and we assign to each agent one individual high-level formula given in
Probabilistic Computational Tree Logic (PCTL). Each agent may need to
collaborate with other agents in order to achieve a task. The collaboration is
imposed by sharing actions between the agents. We aim to design local control
policies such that each agent satisfies its individual PCTL formula. The
proposed algorithm builds on clustering the agents, MDP products construction
and controller policies design. We show that our approach has better
computational complexity than the centralized case, which traditionally suffers
from very high computational demands.

 <dc:description>  With the widespread adoption of social media sites like Twitter and Facebook,
there has been a shift in the way information is produced and consumed.
Earlier, the only producers of information were traditional news organizations,
which broadcast the same carefully-edited information to all consumers over
mass media channels. Whereas, now, in online social media, any user can be a
producer of information, and every user selects which other users she connects
to, thereby choosing the information she consumes. Moreover, the personalized
recommendations that most social media sites provide also contribute towards
the information consumed by individual users. In this work, we define a concept
of information diet -- which is the topical distribution of a given set of
information items (e.g., tweets) -- to characterize the information produced
and consumed by various types of users in the popular Twitter social media. At
a high level, we find that (i) popular users mostly produce very specialized
diets focusing on only a few topics; in fact, news organizations (e.g.,
NYTimes) produce much more focused diets on social media as compared to their
mass media diets, (ii) most users' consumption diets are primarily focused
towards one or two topics of their interest, and (iii) the personalized
recommendations provided by Twitter help to mitigate some of the topical
imbalances in the users' consumption diets, by adding information on diverse
topics apart from the users' primary topics of interest.

sufficient amounts of capacity, training data, and compute time, the
representations learned by these models include disentangled features
corresponding to high-level concepts. Specifically, we find a single unit which
performs sentiment analysis. These representations, learned in an unsupervised
manner, achieve state of the art on the binary subset of the Stanford Sentiment
Treebank. They are also very data efficient. When using only a handful of
labeled examples, our approach matches the performance of strong baselines
trained on full datasets. We also demonstrate the sentiment unit has a direct
influence on the generative process of the model. Simply fixing its value to be
positive or negative generates samples with the corresponding positive or
negative sentiment.

 <dc:description>  The log-determinant of a kernel matrix appears in a variety of machine
learning problems, ranging from determinantal point processes and generalized
Markov random fields, through to the training of Gaussian processes. Exact
calculation of this term is often intractable when the size of the kernel
matrix exceeds a few thousand. In the spirit of probabilistic numerics, we
reinterpret the problem of computing the log-determinant as a Bayesian
inference problem. In particular, we combine prior knowledge in the form of
bounds from matrix theory and evidence derived from stochastic trace estimation
to obtain probabilistic estimates for the log-determinant and its associated
uncertainty within a given computational budget. Beyond its novelty and
theoretic appeal, the performance of our proposal is competitive with
state-of-the-art approaches to approximating the log-determinant, while also
quantifying the uncertainty due to budget-constrained evidence.

 <dc:description>  We consider machine learning in a comparison-based setting where we are given
a set of points in a metric space, but we have no access to the actual
distances between the points. Instead, we can only ask an oracle whether the
distance between two points $i$ and $j$ is smaller than the distance between
the points $i$ and $k$. We are concerned with data structures and algorithms to
find nearest neighbors based on such comparisons. We focus on a simple yet
effective algorithm that recursively splits the space by first selecting two
random pivot points and then assigning all other points to the closer of the
two (comparison tree). We prove that if the metric space satisfies certain
expansion conditions, then with high probability the height of the comparison
tree is logarithmic in the number of points, leading to efficient search
performance. We also provide an upper bound for the failure probability to
return the true nearest neighbor. Experiments show that the comparison tree is
competitive with algorithms that have access to the actual distance values, and
needs less triplet comparisons than other competitors.

 <dc:title>Effect of Super Resolution on High Dimensional Features for Unsupervised

 <dc:description>  Majority of the face recognition algorithms use query faces captured from
uncontrolled, in the wild, environment. Often caused by the cameras limited
capabilities, it is common for these captured facial images to be blurred or
low resolution. Super resolution algorithms are therefore crucial in improving
the resolution of such images especially when the image size is small requiring
enlargement. This paper aims to demonstrate the effect of one of the
state-of-the-art algorithms in the field of image super resolution. To
demonstrate the functionality of the algorithm, various before and after 3D
face alignment cases are provided using the images from the Labeled Faces in
the Wild (lfw). Resulting images are subject to testing on a closed set face

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses automatic summarization and search in visual data
comprising of videos, live streams and image collections in a unified manner.
In particular, we propose a framework for multi-faceted summarization which
extracts key-frames (image summaries), skims (video summaries) and entity
summaries (summarization at the level of entities like objects, scenes, humans
and faces in the video). The user can either view these as extractive
summarization, or query focused summarization. Our approach first pre-processes
the video or image collection once, to extract all important visual features,
following which we provide an interactive mechanism to the user to summarize
the video based on their choice. We investigate several diversity, coverage and
representation models for all these problems, and argue the utility of these
different mod- els depending on the application. While most of the prior work
on submodular summarization approaches has focused on combining several models
and learning weighted mixtures, we focus on the explain-ability of different
the diversity, coverage and representation models and their scalability. Most
importantly, we also show that we can summarize hours of video data in a few
seconds, and our system allows the user to generate summaries of various
lengths and types interactively on the fly.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes two low-complexity iterative algorithms to compute the
capacity of a single-user multiple-input multiple-output channel with
per-antenna power constraint. The first method results from manipulating the
optimality conditions of the considered problem and applying fixed-point
iteration. In the second approach, we transform the considered problem into a
minimax optimization program using the well-known MAC- BC duality, and then
solve it by a novel alternating optimization method. In both proposed iterative
methods, each iteration involves an optimization problem which can be
efficiently solved by the water-filling algorithm. The proposed iterative
methods are provably convergent. Complexity analysis and extensive numerical
experiments are carried out to demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed algorithms over an existing approach known as the mode-dropping
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death among women
worldwide. In clinical routine, automatic breast ultrasound (BUS) image
segmentation is very challenging and essential for cancer diagnosis and
treatment planning. Many BUS segmentation approaches have been studied in the
last two decades, and have been proved to be effective on private datasets.
Currently, the advancement of BUS image segmentation seems to meet its
bottleneck. The improvement of the performance is increasingly challenging, and
only few new approaches were published in the last several years. It is the
time to look at the field by reviewing previous approaches comprehensively and
to investigate the future directions. In this paper, we study the basic ideas,
theories, pros and cons of the approaches, group them into categories, and
extensively review each category in depth by discussing the principles,
application issues, and advantages/disadvantages.

 <dc:title>Alternating Optimization for Capacity Region of Gaussian MIMO Broadcast
  Channels with Per-antenna Power Constraint</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper characterizes the capacity region of Gaussian MIMO broadcast
channels (BCs) with per-antenna power constraint (PAPC). While the capacity
region of MIMO BCs with a sum power constraint (SPC) was extensively studied,
that under PAPC has received less attention. A reason is that efficient
solutions for this problem are hard to find. The goal of this paper is to
devise an efficient algorithm for determining the capacity region of Gaussian
MIMO BCs subject to PAPC, which is scalable to the problem size. To this end,
we first transform the weighted sum capacity maximization problem, which is
inherently nonconvex with the input covariance matrices, into a convex
formulation in the dual multiple access channel by minimax duality. Then we
derive a computationally efficient algorithm combining the concept of
alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. The proposed
algorithm achieves much lower complexity compared to an existing interiorpoint
method. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
converges very fast under various scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based page
segmentation method for handwritten historical document images. We consider
page segmentation as a pixel labeling problem, i.e., each pixel is classified
as one of the predefined classes. Traditional methods in this area rely on
carefully hand-crafted features or large amounts of prior knowledge. In
contrast, we propose to learn features from raw image pixels using a CNN. While
many researchers focus on developing deep CNN architectures to solve different
problems, we train a simple CNN with only one convolution layer. We show that
the simple architecture achieves competitive results against other deep
architectures on different public datasets. Experiments also demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared to previous
methods.

 <dc:description>  The static nature of current cyber systems has made them easy to be attacked
and compromised. By constantly changing a system, Moving Target Defense (MTD)
has provided a promising way to reduce or move the attack surface that is
available for exploitation by an adversary. However, the current network- based
MTD obfuscates networks indiscriminately that makes some networks key services,
such as web and DNS services, unavailable, because many information of these
services has to be opened to the outside and remain real without compromising
their usability. Moreover, the indiscriminate obfuscation also severely reduces
the performance of networks. In this paper, we propose CHAOS, an SDN
(Software-defined networking)-based MTD system, which discriminately obfuscates
hosts with different security levels in a network. In CHAOS, we introduce a
Chaos Tower Obfuscation (CTO) method, which uses a Chaos Tower Structure (CTS)
to depict the hierarchy of all the hosts in an intranet and provides a more
unpredictable and flexible obfuscation method. We also present the design of
CHAOS, which leverages SDN features to obfuscate the attack surface including
IP obfuscation, ports obfuscation, and fingerprint obfuscation thereby
enhancing the unpredictability of the networking environment. We develop fast
CTO algorithms to achieve a different degree of obfuscation for the hosts in
each layer. Our experimental results show that a network protected by CHAOS is
capable of decreasing the percentage of information disclosure effectively to
guarantee the normal flow of traffic.

 <dc:description>  The Weihrauch degrees and strong Weihrauch degrees are partially ordered
structures representing degrees of unsolvability of various mathematical
problems. Their study has been widely applied in computable analysis,
complexity theory, and more recently, also in computable combinatorics. We
answer an open question about the algebraic structure of the strong Weihrauch
degrees, by exhibiting a join operation that turns these degrees into a
lattice. Previously, the strong Weihrauch degrees were only known to form a
lower semi-lattice. We then show that unlike the Weihrauch degrees, which are
known to form a distributive lattice, the lattice of strong Weihrauch degrees
is not distributive. Therefore, the two structures are not isomorphic.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on a novel and challenging vision task, dense video
captioning, which aims to automatically describe a video clip with multiple
informative and diverse caption sentences. The proposed method is trained
without explicit annotation of fine-grained sentence to video region-sequence
correspondence, but is only based on weak video-level sentence annotations. It
differs from existing video captioning systems in three technical aspects.
First, we propose lexical fully convolutional neural networks (Lexical-FCN)
with weakly supervised multi-instance multi-label learning to weakly link video
regions with lexical labels. Second, we introduce a novel submodular
maximization scheme to generate multiple informative and diverse
region-sequences based on the Lexical-FCN outputs. A winner-takes-all scheme is
adopted to weakly associate sentences to region-sequences in the training
phase. Third, a sequence-to-sequence learning based language model is trained
with the weakly supervised information obtained through the association
process. We show that the proposed method can not only produce informative and
diverse dense captions, but also outperform state-of-the-art single video
captioning methods by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  Recent research has shown a substantial active presence of bots in online
social networks (OSNs). In this paper we utilise our past work on studying bots
(Stweeler) to comparatively analyse the usage and impact of bots and humans on
Twitter, one of the largest OSNs in the world. We collect a large-scale Twitter
dataset and define various metrics based on tweet metadata. We divide and
filter the dataset in four popularity groups in terms of number of followers.
Using a human annotation task we assign 'bot' and 'human' ground-truth labels
to the dataset, and compare the annotations against an online bot detection
tool for evaluation. We then ask a series of questions to discern important
behavioural bot and human characteristics using metrics within and among four
popularity groups. From the comparative analysis we draw important differences
as well as surprising similarities between the two entities, thus paving the
way for reliable classification of automated political infiltration,
advertisement campaigns, and general bot detection.

 <dc:description>  Fluorescence microscopy images usually show severe anisotropy in axial versus
lateral resolution. This hampers downstream processing, i.e. the automatic
extraction of quantitative biological data. While deconvolution methods and
other techniques to address this problem exist, they are either time consuming
to apply or limited in their ability to remove anisotropy. We propose a method
to recover isotropic resolution from readily acquired anisotropic data. We
achieve this using a convolutional neural network that is trained end-to-end
from the same anisotropic body of data we later apply the network to. The
network effectively learns to restore the full isotropic resolution by
restoring the image under a trained, sample specific image prior. We apply our
method to $3$ synthetic and $3$ real datasets and show that our results improve
on results from deconvolution and state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques.
Finally, we demonstrate that a standard 3D segmentation pipeline performs on
the output of our network with comparable accuracy as on the full isotropic
data.

 <dc:description>  While modern parallel computing systems provide high performance resources,
utilizing them to the highest extent requires advanced programming expertise.
Programming for parallel computing systems is much more difficult than
programming for sequential systems. OpenMP is an extension of C++ programming
language that enables to express parallelism using compiler directives. While
OpenMP alleviates parallel programming by reducing the lines of code that the
programmer needs to write, deciding how and when to use these compiler
directives is up to the programmer. Novice programmers may make mistakes that
may lead to performance degradation or unexpected program behavior. Cognitive
computing has shown impressive results in various domains, such as health or
marketing. In this paper, we describe the use of IBM Watson cognitive system
for education of novice parallel programmers. Using the dialogue service of the
IBM Watson we have developed a solution that assists the programmer in avoiding
common OpenMP mistakes. To evaluate our approach we have conducted a survey
with a number of novice parallel programmers at the Linnaeus University, and
obtained encouraging results with respect to usefulness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  We study how complexity classes above BQP, such as postBQP, ${\rm
postBQP}_{\rm FP}$, and SBQP, change if we &quot;Merlinize&quot; them, i.e., if we allow
an extra input quantum state (or classical bit string) given by Merlin as
witness. Main results are the following three: First, the Merlinized version of
postBQP is equal to PSPACE. Second, if the Merlinized postBQP is restricted in
such a way that the postselection probability is equal to all witness states,
then the class is equal to PP. Finally, the Merlinization does not change the
class SBQP.

 <dc:title>On application of OMP and CoSaMP algorithms for DOA estimation problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Remarkable properties of Compressed sensing (CS) has led researchers to
utilize it in various other fields where a solution to an underdetermined
system of linear equations is needed. One such application is in the area of
array signal processing e.g. in signal denoising and Direction of Arrival (DOA)
estimation. From the two prominent categories of CS recovery algorithms, namely
convex optimization algorithms and greedy sparse approximation algorithms, we
investigate the application of greedy sparse approximation algorithms to
estimate DOA in the uniform linear array (ULA) environment. We conduct an
empirical investigation into the behavior of the two state-of-the-art greedy
algorithms: OMP and CoSaMP. This investigation takes into account the various
scenarios such as varying degrees of noise level and coherency between the
sources. We perform simulations to demonstrate the performances of these
algorithms and give a brief analysis of the results.

 <dc:description>  Learning how to generate descriptions of images or videos received major
interest both in the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
communities. While a few works have proposed to learn a grounding during the
generation process in an unsupervised way (via an attention mechanism), it
remains unclear how good the quality of the grounding is and whether it
benefits the description quality. In this work we propose a movie description
model which learns to generate description and jointly ground (localize) the
mentioned characters as well as do visual co-reference resolution between pairs
of consecutive sentences/clips. We also propose to use weak localization
supervision through character mentions provided in movie descriptions to learn
the character grounding. At training time, we first learn how to localize
characters by relating their visual appearance to mentions in the descriptions
via a semi-supervised approach. We then provide this (noisy) supervision into
our description model which greatly improves its performance. Our proposed
description model improves over prior work w.r.t. generated description quality
and additionally provides grounding and local co-reference resolution. We
evaluate it on the MPII Movie Description dataset using automatic and human
evaluation measures and using our newly collected grounding and co-reference
data for characters.

relations between scientific concepts, such as synonyms and hyponyms.
Artificial neural networks have been recently explored for relation extraction.
In this work, we continue this line of work and present a system based on a
convolutional neural network to extract relations. Our model ranked first in
the SemEval-2017 task 10 (ScienceIE) for relation extraction in scientific

 <dc:description>  We use the information present in a bipartite network to detect cores of
communities of each set of the bipartite system. Cores of communities are found
by investigating statistically validated projected networks obtained using
information present in the bipartite network. Cores of communities are highly
informative and robust with respect to the presence of errors or missing
entries in the bipartite network. We assess the statistical robustness of cores
by investigating an artificial benchmark network, the co-authorship network,
and the actor-movie network. The accuracy and precision of the partition
obtained with respect to the reference partition are measured in terms of the
adjusted Rand index and of the adjusted Wallace index respectively. The
detection of cores is highly precise although the accuracy of the methodology
can be limited in some cases.

 <dc:title>Distributed Hypothesis Testing Over Noisy Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A distributed binary hypothesis testing problem, in which multiple observers
transmit their observations to a detector over noisy channels, is studied.
Given its own side information, the goal of the detector is to decide between
two hypotheses for the joint distribution of the data. Single-letter upper and
lower bounds on the optimal type 2 error exponent (T2-EE), when the type 1
error probability vanishes with the block-length are obtained. These bounds
coincide and characterize the optimal T2-EE when only a single helper is
involved. Our result shows that the optimal T2-EE depends on the marginal
distributions of the data and the channels rather than their joint
distribution. However, an operational separation between HT and channel coding
does not hold, and the optimal T2-EE is achieved by generating channel inputs
correlated with observed data.

 <dc:title>RefDiff: Detecting Refactorings in Version Histories</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Refactoring is a well-known technique that is widely adopted by software
engineers to improve the design and enable the evolution of a system. Knowing
which refactoring operations were applied in a code change is a valuable
information to understand software evolution, adapt software components, merge
code changes, and other applications. In this paper, we present RefDiff, an
automated approach that identifies refactorings performed between two code
revisions in a git repository. RefDiff employs a combination of heuristics
based on static analysis and code similarity to detect 13 well-known
refactoring types. In an evaluation using an oracle of 448 known refactoring
operations, distributed across seven Java projects, our approach achieved
precision of 100% and recall of 88%. Moreover, our evaluation suggests that
RefDiff has superior precision and recall than existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of stability and frequency regulation
of a recently proposed inverter. In this type of inverter, the DC-side
capacitor emulates the inertia of a synchronous generator. First, we remodel
the dynamics from the electrical power perspective. Second, using this model,
we show that the system is stable if connected to a constant power load, and
the frequency can be regulated by a suitable choice of the controller. Next,
and as the main focus of this paper, we analyze the stability of a network of
these inverters, and show that frequency regulation can be achieved by using an
appropriate controller design. Finally, a numerical example is provided which
illustrates the effectiveness of the method.

 <dc:description>  A recent paper suggests that Deep Neural Networks can be protected from
gradient-based adversarial perturbations by driving the network activations
into a highly saturated regime. Here we analyse such saturated networks and
show that the attacks fail due to numerical limitations in the gradient
computations. A simple stabilisation of the gradient estimates enables
successful and efficient attacks. Thus, it has yet to be shown that the
robustness observed in highly saturated networks is not simply due to numerical
limitations.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional networks have witnessed unprecedented success in various
machine learning applications. Formal understanding on what makes these
networks so successful is gradually unfolding, but for the most part there are
still significant mysteries to unravel. The inductive bias, which reflects
prior knowledge embedded in the network architecture, is one of them. In this
work, we establish a fundamental connection between the fields of quantum
physics and deep learning. We use this connection for asserting novel
theoretical observations regarding the role that the number of channels in each
layer of the convolutional network fulfills in the overall inductive bias.
Specifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep
convolutional arithmetic circuit (ConvAC) and a quantum many-body wave
function, which relies on their common underlying tensorial structure. This
facilitates the use of quantum entanglement measures as well-defined
quantifiers of a deep network's expressive ability to model intricate
correlation structures of its inputs. Most importantly, the construction of a
deep ConvAC in terms of a Tensor Network is made available. This description
enables us to carry a graph-theoretic analysis of a convolutional network, with
which we demonstrate a direct control over the inductive bias of the deep
network via its channel numbers, that are related to the min-cut in the
underlying graph. This result is relevant to any practitioner designing a
network for a specific task. We theoretically analyze ConvACs, and empirically
validate our findings on more common ConvNets which involve ReLU activations
and max pooling. Beyond the results described above, the description of a deep
convolutional network in well-defined graph-theoretic tools and the formal
connection to quantum entanglement, are two interdisciplinary bridges that are
brought forth by this work.

 <dc:description>  It is commonly believed that patterns of social ties affect individuals'
economic status. Here, we translate this concept into an operational definition
at the network level, which allows us to infer the economic wellbeing of
individuals through a measure of their location and influence in the social
network. We analyze two large-scale sources: telecommunications and financial
data of a whole country's population. Our results show that an individual's
location, measured as the optimal collective influence to the structural
integrity of the social network, is highly correlated with personal economic
status. The observed social network patterns of influence mimics the patterns
of economic inequality. For pragmatic use and validation, we carry out a
marketing campaign that shows a three-fold increase in response rate by

 <dc:title>The algorithmic randomness of quantum measurements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shahbazi, Mohammad</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is a comment on the paper &quot;Quantum Mechanics and Algorithmic
Randomness&quot; was written by Ulvi Yurtsever \cite{Yurtsever} and the briefly
explanation of the algorithmic randomness of quantum measurements results.
  There are differences between the computability of probability sources, (
which means there is an algorithm that can define the way that random process
or probability source generates the numbers ) and the algorithmic randomness of
the sequences or strings which are produced by a source. We may have the source
without a computable algorithm for that but it can produce compressible or
incompressible strings. For example, so far there is no computable algorithm
that can define the abstract meaning of randomness even the easiest one,
Bernoulli probability distribution. Historically and philosophically there many
scientist believe the existence of the algorithm for a random process is a
contradiction because in their opinion, in the definition of a random variable,
implicitly assumed that there is no reason for the happening of an event and we
just know the probabilities. There is however no need to enter into this matter
here. As in the paper mentioned, all the algorithms for simulating a random
process try to pass the statistical tests and be close to the abstract meaning
of it.

 <dc:title>Bag-of-Words Method Applied to Accelerometer Measurements for the

 <dc:description>  Accelerometer measurements are the prime type of sensor information most
think of when seeking to measure physical activity. On the market, there are
many fitness measuring devices which aim to track calories burned and steps
counted through the use of accelerometers. These measurements, though good
enough for the average consumer, are noisy and unreliable in terms of the
precision of measurement needed in a scientific setting. The contribution of
this paper is an innovative and highly accurate regression method which uses an
intermediary two-stage classification step to better direct the regression of
energy expenditure values from accelerometer counts.
  We show that through an additional unsupervised layer of intermediate feature
construction, we can leverage latent patterns within accelerometer counts to
provide better grounds for activity classification than expert-constructed
timeseries features. For this, our approach utilizes a mathematical model
originating in natural language processing, the bag-of-words model, that has in
the past years been appearing in diverse disciplines outside of the natural
language processing field such as image processing. Further emphasizing the
natural language connection to stochastics, we use a gaussian mixture model to
learn the dictionary upon which the bag-of-words model is built. Moreover, we
show that with the addition of these features, we're able to improve regression
root mean-squared error of energy expenditure by approximately 1.4 units over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Typically, every part in most coherent text has some plausible reason for its
presence, some function that it performs to the overall semantics of the text.
Rhetorical relations, e.g. contrast, cause, explanation, describe how the parts
of a text are linked to each other. Knowledge about this socalled discourse
structure has been applied successfully to several natural language processing
tasks. This work studies the use of rhetorical relations for Information
Retrieval (IR): Is there a correlation between certain rhetorical relations and
retrieval performance? Can knowledge about a document's rhetorical relations be
useful to IR? We present a language model modification that considers
rhetorical relations when estimating the relevance of a document to a query.
Empirical evaluation of different versions of our model on TREC settings shows
that certain rhetorical relations can benefit retrieval effectiveness notably
(&gt; 10% in mean average precision over a state-of-the-art baseline).

 <dc:title>Preliminary Experiments using Subjective Logic for the

 <dc:description>  According to the principle of polyrepresentation, retrieval accuracy may
improve through the combination of multiple and diverse information object
representations about e.g. the context of the user, the information sought, or
the retrieval system. Recently, the principle of polyrepresentation was
mathematically expressed using subjective logic, where the potential
suitability of each representation for improving retrieval performance was
formalised through degrees of belief and uncertainty. No experimental evidence
or practical application has so far validated this model. We extend the work of
Lioma et al. (2010), by providing a practical application and analysis of the
model. We show how to map the abstract notions of belief and uncertainty to
real-life evidence drawn from a retrieval dataset. We also show how to estimate
two different types of polyrepresentation assuming either (a) independence or
(b) dependence between the information objects that are combined. We focus on
the polyrepresentation of different types of context relating to user
information needs (i.e. work task, user background knowledge, ideal answer) and
show that the subjective logic model can predict their optimal combination
prior and independently to the retrieval process.

have attracted significant interest, but have been used for few real-world
computations. Machine learning has been identified as an area where quantum
annealing may be useful. Here, we show that the D-Wave 2X can be effectively
used as part of an unsupervised machine learning method. This method can be
used to analyze large datasets. The D-Wave only limits the number of features
that can be extracted from the dataset. We apply this method to learn the
features from a set of facial images.

 <dc:title>A Subjective Logic Formalisation of the Principle of Polyrepresentation

 <dc:description>  Interactive Information Retrieval refers to the branch of Information
Retrieval that considers the retrieval process with respect to a wide range of
contexts, which may affect the user's information seeking experience. The
identification and representation of such contexts has been the object of the
principle of Polyrepresentation, a theoretical framework for reasoning about
different representations arising from interactive information retrieval in a
given context. Although the principle of Polyrepresentation has received
attention from many researchers, not much empirical work has been done based on
it. One reason may be that it has not yet been formalised mathematically. In
this paper we propose an up-to-date and exible mathematical formalisation of
the principle of Polyrepresentation for information needs. Specifically, we
apply Subjective Logic to model different representations of information needs
as beliefs marked by degrees of uncertainty. We combine such beliefs using
different logical operators, and we discuss these combinations with respect to
different retrieval scenarios and situations. A formal model is introduced and
discussed, with illustrative applications to the modelling of information
needs.

 <dc:title>Study on a Low Complexity ECG Compression Scheme with Multiple Sensors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Pengda</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The industry of wearable remote health monitoring system keeps growing. In
the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, Electrocardiography~(ECG) waveform is
one of the major tools which is thus widely taken as the monitoring objective.
For the purpose of reducing bit expenditure in the monitoring systems, we study
the compression of ECG signal and propose a new compressor in low complexity.
Different from the traditional ECG compressors, most of which are built on a
single sensor, our compression scheme is based on multiple ECG sensors. The
multi-sensor based compression scheme is able to provide more accurate sensing
results. Besides the investigation into the structure of the compressor, we
also jointly optimize the period and the bit number per sample in the
transmission of ECG signal. Experiments are performed on records in MIT-BIH
Arrhythmis database and European ST-T database. Experimental results show that
our method outperforms conventional ones with respect to ECG reconstruction
accuracy at the same bit rate consumption

 <dc:title>Part of Speech Based Term Weighting for Information Retrieval</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automatic language processing tools typically assign to terms so-called
weights corresponding to the contribution of terms to information content.
Traditionally, term weights are computed from lexical statistics, e.g., term
frequencies. We propose a new type of term weight that is computed from part of
speech (POS) n-gram statistics. The proposed POS-based term weight represents
how informative a term is in general, based on the POS contexts in which it
generally occurs in language. We suggest five different computations of
POS-based term weights by extending existing statistical approximations of term
information measures. We apply these POS-based term weights to information
retrieval, by integrating them into the model that matches documents to
queries. Experiments with two TREC collections and 300 queries, using TF-IDF &amp;
BM25 as baselines, show that integrating our POS-based term weights to
retrieval always leads to gains (up to +33.7% from the baseline). Additional
experiments with a different retrieval model as baseline (Language Model with
Dirichlet priors smoothing) and our best performing POS-based term weight, show
retrieval gains always and consistently across the whole smoothing range of the
baseline.

 <dc:description>  End-to-end training of deep learning-based models allows for implicit
learning of intermediate representations based on the final task loss. However,
the end-to-end approach ignores the useful domain knowledge encoded in explicit
intermediate-level supervision. We hypothesize that using intermediate
representations as auxiliary supervision at lower levels of deep networks may
be a good way of combining the advantages of end-to-end training and more
traditional pipeline approaches. We present experiments on conversational
speech recognition where we use lower-level tasks, such as phoneme recognition,
in a multitask training approach with an encoder-decoder model for direct
character transcription. We compare multiple types of lower-level tasks and
analyze the effects of the auxiliary tasks. Our results on the Switchboard
corpus show that this approach improves recognition accuracy over a standard
encoder-decoder model on the Eval2000 test set.

 <dc:description>  In the pattern matching with $d$ wildcards problem one is given a text $T$ of
length $n$ and a pattern $P$ of length $m$ that contains $d$ wildcard
characters, each denoted by a special symbol $'?'$. A wildcard character
matches any other character. The goal is to establish for each $m$-length
substring of $T$ whether it matches $P$. In the streaming model variant of the
pattern matching with $d$ wildcards problem the text $T$ arrives one character
at a time and the goal is to report, before the next character arrives, if the
last $m$ characters match $P$ while using only $o(m)$ words of space.
  In this paper we introduce two new algorithms for the $d$ wildcard pattern
matching problem in the streaming model. The first is a randomized Monte Carlo
algorithm that is parameterized by a constant $0\leq \delta \leq 1$. This
algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(d^{1-\delta})$ amortized time per character and
$\tilde{O}(d^{1+\delta})$ words of space. The second algorithm, which is used
as a black box in the first algorithm, is a randomized Monte Carlo algorithm
which uses $O(d+\log m)$ worst-case time per character and $O(d\log m)$ words
of space.

 <dc:description>  It is known that greedy methods perform well for maximizing monotone
submodular functions. At the same time, such methods perform poorly in the face
of non-monotonicity. In this paper, we show - arguably, surprisingly - that
invoking the classical greedy algorithm $O(\sqrt{k})$-times leads to the
(currently) fastest deterministic algorithm, called Repeated Greedy, for
maximizing a general submodular function subject to $k$-independent system
constraints. Repeated Greedy achieves $(1 + O(1/\sqrt{k}))k$ approximation
using $O(nr\sqrt{k})$ function evaluations (here, $n$ and $r$ denote the size
of the ground set and the maximum size of a feasible solution, respectively).
We then show that by a careful sampling procedure, we can run the greedy
algorithm only once and obtain the (currently) fastest randomized algorithm,
called Sample Greedy, for maximizing a submodular function subject to
$k$-extendible system constraints (a subclass of $k$-independent system
constrains). Sample Greedy achieves $(k + 3)$-approximation with only $O(nr/k)$
function evaluations. Finally, we derive an almost matching lower bound, and
show that no polynomial time algorithm can have an approximation ratio smaller
than $ k + 1/2 - \varepsilon$. To further support our theoretical results, we
compare the performance of Repeated Greedy and Sample Greedy with prior art in
a concrete application (movie recommendation). We consistently observe that
while Sample Greedy achieves practically the same utility as the best baseline,
it performs at least two orders of magnitude faster.

 <dc:description>  Pre-aspiration is defined as the period of glottal friction occurring in
sequences of vocalic/consonantal sonorants and phonetically voiceless
obstruents. We propose two machine learning methods for automatic measurement
of pre-aspiration duration: a feedforward neural network, which works at the
frame level; and a structured prediction model, which relies on manually
designed feature functions, and works at the segment level. The input for both
algorithms is a speech signal of an arbitrary length containing a single
obstruent, and the output is a pair of times which constitutes the
pre-aspiration boundaries. We train both models on a set of manually annotated
examples. Results suggest that the structured model is superior to the
frame-based model as it yields higher accuracy in predicting the boundaries and
generalizes to new speakers and new languages. Finally, we demonstrate the
applicability of our structured prediction algorithm by replicating linguistic
analysis of pre-aspiration in Aberystwyth English with high correlation.

 <dc:description>  We prove a complexity classification theorem that divides the six-vertex
model on graphs into exactly three types. For every setting of the parameters
of the model, the computation of the partition function is precisely: Either
(1) solvable in polynomial time for every graph, or (2) #P-hard for general
graphs but solvable in polynomial time for planar graphs, or (3) #P-hard even
for planar graphs. The classification has an explicit criterion. In addition to
matchgates and matchgates-transformable signatures, we discover previously
unknown families of planar-tractable partition functions by a non-local
connection to #CSP, defined in terms of a &quot;loop space&quot;. For the proof of
#P-hardness, we introduce the use of M\&quot;obius transformations as a powerful new
tool to prove that certain complexity reductions succeed in polynomial time.

 <dc:title>The impact of random actions on opinion dynamics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Opinion dynamics have fascinated researchers for centuries. The ability of
societies to learn as well as the emergence of irrational {\it herding} are
equally evident. The simplest example is that of agents that have to determine
a binary action, under peer pressure coming from the decisions observed. By
modifying several popular models for opinion dynamics so that agents
internalize actions rather than smooth estimates of what other people think, we
are able to prove that almost surely the actions final outcome remains random,
even though actions can be consensual or polarized depending on the model. This
is a theoretical confirmation that the mechanism that leads to the emergence of
irrational herding behavior lies in the loss of nuanced information regarding
the privately held beliefs behind the individuals decisions.

 <dc:description>  Artificial neural networks have been successfully applied to a variety of
machine learning tasks, including image recognition, semantic segmentation, and
machine translation. However, few studies fully investigated ensembles of
artificial neural networks. In this work, we investigated multiple widely used
ensemble methods, including unweighted averaging, majority voting, the Bayes
Optimal Classifier, and the (discrete) Super Learner, for image recognition
tasks, with deep neural networks as candidate algorithms. We designed several
experiments, with the candidate algorithms being the same network structure
with different model checkpoints within a single training process, networks
with same structure but trained multiple times stochastically, and networks
with different structure. In addition, we further studied the over-confidence
phenomenon of the neural networks, as well as its impact on the ensemble
methods. Across all of our experiments, the Super Learner achieved best
performance among all the ensemble methods in this study.

 <dc:description>  The design of good heuristics or approximation algorithms for NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems often requires significant specialized
knowledge and trial-and-error. Can we automate this challenging, tedious
process, and learn the algorithms instead? In many real-world applications, it
is typically the case that the same optimization problem is solved again and
again on a regular basis, maintaining the same problem structure but differing
in the data. This provides an opportunity for learning heuristic algorithms
that exploit the structure of such recurring problems. In this paper, we
propose a unique combination of reinforcement learning and graph embedding to
address this challenge. The learned greedy policy behaves like a meta-algorithm
that incrementally constructs a solution, and the action is determined by the
output of a graph embedding network capturing the current state of the
solution. We show our framework can be applied to a diverse range of
optimization problems over graphs, and learns effective algorithms for the
Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Cut and Traveling Salesman problems.

 <dc:description>  Convolution with Green's function of a differential operator appears in a lot
of applications e.g. Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. Algorithms for
computing such are usually non-trivial and require non-uniform mesh. However,
recently Vico, Greengard and Ferrando developed method for computing
convolution with smooth functions with compact support with spectral accuracy,
requiring nothing more than Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Their approach is
very suitable for the low-rank tensor implementation which we develop using
Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) decomposition.

 <dc:description>  The analysis of industrial processes, modelled as descriptor systems, is
often computationally hard due to the presence of both algebraic couplings and
difference equations of high order. In this paper, we introduce a control
refinement notion for these descriptor systems that enables analysis and
control design over related reduced-order systems. Utilising the behavioural
framework, we extend upon the standard hierarchical control refinement for
ordinary systems and allow for algebraic couplings inherent to descriptor
systems.

 <dc:title>Constructive Stabilization and Pole Placement by Arbitrary Decentralized
  Architectures</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alavian, Alborz</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rotkowitz, Michael C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A seminal result in decentralized control is the development of fixed modes
by Wang and Davison in 1973 - that plant modes which cannot be moved with a
static decentralized controller cannot be moved by a dynamic one either, and
that the other modes which can be moved can be shifted to any chosen location
with arbitrary precision. These results were developed for perfectly
decentralized, or block diagonal, information structure, where each control
input may only depend on a single corresponding measurement. Furthermore, the
results were claimed after a preliminary step was demonstrated, omitting a
rigorous induction for each of these results, and the remaining task is
nontrivial.
  In this paper, we consider fixed modes for arbitrary information structures,
where certain control inputs may depend on some measurements but not others. We
provide a comprehensive proof that the modes which cannot be altered by a
static controller with the given structure cannot be moved by a dynamic one
either, and that the modes which can be altered by a static controller with the
given structure can be moved by a dynamic one to any chosen location with
arbitrary precision, thus generalizing and solidifying Wang and Davison's
results.
  This shows that a system can be stabilized by a linear time-invariant
controller with the given information structure as long as all of the modes
which are fixed with respect to that structure are in the left half-plane; an
algorithm for synthesizing such a stabilizing decentralized controller is then
distilled from the proof.

 <dc:description>  Design flows use graph partitioning both as a precursor to place and route
for single devices, and to divide netlists or task graphs among multiple
devices. Partitioners have accommodated FPGA heterogeneity via multi-resource
constraints, but have not yet exploited the corresponding ability to implement
some computations in multiple ways (e.g., LUTs vs. DSP blocks), which could
enable a superior solution. This paper introduces multi-personality graph
partitioning, which incorporates aspects of resource mapping into partitioning.
We present a modified multi-level KLFM partitioning algorithm that also
performs heterogeneous resource mapping for nodes with multiple potential
implementations (multiple personalities). We evaluate several variants of our
multi-personality FPGA circuit partitioner using 21 circuits and benchmark
graphs, and show that dynamic resource mapping improves cut size on average by
27% over static mapping for these circuits. We further show that it improves
deviation from target resource utilizations by 50% over post-partitioning
resource mapping.

 <dc:description>  Let $p,q$ be distinct primes satisfying $\mathrm{gcd}(p-1,q-1)=d$ and let
$D_i$, $i=0,1,\cdots,d-1$, be Whiteman's generalized cyclotomic classes with
$Z_{pq}^{\ast}=\cup_{i=0}^{d-1}D_i$. In this paper, we give the values of Gauss
periods based on the generalized cyclotomic sets
$D_0^{\ast}=\sum_{i=0}^{\frac{d}{2}-1}D_{2i}$ and
$D_1^{\ast}=\sum_{i=0}^{\frac{d}{2}-1}D_{2i+1}$. As an application, we
determine a lower bound on the 2-adic complexity of modified Jacobi sequence.
Our result shows that the 2-adic complexity of modified Jacobi sequence is at
least $pq-p-q-1$ with period $N=pq$. This indicates that the 2-adic complexity
of modified Jacobi sequence is large enough to resist the attack of the
rational approximation algorithm (RAA) for feedback with carry shift registers
(FCSRs).

 <dc:description>  Labeled sequence transduction is a task of transforming one sequence into
another sequence that satisfies desiderata specified by a set of labels. In
this paper we propose multi-space variational encoder-decoders, a new model for
labeled sequence transduction with semi-supervised learning. The generative
model can use neural networks to handle both discrete and continuous latent
variables to exploit various features of data. Experiments show that our model
provides not only a powerful supervised framework but also can effectively take
advantage of the unlabeled data. On the SIGMORPHON morphological inflection
benchmark, our model outperforms single-model state-of-art results by a large
margin for the majority of languages.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of parsing natural language descriptions into source
code written in a general-purpose programming language like Python. Existing
data-driven methods treat this problem as a language generation task without
considering the underlying syntax of the target programming language. Informed
by previous work in semantic parsing, in this paper we propose a novel neural
architecture powered by a grammar model to explicitly capture the target syntax
as prior knowledge. Experiments find this an effective way to scale up to
generation of complex programs from natural language descriptions, achieving
state-of-the-art results that well outperform previous code generation and
semantic parsing approaches.

 <dc:description>  We propose an L-BFGS optimization algorithm on Riemannian manifolds using
minibatched stochastic variance reduction techniques for fast convergence with
constant step sizes, without resorting to linesearch methods designed to
satisfy Wolfe conditions. We provide a new convergence proof for strongly
convex functions without using curvature conditions on the manifold, as well as
a convergence discussion for nonconvex functions. We discuss a couple of ways
to obtain the correction pairs used to calculate the product of the gradient
with the inverse Hessian, and empirically demonstrate their use in synthetic
experiments on computation of Karcher means for symmetric positive definite
matrices and leading eigenvalues of large scale data matrices. We compare our
method to VR-PCA for the latter experiment, along with Riemannian SVRG for both
cases, and show strong convergence results for a range of datasets.

 <dc:description>  We present the design and implementation of a custom discrete optimization
technique for building rule lists over a categorical feature space. Our
algorithm produces rule lists with optimal training performance, according to
the regularized empirical risk, with a certificate of optimality. By leveraging
algorithmic bounds, efficient data structures, and computational reuse, we
achieve several orders of magnitude speedup in time and a massive reduction of
memory consumption. We demonstrate that our approach produces optimal rule
lists on practical problems in seconds. Our results indicate that it is
possible to construct optimal sparse rule lists that are approximately as
accurate as the COMPAS proprietary risk prediction tool on data from Broward
County, Florida, but that are completely interpretable. This framework is a
novel alternative to CART and other decision tree methods for interpretable
modeling.

 <dc:description>  Despite the wide use of machine learning in adversarial settings including
computer security, recent studies have demonstrated vulnerabilities to evasion
attacks---carefully crafted adversarial samples that closely resemble
legitimate instances, but cause misclassification. In this paper, we examine
the adequacy of the leading approach to generating adversarial samples---the
gradient descent approach. In particular (1) we perform extensive experiments
on three datasets, MNIST, USPS and Spambase, in order to analyse the
effectiveness of the gradient-descent method against non-linear support vector
machines, and conclude that carefully reduced kernel smoothness can
significantly increase robustness to the attack; (2) we demonstrate that
separated inter-class support vectors lead to more secure models, and propose a
quantity similar to margin that can efficiently predict potential
susceptibility to gradient-descent attacks, before the attack is launched; and
(3) we design a new adversarial sample construction algorithm based on
optimising the multiplicative ratio of class decision functions.

 <dc:description>  Domain Adaptation is an actively researched problem in Computer Vision. In
this work, we propose an approach that leverages unsupervised data to bring the
source and target distributions closer in a learned joint feature space. We
accomplish this by inducing a symbiotic relationship between the learned
embedding and a generative adversarial network. This is in contrast to methods
which use the adversarial framework for realistic data generation and
retraining deep models with such data. We demonstrate the strength and
generality of our approach by performing experiments on three different tasks
with varying levels of difficulty: (1) Digit classification (MNIST, SVHN and
USPS datasets) (2) Object recognition using OFFICE dataset and (3) Domain
adaptation from synthetic to real data. Our method achieves state-of-the art
performance in most experimental settings and by far the only GAN-based method
that has been shown to work well across different datasets such as OFFICE and
DIGITS.

 <dc:description>  Online social media have become an integral part of our social beings.
Analyzing conversations in social media platforms can lead to complex
probabilistic models to understand social interaction networks. In this paper,
we present a modeling approach for characterizing social interaction networks
by jointly inferring user communities and interests based on social media
interactions. We present several pattern inference models: i) Interest pattern
model (IPM) captures population level interaction topics, ii) User interest
pattern model (UIPM) captures user specific interaction topics, and iii)
Community interest pattern model (CIPM) captures both community structures and
user interests. We test our methods on Twitter data collected from Purdue
University community. From our model results, we observe the interaction topics
and communities related to two big events within Purdue University community,
namely Purdue Day of Giving and Senator Bernie Sanders' visit to Purdue
University as part of Indiana Primary Election 2016. Constructing social
interaction networks based on user interactions accounts for the similarity of
users' interactions on various topics of interest and indicates their community
belonging further beyond connectivity. We observed that the
degree-distributions of such networks follow power-law that is indicative of
the existence of fewer nodes in the network with higher levels of interactions,
and many other nodes with less interactions. We also discuss the application of
such networks as a useful tool to effectively disseminate specific information
to the target audience towards planning any large-scale events and demonstrate
how to single out specific nodes in a given community by running network
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Most popular deep learning based models for action recognition are designed
to generate separate predictions within their short temporal windows, which are
often aggregated by heuristic means to assign an action label to the full video
segment. Given that not all frames from a video characterize the underlying
action, pooling schemes that impose equal importance to all frames might be
unfavorable. In an attempt towards tackling this challenge, we propose a novel
pooling scheme, dubbed SVM pooling, based on the notion that among the bag of
features generated by a CNN on all temporal windows, there is at least one
feature that characterizes the action. To this end, we learn a decision
hyperplane that separates this unknown yet useful feature from the rest.
Applying multiple instance learning in an SVM setup, we use the parameters of
this separating hyperplane as a descriptor for the video. Since these
parameters are directly related to the support vectors in a max-margin
framework, they serve as robust representations for pooling of the CNN
features. We devise a joint optimization objective and an efficient solver that
learns these hyperplanes per video and the corresponding action classifiers
over the hyperplanes. Showcased experiments on the standard HMDB and UCF101
datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification (ReID) is an important task in wide area video
surveillance which focuses on identifying people across different cameras.
Recently, deep learning networks with a triplet loss become a common framework
for person ReID. However, the triplet loss pays main attentions on obtaining
correct orders on the training set. It still suffers from a weaker
generalization capability from the training set to the testing set, thus
resulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we design a quadruplet loss,
which can lead to the model output with a larger inter-class variation and a
smaller intra-class variation compared to the triplet loss. As a result, our
model has a better generalization ability and can achieve a higher performance
on the testing set. In particular, a quadruplet deep network using a
margin-based online hard negative mining is proposed based on the quadruplet
loss for the person ReID. In extensive experiments, the proposed network
outperforms most of the state-of-the-art algorithms on representative datasets
which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Consider a single server queue serving a multiclass population. Some popular
scheduling policies for such a system (and of interest in this paper) are the
discriminatory processor sharing (DPS), discriminatory random order service
(DROS), generalized processor sharing (GPS) and weighted fair queueing (WFQ).
The aim of this paper is to show a certain equivalence between these scheduling
policies for the special case when the multiclass population have identical and
exponential service requirements. In fact, we show the equivalence between two
broader classes of policies that generalize the above mentioned four policies.
We specifically show that the sojourn time distribution for a customer of a
particular class in a system with the DPS (GPS) scheduling policy is a constant
multiple of the waiting time distribution of a customer of the same class in a
system with the DROS (respectively WFQ) policy.

 <dc:description>  The notion of entropy is shared between statistics and thermodynamics, and is
fundamental to both disciplines. This makes statistical problems particularly
suitable for reaction network implementations. In this paper we show how to
perform a statistical operation known as Information Projection or E projection
with stochastic mass-action kinetics. Our scheme encodes desired conditional
distributions as the equilibrium distributions of reaction systems. To our
knowledge this is a first scheme to exploit the inherent stochasticity of
reaction networks for information processing. We apply this to the problem of
an artificial cell trying to infer its environment from partial observations.

 <dc:description>  Schaefer introduced a framework for generalized satisfiability problems on
the Boolean domain and characterized the computational complexity of such
problems. We investigate an algebraization of Schaefer's framework in which the
Fourier transform is used to represent constraints by multilinear polynomials
in a unique way. The polynomial representation of constraints gives rise to a
relaxation of the notion of satisfiability in which the values to variables are
linear operators on some Hilbert space. For the case of constraints given by a
system of linear equations over the two-element field, this relaxation has
received considerable attention in the foundations of quantum mechanics, where
such constructions as the Mermin-Peres magic square show that there are systems
that have no solutions in the Boolean domain, but have solutions via operator
assignments on some finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain a complete
characterization of the classes of Boolean relations for which there is a gap
between satisfiability in the Boolean domain and the relaxation of
satisfiability via operator assignments. To establish our main result, we adapt
the notion of primitive-positive definability (pp-definability) to our setting,
a notion that has been used extensively in the study of constraint satisfaction
problems. Here, we show that pp-definability gives rise to gadget reductions
that preserve satisfiability gaps. We also present several additional
applications of this method. In particular and perhaps surprisingly, we show
that the relaxed notion of pp-definability in which the quantified variables
are allowed to range over operator assignments gives no additional expressive
power in defining Boolean relations.

 <dc:title>Object-Part Attention Model for Fine-grained Image Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Fine-grained image classification is to recognize hundreds of subcategories
belonging to the same basic-level category, such as 200 subcategories belonging
to the bird, which is highly challenging due to large variance in the same
subcategory and small variance among different subcategories. Existing methods
generally first locate the objects or parts and then discriminate which
subcategory the image belongs to. However, they mainly have two limitations:
(1) Relying on object or part annotations which are heavily labor consuming.
(2) Ignoring the spatial relationships between the object and its parts as well
as among these parts, both of which are significantly helpful for finding
discriminative parts. Therefore, this paper proposes the object-part attention
model (OPAM) for weakly supervised fine-grained image classification, and the
main novelties are: (1) Object-part attention model integrates two level
attentions: object-level attention localizes objects of images, and part-level
attention selects discriminative parts of object. Both are jointly employed to
learn multi-view and multi-scale features to enhance their mutual promotions.
(2) Object-part spatial constraint model combines two spatial constraints:
object spatial constraint ensures selected parts highly representative, and
part spatial constraint eliminates redundancy and enhances discrimination of
selected parts. Both are jointly employed to exploit the subtle and local
differences for distinguishing the subcategories. Importantly, neither object
nor part annotations are used in our proposed approach, which avoids the heavy
labor consumption of labeling. Comparing with more than 10 state-of-the-art
methods on 4 widely-used datasets, our OPAM approach achieves the best
performance.

 <dc:description>  Recent works have shown that it is possible to automatically predict
intrinsic image properties like memorability. In this paper, we take a step
forward addressing the question: &quot;Can we make an image more memorable?&quot;.
Methods for automatically increasing image memorability would have an impact in
many application fields like education, gaming or advertising. Our work is
inspired by the popular editing-by-applying-filters paradigm adopted in photo
editing applications, like Instagram and Prisma. In this context, the problem
of increasing image memorability maps to that of retrieving &quot;memorabilizing&quot;
filters or style &quot;seeds&quot;. Still, users generally have to go through most of the
available filters before finding the desired solution, thus turning the editing
process into a resource and time consuming task. In this work, we show that it
is possible to automatically retrieve the best style seeds for a given image,
thus remarkably reducing the number of human attempts needed to find a good
match. Our approach leverages from recent advances in the field of image
synthesis and adopts a deep architecture for generating a memorable picture
from a given input image and a style seed. Importantly, to automatically select
the best style a novel learning-based solution, also relying on deep models, is
proposed. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on publicly available
benchmarks, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach for
generating memorable images through automatic style seed selection

 <dc:description>  MRA (Multilingual Report Annotator) is a web application that translates
Radiology text and annotates it with RadLex terms. Its goal is to explore the
solution of translating non-English Radiology reports as a way to solve the
problem of most of the Text Mining tools being developed for English. In this
brief paper we explain the language barrier problem and shortly describe the
application. MRA can be found at https://github.com/lasigeBioTM/MRA .

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel approach to improve unsupervised hashing. Specifically,
we propose a very efficient embedding method: Gaussian Mixture Model embedding
(Gemb). The proposed method, using Gaussian Mixture Model, embeds feature
vector into a low-dimensional vector and, simultaneously, enhances the
discriminative property of features before passing them into hashing. Our
experiment shows that the proposed method boosts the hashing performance of
many state-of-the-art, e.g. Binary Autoencoder (BA) [1], Iterative Quantization
(ITQ) [2], in standard evaluation metrics for the three main benchmark
datasets.

 <dc:title>A Multi-view Context-aware Approach to Android Malware Detection and

 <dc:description>  Existing Android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such
as security sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and
information flows in conjunction with Machine Learning classifiers to achieve
accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic
perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and
limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks
but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the
existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the
aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority
of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified
framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing
comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale
is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in
every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.
  MKLDroid uses a graph kernel to capture structural and contextual information
from apps' dependency graphs and identify malice code patterns in each view.
Subsequently, it employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to find a weighted
combination of the views which yields the best detection accuracy. Besides
multi-view learning, MKLDroid's unique and salient trait is its ability to
locate fine-grained malice code portions in dependency graphs (e.g.,
methods/classes). Through our large-scale experiments on several datasets
(incl. wild apps), we demonstrate that MKLDroid outperforms three
state-of-the-art techniques consistently, in terms of accuracy while
maintaining comparable efficiency. In our malicious code localisation
experiments on a dataset of repackaged malware, MKLDroid was able to identify
all the malice classes with 94% average recall.

 <dc:description>  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted significant interest recently
in wireless communication due to their high maneuverability, flexible
deployment, and low cost. This paper studies a UAV-enabled wireless network
where the UAV is employed as an aerial mobile base station (BS) to serve a
group of users on the ground. To achieve fair performance among users, we
maximize the minimum throughput over all ground users by jointly optimizing the
multiuser communication scheduling and UAV trajectory over a finite horizon.
The formulated problem is shown to be a mixed integer non-convex optimization
problem that is difficult to solve in general. We thus propose an efficient
iterative algorithm by applying the block coordinate descent and successive
convex optimization techniques, which is guaranteed to converge to at least a
locally optimal solution. To achieve fast convergence and stable throughput, we
further propose a low-complexity initialization scheme for the UAV trajectory
design based on the simple circular trajectory. Extensive simulation results
are provided which show significant throughput gains of the proposed design as
compared to other benchmark schemes.

 <dc:description>  In any knowledge discovery process the value of extracted knowledge is
directly related to the quality of the data used. Big Data problems, generated
by massive growth in the scale of data observed in recent years, also follow
the same dictate. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of
noise, particularly in classification problems, where label noise refers to the
incorrect labeling of training instances, and is known to be a very disruptive
feature of data. However, in this Big Data era, the massive growth in the scale
of the data poses a challenge to traditional proposals created to tackle noise,
as they have difficulties coping with such a large amount of data. New
algorithms need to be proposed to treat the noise in Big Data problems,
providing high quality and clean data, also known as Smart Data. In this paper,
two Big Data preprocessing approaches to remove noisy examples are proposed: an
homogeneous ensemble and an heterogeneous ensemble filter, with special
emphasis in their scalability and performance traits. The obtained results show
that these proposals enable the practitioner to efficiently obtain a Smart
Dataset from any Big Data classification problem.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Numerus works that study the spread of information in social networks include
a spreading mechanism in which a set of nodes is initially infected (i.e.
seeded), followed by a viral process, which spontaneously spread the message
through the nodes of the network. These models are used to describe the spread
of rumors as well as the spread of new products and services. In reality
however, it is quite rare that a product or service spreads through a social
networks solely by viral forces. It is more common, that the spreader would
invests a continuous active effort of its sales representatives in order to
enhance the spread. The Latent Viral Marketing Model is a spreading model that
fits this reality. Along the description of the model, the paper continues and
proposes a simple Scheduling of Seeding heuristics, which recommends the node
to seed at each period. A large study of empirical simulations shows that under
a wide range of realistic initial conditions, the Scheduling Seeding method
improves a product adoption rate by 29%-94% in comparison to existing
state-of-the-art seeding methods.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the geometry of optimal memoryless time independent decision
making in relation to the amount of information that the acting agent has about
the state of the system. We show that the expected long term reward, discounted
or per time step, is maximized by policies that randomize among at most $k$
actions whenever at most $k$ world states are consistent with the agent's
observation. Moreover, we show that the expected reward per time step can be
studied in terms of the expected discounted reward. Our main tool is a
geometric version of the policy improvement lemma, which identifies a
polyhedral cone of policy changes in which the state value function increases
for all states.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Living in the Information Age allows almost everyone have access to a large
amount of information and options to choose from in order to fulfill their
needs. In many cases, the amount of information available and the rate of
change may hide the optimal and truly desired solution. This reveals the need
of a mechanism that will highlight the best options to choose among every
possible scenario. Based on this the skyline query was proposed which is a
decision support mechanism, that retrieves the valuefor- money options of a
dataset by identifying the objects that present the optimal combination of the
characteristics of the dataset. This paper surveys the state-of-the-art
techniques for skyline query processing, the numerous variations of the initial
algorithm that were proposed to solve similar problems and the
application-specific approaches that were developed to provide a solution
efficiently in each case. Aditionally in each section a taxonomy is outlined
along with the key aspects of each algorithm and its relation to previous
studies.

 <dc:description>  Automatic question generation aims to generate questions from a text passage
where the generated questions can be answered by certain sub-spans of the given
passage. Traditional methods mainly use rigid heuristic rules to transform a
sentence into related questions. In this work, we propose to apply the neural
encoder-decoder model to generate meaningful and diverse questions from natural
language sentences. The encoder reads the input text and the answer position,
to produce an answer-aware input representation, which is fed to the decoder to
generate an answer focused question. We conduct a preliminary study on neural
question generation from text with the SQuAD dataset, and the experiment
results show that our method can produce fluent and diverse questions.

 <dc:description>  A systematic design of adaptive waveform for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)
has recently been proposed and shown through simulations to lead to significant
performance benefits compared to traditional non-adaptive and heuristic
waveforms. In this study, we design the first prototype of a closed-loop
wireless power transfer system with adaptive waveform optimization based on
Channel State Information acquisition. The prototype consists of three
important blocks, namely the channel estimator, the waveform optimizer, and the
energy harvester. Software Defined Radio (SDR) prototyping tools are used to
implement a wireless power transmitter and a channel estimator, and a voltage
doubler rectenna is designed to work as an energy harvester. A channel adaptive
waveform with 8 sinewaves is shown through experiments to improve the average
harvested DC power at the rectenna output by 9.8% to 36.8% over a non-adaptive
design with the same number of sinewaves.

 <dc:description>  As part of Smart Cities initiatives, national, regional and local governments
all over the globe are under the mandate of being more open regarding how they
share their data. Under this mandate, many of these governments are publishing
data under the umbrella of open government data, which includes measurement
data from city-wide sensor networks. Furthermore, many of these data are
published in so-called data portals as documents that may be spreadsheets,
comma-separated value (CSV) data files, or plain documents in PDF or Word
documents. The sharing of these documents may be a convenient way for the data
provider to convey and publish data but it is not the ideal way for data
consumers to reuse the data. For example, the problems of reusing the data may
range from difficulty opening a document that is provided in any format that is
not plain text, to the actual problem of understanding the meaning of each
piece of knowledge inside of the document. Our proposal tackles those
challenges by identifying metadata that has been regarded to be relevant for
measurement data and providing a schema for this metadata. We further leverage
the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology (HASNetO) to build an architecture for
data collected in urban environments. We discuss the use of HASNetO and the
supporting infrastructure to manage both data and metadata in support of the
City of Fortaleza, a large metropolitan area in Brazil.

 <dc:description>  Significant efforts have been made to understand and document knowledge
related to scientific measurements. Many of those efforts resulted in one or
more high-quality ontologies that describe some aspects of scientific
measurements, but not in a comprehensive and coherently integrated manner. For
instance, we note that many of these high-quality ontologies are not properly
aligned, and more challenging, that they have different and often conflicting
concepts and approaches for encoding knowledge about empirical measurements. As
a result of this lack of an integrated view, it is often challenging for
scientists to determine whether any two scientific measurements were taken in
semantically compatible manners, thus making it difficult to decide whether
measurements should be analyzed in combination or not. In this paper, we
present the Human-Aware Sensor Network Ontology that is a comprehensive
alignment and integration of a sensing infrastructure ontology and a provenance
ontology. HASNetO has been under development for more than one year, and has
been reviewed, shared and used by multiple scientific communities. The ontology
has been in use to support the data management of a number of large-scale
ecological monitoring activities (observations) and empirical experiments.

 <dc:title>Higher-Order Minimum Cost Lifted Multicuts for Motion Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Keuper, Margret</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most state-of-the-art motion segmentation algorithms draw their potential
from modeling motion differences of local entities such as point trajectories
in terms of pairwise potentials in graphical models. Inference in instances of
minimum cost multicut problems defined on such graphs al- lows to optimize the
number of the resulting segments along with the segment assignment. However,
pairwise potentials limit the discriminative power of the employed motion
models to translational differences. More complex models such as Euclidean or
affine transformations call for higher-order potentials and a tractable
inference in the resulting higher-order graphical models. In this paper, we (1)
introduce a generalization of the minimum cost lifted multicut problem to
hypergraphs, and (2) propose a simple primal feasible heuristic that allows for
a reasonably efficient inference in instances of higher-order lifted multicut
problem instances defined on point trajectory hypergraphs for motion
segmentation. The resulting motion segmentations improve over the
state-of-the-art on the FBMS-59 dataset.

 <dc:title>Bilateral Proofs of Safety and Progress Properties of Concurrent

 <dc:creator>Misra, Jayadev</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper suggests a theomisra@utexas.edury of composable specification of
concurrent programs that permits: (1) verification of program code for a given
specification, and (2) composition of the specifications of the components to
yield the specification of a program. The specification consists of both
terminal properties that hold at the end of a program execution (if the
execution terminates) and perpetual properties that hold throughout an
execution. We devise (1) proof techniques for verification, and (2) composition
rules to derive the specification of a program from those of its components. We
employ terminal properties of components to derive perpetual properties of a
program and conversely. Hence, this proof strategy is called bilateral. The
compositional aspect of the theory is important in assembling a program out of
components some of whose source code may not be available, as is increasingly
the case with cross-vendor program integration.

 <dc:description>  The key issues pertaining to collection of epidemic disease data for our
analysis purposes are that it is a labour intensive, time consuming and
expensive process resulting in availability of sparse sample data which we use
to develop prediction models. To address this sparse data issue, we present
novel Incremental Transductive methods to circumvent the data collection
process by applying previously acquired data to provide consistent,
confidence-based labelling alternatives to field survey research. We
investigated various reasoning approaches for semisupervised machine learning
including Bayesian models for labelling data. The results show that using the
proposed methods, we can label instances of data with a class of vector density
at a high level of confidence. By applying the Liberal and Strict Training
Approaches, we provide a labelling and classification alternative to standalone
algorithms. The methods in this paper are components in the process of reducing
the proliferation of the Schistosomiasis disease and its effects.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a generalization of the celebrated Lov\'asz theta number of a
graph to simplicial complexes of arbitrary dimension. Our generalization takes
advantage of real simplicial cohomology theory, in particular combinatorial
Laplacians, and provides a semidefinite programming upper bound of the
independence number of a simplicial complex. We consider properties of the
graph theta number such as the relationship to Hoffman's ratio bound and to the
chromatic number and study how they extend to higher dimensions. Like in the
case of graphs, the higher dimensional theta number can be extended to a
hierarchy of semidefinite programming upper bounds reaching the independence
number. We analyze the value of the theta number and of the hierarchy for dense
random simplicial complexes.

 <dc:title>Fixed versus Dynamic Co-Occurrence Windows in TextRank Term Weights for
  Information Retrieval</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  TextRank is a variant of PageRank typically used in graphs that represent
documents, and where vertices denote terms and edges denote relations between
terms. Quite often the relation between terms is simple term co-occurrence
within a fixed window of k terms. The output of TextRank when applied
iteratively is a score for each vertex, i.e. a term weight, that can be used
for information retrieval (IR) just like conventional term frequency based term
weights. So far, when computing TextRank term weights over co- occurrence
graphs, the window of term co-occurrence is al- ways ?xed. This work departs
from this, and considers dy- namically adjusted windows of term co-occurrence
that fol- low the document structure on a sentence- and paragraph- level. The
resulting TextRank term weights are used in a ranking function that re-ranks
1000 initially returned search results in order to improve the precision of the
ranking. Ex- periments with two IR collections show that adjusting the vicinity
of term co-occurrence when computing TextRank term weights can lead to gains in
early precision.

 <dc:title>A Service-Oriented Architecture for Assisting the Authoring of Semantic

 <dc:description>  Although there are increasingly more initiatives for the generation of
semantic knowledge based on user participation, there is still a shortage of
platforms for regular users to create applications on which semantic data can
be exploited and generated automatically. We propose an architecture, called
Semantic Maps (SeMaps), for assisting the authoring and hosting of applications
in which the maps combine the aggregation of a Geographic Information System
and crowd-generated content (called here crowd maps). In these systems, the
digital map works as a blackboard for accommodating stories told by people
about events they want to share with others typically participating in their
social networks. SeMaps offers an environment for the creation and maintenance
of sites based on crowd maps with the possibility for the user to characterize
semantically that which s/he intends to mark on the map. The designer of a
crowd map, by informing a linguistic expression that designates what has to be
marked on the maps, is guided in a process that aims to associate a concept
from a common-sense base to this linguistic expression. Thus, the crowd maps
start to have dominion over common-sense inferential relations that define the
meaning of the marker, and are able to make inferences about the network of
linked data. This makes it possible to generate maps that have the power to
perform inferences and access external sources (such as DBpedia) that
constitute information that is useful and appropriate to the context of the
map. In this paper we describe the architecture of SeMaps and how it was
applied in a crowd map authoring tool.

 <dc:description>  Many modern clustering methods scale well to a large number of data items, N,
but not to a large number of clusters, K. This paper introduces PERCH, a new
non-greedy algorithm for online hierarchical clustering that scales to both
massive N and K--a problem setting we term extreme clustering. Our algorithm
efficiently routes new data points to the leaves of an incrementally-built
tree. Motivated by the desire for both accuracy and speed, our approach
performs tree rotations for the sake of enhancing subtree purity and
encouraging balancedness. We prove that, under a natural separability
assumption, our non-greedy algorithm will produce trees with perfect dendrogram
purity regardless of online data arrival order. Our experiments demonstrate
that PERCH constructs more accurate trees than other tree-building clustering
algorithms and scales well with both N and K, achieving a higher quality
clustering than the strongest flat clustering competitor in nearly half the
time.

 <dc:description>  The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (DVRPTW) is an
extension of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which takes into
account the dynamic nature of the problem. This aspect requires the vehicle
routes to be updated in an ongoing manner as new customer requests arrive in
the system and must be incorporated into an evolving schedule during the
working day. Besides the vehicle capacity constraint involved in the classical
VRP, DVRPTW considers in addition time windows, which are able to better
capture real-world situations. Despite this, so far, few studies have focused
on tackling this problem of greater practical importance. To this end, this
study devises for the resolution of DVRPTW, an ant colony optimization based
algorithm, which resorts to a joint solution construction mechanism, able to
construct in parallel the vehicle routes. This method is coupled with a local
search procedure, aimed to further improve the solutions built by ants, and
with an insertion heuristics, which tries to reduce the number of vehicles used
to service the available customers. The experiments indicate that the proposed
algorithm is competitive and effective, and on DVRPTW instances with a higher
dynamicity level, it is able to yield better results compared to existing
ant-based approaches.

 <dc:description>  Ashtiani et al. proposed a Semi-Supervised Active Clustering framework
(SSAC), where the learner is allowed to make adaptive queries to a domain
expert. The queries are of the kind &quot;do two given points belong to the same
optimal cluster?&quot; There are many clustering contexts where such same-cluster
queries are feasible. Ashtiani et al. exhibited the power of such queries by
showing that any instance of the $k$-means clustering problem, with additional
margin assumption, can be solved efficiently if one is allowed $O(k^2 \log{k} +
k \log{n})$ same-cluster queries. This is interesting since the $k$-means
problem, even with the margin assumption, is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard.
  In this paper, we extend the work of Ashtiani et al. to the approximation
setting showing that a few of such same-cluster queries enables one to get a
polynomial-time $(1 + \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-means
problem without any margin assumption on the input dataset. Again, this is
interesting since the $k$-means problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to approximate
within a factor $(1 + c)$ for a fixed constant $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$. The number of
same-cluster queries used is $\textrm{poly}(k/\varepsilon)$ which is
independent of the size $n$ of the dataset. Our algorithm is based on the
$D^2$-sampling technique. We also give a conditional lower bound on the number
of same-cluster queries showing that if the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH)
holds, then any such efficient query algorithm needs to make $\Omega
\left(\frac{k}{poly \log k} \right)$ same-cluster queries. Our algorithm can be
extended for the case when the oracle is faulty. Another result we show with
respect to the $k$-means++ seeding algorithm is that a small modification to
the $k$-means++ seeding algorithm within the SSAC framework converts it to a
constant factor approximation algorithm instead of the well known
$O(\log{k})$-approximation algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Causal effect estimation from observational data is an important and much
studied research topic. The instrumental variable (IV) and local causal
discovery (LCD) patterns are canonical examples of settings where a closed-form
expression exists for the causal effect of one variable on another, given the
presence of a third variable. Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the
latter only influences the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it
is likely that this assumption only holds approximately and that there will be
at least some form of weak interaction. This brings about the paradoxical
situation that, in the large-sample limit, no predictions are made, as
detecting the weak edge invalidates the setting. We introduce an alternative
approach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects the
existence of many 'weak' (irrelevant) and 'strong' interactions. We obtain a
posterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows
that, in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the
approach in an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the
MultiNest sampling algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to
show our method is robust even when strict faithfulness is violated.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the logic of questions and dependencies has been
investigated in the closely related frameworks of inquisitive logic and
dependence logic. These investigations have assumed classical logic as the
background logic of statements, and added formulas expressing questions and
dependencies to this classical core. In this paper, we broaden the scope of
these investigations by studying questions and dependency in the context of
intuitionistic logic. We propose an intuitionistic team semantics, where teams
are embedded within intuitionistic Kripke models. The associated logic is a
conservative extension of intuitionistic logic with questions and dependence
formulas. We establish a number of results about this logic, including a normal
form result, a completeness result, and translations to classical inquisitive
logic and modal dependence logic.

 <dc:title>Randomized Linear Programming Solves the Discounted Markov Decision
  Problem In Nearly-Linear (Sometimes Sublinear) Running Time</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel randomized linear programming algorithm for approximating
the optimal policy of the discounted Markov decision problem. By leveraging the
value-policy duality and binary-tree data structures, the algorithm adaptively
samples state-action-state transitions and makes exponentiated primal-dual
updates. We show that it finds an $\epsilon$-optimal policy using nearly-linear
run time in the worst case. When the Markov decision process is ergodic and
specified in some special data formats, the algorithm finds an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy using run time linear in the total number of
state-action pairs, which is sublinear in the input size. These results provide
a new venue and complexity benchmarks for solving stochastic dynamic programs.

 <dc:title>A Convolution Tree with Deconvolution Branches: Exploiting Geometric
  Relationships for Single Shot Keypoint Detection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kumar, Amit</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chellappa, Rama</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, Deep Convolution Networks (DCNNs) have been applied to the task of
face alignment and have shown potential for learning improved feature
representations. Although deeper layers can capture abstract concepts like
pose, it is difficult to capture the geometric relationships among the
keypoints in DCNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel convolution-deconvolution
network for facial keypoint detection. Our model predicts the 2D locations of
the keypoints and their individual visibility along with 3D head pose, while
exploiting the spatial relationships among different keypoints. Different from
existing approaches of modeling these relationships, we propose learnable
transform functions which captures the relationships between keypoints at
feature level. However, due to extensive variations in pose, not all of these
relationships act at once, and hence we propose, a pose-based routing function
which implicitly models the active relationships. Both transform functions and
the routing function are implemented through convolutions in a multi-task
framework. Our approach presents a single-shot keypoint detection method,
making it different from many existing cascade regression-based methods. We
also show that learning these relationships significantly improve the accuracy
of keypoint detections for in-the-wild face images from challenging datasets
such as AFW and AFLW.

 <dc:description>  Linear optimal power flow (LOPF) algorithms use a linearization of the
alternating current (AC) load flow equations to optimize generator dispatch in
a network subject to the loading constraints of the network branches. Common
algorithms use the voltage angles at the buses as optimization variables, but
alternatives can be computationally advantageous. In this article we provide a
review of existing methods and describe new formulations, which express the
loading constraints directly in terms of the flows themselves, using a
decomposition of the network graph into a spanning tree and closed cycles. We
provide a comprehensive study of the computational performance of the various
formulations, in settings that include computationally challenging applications
such as multi-period LOPF with storage dispatch and generation capacity
expansion. We show that one of the new formulations of the LOPF solves up to 20
times faster than the angle formulation using commercial linear programming
solvers, with an average speed-up of factor 3 for the standard networks
considered here. If generation capacities are also optimized, the average
speed-up rises to a factor of 12, reaching up to factor 213 in a particular
instance. The speed-up is largest for networks with many buses and decentral
generators throughout the network, which is highly relevant given the rise of
distributed renewable generation and the computational challenge of operation
and planning in such networks.

 <dc:description>  A landmark based heuristic is investigated for reducing query phase run-time
of the probabilistic roadmap (\PRM) motion planning method. The heuristic is
generated by storing minimum spanning trees from a small number of vertices
within the \PRM graph and using these trees to approximate the cost of a
shortest path between any two vertices of the graph. The intermediate step of
preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the
classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual
queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper
investigates these trade-offs on \PRM graphs constructed in randomized
environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation.We conclude that the
method is preferable to Dijkstra's algorithm or the ${\rm A}^*$ algorithm with
conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.

 <dc:description>  Implicit feedback is the simplest form of user feedback that can be used for
item recommendation. It is easy to collect and domain independent. However,
there is a lack of negative examples. Existing works circumvent this problem by
making various assumptions regarding the unconsumed items, which fail to hold
when the user did not consume an item because she was unaware of it. In this
paper we propose Conformative Filtering (CoF) as a novel method for addressing
the lack of negative examples in implicit feedback. The motivation is that if
there is a large group of users who share the same taste and none of them
consumed an item, then it is highly likely that the item is irrelevant to this
taste. We use Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis (HLTA) to identify taste-based
user groups, and make recommendations for a user based on her memberships in
the groups. Experiments on real-world datasets from different domains show that
CoF has superior performance compared to other baselines and more than 10%
improvement in Recall@5 and Recall@10 is observed.

 <dc:description>  Recent algorithmic developments have enabled computers to automatically
determine and prove the capacity regions of small hypergraph networks under
network coding. A structural theory relating network coding problems of
different sizes is developed to make best use of this newfound computational
capability. A formal notion of network minimality is developed which removes
components of a network coding problem that are inessential to its core
complexity. Equivalence between different network coding problems under
relabeling is formalized via group actions, an algorithm which can directly
list single representatives from each equivalence class of minimal networks up
to a prescribed network size is presented. This algorithm, together with rate
region software, is leveraged to create a database containing the rate regions
for all minimal network coding problems with five or fewer sources and edges, a
collection of 744119 equivalence classes representing more than 9 million
networks. In order to best learn from this database, and to leverage it to
infer rate regions and their characteristics of networks at scale, a hierarchy
between different network coding problems is created with a new theory of
combinations and embedding operators.

 <dc:description>  Staircase codes play an important role as error-correcting codes in optical
communications. In this paper, a low-complexity method for resolving stall
patterns when decoding staircase codes is described. Stall patterns are the
dominating contributor to the error floor in the original decoding method. Our
improvement is based on locating stall patterns by intersecting non-zero
syndromes and flipping the corresponding bits. The approach effectively lowers
the error floor and allows for a new range of block sizes to be considered for
optical communications at a certain rate or, alternatively, a significantly
decreased error floor for the same block size. Further, an improved error floor
analysis is introduced which provides a more accurate estimation of the
contributions to the error floor.

model is expressed as a labeled binary tree of $2k+1$ nodes, where each node is
either a summation, a multiplication, or the application of one of the $q$
basis functions to one of the $p$ covariates. We show that in order to recover
a labeled binary tree from a given dataset, the sufficient number of samples is
$O(k\log(pq)+\log(k!))$, and the necessary number of samples is $\Omega(k\log
(pq)-\log(k!))$. We further propose a greedy algorithm for regression in order
to validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.

 <dc:description>  Although hash function learning algorithms have achieved great success in
recent years, most existing hash models are off-line, which are not suitable
for processing sequential or online data. To address this problem, this work
proposes an online hash model to accommodate data coming in stream for online
learning. Specifically, a new loss function is proposed to measure the
similarity loss between a pair of data samples in hamming space. Then, a
structured hash model is derived and optimized in a passive-aggressive way.
Theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the cumulative loss for the proposed
online hash model is provided. Furthermore, we extend our online hashing from a
single-model to a multi-model online hashing that trains multiple models so as
to retain diverse online hashing models in order to avoid biased update. The
competitive efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed online hash models are
verified through extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets as
compared to related hashing methods.

 <dc:title>The Proof of CSP Dichotomy Conjecture</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many natural combinatorial problems can be expressed as constraint
satisfaction problems. This class of problems is known to be NP-complete in
general, but certain restrictions on the form of the constraints can ensure
tractability. The standard way to parameterize interesting subclasses of the
constraint satisfaction problem is via finite constraint languages. The main
problem is to classify those subclasses that are solvable in polynomial time
and those that are NP-complete. It was conjectured that if a core of a
constraint language has a weak near unanimity polymorphism then the
corresponding constraint satisfaction problem is tractable, otherwise it is
NP-complete.
  In the paper we present an algorithm that solves Constraint Satisfaction
Problem in polynomial time for constraint languages having a weak near
unanimity polymorphism, which proves the remaining part of the conjecture.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate an application of two different beamforming
techniques and propose a novel downlink power minimization scheme for a
two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) model. In this context, we employ time
reversal (TR) technique to a femtocell base station (FBS) whereas we assume
that a macrocell base station (MBS) uses a zero-forcing-based algorithm and the
communication channels are subject to frequency selective fading. Additionally,
HetNet's backhaul connection is unable to support a sufficient throughput for
signaling information exchange between two tiers. Given the considered HetNet
model, a downlink power minimization scheme is proposed, and closed-form
expressions concerning the optimal solution are provided, taking this
constraint into account. Furthermore, considering imperfect channel estimation
at TR-employed femtocell, a worst-case robust power minimization problem is
formulated. By devising TR worst-case analysis, this robust problem is
transformed into an equivalent formulation that is tractable to solve. The
results presented in our paper show that the TR technique outperforms the
zero-forcing one in the perspective of beamforming methods for femtocell
working environments. Finally, we validate the proposed power loading strategy
for both cases of perfect and imperfect channel estimations.

 <dc:description>  A reliable, accurate, and affordable positioning service is highly required
in wireless networks. In this paper, the novel Message Passing Hybrid
Localization (MPHL) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem of cooperative
distributed localization using distance and direction estimates. This hybrid
approach combines two sensing modalities to reduce the uncertainty in
localizing the network nodes. A statistical model is formulated for the
problem, and approximate minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates of the node
locations are computed. The proposed MPHL is a distributed algorithm based on
belief propagation (BP) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. It
improves the identifiability of the localization problem and reduces its
sensitivity to the anchor node geometry, compared to distance-only or
direction-only localization techniques. For example, the unknown location of a
node can be found if it has only a single neighbor; and a whole network can be
localized using only a single anchor node. Numerical results are presented
showing that the average localization error is significantly reduced in almost
every simulation scenario, about 50% in most cases, compared to the competing
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new lifelong learning solution where a single model
is trained for a sequence of tasks. The main challenge that vision systems face
in this context is catastrophic forgetting: as they tend to adapt to the most
recently seen task, they lose performance on the tasks that were learned
previously. Our method aims at preserving the knowledge of the previous tasks
while learning a new one by using autoencoders. For each task, an
under-complete autoencoder is learned, capturing the features that are crucial
for its achievement. When a new task is presented to the system, we prevent the
reconstructions of the features with these autoencoders from changing, which
has the effect of preserving the information on which the previous tasks are
mainly relying. At the same time, the features are given space to adjust to the
most recent environment as only their projection into a low dimension
submanifold is controlled. The proposed system is evaluated on image
classification tasks and shows a reduction of forgetting over the
state-of-the-art

 <dc:description>  For a set ${\cal F}$ of graphs, an instance of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free
Sandwich Problem} is a pair $(G_1,G_2)$ consisting of two graphs $G_1$ and
$G_2$ with the same vertex set such that $G_1$ is a subgraph of $G_2$, and the
task is to determine an ${\cal F}$-free graph $G$ containing $G_1$ and
contained in $G_2$, or to decide that such a graph does not exist. Initially
motivated by the graph sandwich problem for trivially perfect graphs, which are
the $\{ P_4,C_4\}$-free graphs, we study the complexity of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc
free Sandwich Problem} for sets ${\cal F}$ containing two non-isomorphic graphs
of order four. We show that if ${\cal F}$ is one of the sets $\left\{ {\rm
diamond},K_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm diamond},C_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
diamond},{\rm paw}\right\}$, $\left\{ K_4,\overline{K_4}\right\}$, $\left\{
P_4,C_4\right\}$, $\left\{ P_4,\overline{\rm claw}\right\}$, $\left\{
P_4,\overline{\rm paw}\right\}$, $\left\{ P_4,\overline{\rm diamond}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm paw},C_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm paw},{\rm claw}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm paw},\overline{{\rm claw}}\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm

$\left\{ {\rm claw},\overline{{\rm claw}}\right\}$, and $\left\{ {\rm
claw},\overline{C_4}\right\}$, then the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free Sandwich Problem}
can be solved in polynomial time, and, if ${\cal F}$ is one of the sets
$\left\{ C_4,K_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm paw},K_4\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
paw},\overline{K_4}\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm paw},\overline{C_4}\right\}$,
$\left\{ {\rm diamond},\overline{C_4}\right\}$, $\left\{ {\rm
paw},\overline{\rm diamond}\right\}$, and $\left\{ {\rm diamond},\overline{\rm
diamond}\right\}$, then the decision version of the ${\cal F}$-{\sc free
Sandwich Problem} is NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  We propose a quality-of-service (QoS) driven power-and rate-adaptation scheme
for wireless cloud radio access networks (C-RANs), where each radio remote head
(RRH) is connected to the baseband unit (BBU) pool through high-speed optical
links. The RRHs jointly support the users by efficiently exploiting the
enhanced spatial degrees of freedom attained by the powerful cloud computing
facilitated by the BBU pool. Our proposed scheme aims for maximizing the
effective capacity (EC) of the user subject to both per-RRH average-and
peak-power constraints, where the EC is defined as the tele-traffic maximum
arrival rate that can be supported by the C-RAN under the statistical delay-QoS
requirement. We first transform the EC maximization problem into an equivalent
convex optimization problem. By using the Lagrange dual decomposition method
and satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, the optimal
transmission power of each RRH can be obtained in closed form. Furthermore, an
online tracking method is provided for approximating the average power of each
RRH for the sake of updating the Lagrange dual variables. For the special case
of two RRHs, the expression of the average power to be assigned to each RRH can
be calculated in explicit form, which can be numerically evaluated. Hence, the
Lagrange dual variables can be computed in advance in this special case.
Furthermore, we derive the power allocation for two important extreme cases: 1)
no delay constraint; 2) extremely stringent delay-requirements. Additionally,
we also extend our work to the other two important problems: 1) Energy
efficiency maximization problem; 2) EC maximization for a multiuser case. Our
simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the
conventional algorithm without considering the delay requirements.

 <dc:title>Automated Latent Fingerprint Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cao, Kai</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Latent fingerprints are one of the most important and widely used evidence in
law enforcement and forensic agencies worldwide. Yet, NIST evaluations show
that the performance of state-of-the-art latent recognition systems is far from
satisfactory. An automated latent fingerprint recognition system with high
accuracy is essential to compare latents found at crime scenes to a large
collection of reference prints to generate a candidate list of possible mates.
In this paper, we propose an automated latent fingerprint recognition algorithm
that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for ridge flow
estimation and minutiae descriptor extraction, and extract complementary
templates (two minutiae templates and one texture template) to represent the
latent. The comparison scores between the latent and a reference print based on
the three templates are fused to retrieve a short candidate list from the
reference database. Experimental results show that the rank-1 identification
accuracies (query latent is matched with its true mate in the reference
database) are 64.7% for the NIST SD27 and 75.3% for the WVU latent databases,
against a reference database of 100K rolled prints. These results are the best
among published papers on latent recognition and competitive with the
performance (66.7% and 70.8% rank-1 accuracies on NIST SD27 and WVU DB,
respectively) of a leading COTS latent Automated Fingerprint Identification
System (AFIS). By score-level (rank-level) fusion of our system with the
commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) latent AFIS, the overall rank-1 identification
performance can be improved from 64.7% and 75.3% to 73.3% (74.4%) and 76.6%
(78.4%) on NIST SD27 and WVU latent databases, respectively.

 <dc:description>  This paper tackles the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation,
that is, segmenting an object in a sequence given its mask in the first frame.
One of the main challenges in this scenario is the change of appearance of the
objects of interest. Their semantics, on the other hand, do not vary. This
paper investigates how to take advantage of such invariance via the
introduction of a semantic prior that guides the appearance model.
Specifically, given the segmentation mask of the first frame of a sequence, we
estimate the semantics of the object of interest, and propagate that knowledge
throughout the sequence to improve the results based on an appearance model. We
present Semantically-Guided Video Object Segmentation (SGV), which improves
results over previous state of the art on two different datasets using a
variety of evaluation metrics, while running in half a second per frame.

 <dc:title>Short Labeling Schemes for Topology Recognition in Wireless Tree
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gorain, Barun</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pelc, Andrzej</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of topology recognition in wireless (radio) networks
modeled as undirected graphs. Topology recognition is a fundamental task in
which every node of the network has to output a map of the underlying graph
i.e., an isomorphic copy of it, and situate itself in this map. In wireless
networks, nodes communicate in synchronous rounds. In each round a node can
either transmit a message to all its neighbors, or stay silent and listen. At
the receiving end, a node $v$ hears a message from a neighbor $w$ in a given
round, if $v$ listens in this round, and if $w$ is its only neighbor that
transmits in this round. Nodes have labels which are (not necessarily
different) binary strings. The length of a labeling scheme is the largest
length of a label. We concentrate on wireless networks modeled by trees, and we
investigate two problems.
  \begin{itemize} \item What is the shortest labeling scheme that permits
topology recognition in all wireless tree networks of diameter $D$ and maximum
degree $\Delta$?
  \item What is the fastest topology recognition algorithm working for all
wireless tree networks of diameter $D$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, using such
a short labeling scheme? \end{itemize}
  We are interested in deterministic topology recognition algorithms. For the
first problem, we show that the minimum length of a labeling scheme allowing
topology recognition in all trees of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 3$ is
$\Theta(\log\log \Delta)$. For such short schemes, used by an algorithm working
for the class of trees of diameter $D\geq 4$ and maximum degree $\Delta \geq
3$, we show almost matching bounds on the time of topology recognition: an
upper bound $O(D\Delta)$, and a lower bound $\Omega(D\Delta^{\epsilon})$, for
any constant $\epsilon&lt;1$.

 <dc:description>  We show that the perfect matching problem in general graphs is in Quasi-NC.
That is, we give a deterministic parallel algorithm which runs in $O(\log^3 n)$
time on $n^{O(\log^2 n)}$ processors. The result is obtained by a
derandomization of the Isolation Lemma for perfect matchings, which was
introduced in the classic paper by Mulmuley, Vazirani and Vazirani [1987] to
obtain a Randomized NC algorithm.
  Our proof extends the framework of Fenner, Gurjar and Thierauf [2016], who
proved the analogous result in the special case of bipartite graphs. Compared
to that setting, several new ingredients are needed due to the significantly
more complex structure of perfect matchings in general graphs. In particular,
our proof heavily relies on the laminar structure of the faces of the perfect
matching polytope.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the logical foundations of automated inductive theorem
proving. To that aim we first develop a theoretical model that is centered
around the difficulty of finding induction axioms which are sufficient for
proving a goal.
  Based on this model, we then analyze the following aspects: the choice of a
proof shape, the choice of an induction rule and the language of the induction
formula. In particular, using model-theoretic techniques, we clarify the
relationship between notions of inductiveness that have been considered in the
literature on automated inductive theorem proving.

 <dc:title>Promise Constraint Satisfaction: Algebraic Structure and a Symmetric
  Boolean Dichotomy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A classic result due to Schaefer (1978) classifies all constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs) over the Boolean domain as being either in
$\mathsf{P}$ or $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. This paper considers a promise-problem
variant of CSPs called PCSPs. A PCSP over a finite set of pairs of constraints
$\Gamma$ consists of a pair $(\Psi_P, \Psi_Q)$ of CSPs with the same set of
variables such that for every $(P, Q) \in \Gamma$, $P(x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_k})$
is a clause of $\Psi_P$ if and only if $Q(x_{i_1}, ..., x_{i_k})$ is a clause
of $\Psi_Q$. The promise problem $\operatorname{PCSP}(\Gamma)$ is to
distinguish, given $(\Psi_P, \Psi_Q)$, between the cases $\Psi_P$ is
satisfiable and $\Psi_Q$ is unsatisfiable. Many natural problems including
approximate graph and hypergraph coloring can be placed in this framework.
  This paper is motivated by the pursuit of understanding the computational
complexity of Boolean promise CSPs. As our main result, we show that
$\operatorname{PCSP}(\Gamma)$ exhibits a dichotomy (it is either polynomial
time solvable or $\mathsf{NP}$-hard) when the relations in $\Gamma$ are
symmetric and allow for negations of variables. We achieve our dichotomy
theorem by extending the weak polymorphism framework of Austrin, Guruswami, and
H\aa stad [FOCS '14] which itself is a generalization of the algebraic approach
to study CSPs. In both the algorithm and hardness portions of our proof, we
incorporate new ideas and techniques not utilized in the CSP case.
  Furthermore, we show that the computational complexity of any promise CSP
(over arbitrary finite domains) is captured entirely by its weak polymorphisms,
a feature known as Galois correspondence, as well as give necessary and
sufficient conditions for the structure of this set of weak polymorphisms. Such
insights call us to question the existence of a general dichotomy for Boolean
PCSPs.

 <dc:description>  We explore the ability of word embeddings to capture both semantic and
morphological similarity, as affected by the different types of linguistic
properties (surface form, lemma, morphological tag) used to compose the
representation of each word. We train several models, where each uses a
different subset of these properties to compose its representations. By
evaluating the models on semantic and morphological measures, we reveal some
useful insights on the relationship between semantics and morphology.

 <dc:description>  We prove that the regular $n\times n$ square grid of points in the integer
lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ cannot be recovered from an arbitrary $n^{2}$-element
subset of $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ via a mapping with prescribed Lipschitz constant
(independent of $n$). This answers negatively a question of Feige from 2002.
Our resolution of Feige's question takes place largely in a continuous setting
and is based on some new results for Lipschitz mappings falling into two broad
areas of interest, which we study independently. Firstly the present work
contains a detailed investigation of Lipschitz regular mappings on Euclidean
spaces, with emphasis on their bilipschitz decomposability in a sense
comparable to that of the well known result of Jones. Secondly, we build on
work of Burago and Kleiner and McMullen on non-realisable densities. We verify
the existence, and further prevalence, of strongly non-realisable densities
inside spaces of continuous functions.

  theorem of Section 2 (Theorem 2.11 in the present paper) follows easily. This
  affects approx. 5 pages of Section 2, which now can be skipped. Since the two

 <dc:description>  While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies for many
prediction tasks, understanding these models remains a challenge. Despite the
recent interest in developing visual tools to help users interpret deep
learning models, the complexity and wide variety of models deployed in
industry, and the large-scale datasets that they used, pose unique design
challenges that are inadequately addressed by existing work. Through
participatory design sessions with over 15 researchers and engineers at
Facebook, we have developed, deployed, and iteratively improved ActiVis, an
interactive visualization system for interpreting large-scale deep learning
models and results. By tightly integrating multiple coordinated views, such as
a computation graph overview of the model architecture, and a neuron activation
view for pattern discovery and comparison, users can explore complex deep
neural network models at both the instance- and subset-level. ActiVis has been
deployed on Facebook's machine learning platform. We present case studies with
Facebook researchers and engineers, and usage scenarios of how ActiVis may work
with different models.

 <dc:title>The quality of priority ratios estimation in relation to a selected
  prioritization procedure and consistency measure for a Pairwise Comparison
  Matrix</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kazibudzki, Paul Thaddeus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An overview of current debates and contemporary research devoted to the
modeling of decision making processes and their facilitation directs attention
to the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). At the core of the AHP are various
prioritization procedures (PPs) and consistency measures (CMs) for a Pairwise
Comparison Matrix (PCM) which, in a sense, reflects preferences of decision
makers. Certainly, when judgments about these preferences are perfectly
consistent (cardinally transitive), all PPs coincide and the quality of the
priority ratios (PRs) estimation is exemplary. However, human judgments are
very rarely consistent, thus the quality of PRs estimation may significantly
vary. The scale of these variations depends on the applied PP and utilized CM
for a PCM. This is why it is important to find out which PPs and which CMs for
a PCM lead directly to an improvement of the PRs estimation accuracy. The main
goal of this research is realized through the properly designed, coded and
executed seminal and sophisticated simulation algorithms in Wolfram Mathematica
8.0. These research results convince that the embedded in the AHP and commonly
applied, both genuine PP and CM for PCM may significantly deteriorate the
quality of PRs estimation; however, solutions proposed in this paper can
significantly improve the methodology.

 <dc:description>  In the context of Smart Cities, indicator definitions have been used to
calculate values that enable the comparison among different cities. The
calculation of an indicator values has challenges as the calculation may need
to combine some aspects of quality while addressing different levels of
abstraction. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been used successfully to support
flexible representation, which can support improved understanding and data
analysis in similar settings. This paper presents an operational description
for a city KG, an indicator ontology that support indicator discovery and data
visualization and an application capable of performing metadata analysis to
automatically build and display dashboards according to discovered indicators.
We describe our implementation in an urban mobility setting.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the interaction between the valves and walls of the heart is
important in assessing and subsequently treating heart dysfunction. With
advancements in cardiac imaging, nonlinear mechanics and computational
techniques, it is now possible to explore the mechanics of valve-heart
interactions using anatomically and physiologically realistic models. This
study presents an integrated model of the mitral valve (MV) coupled to the left
ventricle (LV), with the geometry derived from in vivo clinical magnetic
resonance images. Numerical simulations using this coupled MV-LV model are
developed using an immersed boundary/finite element method. The model
incorporates detailed valvular features, left ventricular contraction,
nonlinear soft tissue mechanics, and fluid-mediated interactions between the MV
and LV wall. We use the model to simulate the cardiac function from diastole to
systole, and investigate how myocardial active relaxation function affects the
LV pump function. The results of the new model agree with in vivo measurements,
and demonstrate that the diastolic filling pressure increases significantly
with impaired myocardial active relaxation to maintain the normal cardiac
output. The coupled model has the potential to advance fundamental knowledge of
mechanisms underlying MV-LV interaction, and help in risk stratification and
optimization of therapies for heart diseases.

 <dc:description>  A great variety of text tasks such as topic or spam identification, user
profiling, and sentiment analysis can be posed as a supervised learning problem
and tackle using a text classifier. A text classifier consists of several
subprocesses, some of them are general enough to be applied to any supervised
learning problem, whereas others are specifically designed to tackle a
particular task, using complex and computational expensive processes such as
lemmatization, syntactic analysis, etc. Contrary to traditional approaches, we
propose a minimalistic and wide system able to tackle text classification tasks
independent of domain and language, namely microTC. It is composed by some easy
to implement text transformations, text representations, and a supervised
learning algorithm. These pieces produce a competitive classifier even in the
domain of informally written text. We provide a detailed description of microTC
along with an extensive experimental comparison with relevant state-of-the-art
methods. mircoTC was compared on 30 different datasets. Regarding accuracy,
microTC obtained the best performance in 20 datasets while achieves competitive
results in the remaining 10. The compared datasets include several problems
like topic and polarity classification, spam detection, user profiling and
authorship attribution. Furthermore, it is important to state that our approach
allows the usage of the technology even without knowledge of machine learning
and natural language processing.

 <dc:title>A stable and optimally convergent LaTIn-Cut Finite Element Method for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel unfitted finite element method for the
simulation of multiple body contact. The computational mesh is generated
independently of the geometry of the interacting solids, which can be
arbitrarily complex. The key novelty of the approach is the combination of
elements of the CutFEM technology, namely the enrichment of the solution field
via the definition of overlapping fictitious domains with a dedicated
penalty-type regularisation of discrete operators, and the LaTIn hybrid-mixed
formulation of complex interface conditions. Furthermore, the novel P1-P1
discretisation scheme that we propose for the unfitted LaTIn solver is shown to
be stable, robust and optimally convergent with mesh refinement. Finally, the
paper introduces a high-performance 3D level-set/CutFEM framework for the
versatile and robust solution of contact problems involving multiple bodies of
complex geometries, with more than two bodies interacting at a single point.

 <dc:description>  In a seminal paper, Chen, Roughgarden and Valiant studied cost sharing
protocols for network design with the objective to implement a low-cost Steiner
forest as a Nash equilibrium of an induced cost-sharing game. One of the most
intriguing open problems to date is to understand the power of budget-balanced
and separable cost sharing protocols in order to induce low-cost Steiner
forests. In this work, we focus on undirected networks and analyze topological
properties of the underlying graph so that an optimal Steiner forest can be
implemented as a Nash equilibrium (by some separable cost sharing protocol)
independent of the edge costs. We term a graph efficient if the above stated
property holds. As our main result, we give a complete characterization of
efficient undirected graphs for two-player network design games: an undirected
graph is efficient if and only if it does not contain (at least) one out of few
forbidden subgraphs. Our characterization implies that several graph classes
are efficient: generalized series-parallel graphs, fan and wheel graphs and
graphs with small cycles.

 <dc:title>A Delay-Aware Caching Algorithm for Wireless D2D Caching Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently, wireless caching techniques have been studied to satisfy lower
delay requirements and offload traffic from peak periods. By storing parts of
the popular files at the mobile users, users can locate some of their requested
files in their own caches or the caches at their neighbors. In the latter case,
when a user receives files from its neighbors, device-to-device (D2D)
communication is enabled. D2D communication underlaid with cellular networks is
also a new paradigm for the upcoming 5G wireless systems. By allowing a pair of
adjacent D2D users to communicate directly, D2D communication can achieve
higher throughput, better energy efficiency and lower traffic delay. In this
work, we propose a very efficient caching algorithm for D2D-enabled cellular
networks to minimize the average transmission delay. Instead of searching over
all possible solutions, our algorithm finds out the best &lt;file,user&gt; pairs,
which provide the best delay improvement in each loop to form a caching policy
with very low transmission delay and high throughput. This algorithm is also
extended to address a more general scenario, in which the distributions of
fading coefficients and values of system parameters potentially change over
time. Via numerical results, the superiority of the proposed algorithm is
verified by comparing it with a naive algorithm, in which all users simply
cache their favorite files.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel technique for direct recognition of
multiple speech streams given the single channel of mixed speech, without first
separating them. Our technique is based on permutation invariant training (PIT)
for automatic speech recognition (ASR). In PIT-ASR, we compute the average
cross entropy (CE) over all frames in the whole utterance for each possible
output-target assignment, pick the one with the minimum CE, and optimize for
that assignment. PIT-ASR forces all the frames of the same speaker to be
aligned with the same output layer. This strategy elegantly solves the label
permutation problem and speaker tracing problem in one shot. Our experiments on
artificially mixed AMI data showed that the proposed approach is very
promising.

 <dc:description>  Massive Internet of Things (mIoT) has provided an auspicious opportunity to
build powerful and ubiquitous connections that faces a plethora of new
challenges, where cellular networks are potential solutions due to their high
scalability, reliability, and efficiency. The Random Access CHannel (RACH)
procedure is the first step of connection establishment between IoT devices and
Base Stations (BSs) in the cellular-based mIoT network, where modelling the
interactions between static properties of physical layer network and dynamic
properties of queue evolving in each IoT device are challenging. To tackle
this, we provide a novel traffic-aware spatio-temporal model to analyze RACH in
cellular-based mIoT networks, where the physical layer network is modelled and
analyzed based on stochastic geometry in the spatial domain, and the queue
evolution is analyzed based on probability theory in the time domain. For
performance evaluation, we derive the exact expressions for the preamble
transmission success probabilities of a randomly chosen IoT device with
different RACH schemes in each time slot, which offer insights into
effectiveness of each RACH scheme. Our derived analytical results are verified
by the realistic simulations capturing the evolution of packets in each IoT
device. This mathematical model and analytical framework can be applied to
evaluate the performance of other types of RACH schemes in the cellular-based
networks by simply integrating its preamble transmission principle.

 <dc:description>  Modern image and video compression codes employ elaborate structures existing
in such signals to encode them into few number of bits. Compressed sensing
recovery algorithms on the other hand use such signals' structures to recover
them from few linear observations. Despite the steady progress in the field of
compressed sensing, structures that are often used for signal recovery are
still much simpler than those employed by state-of-the-art compression codes.
The main goal of this paper is to bridge this gap through answering the
following question: Can one employ a given compression code to build an
efficient (polynomial time) compressed sensing recovery algorithm? In response
to this question, the compression-based gradient descent (C-GD) algorithm is
proposed. C-GD, which is a low-complexity iterative algorithm, is able to
employ a generic compression code for compressed sensing and therefore elevates
the scope of structures used in compressed sensing to those used by compression
codes. The convergence performance of C-GD and its required number of
measurements in terms of the rate-distortion performance of the compression
code are theoretically analyzed. It is also shown that C-GD is robust to
additive white Gaussian noise. Finally, the presented simulation results show
that combining C-GD with commercial image compression codes such as JPEG2000
yields state-of-the-art performance in imaging applications.

 <dc:title>Secure Transmission of Delay-Sensitive Data over Wireless Fading
  Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ozmen, Mustafa</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, throughput and energy efficiency of secure wireless
transmission of delay sensitive data generated by random sources is studied. A
fading broadcast model in which the transmitter sends confidential and common
messages to two receivers is considered. It is assumed that the common and
confidential data, generated from Markovian sources, is stored in buffers prior
to transmission, and the transmitter operates under constraints on buffer/delay
violation probability. Under such statistical quality of service (QoS)
constraints, effective capacity of time-varying wireless transmissions and
effective bandwidth of Markovian sources are employed to determine the
throughput. In particular, secrecy capacity is used to describe the service
rate of buffers containing confidential messages. Moreover, energy per bit is
used as the energy efficiency metric and energy efficiency is studied in the
low signal-to-noise (SNR) regime. Specifically, minimum energy per bit required
for the reliable communication of common and confidential messages is
determined and wideband slope expressions are identified. The impact of
buffer/delay constraints, correlation between channels, source
characteristics/burstiness, channel knowledge at the transmitter, power
allocation, and secrecy requirements on the throughput and energy efficiency of
common and confidential message transmissions is identified.

 <dc:title>Optimizing Adiabatic Quantum Program Compilation using a Graph-Theoretic

 <dc:description>  Adiabatic quantum computing has evolved in recent years from a theoretical
field into an immensely practical area, a change partially sparked by D-Wave
System's quantum annealing hardware. These multimillion-dollar quantum
annealers offer the potential to solve optimization problems millions of times
faster than classical heuristics, prompting researchers at Google, NASA and
Lockheed Martin to study how these computers can be applied to complex
real-world problems such as NASA rover missions. Unfortunately, compiling
(embedding) an optimization problem into the annealing hardware is itself a
difficult optimization problem and a major bottleneck currently preventing
widespread adoption. Additionally, while finding a single embedding is
difficult, no generalized method is known for tuning embeddings to use minimal
hardware resources. To address these barriers, we introduce a graph-theoretic
framework for developing structured embedding algorithms. Using this framework,
we introduce a biclique virtual hardware layer to provide a simplified
interface to the physical hardware. Additionally, we exploit bipartite
structure in quantum programs using odd cycle transversal (OCT) decompositions.
By coupling an OCT-based embedding algorithm with new, generalized reduction
methods, we develop a new baseline for embedding a wide range of optimization
problems into fault-free D-Wave annealing hardware. To encourage the reuse and
extension of these techniques, we provide an implementation of the framework
and embedding algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The rapidly growing number of large network analysis problems has led to the
emergence of many parallel and distributed graph processing systems---one
survey in 2014 identified over 80. Since then, the landscape has evolved; some
packages have become inactive while more are being developed. Determining the
best approach for a given problem is infeasible for most developers. To enable
easy, rigorous, and repeatable comparison of the capabilities of such systems,
we present an approach and associated software for analyzing the performance
and scalability of parallel, open-source graph libraries. We demonstrate our
approach on five graph processing packages: GraphMat, the Graph500, the Graph
Algorithm Platform Benchmark Suite, GraphBIG, and PowerGraph using synthetic
and real-world datasets. We examine previously overlooked aspects of parallel
graph processing performance such as phases of execution and energy usage for
three algorithms: breadth first search, single source shortest paths, and
PageRank and compare our results to Graphalytics.

 <dc:title>A Software-equivalent SNN Hardware using RRAM-array for Asynchronous
  Real-time Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Spiking Neural Network (SNN) naturally inspires hardware implementation as it
is based on biology. For learning, spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) may
be implemented using an energy efficient waveform superposition on memristor
based synapse. However, system level implementation has three challenges.
First, a classic dilemma is that recognition requires current reading for short
voltage$-$spikes which is disturbed by large voltage$-$waveforms that are
simultaneously applied on the same memristor for real$-$time learning i.e. the
simultaneous read$-$write dilemma. Second, the hardware needs to exactly
replicate software implementation for easy adaptation of algorithm to hardware.
Third, the devices used in hardware simulations must be realistic. In this
paper, we present an approach to address the above concerns. First, the
learning and recognition occurs in separate arrays simultaneously in
real$-$time, asynchronously $-$ avoiding non$-$biomimetic clocking based
complex signal management. Second, we show that the hardware emulates software
at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit$-$simulator) with MATLAB
(mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an
example, the hardware shows 97.5 per cent accuracy in classification which is
equivalent to software for a Fisher$-$Iris dataset. Third, the STDP is
implemented using a model of synaptic device implemented using HfO2 memristor.
We show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the
hardware performance (85 per cent), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM
characteristics specifically for SNN.

 <dc:description>  The brain must robustly store a large number of memories, corresponding to
the many events encountered over a lifetime. However, the number of memory
states in existing neural network models either grows weakly with network size
or recall fails catastrophically with vanishingly little noise. We construct an
associative content-addressable memory with exponentially many stable states
and robust error-correction. The network possesses expander graph connectivity
on a restricted Boltzmann machine architecture. The expansion property allows
simple neural network dynamics to perform at par with modern error-correcting
codes. Appropriate networks can be constructed with sparse random connections,
glomerular nodes, and associative learning using low dynamic-range weights.
Thus, sparse quasi-random structures---characteristic of important
error-correcting codes---may provide for high-performance computation in
artificial neural networks and the brain.

 <dc:description>  The impact of citizen journalism raises important video integrity and
credibility issues. In this article, we introduce Vamos, the first user
transparent video &quot;liveness&quot; verification solution based on video motion, that
accommodates the full range of camera movements, and supports videos of
arbitrary length. Vamos uses the agreement between video motion and camera
movement to corroborate the video authenticity. Vamos can be integrated into
any mobile video capture application without requiring special user training.
We develop novel attacks that target liveness verification solutions. The
attacks leverage both fully automated algorithms and trained human experts. We
introduce the concept of video motion categories to annotate the camera and
user motion characteristics of arbitrary videos. We show that the performance
of Vamos depends on the video motion category. Even though Vamos uses motion as
a basis for verification, we observe a surprising and seemingly
counter-intuitive resilience against attacks performed on relatively
&quot;stationary&quot; video chunks, which turn out to contain hard-to-imitate
involuntary movements. We show that overall the accuracy of Vamos on the task
of verifying whole length videos exceeds 93\% against the new attacks.

 <dc:description>  Treatment effects can be estimated from observational data as the difference
in potential outcomes. In this paper, we address the challenge of estimating
the potential outcome when treatment-dose levels can vary continuously over
time. Further, the outcome variable may not be measured at a regular frequency.
Our proposed solution represents the treatment response curves using linear
time-invariant dynamical systems---this provides a flexible means for modeling
response over time to highly variable dose curves. Moreover, for multivariate
data, the proposed method: uncovers shared structure in treatment response and
the baseline across multiple markers; and, flexibly models challenging
correlation structure both across and within signals over time. For this, we
build upon the framework of multiple-output Gaussian Processes. On simulated
and a challenging clinical dataset, we show significant gains in accuracy over
state-of-the-art models.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework to measure, evaluate, and rank campaign effectiveness
in the ongoing 2016 U.S. presidential election. Using Twitter data collected
from Sept. 2015 to Jan. 2016, we first uncover the tweeting tactics of the
candidates and second, using negative binomial regression and exploiting the
variations in 'likes,' we evaluate the effectiveness of these tactics. Thirdly,
we rank the candidates' campaign tactics by calculating the conditional
expectation of their generated 'likes.'
  We show that while Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio put much weight on President
Obama, this tactic is not being well received by their supporters. We
demonstrate that Hillary Clinton's tactic of linking herself to President Obama
resonates well with her supporters but the same is not true for Bernie Sanders.
In addition, we show that Donald Trump is a major topic for all the other
candidates and that the women issue is equally emphasized in Sanders' campaign
as in Clinton's.
  Finally, we suggest two ways that politicians can use the feedback mechanism
in social media to improve their campaign: (1) use feedback from social media
to improve campaign tactics within social media; (2) prototype policies and
test the public response from the social media.

 <dc:description>  Frequency modulation (FM) is a form of radio broadcasting which is widely
used nowadays and has been for almost a century. We suggest a
software-defined-radio (SDR) receiver for FM demodulation that adopts an
end-to-end learning based approach and utilizes the prior information of
transmitted speech message in the demodulation process. The receiver detects
and enhances speech from the in-phase and quadrature components of its base
band version. The new system yields high performance detection for both
acoustical disturbances, and communication channel noise and is foreseen to
out-perform the established methods for low signal to noise ratio (SNR)
conditions in both mean square error and in perceptual evaluation of speech
quality score.

 <dc:description>  A computational method, based on $\ell_1$-minimization, is proposed for the
problem of link flow correction, when the available traffic flow data on many
links in a road network are inconsistent with respect to the flow conservation
law. Without extra information, the problem is generally ill-posed when a large
portion of the link sensors are unhealthy. It is possible, however, to correct
the corrupted link flows \textit{accurately} with the proposed method under a
recoverability condition if there are only a few bad sensors which are located
at certain links. We analytically identify the links that are robust to
miscounts and relate them to the geometric structure of the traffic network by
introducing the recoverability concept and an algorithm for computing it. The
recoverability condition for corrupted links is simply the associated
recoverability being greater than 1. In a more realistic setting, besides the
unhealthy link sensors, small measurement noises may be present at the other
sensors. Under the same recoverability condition, our method guarantees to give
an estimated traffic flow fairly close to the ground-truth data and leads to a
bound for the correction error. Both synthetic and real-world examples are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We show that approximate similarity (near neighbour) search can be solved in
high dimensions with performance matching state of the art (data independent)
Locality Sensitive Hashing, but with a guarantee of no false negatives.
Specifically we give two data structures for common problems. For
$c$-approximate near neighbour in Hamming space we get query time
$dn^{1/c+o(1)}$ and space $dn^{1+1/c+o(1)}$ matching that of [Indyk and
Motwani, 1998] and answering a long standing open question from [Indyk, 2000a]
and [Pagh, 2016] in the affirmative. For $(s_1,s_2)$-approximate Jaccard
similarity we get query time $d^2n^{\rho+o(1)}$ and space $d^2n^{1+\rho+o(1)}$,
$\rho=\log\frac{1+s_1}{2s_1}\big/\log\frac{1+s_2}{2s_2}$, when sets have equal
size, matching the performance of [Pagh and Christiani, 2017].
  The algorithms are based on space partitions, as with classic LSH, but we
construct these using a combination of brute force, tensoring and splitter
functions \`a la [Naor et al., 1995]. We also show two dimensionality reduction
lemmas with 1-sided error.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a method for obtaining tail-bounds for random
variables satisfying certain probabilistic recurrences that arise in the
analysis of randomized parallel divide and conquer algorithms. In such
algorithms, some computation is initially done to process an input x, which is
then randomly split into subproblems $h_1(x), ..., h_n(x)$, and the algorithm
proceeds recursively in parallel on each subproblem. The total work on input x,
W(x), then satisfies a probabilistic recurrence of the form $W(x) = a(x) +
\sum_{i=1}^n W (h_i(x))$, and the span (the longest chain of sequential
dependencies), satisfies $S(x) = b(x) + \max_{i=1}^n S(h_i(x))$, where a(x) and
b(x) are the work and span to split x and combine the results of the recursive
calls.
  Karp has previously presented methods for obtaining tail-bounds in the case
when n = 1, and under certain stronger assumptions for the work-recurrence when
n &gt; 1, but left open the question of the span-recurrence. We first show how to
extend his technique to handle the span-recurrence. We then show that in some
cases, the work-recurrence can be bounded under simpler assumptions than Karp's
by transforming it into a related span-recurrence and applying our first
result. We demonstrate our results by deriving tail bounds for the work and
span of quicksort and the height of a randomly generated binary search tree.

 <dc:description>  Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that are
used to represent non-tree-like evolutionary histories that arise in organisms
such as plants and bacteria, or uncertainty in evolutionary histories. An
\emph{unrooted} phylogenetic network on a nonempty, finite set $X$ of taxa, or
\emph{network}, is a connected graph in which every vertex has degree 1 or 3
and whose leaf-set is $X$. It is called a \emph{phylogenetic tree} if the
underlying graph is a tree. In this paper we consider properties of
\emph{tree-based networks}, that is, networks that can be constructed by adding
edges into a phylogenetic tree. We show that although they have some properties
in common with their rooted analogues which have recently drawn much attention
in the literature, they have some striking differences in terms of both their
structural and computational properties. We expect that our results could
eventually have applications to, for example, detecting horizontal gene
transfer or hyrbridization which are important factors in the evolution of many
organisms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose computational approaches for the zero forcing
problem, the connected zero forcing problem, and the problem of forcing a graph
within a specified number of timesteps. Our approaches are based on a
combination of integer programming models and combinatorial algorithms, and
include formulations for zero forcing as a dynamic process, and as a
set-covering problem. We explore several solution strategies for these models,
and numerically compare them to the well-known Wavefront algorithm for zero
forcing developed by Grout et al. Our proposed algorithms for connected zero
forcing and for controlling the propagation time are the first general-purpose
computational methods for these problems; they are comparable in performance to
Wavefront and superior to brute force computation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a principled convolutional neural pyramid (CNP) framework for
general low-level vision and image processing tasks. It is based on the
essential finding that many applications require large receptive fields for
structure understanding. But corresponding neural networks for regression
either stack many layers or apply large kernels to achieve it, which is
computationally very costly. Our pyramid structure can greatly enlarge the
field while not sacrificing computation efficiency. Extra benefit includes
adaptive network depth and progressive upsampling for quasi-realtime testing on
VGA-size input. Our method profits a broad set of applications, such as
depth/RGB image restoration, completion, noise/artifact removal, edge
refinement, image filtering, image enhancement and colorization.

 <dc:title>On Sensing, Agility, and Computation Requirements for a Data-gathering

 <dc:description>  We consider a robotic vehicle tasked with gathering information by visiting a
set of spatially-distributed data sources, the locations of which are not known
a priori, but are discovered on the fly. We assume a first-order robot dynamics
involving drift and that the locations of the data sources are
Poisson-distributed. In this setting, we characterize the performance of the
robot in terms of its sensing, agility, and computation capabilities. More
specifically, the robot's performance is characterized in terms of its ability
to sense the target locations from a distance, to maneuver quickly, and to
perform computations for inference and planning. We also characterize the
performance of the robot in terms of the amount and distribution of information
that can be acquired at each data source. The following are among our
theoretical results: the distribution of the amount of information among the
target locations immensely impacts the requirements for sensing targets from a
distance; performance increases with increasing maneuvering capability, but
with diminishing returns; and the computation requirements increase more
rapidly for planning as opposed to inference, with both increasing sensing
range and maneuvering ability. We provide computational experiments to validate
our theoretical results. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be
utilized in the co-design of sensing, actuation, and computation capabilities
of mobile robotic systems for an information-gathering mission. Our proof
techniques establish novel connections between the fundamental problems of
robotic information-gathering and the last-passage percolation problem of
statistical mechanics, which may be of interest on its own right.

 <dc:title>Distributed Average Tracking for Lipschitz-Type Nonlinear Dynamical

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a distributed average tracking problem is studied for
Lipschitz-type nonlinear dynamical systems. The objective is to design
distributed average tracking algorithms for locally interactive agents to track
the average of multiple reference signals. Here, in both the agents' and the
reference signals' dynamics, there is a nonlinear term satisfying the
Lipschitz-type condition. Three types of distributed average tracking
algorithms are designed. First, based on state-dependent-gain designing
approaches, a robust distributed average tracking algorithm is developed to
solve distributed average tracking problems without requiring the same initial
condition. Second, by using a gain adaption scheme, an adaptive distributed
average tracking algorithm is proposed in this paper to remove the requirement
that the Lipschitz constant is known for agents. Third, to reduce chattering
and make the algorithms easier to implement, a continuous distributed average
tracking algorithm based on a time-varying boundary layer is further designed
as a continuous approximation of the previous discontinuous distributed average
tracking algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for modeling threaded discussions on
social media using a graph-structured bidirectional LSTM which represents both
hierarchical and temporal conversation structure. In experiments with a task of
predicting popularity of comments in Reddit discussions, the proposed model
outperforms a node-independent architecture for different sets of input
features. Analyses show a benefit to the model over the full course of the
discussion, improving detection in both early and late stages. Further, the use
of language cues with the bidirectional tree state updates helps with
identifying controversial comments.

 <dc:description>  A promising paradigm for achieving highly efficient deep neural networks is
the idea of evolutionary deep intelligence, which mimics biological evolution
processes to progressively synthesize more efficient networks. A crucial design
factor in evolutionary deep intelligence is the genetic encoding scheme used to
simulate heredity and determine the architectures of offspring networks. In
this study, we take a deeper look at the notion of synaptic cluster-driven
evolution of deep neural networks which guides the evolution process towards
the formation of a highly sparse set of synaptic clusters in offspring
networks. Utilizing a synaptic cluster-driven genetic encoding, the
probabilistic encoding of synaptic traits considers not only individual
synaptic properties but also inter-synaptic relationships within a deep neural
network. This process results in highly sparse offspring networks which are
particularly tailored for parallel computational devices such as GPUs and deep
neural network accelerator chips. Comprehensive experimental results using four
well-known deep neural network architectures (LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet-56, and
DetectNet) on two different tasks (object categorization and object detection)
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. Cluster-driven genetic
encoding scheme synthesizes networks that can achieve state-of-the-art
performance with significantly smaller number of synapses than that of the
original ancestor network. ($\sim$125-fold decrease in synapses for MNIST).
Furthermore, the improved cluster efficiency in the generated offspring
networks ($\sim$9.71-fold decrease in clusters for MNIST and a $\sim$8.16-fold
decrease in clusters for KITTI) is particularly useful for accelerated
performance on parallel computing hardware architectures such as those in GPUs
and deep neural network accelerator chips.

 <dc:title>&quot;RAPID&quot; Regions-of-Interest Detection In Big Histopathological Images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sulimowicz, Li</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ahmad, Ishfaq</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The sheer volume and size of histopathological images (e.g.,10^6 MPixel)
underscores the need for faster and more accurate Regions-of-interest (ROI)
detection algorithms. In this paper, we propose such an algorithm, which has
four main components that help achieve greater accuracy and faster speed:
First, while using coarse-to-fine topology preserving segmentation as the
baseline, the proposed algorithm uses a superpixel regularity optimization
scheme for avoiding irregular and extremely small superpixels. Second, the
proposed technique employs a prediction strategy to focus only on important
superpixels at finer image levels. Third, the algorithm reuses the information
gained from the coarsest image level at other finer image levels. Both the
second and the third components drastically lower the complexity. Fourth, the
algorithm employs a highly effective parallelization scheme using adap- tive
data partitioning, which gains high speedup. Experimental results, conducted on
the BSD500 [1] and 500 whole-slide histological images from the National Lung
Screening Trial (NLST)1 dataset, confirm that the proposed algorithm gained 13
times speedup compared with the baseline, and around 160 times compared with
SLIC [11], without losing accuracy.

 <dc:title>A Zero Knowledge Sumcheck and its Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many seminal results in Interactive Proofs (IPs) use algebraic techniques
based on low-degree polynomials, the study of which is pervasive in theoretical
computer science. Unfortunately, known methods for endowing such proofs with
zero knowledge guarantees do not retain this rich algebraic structure.
  In this work, we develop algebraic techniques for obtaining zero knowledge
variants of proof protocols in a way that leverages and preserves their
algebraic structure. Our constructions achieve unconditional (perfect) zero
knowledge in the Interactive Probabilistically Checkable Proof (IPCP) model of
Kalai and Raz [KR08] (the prover first sends a PCP oracle, then the prover and
verifier engage in an Interactive Proof in which the verifier may query the
PCP).
  Our main result is a zero knowledge variant of the sumcheck protocol [LFKN92]
in the IPCP model. The sumcheck protocol is a key building block in many IPs,
including the protocol for polynomial-space computation due to Shamir [Sha92],
and the protocol for parallel computation due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and
Rothblum [GKR15]. A core component of our result is an algebraic commitment
scheme, whose hiding property is guaranteed by algebraic query complexity lower
bounds [AW09,JKRS09]. This commitment scheme can then be used to considerably
strengthen our previous work [BCFGRS16] that gives a sumcheck protocol with
much weaker zero knowledge guarantees, itself using algebraic techniques based
on algorithms for polynomial identity testing [RS05,BW04].
  We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques by deriving zero knowledge
variants of well-known protocols based on algebraic techniques, including the
protocols of Shamir and of Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, as well as the
protocol of Babai, Fortnow, and Lund [BFL91].

 <dc:description>  Recently, hashing methods have been widely used in large-scale image
retrieval. However, most existing hashing methods did not consider the
hierarchical relation of labels, which means that they ignored the rich
information stored in the hierarchy. Moreover, most of previous works treat
each bit in a hash code equally, which does not meet the scenario of
hierarchical labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing
method, called supervised hierarchical deep hashing (SHDH), to perform hash
code learning for hierarchical labeled data. Specifically, we define a novel
similarity formula for hierarchical labeled data by weighting each layer, and
design a deep convolutional neural network to obtain a hash code for each data
point. Extensive experiments on several real-world public datasets show that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in the image
retrieval task.

 <dc:description>  Recently, topic modeling has been widely used to discover the abstract topics
in text corpora. Most of the existing topic models are based on the assumption
of three-layer hierarchical Bayesian structure, i.e. each document is modeled
as a probability distribution over topics, and each topic is a probability
distribution over words. However, the assumption is not optimal. Intuitively,
it's more reasonable to assume that each topic is a probability distribution
over concepts, and then each concept is a probability distribution over words,
i.e. adding a latent concept layer between topic layer and word layer in
traditional three-layer assumption. In this paper, we verify the proposed
assumption by incorporating the new assumption in two representative topic
models, and obtain two novel topic models. Extensive experiments were conducted
among the proposed models and corresponding baselines, and the results show
that the proposed models significantly outperform the baselines in terms of
case study and perplexity, which means the new assumption is more reasonable
than traditional one.

 <dc:description>  The shortest augmenting path technique is one of the fundamental ideas used
in maximum matching and maximum flow algorithms. Since being introduced by
Edmonds and Karp in 1972, it has been widely applied in many different
settings. Surprisingly, despite this extensive usage, it is still not well
understood even in the simplest case: online bipartite matching problem on
trees. In this problem a bipartite tree $T=(W \uplus B, E)$ is being revealed
online, i.e., in each round one vertex from $B$ with its incident edges
arrives. It was conjectured by Chaudhuri et. al. [K. Chaudhuri, C. Daskalakis,
R. D. Kleinberg, and H. Lin. Online bipartite perfect matching with
augmentations. In INFOCOM 2009] that the total length of all shortest
augmenting paths found is $O(n \log n)$. In this paper, we prove a tight $O(n
\log n)$ upper bound for the total length of shortest augmenting paths for
trees improving over $O(n \log^2 n)$ bound [B. Bosek, D. Leniowski, P.
Sankowski, and A. Zych. Shortest augmenting paths for online matchings on
trees. In WAOA 2015].

 <dc:description>  Precise (sub-meter level) real-time navigation using a space-capable
single-frequency global positioning system (GPS) receiver and ultra-rapid
(real-time) ephemerides from the international global navigation satellite
systems service is proposed for low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites. The C/A
code and L1 carrier phase measurements are combined and single-differenced to
eliminate first-order ionospheric effects and receiver clock offsets. A
random-walk process is employed to model the phase ambiguities in order to
absorb the time-varying and satellite-specific higher-order measurement errors
as well as the GPS clock correction errors. A sequential Kalman filter which
incorporates the known orbital dynamic model is developed to estimate orbital
states and phase ambiguities without matrix inversion. Real flight data from
the single-frequency GPS receiver onboard China's SJ-9A small satellite are
processed to evaluate the orbit determination accuracy. Statistics from
internal orbit assessments indicate that three-dimensional accuracies of better
than 0.50 m and 0.55 mm/s are achieved for position and velocity, respectively.

 <dc:description>  The paper addresses a method for spreading messages in social networks
through an initial acceleration by Spreading Groups. These groups start the
spread which eventually reaches a larger portion of the network. The use of
spreading groups creates a final flow which resembles the spread through the
nodes with the highest level of influence (opinion leaders). While harnessing
opinion leaders to spread messages is generally costly, the formation of
spreading groups is merely a technical issue, and can be done by computerized
bots. The paper presents an information flow model and inspects the model
through a dataset of Nasdaq-related tweets.

 <dc:title>Restricted Isometry Property of Gaussian Random Projection for Finite

 <dc:description>  Dimension reduction plays an essential role when decreasing the complexity of
solving large-scale problems. The well-known Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) Lemma
and Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) admit the use of random projection to
reduce the dimension while keeping the Euclidean distance, which leads to the
boom of Compressed Sensing and the field of sparsity related signal processing.
Recently, successful applications of sparse models in computer vision and
machine learning have increasingly hinted that the underlying structure of high
dimensional data looks more like a union of subspaces (UoS). In this paper,
motivated by JL Lemma and an emerging field of Compressed Subspace Clustering
(CSC), we study for the first time the RIP of Gaussian random matrices for the
compression of two subspaces based on the generalized projection $F$-norm
distance. We theoretically prove that with high probability the affinity or
distance between two projected subspaces are concentrated around their
estimates. When the ambient dimension after projection is sufficiently large,
the affinity and distance between two subspaces almost remain unchanged after
random projection. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical work.

 <dc:description>  Most popular deep models for action recognition split video sequences into
short sub-sequences consisting of a few frames; frame-based features are then
pooled for recognizing the activity. Usually, this pooling step discards the
temporal order of the frames, which could otherwise be used for better
recognition. Towards this end, we propose a novel pooling method, generalized
rank pooling (GRP), that takes as input, features from the intermediate layers
of a CNN that is trained on tiny sub-sequences, and produces as output the
parameters of a subspace which (i) provides a low-rank approximation to the
features and (ii) preserves their temporal order. We propose to use these
parameters as a compact representation for the video sequence, which is then
used in a classification setup. We formulate an objective for computing this
subspace as a Riemannian optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, and
propose an efficient conjugate gradient scheme for solving it. Experiments on
several activity recognition datasets show that our scheme leads to
state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Cross-modal retrieval has become a highlighted research topic for retrieval
across multimedia data such as image and text. A two-stage learning framework
is widely adopted by most existing methods based on Deep Neural Network (DNN):
The first learning stage is to generate separate representation for each
modality, and the second learning stage is to get the cross-modal common
representation. However, the existing methods have three limitations: (1) In
the first learning stage, they only model intra-modality correlation, but
ignore inter-modality correlation with rich complementary context. (2) In the
second learning stage, they only adopt shallow networks with single-loss
regularization, but ignore the intrinsic relevance of intra-modality and
inter-modality correlation. (3) Only original instances are considered while
the complementary fine-grained clues provided by their patches are ignored. For
addressing the above problems, this paper proposes a cross-modal correlation
learning (CCL) approach with multi-grained fusion by hierarchical network, and
the contributions are as follows: (1) In the first learning stage, CCL exploits
multi-level association with joint optimization to preserve the complementary
context from intra-modality and inter-modality correlation simultaneously. (2)
In the second learning stage, a multi-task learning strategy is designed to
adaptively balance the intra-modality semantic category constraints and
inter-modality pairwise similarity constraints. (3) CCL adopts multi-grained
modeling, which fuses the coarse-grained instances and fine-grained patches to
make cross-modal correlation more precise. Comparing with 13 state-of-the-art
methods on 6 widely-used cross-modal datasets, the experimental results show
our CCL approach achieves the best performance.

 <dc:title>Partial Face Detection in the Mobile Domain</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mahbub, Upal</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Generic face detection algorithms do not perform well in the mobile domain
due to significant presence of occluded and partially visible faces. One
promising technique to handle the challenge of partial faces is to design face
detectors based on facial segments. In this paper two different approaches of
facial segment-based face detection are discussed, namely, proposal-based
detection and detection by end-to-end regression. Methods that follow the first
approach rely on generating face proposals that contain facial segment
information. The three detectors following this approach, namely Facial
Segment-based Face Detector (FSFD), SegFace and DeepSegFace, discussed in this
paper, perform binary classification on each proposal based on features learned
from facial segments. The process of proposal generation, however, needs to be
handled separately, which can be very time consuming, and is not truly
necessary given the nature of the active authentication problem. Hence a novel
algorithm, Deep Regression-based User Image Detector (DRUID) is proposed, which
shifts from the classification to the regression paradigm, thus obviating the
need for proposal generation. DRUID has an unique network architecture with
customized loss functions, is trained using a relatively small amount of data
by utilizing a novel data augmentation scheme and is fast since it outputs the
bounding boxes of a face and its segments in a single pass. Being robust to
occlusion by design, the facial segment-based face detection methods,
especially DRUID show superior performance over other state-of-the-art face
detectors in terms of precision-recall and ROC curve on two mobile face
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Recent literature on deep neural networks for tagging of highly energetic
jets resulting from top quark decays has focused on image based techniques or
multivariate approaches using high-level jet substructure variables. Here, a
sequential approach to this task is taken by using an ordered sequence of jet
constituents as training inputs. Unlike the majority of previous approaches,
this strategy does not result in a loss of information during pixelisation or
the calculation of high level features. The jet classification method achieves
a background rejection of 45 at a 50% efficiency operating point for
reconstruction level jets with transverse momentum range of 600 to 2500 GeV and
is insensitive to multiple proton-proton interactions at the levels expected
throughout Run 2 of the LHC.

 <dc:description>  We characterize a multi tier network with classical macro cells, and multi
radio access technology (RAT) small cells, which are able to operate in
microwave and millimeter-wave (mm-wave) bands. The small cells are assumed to
be deployed along roads modeled as a Poisson line process. This
characterization is more realistic as compared to the classical Poisson point
processes typically used in literature. In this context, we derive the
association and RAT selection probabilities of the typical user under various
system parameters such as the small cell deployment density and mm-wave antenna
gain, and with varying street densities. Finally, we calculate the signal to
interference plus noise ratio (SINR) coverage probability for the typical user
considering a tractable dominant interference based model for mm-wave
interference. Our analysis reveals the need of deploying more small cells per
street in cities with more streets to maintain coverage, and highlights that
mm-wave RAT in small cells can help to improve the SINR performance of the
users.

 <dc:description>  We argue for network slicing as an efficient solution that addresses the
diverse requirements of 5G mobile networks, thus providing the necessary
flexibility and scalability associated with future network implementations. We
elaborate on the challenges that emerge when we design 5G networks based on
network slicing. We focus on the architectural aspects associated with the
coexistence of dedicated as well as shared slices in the network. In
particular, we analyze the realization options of a flexible radio access
network with focus on network slicing and their impact on the design of 5G
mobile networks. In addition to the technical study, this paper provides an
investigation of the revenue potential of network slicing, where the
applications that originate from such concept and the profit capabilities from
the network operator's perspective are put forward.

 <dc:description>  This document describes in detail an inventory of 50 semantic labels designed
to characterize the use of adpositions and case markers at a somewhat coarse
level of granularity. Version 2 is a revision of the supersense inventory
proposed for English by Schneider et al. (2015, 2016) and documented in
PrepWiki (henceforth &quot;v1&quot;), which in turn was based on previous schemes. The
present inventory was developed after extensive review of the v1 corpus
annotations for English, plus previously unanalyzed 's (genitive case)
possessives (Blodgett and Schneider, 2018), as well as consideration of
adposition and case phenomena in Hebrew, Hindi, and Korean. Hwang et al. (2017)
present the theoretical underpinnings of the v2 scheme. Though the v2 inventory
aspires to be universal, this document is specific to English; documentation
for other languages will be published separately.
  The STREUSLE 4.0 corpus containing English annotations according to this
scheme will be released at https://github.com/nert-gu/streusle/.

 <dc:title>A Fine-Grained Hierarchy of Hard Problems in the Separated Fragment</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently, the separated fragment (SF) has been introduced and proved to be
decidable. Its defining principle is that universally and existentially
quantified variables may not occur together in atoms. The known upper bound on
the time required to decide SF's satisfiability problem is formulated in terms
of quantifier alternations: Given an SF sentence $\exists \vec{z} \forall
\vec{x}_1 \exists \vec{y}_1 \ldots \forall \vec{x}_n \exists \vec{y}_n . \psi$
in which $\psi$ is quantifier free, satisfiability can be decided in
nondeterministic $n$-fold exponential time. In the present paper, we conduct a
more fine-grained analysis of the complexity of SF-satisfiability. We derive an
upper and a lower bound in terms of the degree of interaction of existential
variables (short: degree)}---a novel measure of how many separate existential
quantifier blocks in a sentence are connected via joint occurrences of
variables in atoms. Our main result is the $k$-NEXPTIME-completeness of the
satisfiability problem for the set $SF_{\leq k}$ of all SF sentences that have
degree $k$ or smaller. Consequently, we show that SF-satisfiability is
non-elementary in general, since SF is defined without restrictions on the
degree. Beyond trivial lower bounds, nothing has been known about the hardness
of SF-satisfiability so far.

 <dc:description>  Quantum machine learning witnesses an increasing amount of quantum algorithms
for data-driven decision making, a problem with potential applications ranging
from automated image recognition to medical diagnosis. Many of those algorithms
are implementations of quantum classifiers, or models for the classification of
data inputs with a quantum computer. Following the success of collective
decision making with ensembles in classical machine learning, this paper
introduces the concept of quantum ensembles of quantum classifiers. Creating
the ensemble corresponds to a state preparation routine, after which the
quantum classifiers are evaluated in parallel and their combined decision is
accessed by a single-qubit measurement. This framework naturally allows for
exponentially large ensembles in which -- similar to Bayesian learning -- the
individual classifiers do not have to be trained. As an example, we analyse an
exponentially large quantum ensemble in which each classifier is weighed
according to its performance in classifying the training data, leading to new
results for quantum as well as classical machine learning.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical clustering is a recursive partitioning of a dataset into
clusters at an increasingly finer granularity. Motivated by the fact that most
work on hierarchical clustering was based on providing algorithms, rather than
optimizing a specific objective, Dasgupta framed similarity-based hierarchical
clustering as a combinatorial optimization problem, where a `good' hierarchical
clustering is one that minimizes some cost function. He showed that this cost
function has certain desirable properties.
  We take an axiomatic approach to defining `good' objective functions for both
similarity and dissimilarity-based hierarchical clustering. We characterize a
set of &quot;admissible&quot; objective functions (that includes Dasgupta's one) that
have the property that when the input admits a `natural' hierarchical
clustering, it has an optimal value.
  Equipped with a suitable objective function, we analyze the performance of
practical algorithms, as well as develop better algorithms. For
similarity-based hierarchical clustering, Dasgupta showed that the divisive
sparsest-cut approach achieves an $O(\log^{3/2} n)$-approximation. We give a
refined analysis of the algorithm and show that it in fact achieves an
$O(\sqrt{\log n})$-approx. (Charikar and Chatziafratis independently proved
that it is a $O(\sqrt{\log n})$-approx.). This improves upon the LP-based
$O(\log n)$-approx. of Roy and Pokutta. For dissimilarity-based hierarchical
clustering, we show that the classic average-linkage algorithm gives a factor 2
approx., and provide a simple and better algorithm that gives a factor 3/2
approx..
  Finally, we consider `beyond-worst-case' scenario through a generalisation of
the stochastic block model for hierarchical clustering. We show that Dasgupta's
cost function has desirable properties for these inputs and we provide a simple
1 + o(1)-approximation in this setting.

 <dc:description>  This paper revisits the definition of linear time-invariant (LTI) stochastic

derive a canonical representation of an LTI stochastic process and a physically

 <dc:description>  We evaluate a semantic parser based on a character-based sequence-to-sequence
model in the context of the SemEval-2017 shared task on semantic parsing for
AMRs. With data augmentation, super characters, and POS-tagging we gain major
improvements in performance compared to a baseline character-level model.
Although we improve on previous character-based neural semantic parsing models,
the overall accuracy is still lower than a state-of-the-art AMR parser. An
ensemble combining our neural semantic parser with an existing, traditional
parser, yields a small gain in performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of depth estimation from a single still
image. Inspired by recent works on multi- scale convolutional neural networks
(CNN), we propose a deep model which fuses complementary information derived
from multiple CNN side outputs. Different from previous methods, the
integration is obtained by means of continuous Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). In particular, we propose two different variations, one based on a
cascade of multiple CRFs, the other on a unified graphical model. By designing
a novel CNN implementation of mean-field updates for continuous CRFs, we show
that both proposed models can be regarded as sequential deep networks and that
training can be performed end-to-end. Through extensive experimental evaluation
we demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed approach and establish new
state of the art results on publicly available datasets.

 <dc:description>  Team semantics is the mathematical framework of modern logics of dependence
and independence in which formulae are interpreted by sets of assignments
(teams) instead of single assignments as in first-order logic. In order to
deepen the fruitful interplay between team semantics and database dependency
theory, we define &quot;Polyteam Semantics&quot; in which formulae are evaluated over a
family of teams. We begin by defining a novel polyteam variant of dependence
atoms and give a finite axiomatisation for the associated implication problem.
We also characterise the expressive power of poly-dependence logic by
properties of polyteams that are downward closed and definable in existential
second-order logic (ESO). The analogous result is shown to hold for
poly-independence logic and all ESO-definable properties.

 <dc:description>  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is used for non-invasive diagnosis of
diabetic macular edema assessing the retinal layers. In this paper, we propose
a new fully convolutional deep architecture, termed ReLayNet, for end-to-end
segmentation of retinal layers and fluid masses in eye OCT scans. ReLayNet uses
a contracting path of convolutional blocks (encoders) to learn a hierarchy of
contextual features, followed by an expansive path of convolutional blocks
(decoders) for semantic segmentation. ReLayNet is trained to optimize a joint
loss function comprising of weighted logistic regression and Dice overlap loss.
The framework is validated on a publicly available benchmark dataset with
comparisons against five state-of-the-art segmentation methods including two
deep learning based approaches to substantiate its effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  Egocentric vision consists in acquiring images along the day from a first
person point-of-view using wearable cameras. The automatic analysis of this
information allows to discover daily patterns for improving the quality of life
of the user. A natural topic that arises in egocentric vision is storytelling,
that is, how to understand and tell the story relying behind the pictures. In
this paper, we tackle storytelling as an egocentric sequences description
problem. We propose a novel methodology that exploits information from
temporally neighboring events, matching precisely the nature of egocentric
sequences. Furthermore, we present a new method for multimodal data fusion
consisting on a multi-input attention recurrent network. We also publish the
first dataset for egocentric image sequences description, consisting of 1,339
events with 3,991 descriptions, from 55 days acquired by 11 people.
Furthermore, we prove that our proposal outperforms classical attentional
encoder-decoder methods for video description.

 <dc:description>  Generating and manipulating human facial images using high-level attributal
controls are important and interesting problems. The models proposed in
previous work can solve one of these two problems (generation or manipulation),
but not both coherently. This paper proposes a novel model that learns how to
both generate and modify the facial image from high-level semantic attributes.
Our key idea is to formulate a Semi-Latent Facial Attribute Space (SL-FAS) to
systematically learn relationship between user-defined and latent attributes,
as well as between those attributes and RGB imagery. As part of this newly
formulated space, we propose a new model --- SL-GAN which is a specific form of
Generative Adversarial Network. Finally, we present an iterative training
algorithm for SL-GAN. The experiments on recent CelebA and CASIA-WebFace
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. We will also
make data, pre-trained models and code available.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the impact of the base station (BS) idle mode capability
(IMC) on the network performance of multi-tier and dense heterogeneous cellular
networks (HCNs). Different from most existing works that investigated network
scenarios with an infinite number of user equipments (UEs), we consider a more
practical setup with a finite number of UEs in our analysis. More specifically,
we derive the probability of which BS tier a typical UE should associate to and
the expression of the activated BS density in each tier. Based on such results,
analytical expressions for the coverage probability and the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) in each tier are also obtained. The impact of the IMC on the
performance of all BS tiers is shown to be significant. In particular, there
will be a surplus of BSs when the BS density in each tier exceeds the UE
density, and the overall coverage probability as well as the ASE continuously
increase when the BS IMC is applied. Such finding is distinctively different
from that in existing work. Thus, our result sheds new light on the design and
deployment of the future 5G HCNs.

 <dc:title>New Subquadratic Approximation Algorithms for the Girth</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of approximating the girth, $g$, of an unweighted and
undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. A seminal result of
Itai and Rodeh [SICOMP'78] gave an additive $1$-approximation in $O(n^2)$ time,
and the main open question is thus how well we can do in subquadratic time.
  In this paper we present two main results. The first is a
$(1+\varepsilon,O(1))$-approximation in truly subquadratic time. Specifically,
for any $k\ge 2$ our algorithm returns a cycle of length $2\lceil
g/2\rceil+2\left\lceil\frac{g}{2(k-1)}\right\rceil$ in $\tilde{O}(n^{2-1/k})$
time. This generalizes the results of Lingas and Lundell [IPL'09] who showed it
for the special case of $k=2$ and Roditty and Vassilevska Williams [SODA'12]
who showed it for $k=3$. Our second result is to present an
$O(1)$-approximation running in $O(n^{1+\varepsilon})$ time for any
$\varepsilon &gt; 0$. Prior to this work the fastest constant-factor approximation
was the $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ time $8/3$-approximation of Lingas and Lundell
[IPL'09] using the algorithm corresponding to the special case $k=2$ of our
first result.

 <dc:description>  If the influence diagram (ID) depicting a Bayesian game is common knowledge
to its players then additional assumptions may allow the players to make use of
its embodied irrelevance statements. They can then use these to discover a
simpler game which still embodies both their optimal decision policies. However
the impact of this result has been rather limited because many common Bayesian
games do not exhibit sufficient symmetry to be fully and efficiently
represented by an ID. The tree-based chain event graph (CEG) has been developed
specifically for such asymmetric problems. By using these graphs rational
players can make analogous deductions, assuming the topology of the CEG as
common knowledge. In this paper we describe these powerful new techniques and
illustrate them through an example modelling a game played between a government
department and the provider of a website designed to radicalise vulnerable
people.

 <dc:description>  We study Proportional Approval Voting (PAV)---an election system used for
choosing representatives bodies, such as parliaments, based on preferences of a
population of voters over individual candidates. We observe that the problem of
computing the outcome of PAV can be cast as a variant of the standard k-median
problem. Our main result is that, due to the specific (harmonic) cost
structure, the problem allows constant factor approximation that does not
require the underlying connection costs to be metric. To the best of our
knowledge this is the first constant factor approximation algorithm for a
facility location type problem not assuming triangle inequalities for
connection costs.
  The algorithm we propose is a standard dependent rounding routine
[Srinivasan, FOCS'01] applied to the solution of a natural LP-relaxation of the
problem. The rounding process is well known to produce distributions over
integral solutions satisfying Negative Correlation (NC), which is usually
sufficient for the analysis of approximation guarantees offered by rounding
procedures. In our analysis, however, we need to use the fact that the
carefully implemented rounding process satisfies a stronger property, called
Binary Negative Association (BNA). We also give a compact example for that if
the pairs of elements to be correlated are being selected by an adaptive
adversary, then the BNA may not hold.

 <dc:title>The (1+$\lambda$) Evolutionary Algorithm with Self-Adjusting Mutation

 <dc:description>  We propose a new way to self-adjust the mutation rate in population-based
evolutionary algorithms in discrete search spaces. Roughly speaking, it
consists of creating half the offspring with a mutation rate that is twice the
current mutation rate and the other half with half the current rate. The
mutation rate is then updated to the rate used in that subpopulation which
contains the best offspring.
  We analyze how the $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary algorithm with this
self-adjusting mutation rate optimizes the OneMax test function. We prove that
this dynamic version of the $(1+\lambda)$~EA finds the optimum in an expected
optimization time (number of fitness evaluations) of
$O(n\lambda/\!\log\lambda+n\log n)$. This time is asymptotically smaller than
the optimization time of the classic $(1+\lambda)$ EA. Previous work shows that
this performance is best-possible among all $\lambda$-parallel mutation-based
unbiased black-box algorithms.
  This result shows that the new way of adjusting the mutation rate can find
optimal dynamic parameter values on the fly. Since our adjustment mechanism is
simpler than the ones previously used for adjusting the mutation rate and does
not have parameters itself, we are optimistic that it will find other
applications.

 <dc:description>  Clustering is a useful data exploratory method with its wide applicability in
multiple fields. However, data clustering greatly relies on initialization of
cluster centers that can result in large intra-cluster variance and dead
centers, therefore leading to sub-optimal solutions. This paper proposes a
novel variance based version of the conventional Moving K-Means (MKM) algorithm
called Variance Based Moving K-Means (VMKM) that can partition data into
optimal homogeneous clusters, irrespective of cluster initialization. The
algorithm utilizes a novel distance metric and a unique data element selection
criteria to transfer the selected elements between clusters to achieve low
intra-cluster variance and subsequently avoid dead centers. Quantitative and
qualitative comparison with various clustering techniques is performed on four
datasets selected from image processing, bioinformatics, remote sensing and the
stock market respectively. An extensive analysis highlights the superior
performance of the proposed method over other techniques.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we aim to estimate the Winner of world-wide film festival from
the exhibited movie poster. The task is an extremely challenging because the
estimation must be done with only an exhibited movie poster, without any film
ratings and box-office takings. In order to tackle this problem, we have
created a new database which is consist of all movie posters included in the
four biggest film festivals. The movie poster database (MPDB) contains historic
movies over 80 years which are nominated a movie award at each year. We apply a
couple of feature types, namely hand-craft, mid-level and deep feature to
extract various information from a movie poster. Our experiments showed
suggestive knowledge, for example, the Academy award estimation can be better
rate with a color feature and a facial emotion feature generally performs good
rate on the MPDB. The paper may suggest a possibility of modeling human taste
for a movie recommendation.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach for real-time, robust and accurate hand pose
estimation from moving egocentric RGB-D cameras in cluttered real environments.
Existing methods typically fail for hand-object interactions in cluttered
scenes imaged from egocentric viewpoints, common for virtual or augmented
reality applications. Our approach uses two subsequently applied Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) to localize the hand and regress 3D joint locations.
Hand localization is achieved by using a CNN to estimate the 2D position of the
hand center in the input, even in the presence of clutter and occlusions. The
localized hand position, together with the corresponding input depth value, is
used to generate a normalized cropped image that is fed into a second CNN to
regress relative 3D hand joint locations in real time. For added accuracy,
robustness and temporal stability, we refine the pose estimates using a
kinematic pose tracking energy. To train the CNNs, we introduce a new
photorealistic dataset that uses a merged reality approach to capture and
synthesize large amounts of annotated data of natural hand interaction in
cluttered scenes. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we show that
our method is robust to self-occlusion and occlusions by objects, particularly
in moving egocentric perspectives.

 <dc:description>  We propose a privacy-preserving framework for learning visual classifiers by
leveraging distributed private image data. This framework is designed to
aggregate multiple classifiers updated locally using private data and to ensure
that no private information about the data is exposed during and after its
learning procedure. We utilize a homomorphic cryptosystem that can aggregate
the local classifiers while they are encrypted and thus kept secret. To
overcome the high computational cost of homomorphic encryption of
high-dimensional classifiers, we (1) impose sparsity constraints on local
classifier updates and (2) propose a novel efficient encryption scheme named
doubly-permuted homomorphic encryption (DPHE) which is tailored to sparse
high-dimensional data. DPHE (i) decomposes sparse data into its constituent
non-zero values and their corresponding support indices, (ii) applies
homomorphic encryption only to the non-zero values, and (iii) employs double
permutations on the support indices to make them secret. Our experimental
evaluation on several public datasets shows that the proposed approach achieves
comparable performance against state-of-the-art visual recognition methods
while preserving privacy and significantly outperforms other privacy-preserving
methods.

object are two challenges in computer vision. With dual-lens smart phones, such
as iPhone 7Plus and Huawei P9, coming into the market, two images of slightly
different views provide us new information to unify the two topics. We propose
a joint method to tackle them simultaneously via a joint fully connected
conditional random field (CRF) framework. The regional correspondence is used
to handle textureless regions in matching and make our CRF system
computationally efficient. Our method is evaluated over 2,000 new image pairs,
and produces promising results on challenging portrait images.

 <dc:description>  Human face exhibits an inherent hierarchy in its representations (i.e.,
holistic facial expressions can be encoded via a set of facial action units
(AUs) and their intensity). Variational (deep) auto-encoders (VAE) have shown
great results in unsupervised extraction of hierarchical latent representations
from large amounts of image data, while being robust to noise and other
undesired artifacts. Potentially, this makes VAEs a suitable approach for
learning facial features for AU intensity estimation. Yet, most existing
VAE-based methods apply classifiers learned separately from the encoded
features. By contrast, the non-parametric (probabilistic) approaches, such as
Gaussian Processes (GPs), typically outperform their parametric counterparts,
but cannot deal easily with large amounts of data. To this end, we propose a
novel VAE semi-parametric modeling framework, named DeepCoder, which combines
the modeling power of parametric (convolutional) and nonparametric (ordinal
GPs) VAEs, for joint learning of (1) latent representations at multiple levels
in a task hierarchy1, and (2) classification of multiple ordinal outputs. We
show on benchmark datasets for AU intensity estimation that the proposed
DeepCoder outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, and related VAEs and
deep learning models.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, two new indicators (Equalized Mean-based Normalized Proportion
Cited, EMNPC, and Mean-based Normalized Proportion Cited, MNPC) were proposed
which are intended for sparse data. We propose a third indicator
(Mantel-Haenszel quotient, MHq) belonging to the same indicator family. The MHq
is based on the MH analysis - an established method for polling the data from
multiple 2x2 contingency tables based on different subgroups. We test (using
citations and assessments by peers) if the three indicators can distinguish
between different quality levels as defined on the basis of the assessments by
peers (convergent validity). We find that the indicator MHq is able to
distinguish between the quality levels in most cases while MNPC and EMNPC are
not.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our approach to the SemEval 2017 Task 10: &quot;Extracting
Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications&quot;, specifically to Subtask
(B): &quot;Classification of identified keyphrases&quot;. We explored three different
deep learning approaches: a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN),
a stacked learner with an MLP meta-classifier, and an attention based Bi-LSTM.
From these approaches, we created an ensemble of differently
hyper-parameterized systems, achieving a micro-F1-score of 0.63 on the test
data. Our approach ranks 2nd (score of 1st placed system: 0.64) out of four
according to this official score. However, we erroneously trained 2 out of 3
neural nets (the stacker and the CNN) on only roughly 15% of the full data,
namely, the original development set. When trained on the full data
(training+development), our ensemble has a micro-F1-score of 0.69. Our code is
available from https://github.com/UKPLab/semeval2017-scienceie.

onsets and estimate the tempos. Then, we form Cumulative Beat Strength Signal
(CBSS) by taking advantage of OSS and estimated tempos. Next, we perform peak
detection by extracting the periodic sequence of beats among all CBSS peaks. In
simulations, we can see that our proposed algorithm, Online Beat TrAckINg
(OBTAIN), outperforms state-of-art results in terms of prediction accuracy
while maintaining comparable and practical computational complexity. The
real-time performance is tractable visually as illustrated in the simulations.

 <dc:title>Investigating Natural Image Pleasantness Recognition using Deep Features
  and Eye Tracking for Loosely Controlled Human-computer Interaction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tavakoli, Hamed R.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper revisits recognition of natural image pleasantness by employing
deep convolutional neural networks and affordable eye trackers. There exist
several approaches to recognize image pleasantness: (1) computer vision, and
(2) psychophysical signals. For natural images, computer vision approaches have
not been as successful as for abstract paintings and is lagging behind the
psychophysical signals like eye movements. Despite better results, the
scalability of eye movements is adversely affected by the sensor cost. While
the introduction of affordable sensors have helped the scalability issue by
making the sensors more accessible, the application of such sensors in a
loosely controlled human-computer interaction setup is not yet studied for
affective image tagging. On the other hand, deep convolutional neural networks
have boosted the performance of vision-based techniques significantly in recent
years. To investigate the current status in regard to affective image tagging,
we (1) introduce a new eye movement dataset using an affordable eye tracker,
(2) study the use of deep neural networks for pleasantness recognition, (3)
investigate the gap between deep features and eye movements. To meet these
ends, we record eye movements in a less controlled setup, akin to daily
human-computer interaction. We assess features from eye movements, visual
features, and their combination. Our results show that (1) recognizing natural
image pleasantness from eye movement under less restricted setup is difficult
and previously used techniques are prone to fail, and (2) visual class
categories are strong cues for predicting pleasantness, due to their
correlation with emotions, necessitating careful study of this phenomenon. This
latter finding is alerting as some deep learning approaches may fit to the
class category bias.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a cooperative odometry scheme based on the

for multiple robots [1]. To this end, we introduce a simple optimization scheme
that realizes visual mobile marker odometry via accurate fixed marker-based
camera positioning and analyse the characteristics of errors inherent to the
method compared to classical fixed marker-based navigation and visual odometry.
In addition, we provide a specific UAV-UGV configuration that allows for
continuous movements of the UAV without doing stops and a minimal
caterpillar-like configuration that works with one UGV alone. Finally, we
present a real-world implementation and evaluation for the proposed UAV-UGV
configuration.

 <dc:title>An Overview of Cross-media Retrieval: Concepts, Methodologies,

 <dc:description>  Multimedia retrieval plays an indispensable role in big data utilization.
Past efforts mainly focused on single-media retrieval. However, the
requirements of users are highly flexible, such as retrieving the relevant
audio clips with one query of image. So challenges stemming from the &quot;media
gap&quot;, which means that representations of different media types are
inconsistent, have attracted increasing attention. Cross-media retrieval is
designed for the scenarios where the queries and retrieval results are of
different media types. As a relatively new research topic, its concepts,
methodologies and benchmarks are still not clear in the literatures. To address
these issues, we review more than 100 references, give an overview including
the concepts, methodologies, major challenges and open issues, as well as build
up the benchmarks including datasets and experimental results. Researchers can
directly adopt the benchmarks to promptly evaluate their proposed methods. This
will help them to focus on algorithm design, rather than the time-consuming
compared methods and results. It is noted that we have constructed a new
dataset XMedia, which is the first publicly available dataset with up to five
media types (text, image, video, audio and 3D model). We believe this overview
will attract more researchers to focus on cross-media retrieval and be helpful
to them.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel 3D neural network architecture for 3D hand pose estimation
from a single depth image. Different from previous works that mostly run on 2D
depth image domain and require intermediate or post process to bring in the
supervision from 3D space, we convert the depth map to a 3D volumetric
representation, and feed it into a 3D convolutional neural network(CNN) to
directly produce the pose in 3D requiring no further process. Our system does
not require the ground truth reference point for initialization, and our
network architecture naturally integrates both local feature and global context
in 3D space. To increase the coverage of the hand pose space of the training
data, we render synthetic depth image by transferring hand pose from existing
real image datasets. We evaluation our algorithm on two public benchmarks and
achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The synthetic hand pose dataset will
be available.

 <dc:description>  Categories of polymorphic lenses in computer science, and of open games in
compositional game theory, have a curious structure that is reminiscent of
compact closed categories, but differs in some crucial ways. Specifically they
have a family of morphisms that behave like the counits of a compact closed
category, but have no corresponding units; and they have a `partial' duality
that behaves like transposition in a compact closed category when it is
defined. We axiomatise this structure, which we refer to as a `teleological
category'. We precisely define a diagrammatic language suitable for these
categories, and prove a coherence theorem for them. This underpins the use of
diagrammatic reasoning in compositional game theory, which has previously been
used only informally.

 <dc:description>  In our society and century, clothing is not anymore used only as a means for
body protection. Our paper builds upon the evidence, studied within the social
sciences, that clothing brings a clear communicative message in terms of social
signals, influencing the impression and behaviour of others towards a person.
In fact, clothing correlates with personality traits, both in terms of
self-assessment and assessments that unacquainted people give to an individual.
The consequences of these facts are important: the influence of clothing on the
decision making of individuals has been investigated in the literature, showing
that it represents a discriminative factor to differentiate among diverse
groups of people. Unfortunately, this has been observed after cumbersome and
expensive manual annotations, on very restricted populations, limiting the
scope of the resulting claims. With this position paper, we want to sketch the
main steps of the very first systematic analysis, driven by social signal
processing techniques, of the relationship between clothing and social signals,
both sent and perceived. Thanks to human parsing technologies, which exhibit
high robustness owing to deep learning architectures, we are now capable to
isolate visual patterns characterising a large types of garments. These
algorithms will be used to capture statistical relations on a large corpus of
evidence to confirm the sociological findings and to go beyond the state of the
art.

 <dc:description>  The Gibbs sampler is a particularly popular Markov chain used for learning
and inference problems in Graphical Models (GMs). These tasks are
computationally intractable in general, and the Gibbs sampler often suffers
from slow mixing. In this paper, we study the Swendsen-Wang dynamics which is a
more sophisticated Markov chain designed to overcome bottlenecks that impede
the Gibbs sampler. We prove O(\log n) mixing time for attractive binary
pairwise GMs (i.e., ferromagnetic Ising models) on stochastic partitioned
graphs having n vertices, under some mild conditions, including low temperature
regions where the Gibbs sampler provably mixes exponentially slow. Our
experiments also confirm that the Swendsen-Wang sampler significantly
outperforms the Gibbs sampler when they are used for learning parameters of
attractive GMs.

 <dc:title>What Constitutes Peer Review of Data: A survey of published peer review
  guidelines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Carpenter, Todd A</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Since a number of journals specifically focus on the review and publication
of data sets, reviewing their policies seems an appropriate place to start in
assessing what existing practice looks like in the 'real world' of reviewing
and publishing data. This article outlines a study of the publicly available
peer review policies of 39 scientific publications that publish data papers to
discern which criteria are most and least frequently referenced. It also
compares current practice with proposed criteria published in 2012.

 <dc:title>On the First-Order Complexity of Induced Subgraph Isomorphism</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $F$, let $I(F)$ be the class of graphs containing $F$ as an
induced subgraph. Let $W[F]$ denote the minimum $k$ such that $I(F)$ is
definable in $k$-variable first-order logic. The recognition problem of $I(F)$,
known as Induced Subgraph Isomorphism (for the pattern graph $F$), is solvable
in time $O(n^{W[F]})$. Motivated by this fact, we are interested in determining
or estimating the value of $W[F]$. Using Olariu's characterization of paw-free
graphs, we show that $I(K_3+e)$ is definable by a first-order sentence of
quantifier depth 3, where $K_3+e$ denotes the paw graph. This provides an
example of a graph $F$ with $W[F]$ strictly less than the number of vertices in
$F$. On the other hand, we prove that $W[F]=4$ for all $F$ on 4 vertices except
the paw graph and its complement. If $F$ is a graph on $t$ vertices, we prove a
general lower bound $W[F]&gt;(1/2-o(1))t$, where the function in the little-o
notation approaches 0 as $t$ inreases. This bound holds true even for a related
parameter $W^*[F]\le W[F]$, which is defined as the minimum $k$ such that
$I(F)$ is definable in the infinitary logic $L^k_{\infty\omega}$. We show that
$W^*[F]$ can be strictly less than $W[F]$. Specifically, $W^*[P_4]=3$ for $P_4$
being the path graph on 4 vertices.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of sampling k-bandlimited graph signals, ie, linear
combinations of the first k graph Fourier modes. We know that a set of k nodes
embedding all k-bandlimited signals always exists, thereby enabling their
perfect reconstruction after sampling. Unfortunately, to exhibit such a set,
one needs to partially diagonalize the graph Laplacian, which becomes
prohibitive at large scale. We propose a novel strategy based on determinantal
point processes that side-steps partial diagonalisation and enables
reconstruction with only O(k) samples. While doing so, we exhibit a new general
algorithm to sample determinantal process, faster than the state-of-the-art
algorithm by an order k.

 <dc:description>  Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables radio-frequency (RF) powered
backscatter devices (BDs) (e.g., sensors, tags) to modulate their information
bits over ambient RF carriers in an over-the-air manner. This technology also
called &quot;modulation in the air&quot;, thus has emerged as a promising solution to
achieve green communications for future Internet-of-Things. This paper studies
an AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC
system from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel
joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol
period is designed to be in general an integer multiplication of the OFDM
symbol period, and the waveform for BD bit `0' maintains the same state within
a BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit `1' has a state transition in
the middle of each OFDM symbol period within a BD symbol period. In the
receiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the
direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient
OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a
single-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover
the BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form
expression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test
statistic, and derive the optimal detector. Moreover, practical timing
synchronization algorithms are proposed, and we also analyze the effect of
various system parameters on the system performance. Finally, extensive
numerical results are provided to verify that the proposed transceiver design
can improve the system bit-error-rate (BER) performance and the operating range
significantly, and achieve much higher data rate, as compared to the
conventional design.

 <dc:description>  Learned boundary maps are known to outperform hand- crafted ones as a basis
for the watershed algorithm. We show, for the first time, how to train
watershed computation jointly with boundary map prediction. The estimator for
the merging priorities is cast as a neural network that is con- volutional
(over space) and recurrent (over iterations). The latter allows learning of
complex shape priors. The method gives the best known seeded segmentation
results on the CREMI segmentation challenge.

 <dc:description>  A biform theory is a combination of an axiomatic theory and an algorithmic
theory that supports the integration of reasoning and computation. These are
ideal for formalizing algorithms that manipulate mathematical expressions. A
theory graph is a network of theories connected by meaning-preserving theory
morphisms that map the formulas of one theory to the formulas of another
theory. Theory graphs are in turn well suited for formalizing mathematical
knowledge at the most convenient level of abstraction using the most convenient
vocabulary. We are interested in the problem of whether a body of mathematical
knowledge can be effectively formalized as a theory graph of biform theories.
As a test case, we look at the graph of theories encoding natural number
arithmetic. We used two different formalisms to do this, which we describe and
compare. The first is realized in ${\rm CTT}_{\rm uqe}$, a version of Church's
type theory with quotation and evaluation, and the second is realized in Agda,
a dependently typed programming language.

 <dc:description>  Models that can simulate how environments change in response to actions can
be used by agents to plan and act efficiently. We improve on previous
environment simulators from high-dimensional pixel observations by introducing
recurrent neural networks that are able to make temporally and spatially
coherent predictions for hundreds of time-steps into the future. We present an
in-depth analysis of the factors affecting performance, providing the most
extensive attempt to advance the understanding of the properties of these
models. We address the issue of computationally inefficiency with a model that
does not need to generate a high-dimensional image at each time-step. We show
that our approach can be used to improve exploration and is adaptable to many
diverse environments, namely 10 Atari games, a 3D car racing environment, and
complex 3D mazes.

 <dc:description>  The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is an important building block for
graph analysis of large datasets. The BFS parallelisation has been shown to be
challenging because of its inherent characteristics, including irregular memory
access patterns, data dependencies and workload imbalance, that limit its
scalability. We investigate the optimisation and vectorisation of the hybrid
BFS (a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches for BFS) on the Xeon
Phi, which has advanced vector processing capabilities. The results show that
our new implementation improves by 33\%, for a one million vertices graph,
compared to the state-of-the-art.

on Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, specifically, the Message Polarity
Classification subtask for English (subtask A). Our system is a voting
ensemble, where each base classifier is trained in a different feature space.
The first space is a bag-of-words model and has a Linear SVM as base
classifier. The second and third spaces are two different strategies of
combining word embeddings to represent sentences and use a Linear SVM and a
Logistic Regressor as base classifiers. The proposed system was ranked 18th out
of 38 systems considering F1 score and 20th considering recall.

 <dc:description>  We consider MultiCriteria Decision Analysis models which are defined over
discrete attributes, taking a finite number of values. We do not assume that
the model is monotonically increasing with respect to the attributes values.
Our aim is to define an importance index for such general models, considering
that they are equivalent to $k$-ary games (multichoice games). We show that
classical solutions like the Shapley value are not suitable for such models,
essentially because of the efficiency axiom which does not make sense in this
context. We propose an importance index which is a kind of average variation of
the model along the attributes. We give an axiomatic characterization of it.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning of visual similarities is of paramount importance to
computer vision, particularly due to lacking training data for fine-grained
similarities. Deep learning of similarities is often based on relationships
between pairs or triplets of samples. Many of these relations are unreliable
and mutually contradicting, implying inconsistencies when trained without
supervision information that relates different tuples or triplets to each
other. To overcome this problem, we use local estimates of reliable
(dis-)similarities to initially group samples into compact surrogate classes
and use local partial orders of samples to classes to link classes to each
other. Similarity learning is then formulated as a partial ordering task with
soft correspondences of all samples to classes. Adopting a strategy of
self-supervision, a CNN is trained to optimally represent samples in a mutually
consistent manner while updating the classes. The similarity learning and
grouping procedure are integrated in a single model and optimized jointly. The
proposed unsupervised approach shows competitive performance on detailed pose
estimation and object classification.

 <dc:description>  Pattern Matching is a computationally intensive task used in many research
fields and real world applications. Due to the ever-growing volume of data to
be processed, and increasing link speeds, the number of patterns to be matched
has risen significantly. In this paper we explore the parallel capabilities of
modern General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) applications for high
speed pattern matching. A highly compressed failure-less Aho-Corasick algorithm
is presented for Intrusion Detection Systems on off-the-shelf hardware. This
approach maximises the bandwidth for data transfers between the host and the
Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Experiments are performed on multiple alphabet
sizes, demonstrating the capabilities of the library to be used in different
research fields, while sustaining an adequate throughput for intrusion
detection systems or DNA sequencing. The work also explores the performance
impact of adequate prefix matching for alphabet sizes and varying pattern
numbers achieving speeds up to 8Gbps and low memory consumption for intrusion
detection systems.

 <dc:title>Mitigating Interference in Content Delivery Networks by Spatial Signal
  Alignment: The Approach of Shot-Noise Ratio</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Dongzhu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Kaibin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multimedia content especially videos is expected to dominate data traffic in
next-generation mobile networks. Caching popular content at the network edge
has emerged to be a solution for low-latency content delivery. Compared with
the traditional wireless communication, content delivery has a key
characteristic that many signals coexisting in the air carry identical popular
content. They, however, can interfere with each other at a receiver if their
modulation-and-coding (MAC) schemes are adapted to individual channels
following the classic approach. To address this issue, we present a novel idea
of content adaptive MAC (CAMAC) where adapting MAC schemes to content ensures
that all signals carry identical content are encoded using an identical MAC
scheme, achieving spatial MAC alignment. Consequently, interference can be
harnessed as signals, to improve the reliability of wireless delivery. In the
remaining part of the paper, we focus on quantifying the gain CAMAC can bring
to a content-delivery network using a stochastic-geometry model. Specifically,
content helpers are distributed as a Poisson point process, each of which
transmits a file from a content database based on a given popularity
distribution. It is discovered that the successful content-delivery probability
is closely related to the distribution of the ratio of two independent shot
noise processes, named a shot-noise ratio. The distribution itself is an open
mathematical problem that we tackle in this work. Using stable-distribution
theory and tools from stochastic geometry, the distribution function is derived
in closed form. Extending the result in the context of content-delivery
networks with CAMAC yields the content-delivery probability in different closed
forms. In addition, the gain in the probability due to CAMAC is shown to grow
with the level of skewness in the content popularity distribution.

 <dc:description>  Large industrial systems that combine services and applications, have become
targets for cyber criminals and are challenging from the security, monitoring
and auditing perspectives. Security log analysis is a key step for uncovering
anomalies, detecting intrusion, and enabling incident response. The constant
increase of link speeds, threats and users, produce large volumes of log data
and become increasingly difficult to analyse on a Central Processing Unit
(CPU). This paper presents a massively parallel Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
LOg Processing (GLoP) library and can also be used for Deep Packet Inspection
(DPI), using a prefix matching technique, harvesting the full power of
off-the-shelf technologies. GLoP implements two different algorithm using
different GPU memory and is compared against CPU counterpart implementations.
The library can be used for processing nodes with single or multiple GPUs as
well as GPU cloud farms. The results show throughput of 20Gbps and demonstrate
that modern GPUs can be utilised to increase the operational speed of large
scale log processing scenarios, saving precious time before and after an
intrusion has occurred.

 <dc:title>Thresholding Bandits with Augmented UCB</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose the Augmented-UCB (AugUCB) algorithm for a
fixed-budget version of the thresholding bandit problem (TBP), where the
objective is to identify a set of arms whose quality is above a threshold. A
key feature of AugUCB is that it uses both mean and variance estimates to
eliminate arms that have been sufficiently explored; to the best of our
knowledge this is the first algorithm to employ such an approach for the
considered TBP. Theoretically, we obtain an upper bound on the loss
(probability of mis-classification) incurred by AugUCB. Although UCBEV in
literature provides a better guarantee, it is important to emphasize that UCBEV
has access to problem complexity (whose computation requires arms' mean and
variances), and hence is not realistic in practice; this is in contrast to
AugUCB whose implementation does not require any such complexity inputs. We
conduct extensive simulation experiments to validate the performance of AugUCB.
Through our simulation work, we establish that AugUCB, owing to its utilization
of variance estimates, performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art
APT, CSAR and other non variance-based algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of things (IoT) is still in its infancy and has attracted much
interest in many industrial sectors including medical fields, logistics
tracking, smart cities and automobiles. However as a paradigm, it is
susceptible to a range of significant intrusion threats. This paper presents a
threat analysis of the IoT and uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to
combat these threats. A multi-level perceptron, a type of supervised ANN, is
trained using internet packet traces, then is assessed on its ability to thwart
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS/DoS) attacks. This paper focuses on the
classification of normal and threat patterns on an IoT Network. The ANN
procedure is validated against a simulated IoT network. The experimental
results demonstrate 99.4% accuracy and can successfully detect various DDoS/DoS
attacks.

 <dc:title>Comparison of Global Algorithms in Word Sense Disambiguation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This article compares four probabilistic algorithms (global algorithms) for
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) in terms of the number of scorer calls (local
algo- rithm) and the F1 score as determined by a gold-standard scorer. Two
algorithms come from the state of the art, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm
(SAA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well as two algorithms that we first
adapt from WSD that are state of the art probabilistic search algorithms,
namely a Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and a Bat Search algorithm (BS). As WSD
requires to evaluate exponentially many word sense combinations (with branching
factors of up to 6 or more), probabilistic algorithms allow to find approximate
solution in a tractable time by sampling the search space. We find that CSA, GA
and SA all eventually converge to similar results (0.98 F1 score), but CSA gets
there faster (in fewer scorer calls) and reaches up to 0.95 F1 before SA in
fewer scorer calls. In BA a strict convergence criterion prevents it from
reaching above 0.89 F1.

 <dc:description>  Recently, deep learning methods have been shown to improve the performance of
recommender systems over traditional methods, especially when review text is
available. For example, a recent model, DeepCoNN, uses neural nets to learn one
latent representation for the text of all reviews written by a target user, and
a second latent representation for the text of all reviews for a target item,
and then combines these latent representations to obtain state-of-the-art
performance on recommendation tasks. We show that (unsurprisingly) much of the
predictive value of review text comes from reviews of the target user for the
target item. We then introduce a way in which this information can be used in
recommendation, even when the target user's review for the target item is not
available. Our model, called TransNets, extends the DeepCoNN model by
introducing an additional latent layer representing the target user-target item
pair. We then regularize this layer, at training time, to be similar to another
latent representation of the target user's review of the target item. We show
that TransNets and extensions of it improve substantially over the previous
state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  We study a discrete version of a geometric stable marriage problem originally
proposed in a continuous setting by Hoffman, Holroyd, and Peres, in which
points in the plane are stably matched to cluster centers, as prioritized by
their distances, so that each cluster center is apportioned a set of points of
equal area. We show that, for a discretization of the problem to an $n\times n$
grid of pixels with $k$ centers, the problem can be solved in time $O(n^2
\log^5 n)$, and we experiment with two slower but more practical algorithms and
a hybrid method that switches from one of these algorithms to the other to gain
greater efficiency than either algorithm alone. We also show how to combine
geometric stable matchings with a $k$-means clustering algorithm, so as to
provide a geometric political-districting algorithm that views distance in
economic terms, and we experiment with weighted versions of stable $k$-means in
order to improve the connectivity of the resulting clusters.

 <dc:description>  We present a new autoencoder-type architecture that is trainable in an
unsupervised mode, sustains both generation and inference, and has the quality
of conditional and unconditional samples boosted by adversarial learning.
Unlike previous hybrids of autoencoders and adversarial networks, the
adversarial game in our approach is set up directly between the encoder and the
generator, and no external mappings are trained in the process of learning. The
game objective compares the divergences of each of the real and the generated
data distributions with the prior distribution in the latent space. We show
that direct generator-vs-encoder game leads to a tight coupling of the two
components, resulting in samples and reconstructions of a comparable quality to
some recently-proposed more complex architectures.

 <dc:description>  Obfuscation techniques are a general category of software protections widely
adopted to prevent malicious tampering of the code by making applications more
difficult to understand and thus harder to modify. Obfuscation techniques are
divided in code and data obfuscation, depending on the protected asset. While
preliminary empirical studies have been conducted to determine the impact of
code obfuscation, our work aims at assessing the effectiveness and efficiency
in preventing attacks of a specific data obfuscation technique - VarMerge. We
conducted an experiment with student participants performing two attack tasks
on clear and obfuscated versions of two applications written in C. The
experiment showed a significant effect of data obfuscation on both the time
required to complete and the successful attack efficiency. An application with
VarMerge reduces by six times the number of successful attacks per unit of
time. This outcome provides a practical clue that can be used when applying
software protections based on data obfuscation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study matrix scaling and balancing, which are fundamental
problems in scientific computing, with a long line of work on them that dates
back to the 1960s. We provide algorithms for both these problems that, ignoring
logarithmic factors involving the dimension of the input matrix and the size of
its entries, both run in time $\widetilde{O}\left(m\log \kappa \log^2
(1/\epsilon)\right)$ where $\epsilon$ is the amount of error we are willing to
tolerate. Here, $\kappa$ represents the ratio between the largest and the
smallest entries of the optimal scalings. This implies that our algorithms run
in nearly-linear time whenever $\kappa$ is quasi-polynomial, which includes, in
particular, the case of strictly positive matrices. We complement our results
by providing a separate algorithm that uses an interior-point method and runs
in time $\widetilde{O}(m^{3/2} \log (1/\epsilon))$.
  In order to establish these results, we develop a new second-order
optimization framework that enables us to treat both problems in a unified and
principled manner. This framework identifies a certain generalization of linear
system solving that we can use to efficiently minimize a broad class of
functions, which we call second-order robust. We then show that in the context
of the specific functions capturing matrix scaling and balancing, we can
leverage and generalize the work on Laplacian system solving to make the
algorithms obtained via this framework very efficient.

 <dc:description>  Sentence simplification reduces semantic complexity to benefit people with
language impairments. Previous simplification studies on the sentence level and
word level have achieved promising results but also meet great challenges. For
sentence-level studies, sentences after simplification are fluent but sometimes
are not really simplified. For word-level studies, words are simplified but
also have potential grammar errors due to different usages of words before and
after simplification. In this paper, we propose a two-step simplification
framework by combining both the word-level and the sentence-level
simplifications, making use of their corresponding advantages. Based on the
two-step framework, we implement a novel constrained neural generation model to
simplify sentences given simplified words. The final results on Wikipedia and
Simple Wikipedia aligned datasets indicate that our method yields better
performance than various baselines.

 <dc:description>  We develop several efficient algorithms for the classical \emph{Matrix
Scaling} problem, which is used in many diverse areas, from preconditioning
linear systems to approximation of the permanent. On an input $n\times n$
matrix $A$, this problem asks to find diagonal (scaling) matrices $X$ and $Y$
(if they exist), so that $X A Y$ $\varepsilon$-approximates a doubly
stochastic, or more generally a matrix with prescribed row and column sums.
  We address the general scaling problem as well as some important special
cases. In particular, if $A$ has $m$ nonzero entries, and if there exist $X$
and $Y$ with polynomially large entries such that $X A Y$ is doubly stochastic,
then we can solve the problem in total complexity $\tilde{O}(m + n^{4/3})$.
This greatly improves on the best known previous results, which were either
$\tilde{O}(n^4)$ or $O(m n^{1/2}/\varepsilon)$.
  Our algorithms are based on tailor-made first and second order techniques,
combined with other recent advances in continuous optimization, which may be of
independent interest for solving similar problems.

 <dc:description>  With the increased interest in computational sciences, machine learning (ML),
pattern recognition (PR) and big data, governmental agencies, academia and
manufacturers are overwhelmed by the constant influx of new algorithms and
techniques promising improved performance, generalization and robustness.
Sadly, result reproducibility is often an overlooked feature accompanying
original research publications, competitions and benchmark evaluations. The
main reasons behind such a gap arise from natural complications in research and
development in this area: the distribution of data may be a sensitive issue;
software frameworks are difficult to install and maintain; Test protocols may
involve a potentially large set of intricate steps which are difficult to
handle. Given the raising complexity of research challenges and the constant
increase in data volume, the conditions for achieving reproducible research in
the domain are also increasingly difficult to meet.
  To bridge this gap, we built an open platform for research in computational
sciences related to pattern recognition and machine learning, to help on the
development, reproducibility and certification of results obtained in the
field. By making use of such a system, academic, governmental or industrial
organizations enable users to easily and socially develop processing
toolchains, re-use data, algorithms, workflows and compare results from
distinct algorithms and/or parameterizations with minimal effort. This article
presents such a platform and discusses some of its key features, uses and
limitations. We overview a currently operational prototype and provide design
insights.

 <dc:description>  The decomposition-based method has been recognized as a major approach for
multi-objective optimization. It decomposes a multi-objective optimization
problem into several single-objective optimization subproblems, each of which
is usually defined as a scalarizing function using a weight vector. Due to the
characteristics of the contour line of a particular scalarizing function, the
performance of the decomposition-based method strongly depends on the Pareto
front's shape by merely using a single scalarizing function, especially when
facing a large number of objectives. To improve the flexibility of the
decomposition-based method, this paper develops an adversarial decomposition
method that leverages the complementary characteristics of two different
scalarizing functions within a single paradigm. More specifically, we maintain
two co-evolving populations simultaneously by using different scalarizing
functions. In order to avoid allocating redundant computational resources to
the same region of the Pareto front, we stably match these two co-evolving
populations into one-one solution pairs according to their working regions of
the Pareto front. Then, each solution pair can at most contribute one mating
parent during the mating selection process. Comparing with nine
state-of-the-art many-objective optimizers, we have witnessed the competitive
performance of our proposed algorithm on 130 many-objective test instances with
various characteristics and Pareto front's shapes.

 <dc:description>  Data frames in scripting languages are essential abstractions for processing
structured data. However, existing data frame solutions are either not
distributed (e.g., Pandas in Python) and therefore have limited scalability, or
they are not tightly integrated with array computations (e.g., Spark SQL). This
paper proposes a novel compiler-based approach where we integrate data frames
into the High Performance Analytics Toolkit (HPAT) to build HiFrames. It
provides expressive and flexible data frame APIs which are tightly integrated
with array operations. HiFrames then automatically parallelizes and compiles
relational operations along with other array computations in end-to-end data
analytics programs, and generates efficient MPI/C++ code. We demonstrate that
HiFrames is significantly faster than alternatives such as Spark SQL on
clusters, without forcing the programmer to switch to embedded SQL for part of
the program. HiFrames is 3.6x to 70x faster than Spark SQL for basic relational
operations, and can be up to 20,000x faster for advanced analytics operations,
such as weighted moving averages (WMA), that the map-reduce paradigm cannot
handle effectively. HiFrames is also 5x faster than Spark SQL for TPCx-BB Q26
on 64 nodes of Cori supercomputer.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for performing spectral clustering
efficiently. Spectral clustering is a powerful clustering algorithm that
suffers from high computational complexity, due to eigen decomposition. In this
work, we first build the adjacency matrix of the corresponding graph of the
dataset. To build this matrix, we only consider a limited number of points,
called landmarks, and compute the similarity of all data points with the
landmarks. Then, we present a definition of the Laplacian matrix of the graph
that enable us to perform eigen decomposition efficiently, using a deep
autoencoder. The overall complexity of the algorithm for eigen decomposition is
$O(np)$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $p$ is the number of
landmarks. At last, we evaluate the performance of the algorithm in different
experiments.

 <dc:title>Joint Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ferrer, Luciana</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Standard probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) for speaker
recognition assumes that the sample's features (usually, i-vectors) are given
by a sum of three terms: a term that depends on the speaker identity, a term
that models the within-speaker variability and is assumed independent across
samples, and a final term that models any remaining variability and is also
independent across samples. In this work, we propose a generalization of this
model where the within-speaker variability is not necessarily assumed
independent across samples but dependent on another discrete variable. This
variable, which we call the channel variable as in the standard PLDA approach,
could be, for example, a discrete category for the channel characteristics, the
language spoken by the speaker, the type of speech in the sample
(conversational, monologue, read), etc. The value of this variable is assumed
to be known during training but not during testing. Scoring is performed, as in
standard PLDA, by computing a likelihood ratio between the null hypothesis that
the two sides of a trial belong to the same speaker versus the alternative
hypothesis that the two sides belong to different speakers. The two likelihoods
are computed by marginalizing over two hypothesis about the channels in both
sides of a trial: that they are the same and that they are different. This way,
we expect that the new model will be better at coping with same-channel versus
different-channel trials than standard PLDA, since knowledge about the channel
(or language, or speech style) is used during training and implicitly
considered during scoring.

 <dc:description>  The segmentation of liver lesions is crucial for detection, diagnosis and
monitoring progression of liver cancer. However, design of accurate automated
methods remains challenging due to high noise in CT scans, low contrast between
liver and lesions, as well as large lesion variability. We propose a 3D
automatic, unsupervised method for liver lesions segmentation using a phase
separation approach. It is assumed that liver is a mixture of two phases:
healthy liver and lesions, represented by different image intensities polluted
by noise. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is used to remove the noise and separate
the mixture into two distinct phases with well-defined interfaces. This
simplifies the lesion detection and segmentation task drastically and enables
to segment liver lesions by thresholding the Cahn-Hilliard solution. The method
was tested on 3Dircadb and LITS dataset.

 <dc:description>  Automating the extraction and quantification of features from
three-dimensional (3-D) image stacks is a critical task for advancing computer
vision research. The union of 3-D image acquisition and analysis enables the
quantification of biological resistance of a plant tissue to fungal infection
through the analysis of attributes such as fungal penetration depth, fungal
mass, and branching of the fungal network of connected cells. From an image
processing perspective, these tasks reduce to segmentation of vessel-like
structures and the extraction of features from their skeletonization. In order
to sample multiple infection events for analysis, we have developed an approach
we refer to as macroscopic microscopy. However, macroscopic microscopy produces
high-resolution image stacks that pose challenges to routine approaches and are
difficult for a human to annotate to obtain ground truth data. We present a
synthetic hyphal network generator, a comparison of several vessel segmentation
methods, and a minimum spanning tree method for connecting small gaps resulting
from imperfections in imaging or incomplete skeletonization of hyphal networks.
Qualitative results are shown for real microscopic data. We believe the
comparison of vessel detectors on macroscopic microscopy data, the synthetic
vessel generator, and the gap closing technique are beneficial to the image
processing community.

 <dc:description>  Voice conversion (VC) using sequence-to-sequence learning of context
posterior probabilities is proposed. Conventional VC using shared context
posterior probabilities predicts target speech parameters from the context
posterior probabilities estimated from the source speech parameters. Although
conventional VC can be built from non-parallel data, it is difficult to convert
speaker individuality such as phonetic property and speaking rate contained in
the posterior probabilities because the source posterior probabilities are
directly used for predicting target speech parameters. In this work, we assume
that the training data partly include parallel speech data and propose
sequence-to-sequence learning between the source and target posterior
probabilities. The conversion models perform non-linear and variable-length
transformation from the source probability sequence to the target one. Further,
we propose a joint training algorithm for the modules. In contrast to
conventional VC, which separately trains the speech recognition that estimates
posterior probabilities and the speech synthesis that predicts target speech
parameters, our proposed method jointly trains these modules along with the
proposed probability conversion modules. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms the conventional VC.

 <dc:description>  One problem that every presenter faces when delivering a public discourse is
how to hold the listeners' attentions or to keep them involved. Therefore, many
studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively
con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate
these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of
2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are
used by the presenters for applause elicitation. Through conducting regression
anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of
audience applauding. We further build models that can rec-ognize
applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.

 <dc:description>  We consider &quot;time-of-use&quot; pricing as a technique for matching supply and
demand of temporal resources with the goal of maximizing social welfare.
Relevant examples include energy, computing resources on a cloud computing
platform, and charging stations for electric vehicles, among many others. A
client/job in this setting has a window of time during which he needs service,
and a particular value for obtaining it. We assume a stochastic model for
demand, where each job materializes with some probability via an independent
Bernoulli trial. Given a per-time-unit pricing of resources, any realized job
will first try to get served by the cheapest available resource in its window
and, failing that, will try to find service at the next cheapest available
resource, and so on. Thus, the natural stochastic fluctuations in demand have
the potential to lead to cascading overload events. Our main result shows that
setting prices so as to optimally handle the {\em expected} demand works well:
with high probability, when the actual demand is instantiated, the system is
stable and the expected value of the jobs served is very close to that of the
optimal offline algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In a model of network communication based on a random walk in an undirected
graph, what subset of nodes (subject to constraints on the set size), enables
the fastest spread of information? In this paper, we assume the dynamics of
spread is described by a network consensus process, but to find the most
effective seeds we consider the target set of a random walk--the process dual
to network consensus spread. Thus an optimal set $A$ minimizes the sum of the
expected first hitting times $F(A)$ of random walks that start at nodes outside
the set. We introduce a submodular, non-decreasing rank function $\rho$, that
permits some comparison between the solution obtained by the classical greedy
algorithm and one obtained by our methods. The supermodularity and
non-increasing properties of $F$ are used to show that the rank of our solution
is at least $(1-\frac{1}{e})$ times the rank of the optimal set. When our
approximation has a higher rank than the greedy solution, this can be improved
to $(1-\frac{1}{e})(1+\chi)$ where $\chi &gt;0$ is a constant. A non-zero lower
bound for $\chi$ can be obtained when the curvature and increments of $\rho$
are known.

 <dc:description>  We consider properties of edge-colored vertex-ordered graphs, i.e., graphs
with a totally ordered vertex set and a finite set of possible edge colors. We
show that any hereditary property of such graphs is strongly testable, i.e.,
testable with a constant number of queries. We also explain how the proof can
be adapted to show that any hereditary property of $2$-dimensional matrices
over a finite alphabet (where row and column order is not ignored) is strongly
testable. The first result generalizes the result of Alon and Shapira [FOCS'05,
SICOMP'08], who showed that any hereditary graph property (without vertex
order) is strongly testable. The second result answers and generalizes a
conjecture of Alon, Fischer and Newman [SICOMP'07] concerning testing of matrix
properties.
  The testability is proved by establishing a removal lemma for vertex-ordered
graphs. It states that for any finite or infinite family $\mathcal{F}$ of
forbidden vertex-ordered graphs, and any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, there exist $\delta &gt;
0$ and $k$ so that any vertex-ordered graph which is $\epsilon$-far from being
$\mathcal{F}$-free contains at least $\delta n^{|F|}$ copies of some
$F\in\mathcal{F}$ (with the correct vertex order) where $|F|\leq k$. The proof
bridges the gap between techniques related to the regularity lemma, used in the
long chain of papers investigating graph testing, and string testing
techniques. Along the way we develop a Ramsey-type lemma for $k$-partite graphs
with &quot;undesirable&quot; edges, stating that one can find a Ramsey-type structure in
such a graph, in which the density of the undesirable edges is not much higher
than the density of those edges in the graph.

 <dc:title>Time-Contrastive Learning Based DNN Bottleneck Features for

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a time-contrastive learning (TCL) based bottleneck
(BN)feature extraction method for speech signals with an application to
text-dependent (TD) speaker verification (SV). It is well-known that speech
signals exhibit quasi-stationary behavior in and only in a short interval, and
the TCL method aims to exploit this temporal structure. More specifically, it
trains deep neural networks (DNNs) to discriminate temporal events obtained by
uniformly segmenting speech signals, in contrast to existing DNN based BN
feature extraction methods that train DNNs using labeled data to discriminate
speakers or pass-phrases or phones or a combination of them. In the context of
speaker verification, speech data of fixed pass-phrases are used for TCL-BN
training, while the pass-phrases used for TCL-BN training are excluded from
being used for SV, so that the learned features can be considered generic. The
method is evaluated on the RedDots Challenge 2016 database. Experimental
results show that TCL-BN is superior to the existing speaker and pass-phrase
discriminant BN features and the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient feature for
text-dependent speaker verification.

 <dc:description>  Clustering is a widely-used data mining tool, which aims to discover
partitions of similar items in data. We introduce a new clustering paradigm,
\emph{accordant clustering}, which enables the discovery of (predefined) group
level insights. Unlike previous clustering paradigms that aim to understand
relationships amongst the individual members, the goal of accordant clustering
is to uncover insights at the group level through the analysis of their
members. Group level insight can often support a call to action that cannot be
informed through previous clustering techniques. We propose the first accordant
clustering algorithm, and prove that it finds near-optimal solutions when data
possesses inherent cluster structure. The insights revealed by accordant
clusterings enabled experts in the field of medicine to isolate successful
treatments for a neurodegenerative disease, and those in finance to discover
patterns of unnecessary spending.

 <dc:description>  Consider a small number of scouts exploring the infinite $d$-dimensional grid
with the aim of hitting a hidden target point. Each scout is controlled by a
probabilistic finite automaton that determines its movement (to a neighboring
grid point) based on its current state. The scouts, that operate under a fully
synchronous schedule, communicate with each other (in a way that affects their
respective states) when they share the same grid point and operate
independently otherwise. Our main research question is: How many scouts are
required to guarantee that the target admits a finite mean hitting time?
Recently, it was shown that $d + 1$ is an upper bound on the answer to this
question for any dimension $d \geq 1$ and the main contribution of this paper
comes in the form of proving that this bound is tight for $d \in \{ 1, 2 \}$.

 <dc:description>  Quality control in crowdsourcing systems is crucial. It is typically done
after data collection, often using additional crowdsourced tasks to assess and
improve the quality. These post-hoc methods can easily add cost and latency to
the acquisition process--particularly if collecting high-quality data is
important. In this paper, we argue for pre-hoc interface optimizations based on
feedback that helps workers improve data quality before it is submitted and is
well suited to complement post-hoc techniques. We propose the Precog system
that explicitly supports such interface optimizations for common integrity
constraints as well as more ambiguous text acquisition tasks where quality is
ill-defined. We then develop the Segment-Predict-Explain pattern for detecting
low-quality text segments and generating prescriptive explanations to help the
worker improve their text input. Our unique combination of segmentation and
prescriptive explanation are necessary for Precog to collect 2x more
high-quality text data than non-Precog approaches on two real domains.

 <dc:title>A Trolling Hierarchy in Social Media and A Conditional Random Field For

 <dc:creator>Mojica, Luis Gerardo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An-ever increasing number of social media websites, electronic newspapers and
Internet forums allow visitors to leave comments for others to read and
interact. This exchange is not free from participants with malicious
intentions, which do not contribute with the written conversation. Among
different communities users adopt strategies to handle such users. In this
paper we present a comprehensive categorization of the trolling phenomena
resource, inspired by politeness research and propose a model that jointly
predicts four crucial aspects of trolling: intention, interpretation, intention
disclosure and response strategy. Finally, we present a new annotated dataset
containing excerpts of conversations involving trolls and the interactions with
other users that we hope will be a useful resource for the research community.

 <dc:title>Pixelwise Instance Segmentation with a Dynamically Instantiated Network</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Semantic segmentation and object detection research have recently achieved
rapid progress. However, the former task has no notion of different instances
of the same object, and the latter operates at a coarse, bounding-box level. We
propose an Instance Segmentation system that produces a segmentation map where
each pixel is assigned an object class and instance identity label. Most
approaches adapt object detectors to produce segments instead of boxes. In
contrast, our method is based on an initial semantic segmentation module, which
feeds into an instance subnetwork. This subnetwork uses the initial
category-level segmentation, along with cues from the output of an object
detector, within an end-to-end CRF to predict instances. This part of our model
is dynamically instantiated to produce a variable number of instances per
image. Our end-to-end approach requires no post-processing and considers the
image holistically, instead of processing independent proposals. Therefore,
unlike some related work, a pixel cannot belong to multiple instances.
Furthermore, far more precise segmentations are achieved, as shown by our
state-of-the-art results (particularly at high IoU thresholds) on the Pascal
VOC and Cityscapes datasets.

 <dc:description>  The use of rendered images, whether from completely synthetic datasets or
from 3D reconstructions, is increasingly prevalent in vision tasks. However,
little attention has been given to how the selection of viewpoints affects the
performance of rendered training sets. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
approach to view set selection. Given a set of example images, we extract
statistics describing their contents and generate a set of views matching the
distribution of those statistics. Motivated by semantic segmentation tasks, we
model the spatial distribution of each semantic object category within an image
view volume. We provide a search algorithm that generates a sampling of likely
candidate views according to the example distribution, and a set selection
algorithm that chooses a subset of the candidates that jointly cover the
example distribution. Results of experiments with these algorithms on SUNCG
indicate that they are indeed able to produce view distributions similar to an
example set from NYUDv2 according to the earth mover's distance. Furthermore,
the selected views improve performance on semantic segmentation compared to
alternative view selection algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We present new protocols for Byzantine state machine replication and
Byzantine agreement in the synchronous and authenticated setting. The
celebrated PBFT state machine replication protocol tolerates $f$ Byzantine
faults in an asynchronous setting using $3f+1$ replicas, and has since been
studied or deployed by numerous works. In this work, we improve the Byzantine
fault tolerance threshold to $n=2f+1$ by utilizing a relaxed synchrony
assumption. We present a synchronous state machine replication protocol that
commits a decision every 3 rounds in the common case. The key challenge is to
ensure quorum intersection at one honest replica. Our solution is to rely on
the synchrony assumption to form a post-commit quorum of size $2f+1$, which
intersects at $f+1$ replicas with any pre-commit quorums of size $f+1$. Our
protocol also solves synchronous authenticated Byzantine agreement in expected
8 rounds. The best previous solution (Katz and Koo, 2006) requires expected 24
rounds. Our protocols may be applied to build Byzantine fault tolerant systems
or improve cryptographic protocols such as cryptocurrencies when synchrony can
be assumed.

 <dc:description>  Policy gradient methods have been successfully applied to many complex
reinforcement learning problems. However, policy gradient methods suffer from
high variance, slow convergence, and inefficient exploration. In this work, we
introduce a maximum entropy policy optimization framework which explicitly
encourages parameter exploration, and show that this framework can be reduced
to a Bayesian inference problem. We then propose a novel Stein variational
policy gradient method (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods
and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved
policies. SVPG is robust to initialization and can easily be implemented in a
parallel manner. On continuous control problems, we find that implementing SVPG
on top of REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic algorithms improves both average
return and data efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Facial landmark localization is a fundamental module for pose-invariant face
recognition. The most common approach for facial landmark detection is cascaded
regression, which is composed of two steps: feature extraction and facial shape
regression. Recent methods employ deep convolutional networks to extract robust
features for each step, while the whole system could be regarded as a deep
cascaded regression architecture. In this work, instead of employing a deep
regression network, a Globally Optimized Dual-Pathway (GoDP) deep architecture
is proposed to identify the target pixels through solving a cascaded pixel
labeling problem without resorting to high-level inference models or complex
stacked architecture. The proposed end-to-end system relies on distance-aware
softmax functions and dual-pathway proposal-refinement architecture. Results
show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art cascaded regression-based methods
on multiple in-the-wild face alignment databases. The model achieves 1.84
normalized mean error (NME) on the AFLW database, which outperforms 3DDFA by
61.8%. Experiments on face identification demonstrate that GoDP, coupled with
DPM-headhunter, is able to improve rank-1 identification rate by 44.2% compared
to Dlib toolbox on a challenging database.

 <dc:title>More on additive triples of bijections</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eberhard, Sean</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study additive properties of the set $S$ of bijections (or permutations)
$\{1,\dots,n\}\to G$, thought of as a subset of $G^n$, where $G$ is an
arbitrary abelian group of order $n$. Our main result is an asymptotic for the
number of solutions to $\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 = f$ with $\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3\in
S$, where $f:\{1,\dots,n\}\to G$ is an arbitary function satisfying
$\sum_{i=1}^n f(i) = \sum G$. This extends recent work of Manners, Mrazovi\'c,
and the author. Using the same method we also prove a less interesting
asymptotic for solutions to $\pi_1 + \pi_2 + \pi_3 + \pi_4 = f$, and we also
show that the distribution $\pi_1+\pi_2$ is close to flat in $L^2$.
  As in the previous paper, our method is based on Fourier analysis, and we
prove our results by carefully carving up $\widehat{G}^n$ and bounding various
character sums. This is most complicated when $G$ has even order, say when $G =
\mathbf{F}_2^d$.
  At the end of the paper we explain two applications, one coming from the
Latin squares literature (counting transversals in Latin hypercubes) and one
from cryptography (PRP-to-PRF conversion).

 <dc:description>  PLACES 2017 (full title: Programming Language Approaches to Concurrency- and
Communication-cEntric Software) is the tenth edition of the PLACES workshop
series. After the first PLACES, which was affiliated to DisCoTec in 2008, the
workshop has been part of ETAPS every year since 2009 and is now an established
part of the ETAPS satellite events. PLACES 2017 was held on 29th April in
Uppsala, Sweden. The workshop series was started in order to promote the
application of novel programming language ideas to the increasingly important
problem of developing software for systems in which concurrency and
communication are intrinsic aspects. This includes software for both multi-core
systems and large-scale distributed and/or service-oriented systems. The scope
of PLACES includes new programming language features, whole new programming
language designs, new type systems, new semantic approaches, new program
analysis techniques, and new implementation mechanisms. This volume consists of
the papers accepted for presentation at the workshop.

 <dc:title>Average-radius list-recovery of random linear codes: it really ties the
  room together</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rudra, Atri</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wootters, Mary</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We analyze the list-decodability, and related notions, of random linear
codes. This has been studied extensively before: there are many different
parameter regimes and many different variants. Previous works have used
complementary styles of arguments---which each work in their own parameter
regimes but not in others---and moreover have left some gaps in our
understanding of the list-decodability of random linear codes. In particular,
none of these arguments work well for list-recovery, a generalization of
list-decoding that has been useful in a variety of settings.
  In this work, we present a new approach, which works across parameter regimes
and further generalizes to list-recovery. Our main theorem can establish better
list-decoding and list-recovery results for low-rate random linear codes over
large fields; list-recovery of high-rate random linear codes; and it can
recover the rate bounds of Guruswami, Hastad, and Kopparty for constant-rate
random linear codes (although with large list sizes).

run into a certain subset of its state space, stand at the core of verification
and synthesis problems for hybrid systems. This volume contains papers

 <dc:title>A Deep Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks for Dynamic MR Image

 <dc:description>  Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we propose a framework for
reconstructing dynamic sequences of 2D cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) images
from undersampled data using a deep cascade of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to accelerate the data acquisition process. In particular, we address
the case where data is acquired using aggressive Cartesian undersampling.
Firstly, we show that when each 2D image frame is reconstructed independently,
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art 2D compressed sensing
approaches such as dictionary learning-based MR image reconstruction, in terms
of reconstruction error and reconstruction speed. Secondly, when reconstructing
the frames of the sequences jointly, we demonstrate that CNNs can learn
spatio-temporal correlations efficiently by combining convolution and data
sharing approaches. We show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and is capable of preserving anatomical structure more
faithfully up to 11-fold undersampling. Moreover, reconstruction is very fast:
each complete dynamic sequence can be reconstructed in less than 10s and, for
the 2D case, each image frame can be reconstructed in 23ms, enabling real-time
applications.
