 <dc:title>Is writing style predictive of scientific fraud?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of detecting scientific fraud using machine learning was recently
introduced, with initial, positive results from a model taking into account
various general indicators. The results seem to suggest that writing style is
predictive of scientific fraud. We revisit these initial experiments, and show
that the leave-one-out testing procedure they used likely leads to a slight
over-estimate of the predictability, but also that simple models can outperform
their proposed model by some margin. We go on to explore more abstract
linguistic features, such as linguistic complexity and discourse structure,
only to obtain negative results. Upon analyzing our models, we do see some
interesting patterns, though: Scientific fraud, for examples, contains less
comparison, as well as different types of hedging and ways of presenting
logical reasoning.

 <dc:title>A Polynomial Time Match Test for Large Classes of Extended Regular
  Expressions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reidenbach, Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Schmid, Markus L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the present paper, we study the match test for extended regular
expressions. We approach this NP-complete problem by introducing a novel
variant of two-way multihead automata, which reveals that the complexity of the
match test is determined by a hidden combinatorial property of extended regular
expressions, and it shows that a restriction of the corresponding parameter
leads to rich classes with a polynomial time match test. For presentational
reasons, we use the concept of pattern languages in order to specify extended
regular expressions. While this decision, formally, slightly narrows the scope
of our results, an extension of our concepts and results to more general
notions of extended regular expressions is straightforward.

 <dc:description>  The paper investigates navigability with imperfect information. It shows that
the properties of navigability with perfect recall are exactly those captured
by Armstrong's axioms from the database theory. If the assumption of perfect
recall is omitted, then Armstrong's transitivity axiom is not valid, but it can
be replaced by two new weaker principles. The main technical results are
soundness and completeness theorems for the logical systems describing
properties of navigability with and without perfect recall.

 <dc:title>Do Convolutional Networks need to be Deep for Text Classification ?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study in this work the importance of depth in convolutional models for
text classification, either when character or word inputs are considered. We
show on 5 standard text classification and sentiment analysis tasks that deep
models indeed give better performances than shallow networks when the text
input is represented as a sequence of characters. However, a simple
shallow-and-wide network outperforms deep models such as DenseNet with word
inputs. Our shallow word model further establishes new state-of-the-art
performances on two datasets: Yelp Binary (95.9\%) and Yelp Full (64.9\%).

 <dc:description>  We study parametric Markov decision processes (PMDPs) and their reachability
probabilities &quot;independent&quot; of the parameters. Different to existing work on
parameter synthesis (implemented in the tools PARAM and PRISM), our main focus
is on describing different types of optimal deterministic memoryless schedulers
for the whole parameter range. We implement a simple prototype tool SEA-PARAM
that computes these optimal schedulers and show experimental results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we continue our research line on logical characterizations of
behavioral metrics obtained from the definition of a metric over the set of
logical properties of interest. This time we provide a characterization of both
strong and weak trace metric on nondeterministic probabilistic processes, based
on a minimal boolean logic L which we prove to be powerful enough to
characterize strong and weak probabilistic trace equivalence. Moreover, we also
prove that our characterization approach can be restated in terms of a more
classic probabilistic L-model checking problem.

 <dc:description>  PAWS is a tool to analyse the behaviour of weighted automata and conditional
transition systems. At its core PAWS is based on a generic implementation of
algorithms for checking language equivalence in weighted automata and
bisimulation in conditional transition systems. This architecture allows for
the use of arbitrary user-defined semirings. New semirings can be generated
during run-time and the user can rely on numerous automatisation techniques to
create new semiring structures for PAWS' algorithms. Basic semirings such as
distributive complete lattices and fields of fractions can be defined by
specifying few parameters, more exotic semirings can be generated from other
semirings or defined from scratch using a built-in semiring generator. In the
most general case, users can define new semirings by programming (in C#) the
base operations of the semiring and a procedure to solve linear equations and
use their newly generated semiring in the analysis tools that PAWS offers.

 <dc:title>Design and Optimisation of the FlyFast Front-end for Attribute-based

 <dc:description>  Collective Adaptive Systems (CAS) consist of a large number of interacting
objects. The design of such systems requires scalable analysis tools and
methods, which have necessarily to rely on some form of approximation of the
system's actual behaviour. Promising techniques are those based on mean-field
approximation. The FlyFast model-checker uses an on-the-fly algorithm for
bounded PCTL model-checking of selected individual(s) in the context of very
large populations whose global behaviour is approximated using deterministic
limit mean-field techniques. Recently, a front-end for FlyFast has been
proposed which provides a modelling language, PiFF in the sequel, for the
Predicate-based Interaction for FlyFast. In this paper we present details of
PiFF design and an approach to state-space reduction based on probabilistic
bisimulation for inhomogeneous DTMCs.

 <dc:description>  Static program analysis is used to summarize properties over all dynamic
executions. In a unifying approach based on 3-valued logic properties are
either assigned a definite value or unknown. But in summarizing a set of
executions, a property is more accurately represented as being biased towards
true, or towards false. Compilers use program analysis to determine benefit of
an optimization. Since benefit (e.g., performance) is justified based on the
common case understanding bias is essential in guiding the compiler.
Furthermore, successful optimization also relies on understanding the quality
of the information, i.e. the plausibility of the bias. If the quality of the
static information is too low to form a decision we would like a mechanism that
improves dynamically.
  We consider the problem of building such a reasoning framework and present
the fuzzy data-flow analysis. Our approach generalize previous work that use
3-valued logic. We derive fuzzy extensions of data-flow analyses used by the
lazy code motion optimization and unveil opportunities previous work would not
detect due to limited expressiveness. Furthermore we show how the results of
our analysis can be used in an adaptive classifier that improve as the
application executes.

 <dc:description>  Even todays most advanced machine learning models are easily fooled by almost
imperceptible perturbations of their inputs. Foolbox is a new Python package to
generate such adversarial perturbations and to quantify and compare the
robustness of machine learning models. It is build around the idea that the
most comparable robustness measure is the minimum perturbation needed to craft
an adversarial example. To this end, Foolbox provides reference implementations
of most published adversarial attack methods alongside some new ones, all of
which perform internal hyperparameter tuning to find the minimum adversarial
perturbation. Additionally, Foolbox interfaces with most popular deep learning
frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow, Theano and MXNet, provides a
straight forward way to add support for other frameworks and allows different
adversarial criteria such as targeted misclassification and top-k
misclassification as well as different distance measures. The code is licensed

 <dc:title>Classifying document types to enhance search and recommendations in

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of classifying documents available from
the global network of (open access) repositories according to their type. We
show that the metadata provided by repositories enabling us to distinguish
research papers, thesis and slides are missing in over 60% of cases. While
these metadata describing document types are useful in a variety of scenarios
ranging from research analytics to improving search and recommender (SR)
systems, this problem has not yet been sufficiently addressed in the context of
the repositories infrastructure. We have developed a new approach for
classifying document types using supervised machine learning based exclusively
on text specific features. We achieve 0.96 F1-score using the random forest and
Adaboost classifiers, which are the best performing models on our data. By
analysing the SR system logs of the CORE [1] digital library aggregator, we
show that users are an order of magnitude more likely to click on research
papers and thesis than on slides. This suggests that using document types as a
feature for ranking/filtering SR results in digital libraries has the potential
to improve user experience.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present our solution to Google YouTube-8M Video
Classification Challenge 2017. We leveraged both video-level and frame-level
features in the submission. For video-level classification, we simply used a
200-mixture Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer, which achieves GAP 0.802 on the
validation set with a single model. For frame-level classification, we utilized
several variants of recurrent neural networks, sequence aggregation with
attention mechanism and 1D convolutional models. We achieved GAP 0.8408 on the
private testing set with the ensemble model.

 <dc:description>  Program synthesis and repair have emerged as an exciting area of research,
driven by the potential for revolutionary advances in programmer productivity.
Among most promising ideas emerging for synthesis are syntax-driven search,
probabilistic models of code, and the use of input-output examples. Our paper
shows how to combine these techniques and use them for program repair, which is
among the most relevant applications of synthesis to general-purpose code. Our
approach combines semantic specifications, in the form of pre- and
post-conditions and input-output examples with syntactic specifications in the
form of term grammars and AST-level statistics extracted from code corpora. We
show that synthesis in this framework can be viewed as an instance of graph
search, permitting the use of well-understood families of techniques such as
A*. We implement our algorithm in a framework for verification, synthesis and
repair of functional programs, demonstrating that our approach can repair
programs that are beyond the reach of previous tools.

 <dc:description>  A constant-rate multi-mode system is a hybrid system that can switch freely
among a finite set of modes, and whose dynamics is specified by a finite number
of real-valued variables with mode-dependent constant rates. Alur, Wojtczak,
and Trivedi have shown that reachability problems for constant-rate multi-mode
systems for open and convex safety sets can be solved in polynomial time. In
this paper, we study the reachability problem for non-convex state spaces and
show that this problem is in general undecidable. We recover decidability by
making certain assumptions about the safety set. We present a new algorithm to
solve this problem and compare its performance with the popular sampling based
algorithm rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) as implemented in the Open Motion
Planning Library (OMPL).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we define a notion of automatic randomness tests (ART) which
capture measure theoretic typicalness of infinite binary sequences within the
framework of automata theory. An individual ART is found to be equivalent to a
deterministic B\&quot;{u}chi automaton recognizing $\omega$-language of (Lebesgue)
measure zero. A collection of ART's induce a notion of automatic random
sequence. We provide a purely combinatorial characterization of an automatic
random sequence in the form of a disjunctive property for sequences. At last,
we compare two kinds of automatic randomness tests presented in this paper.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an overview of the most effective ideas for the
Quad-rotor project. The concept of modeling using different methods is
presented. The modeling part presented the nonlinear model, and the concept of
linearization using small disturbance theory. Parameter identifications part
explained the most important parameters that affect the system stability and
tried to get suitable solutions for these problems and identify some parameters
experimentally. Data filtration, Kalman filter, Structure design, motor
distribution, aerodynamic effect, analysis of shroud and its effect on the
resultant thrust were explained. The control part incorporates different
classical schemes such as PD and PID controllers to stabilize the Quad-rotor.
Also, different ideas are presented to stabilize the quad rotor using PID
controllers with some modification to get high maneuverability and better
performance.

 <dc:description>  Most deep reinforcement learning algorithms are data inefficient in complex
and rich environments, limiting their applicability to many scenarios. One
direction for improving data efficiency is multitask learning with shared
neural network parameters, where efficiency may be improved through transfer
across related tasks. In practice, however, this is not usually observed,
because gradients from different tasks can interfere negatively, making
learning unstable and sometimes even less data efficient. Another issue is the
different reward schemes between tasks, which can easily lead to one task
dominating the learning of a shared model. We propose a new approach for joint
training of multiple tasks, which we refer to as Distral (Distill &amp; transfer
learning). Instead of sharing parameters between the different workers, we
propose to share a &quot;distilled&quot; policy that captures common behaviour across
tasks. Each worker is trained to solve its own task while constrained to stay
close to the shared policy, while the shared policy is trained by distillation
to be the centroid of all task policies. Both aspects of the learning process
are derived by optimizing a joint objective function. We show that our approach
supports efficient transfer on complex 3D environments, outperforming several
related methods. Moreover, the proposed learning process is more robust and
more stable---attributes that are critical in deep reinforcement learning.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates one of the fundamental issues in cache-enabled
heterogeneous networks (HetNets): how many cache instances should be deployed
at different base stations, in order to provide guaranteed service in a
cost-effective manner. Specifically, we consider two-tier HetNets with
hierarchical caching, where the most popular files are cached at small cell
base stations (SBSs) while the less popular ones are cached at macro base
stations (MBSs). For a given network cache deployment budget, the cache sizes
for MBSs and SBSs are optimized to maximize network capacity while satisfying
the file transmission rate requirements. As cache sizes of MBSs and SBSs affect
the traffic load distribution, inter-tier traffic steering is also employed for
load balancing. Based on stochastic geometry analysis, the optimal cache sizes
for MBSs and SBSs are obtained, which are threshold-based with respect to cache
budget in the networks constrained by SBS backhauls. Simulation results are
provided to evaluate the proposed schemes and demonstrate the applications in
cost-effective network deployment.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we show that saturating output activation functions, such as
the softmax, impede learning on a number of standard classification tasks.
Moreover, we present results showing that the utility of softmax does not stem
from the normalization, as some have speculated. In fact, the normalization
makes things worse. Rather, the advantage is in the exponentiation of error
gradients. This exponential gradient boosting is shown to speed up convergence
and improve generalization. To this end, we demonstrate faster convergence and
better performance on diverse classification tasks: image classification using
CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and semantic segmentation using PASCAL VOC 2012. In the
latter case, using the state-of-the-art neural network architecture, the model
converged 33% faster with our method (roughly two days of training less) than
with the standard softmax activation, and with a slightly better performance to
boot.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a multi-antenna assisted virtual full-duplex (FD) relaying
with reliability-aware iterative decoding at destination node is proposed to
improve system spectral efficiency and reliability. This scheme enables two
half-duplex relay nodes, mimicked as FD relaying, to alternatively serve as
transmitter and receiver to relay their decoded data signals regardless the
decoding errors, meanwhile, cancel the inter-relay interference with
QR-decomposition. Then, by deploying the reliability-aware iterative
detection/decoding process, destination node can efficiently mitigate
inter-frame interference and error propagation effect at the same time.
Simulation results show that, without extra cost of time delay and signalling
overhead, our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional selective
decode-and-forward (S-DF) relaying schemes, such as cyclic redundancy check
based S-DF relaying and threshold based S-DF relaying, by up to 8 dB in terms
of bit-error-rate.

 <dc:title>Universal Sparse Superposition Codes with Spatial Coupling and GAMP

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sparse superposition codes, or sparse regression codes, constitute a new
class of codes which was first introduced for communication over the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. It has been shown that such codes are
capacity-achieving over the AWGN channel under optimal maximum-likelihood
decoding as well as under various efficient iterative decoding schemes equipped
with power allocation or spatially coupled constructions. Here, we generalize
the analysis of these codes to a much broader setting that includes all
memoryless channels. We show, for a large class of memoryless channels, that
spatial coupling allows an efficient decoder, based on the Generalized
Approximate Message-Passing (GAMP) algorithm, to reach the potential (or Bayes
optimal) threshold of the underlying (or uncoupled) code ensemble. Moreover, we
argue that spatially coupled sparse superposition codes universally achieve
capacity under GAMP decoding by showing that the error floor vanishes and the
potential threshold tends to capacity as one of the code parameter goes to
infinity. Furthermore, we provide a closed form formula for the algorithmic
threshold of the underlying code ensemble in terms of a Fisher information.
Relating an algorithmic threshold to a Fisher information has theoretical as
well as practical importance. Our proof relies on the state evolution analysis
and uses the potential method developed in the theory of low-density
parity-check codes and compressed sensing.

 <dc:description>  This work looks in depth at several studies that have attempted to automate
the process of citation importance classification based on the publications
full text. We analyse a range of features that have been previously used in
this task. Our experimental results confirm that the number of in text
references are highly predictive of influence. Contrary to the work of
Valenzuela et al. we find abstract similarity one of the most predictive
features. Overall, we show that many of the features previously described in
literature are not particularly predictive. Consequently, we discuss challenges
and potential improvements in the classification pipeline, provide a critical
review of the performance of individual features and address the importance of
constructing a large scale gold standard reference dataset.

 <dc:description>  Cities are living systems where urban infrastructures and their functions are
defined and evolved due to population behaviors. Profiling the cities and
functional regions has been an important topic in urban design and planning.
This paper studies a unique big data set which includes daily movement data of
tens of millions of city residents, and develop a visual analytics system,
namely UrbanFACET, to discover and visualize the dynamical profiles of multiple
cities and their residents. This big user movement data set, acquired from
mobile users' agnostic check-ins at thousands of phone APPs, is well utilized
in an integrative study and visualization together with urban structure (e.g.,
road network) and POI (Point of Interest) distributions. In particular, we
novelly develop a set of information-theory based metrics to characterize the
mobility patterns of city areas and groups of residents. These multifaceted
metrics including Fluidity, vibrAncy, Commutation, divErsity, and densiTy
(FACET) which categorize and manifest hidden urban functions and behaviors.
UrbanFACET system further allows users to visually analyze and compare the
metrics over different areas and cities in metropolitan scales. The system is
evaluated through both case studies on several big and heavily populated
cities, and user studies involving real-world users.

 <dc:description>  Representing a word by its co-occurrences with other words in context is an
effective way to capture the meaning of the word. However, the theory behind
remains a challenge. In this work, taking the example of a word classification
task, we give a theoretical analysis of the approaches that represent a word X
by a function f(P(C|X)), where C is a context feature, P(C|X) is the
conditional probability estimated from a text corpus, and the function f maps
the co-occurrence measure to a prediction score. We investigate the impact of
context feature C and the function f. We also explain the reasons why using the
co-occurrences with multiple context features may be better than just using a
single one. In addition, some of the results shed light on the theory of
feature learning and machine learning in general.

 <dc:title>Triangle packing in (sparse) tournaments: approximation and

 <dc:description>  Given a tournament T and a positive integer k, the C_3-Pakcing-T problem asks
if there exists a least k (vertex-)disjoint directed 3-cycles in T. This is the
dual problem in tournaments of the classical minimal feedback vertex set
problem. Surprisingly C_3-Pakcing-T did not receive a lot of attention in the
literature. We show that it does not admit a PTAS unless P=NP, even if we
restrict the considered instances to sparse tournaments, that is tournaments
with a feedback arc set (FAS) being a matching. Focusing on sparse tournaments
we provide a (1+6/(c-1)) approximation algorithm for sparse tournaments having
a linear representation where all the backward arcs have &quot;length&quot; at least c.
Concerning kernelization, we show that C_3-Pakcing-T admits a kernel with O(m)
vertices, where m is the size of a given feedback arc set. In particular, we
derive a O(k) vertices kernel for C_3-Pakcing-T when restricted to sparse
instances. On the negative size, we show that C_3-Pakcing-T does not admit a
kernel of (total bit) size O(k^{2-\epsilon}) unless NP is a subset of coNP /
Poly. The existence of a kernel in O(k) vertices for C_3-Pakcing-T remains an
open question.

 <dc:description>  General treebank analyses are graph structured, but parsers are typically
restricted to tree structures for efficiency and modeling reasons. We propose a
new representation and algorithm for a class of graph structures that is
flexible enough to cover almost all treebank structures, while still admitting
efficient learning and inference. In particular, we consider directed, acyclic,
one-endpoint-crossing graph structures, which cover most long-distance
dislocation, shared argumentation, and similar tree-violating linguistic
phenomena. We describe how to convert phrase structure parses, including
traces, to our new representation in a reversible manner. Our dynamic program
uniquely decomposes structures, is sound and complete, and covers 97.3% of the
Penn English Treebank. We also implement a proof-of-concept parser that
recovers a range of null elements and trace types.

 <dc:description>  Today, the vocabulary size for language models in large vocabulary speech
recognition is typically several hundreds of thousands of words. While this is
already sufficient in some applications, the out-of-vocabulary words are still
limiting the usability in others. In agglutinative languages the vocabulary for
conversational speech should include millions of word forms to cover the
spelling variations due to colloquial pronunciations, in addition to the word
compounding and inflections. Very large vocabularies are also needed, for
example, when the recognition of rare proper names is important.

 <dc:title>Synchronization Strings: Channel Simulations and Interactive Coding for

 <dc:description>  We present many new results related to reliable (interactive) communication
over insertion-deletion channels. Synchronization errors, such as insertions
and deletions, strictly generalize the usual symbol corruption errors and are
much harder to protect against.
  We show how to hide the complications of synchronization errors in many
applications by introducing very general channel simulations which efficiently
transform an insertion-deletion channel into a regular symbol corruption
channel with an error rate larger by a constant factor and a slightly smaller
alphabet. We generalize synchronization string based methods which were
recently introduced as a tool to design essentially optimal error correcting
codes for insertion-deletion channels. Our channel simulations depend on the
fact that, at the cost of increasing the error rate by a constant factor,
synchronization strings can be decoded in a streaming manner that preserves
linearity of time. We also provide a lower bound showing that this constant
factor cannot be improved to $1+\epsilon$, in contrast to what is achievable
for error correcting codes. Our channel simulations drastically generalize the
applicability of synchronization strings.
  We provide new interactive coding schemes which simulate any interactive
two-party protocol over an insertion-deletion channel. Our results improve over
the interactive coding scheme of Braverman et al. which achieves a small
constant rate and requires exponential time computations. We provide the first
computationally efficient interactive coding schemes for synchronization
errors, the first coding scheme with a rate approaching one for small noise
rates, and also improve over the maximal tolerable error rate. We also show
tight connections between synchronization strings and edit-distance tree codes
which allow us to transfer results from tree codes directly to edit-distance
tree codes.

 <dc:title>Improving Sparsity in Kernel Adaptive Filters Using a Unit-Norm
  Dictionary</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tobar, Felipe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Kernel adaptive filters, a class of adaptive nonlinear time-series models,
are known by their ability to learn expressive autoregressive patterns from
sequential data. However, for trivial monotonic signals, they struggle to
perform accurate predictions and at the same time keep computational complexity
within desired boundaries. This is because new observations are incorporated to
the dictionary when they are far from what the algorithm has seen in the past.
We propose a novel approach to kernel adaptive filtering that compares new
observations against dictionary samples in terms of their unit-norm
(normalised) versions, meaning that new observations that look like previous
samples but have a different magnitude are not added to the dictionary. We
achieve this by proposing the unit-norm Gaussian kernel and define a
sparsification criterion for this novel kernel. This new methodology is
validated on two real-world datasets against standard KAF in terms of the
normalised mean square error and the dictionary size.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a model for the emergence of innovations, in which cognitive
processes are described as random walks on the network of links among ideas or
concepts, and an innovation corresponds to the first visit of a node. The
transition matrix of the random walk depends on the network weights, while in
turn the weight of an edge is reinforced by the passage of a walker. The
presence of the network naturally accounts for the mechanism of the adjacent
possible, and the model reproduces both the rate at which novelties emerge and
the correlations among them observed empirically. We show this by using
synthetic networks and by studying real data sets on the growth of knowledge in
different scientific disciplines. Edge-reinforced random walks on complex
topologies offer a new modeling framework for the dynamics of correlated
novelties and are another example of coevolution of processes and networks.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning plays a role in many aspects of modern IR systems, and deep
learning is applied in all of them. The fast pace of modern-day research has
given rise to many different approaches for many different IR problems. The
amount of information available can be overwhelming both for junior students
and for experienced researchers looking for new research topics and directions.
Additionally, it is interesting to see what key insights into IR problems the
new technologies are able to give us. The aim of this full-day tutorial is to
give a clear overview of current tried-and-trusted neural methods in IR and how
they benefit IR research. It covers key architectures, as well as the most
promising future directions.

system - a resource-constrained, high- throughput and language-agnostic system
for information extraction from noisy user generated text on social media.
Lithium NLP extracts a rich set of information including entities, topics,
hashtags and sentiment from text. We discuss several real world applications of
the system currently incorporated in Lithium products. We also compare our
system with existing commercial and academic NLP systems in terms of
performance, information extracted and languages supported. We show that
Lithium NLP is at par with and in some cases, outperforms state- of-the-art
commercial NLP systems.

 <dc:description>  Modern software systems in many application areas offer to the user a
multitude of parameters, switches and other customisation hooks. Humans tend to
have difficulties determining the best configurations for particular
applications. Modern optimising compilers are an example of such software
systems; their many parameters need to be tuned for optimal performance, but
are often left at the default values for convenience. In this work, we
automatically determine compiler parameter settings that result in optimised
performance for particular applications. Specifically, we apply a
state-of-the-art automated parameter configuration procedure based on
cutting-edge machine learning and optimisation techniques to two prominent
JavaScript compilers and demonstrate that significant performance improvements,
more than 35% in some cases, can be achieved over the default parameter
settings on a diverse set of benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We prove a tight uniform continuity bound for a family of entropies which
includes the von Neumann entropy, the Tsallis entropy and the $\alpha$-R\'enyi
entropy, $S_\alpha$, for $\alpha\in (0,1)$. We establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for equality in the continuity bound and prove that these
conditions are the same for every member of the family. Our result builds on
recent work in which we constructed a state which was majorized by every state
in a neighbourhood ($\varepsilon$-ball) of a given state, and thus was the
minimal state in majorization order in the $\varepsilon$-ball. This minimal
state satisfies a particular semigroup property, which we exploit to prove our
bound.

 <dc:title>Defensive Alliances in Graphs of Bounded Treewidth</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A set S of vertices of a graph is a defensive alliance if, for each element
of S, the majority of its neighbors is in S. The problem of finding a defensive
alliance of minimum size in a given graph is NP-hard and there are
polynomial-time algorithms if certain parameters are bounded by a fixed
constant. In particular, fixed-parameter tractability results have been
obtained for some structural parameters such as the vertex cover number.
However, for the parameter treewidth, the question of whether the problem is
FPT has remained open. This is unfortunate because treewidth is perhaps the
most prominent graph parameter and has proven successful for many problems. In
this work, we give a negative answer by showing that the problem is W[1]-hard
when parameterized by treewidth, which rules out FPT algorithms under common
assumptions. This is surprising since the problem is known to be FPT when
parameterized by solution size and &quot;subset problems&quot; that satisfy this property
usually tend to be FPT for bounded treewidth as well. We prove W[1]-hardness by
using techniques from a recent hardness result for the problem of finding
so-called secure sets in a graph.

 <dc:description>  Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are the primary means to modelling
dynamical systems in many natural and engineering sciences. The number of
equations required to describe a system with high heterogeneity limits our
capability of effectively performing analyses. This has motivated a large body
of research, across many disciplines, into abstraction techniques that provide
smaller ODE systems while preserving the original dynamics in some appropriate
sense. In this paper we give an overview of a recently proposed
computer-science perspective to this problem, where ODE reduction is recast to
finding an appropriate equivalence relation over ODE variables, akin to
classical models of computation based on labelled transition systems.

 <dc:description>  We investigate factors controlling DNN diversity in the context of the Google
Cloud and YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge. While it is well-known that
ensemble methods improve prediction performance, and that combining accurate
but diverse predictors helps, there is little knowledge on how to best promote
&amp; measure DNN diversity. We show that diversity can be cultivated by some
unexpected means, such as model over-fitting or dropout variations. We also
present details of our solution to the video understanding problem, which
ranked #7 in the Kaggle competition (competing as the Yeti team).

 <dc:title>On (Anti)Conditional Independence in Dempster-Shafer Theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>K&#x142;opotek, Mieczys&#x142;aw A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper verifies a result of {Shenoy:94} concerning graphoidal structure
of Shenoy's notion of independence for Dempster-Shafer theory of belief
functions. Shenoy proved that his notion of independence has graphoidal
properties for positive normal valuations.
  The requirement of strict positive normal valuations as prerequisite for
application of graphoidal properties excludes a wide class of DS belief
functions. It excludes especially so-called probabilistic belief functions. It
is demonstrated that the requirement of positiveness of valuation may be
weakened in that it may be required that commonality function is non-zero for
singleton sets instead, and the graphoidal properties for independence of
belief function variables are then preserved. This means especially that
probabilistic belief functions with all singleton sets as focal points possess
graphoidal properties for independence.

 <dc:title>Sparse Impulse Noise Minimization in UWB Communication using Signal

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many applications, ultra-wide band (UWB) system experiences impulse noise
due to surrounding physical noise sources. Therefore, a conventional receiver
(correlator or matched filter) designed for additive Gaussian noise system is
not optimum for an impulse noise affected communication channel. In this paper,
we propose a new robust receiver design that utilizes the received UWB signal
cluster sparsity to mitigate impulse noise. Further, multipath channel
diversity enhances the signal-to-noise ratio, as compared to the single path
after impulse noise removal in the proposed receiver design. The proposed
receiver is analyzed in time hopping binary phase shift keying UWB system and
is compared with popular blanking non-linearity based receiver in
Bernoulli-Gaussian impulse noise over both single and multipath IEEE 802.15.4a
channels. Unlike existing designs, the proposed receiver does not require any
training sequence. The proposed receiver is observed to be robust with improved
bit error rate performance as compared to a blanking receiver in the presence
of impulse noise.

 <dc:title>Exploring Dimensionality Reductions with Forward and Backward

 <dc:creator>Cavallo, Marco</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dimensionality reduction is a common method for analyzing and visualizing
high-dimensional data across domains. Dimensionality-reduction algorithms
involve complex optimizations and the reduced dimensions computed by these
algorithms generally lack clear relation to the initial data dimensions.
Therefore, interpreting and reasoning about dimensionality reductions can be
difficult. In this work, we introduce two interaction techniques,
\textit{forward projection} and \textit{backward projection}, for reasoning
dynamically about scatter plots of dimensionally reduced data. We also
contribute two related visualization techniques, \textit{prolines} and
\textit{feasibility map} to facilitate and enrich the effective use of the
proposed interactions, which we integrate in a new tool called \textit{Praxis}.
To evaluate our techniques, we first analyze their time and accuracy
performance across varying sample and dimension sizes. We then conduct a user
study in which twelve data scientists use \textit{Praxis} so as to assess the
usefulness of the techniques in performing exploratory data analysis tasks.
Results suggest that our visual interactions are intuitive and effective for
exploring dimensionality reductions and generating hypotheses about the
underlying data.

 <dc:description>  Starting with Michail, Chatzigiannakis, and Spirakis work, the problem of
Counting the number of nodes in Anonymous Dynamic Networks has attracted a lot
of attention. The problem is challenging because nodes are indistinguishable
(they lack identifiers and execute the same program) and the topology may
change arbitrarily from round to round of communication, as long as the network
is connected in each round. The problem is central in distributed computing as
the number of participants is frequently needed to make important decisions,
such as termination, agreement, synchronization, and many others. A variety of
algorithms built on top of mass-distribution techniques have been presented,
analyzed, and also experimentally evaluated; some of them assumed additional
knowledge of network characteristics, such as bounded degree or given upper
bound on the network size. However, the question of whether Counting can be
solved deterministically in sub-exponential time remained open. In this work,
we answer this question positively by presenting Methodical Counting, which
runs in polynomial time and requires no knowledge of network characteristics.
Moreover, we also show how to extend Methodical Counting to compute the sum of
input values and more complex functions without extra cost. Our analysis
leverages previous work on random walks in evolving graphs, combined with
carefully chosen alarms in the algorithm that control the process and its
parameters. To the best of our knowledge, our Counting algorithm and its
extensions to other algebraic and Boolean functions are the first that can be
implemented in practice with worst-case guarantees.

 <dc:description>  Ridesharing can save energy, reduce pollution, and alleviate congestion.
Ridesharing systems allow peer-to-peer ride matching through mobile-phone
applications. In many systems people have little information about the driver
and co-riders. Trust heavily influences the usage of a ridesharing system,
however, work in this area is limited. In this paper, we investigate the role
of social media in shaping trust and delineate factors that influence the
decisions of trust placed on a driver or co-rider. We design a ridesharing
system where a rider can see the Instagram profile and 10 recent pictures of a
co-rider and ask them to make judgments on six trust related questions. We
discovered three important factors that shape trust forming: \textit{social
proof}, \textit{social approval}, and \textit{self-disclosure}. These three
factors account for 40\%, 33\%, and 13\% of the variance, and subsequent
factors extracted accounted for substantially less variance. Using these three
factors, we successfully build a trust prediction model with F-measure of
87.4\%, an improvement from 78.6\% on using all factors collected.

 <dc:description>  Learners regularly abandon online coding tutorials when they get bored or
frustrated, but there are few techniques for anticipating this abandonment to
intervene. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of predicting abandonment
with machine-learned classifiers. Using interaction logs from an online
programming game, we extracted a collection of features that are potentially
related to learner abandonment and engagement, then developed classifiers for
each level. Across the first five levels of the game, our classifiers
successfully predicted 61% to 76% of learners who did not complete the next
level, achieving an average AUC of 0.68. In these classifiers, features
negatively associated with abandonment included account activation and
help-seeking behaviors, whereas features positively associated with abandonment
included features indicating difficulty and disengagement. These findings
highlight the feasibility of providing timely intervention to learners likely
to quit.

 <dc:description>  In search and surveillance applications in robotics, it is intuitive to
spatially distribute robot trajectories with respect to the probability of
locating targets in the domain. Ergodic coverage is one such approach to
trajectory planning in which a robot is directed such that the percentage of
time spent in a region is in proportion to the probability of locating targets
in that region. In this work, we extend the ergodic coverage algorithm to
robots operating in constrained environments and present a formulation that can
capture sensor footprint and avoid obstacles and restricted areas in the
domain. We demonstrate that our formulation easily extends to coordination of
multiple robots equipped with different sensing capabilities to perform ergodic
coverage of a domain.

 <dc:description>  Clustering problems are well-studied in a variety of fields such as data
science, operations research, and computer science. Such problems include
variants of centre location problems, $k$-median, and $k$-means to name a few.
In some cases, not all data points need to be clustered; some may be discarded
for various reasons.
  We study clustering problems with outliers. More specifically, we look at
Uncapacitated Facility Location (UFL), $k$-Median, and $k$-Means. In UFL with
outliers, we have to open some centres, discard up to $z$ points of $\cal X$
and assign every other point to the nearest open centre, minimizing the total
assignment cost plus centre opening costs. In $k$-Median and $k$-Means, we have
to open up to $k$ centres but there are no opening costs. In $k$-Means, the
cost of assigning $j$ to $i$ is $\delta^2(j,i)$. We present several results.
Our main focus is on cases where $\delta$ is a doubling metric or is the
shortest path metrics of graphs from a minor-closed family of graphs. For
uniform-cost UFL with outliers on such metrics we show that a multiswap simple
local search heuristic yields a PTAS. With a bit more work, we extend this to
bicriteria approximations for the $k$-Median and $k$-Means problems in the same
metrics where, for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$, we can find a solution using
$(1+\epsilon)k$ centres whose cost is at most a $(1+\epsilon)$-factor of the
optimum and uses at most $z$ outliers. We also show that natural local search
heuristics that do not violate the number of clusters and outliers for
$k$-Median (or $k$-Means) will have unbounded gap even in Euclidean metrics.
Furthermore, we show how our analysis can be extended to general metrics for
$k$-Means with outliers to obtain a $(25+\epsilon,1+\epsilon)$ bicriteria.

 <dc:description>  The reconstruction of a species phylogeny from genomic data faces two
significant hurdles: 1) the trees describing the evolution of each individual
gene--i.e., the gene trees--may differ from the species phylogeny and 2) the
molecular sequences corresponding to each gene often provide limited
information about the gene trees themselves. In this paper we consider an
approach to species tree reconstruction that addresses both these hurdles.
Specifically, we propose an algorithm for phylogeny reconstruction under the
multispecies coalescent model with a standard model of site substitution. The
multispecies coalescent is commonly used to model gene tree discordance due to
incomplete lineage sorting, a well-studied population-genetic effect.
  In previous work, an information-theoretic trade-off was derived in this
context between the number of loci, $m$, needed for an accurate reconstruction
and the length of the locus sequences, $k$. It was shown that to reconstruct an
internal branch of length $f$, one needs $m$ to be of the order of $1/[f^{2}
\sqrt{k}]$. That previous result was obtained under the molecular clock
assumption, i.e., under the assumption that mutation rates (as well as
population sizes) are constant across the species phylogeny.
  Here we generalize this result beyond the restrictive molecular clock
assumption, and obtain a new reconstruction algorithm that has the same data
requirement (up to log factors). Our main contribution is a novel reduction to
the molecular clock case under the multispecies coalescent. As a corollary, we
also obtain a new identifiability result of independent interest: for any
species tree with $n \geq 3$ species, the rooted species tree can be identified
from the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence
of a molecular clock.

 <dc:title>Multiscale Surrogate Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification for
  Periodic Composite Structures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Computational modeling of the structural behavior of continuous fiber
composite materials often takes into account the periodicity of the underlying
micro-structure. A well established method dealing with the structural behavior
of periodic micro-structures is the so- called Asymptotic Expansion
Homogenization (AEH). By considering a periodic perturbation of the material
displacement, scale bridging functions, also referred to as elastic correctors,
can be derived in order to connect the strains at the level of the
macro-structure with micro- structural strains. For complicated inhomogeneous
micro-structures, the derivation of such functions is usually performed by the
numerical solution of a PDE problem - typically with the Finite Element Method.
Moreover, when dealing with uncertain micro-structural geometry and material
parameters, there is considerable uncertainty introduced in the actual stresses
experienced by the materials. Due to the high computational cost of computing
the elastic correctors, the choice of a pure Monte-Carlo approach for dealing
with the inevitable material and geometric uncertainties is clearly
computationally intractable. This problem is even more pronounced when the
effect of damage in the micro-scale is considered, where re-evaluation of the
micro-structural representative volume element is necessary for every occurring
damage. The novelty in this paper is that a non-intrusive surrogate modeling
approach is employed with the purpose of directly bridging the macro-scale
behavior of the structure with the material behavior in the micro-scale,
therefore reducing the number of costly evaluations of corrector functions,
allowing for future developments on the incorporation of fatigue or static
damage in the analysis of composite structural components.

 <dc:title>A Dichotomy on Constrained Topological Sorting</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce the constrained topological sorting problem (CTS-problem): given
a target language L and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G with labeled vertices,
determine if G has a topological sort which forms a word that belongs to L.
This natural problem applies to several settings, including scheduling with
costs or verifying concurrent programs. It also generalizes the shuffle problem
of formal language theory, which asks if a list of input strings has an
interleaving that achieves a target string. We accordingly call constrained
shuffle problem (CSh-problem) the restriction of our CTS-problem where the
input DAG consists of disjoint strings.
  We study the complexity of the CTS-problem and CSh-problem for regular target
languages: for each fixed regular language L, we call CTS(L) and CSh(L) the
corresponding problems, where the input is the DAG. Our goal is to characterize
the regular languages for which these problems are tractable. We show that both
problems are tractable (in NL) for unions of monomials, a useful language class
for pattern matching, as well as some other cases. We extend this for the
CSh-problem to unions of district group monomials. We also show NP-hardness for
some other languages such as (ab)^*. These results lead to a dichotomy for a
different problem phrasing, when the target is specified as a semiautomaton to
enforce some closure assumptions, and where the semiautomaton is assumed to be
counter-free. In this case, both problems are in NL if the transition monoid of
the semiautomaton is in some class, and NP-hard otherwise. Without the
counter-freeness assumption, we can extend the dichotomy to a partial result
for the CSh-problem. Our proofs use a variety of tools ranging from complexity
theory, combinatorics, algebraic automata theory, Ramsey's theorem, as well as
a custom reduction and other new techniques.

 <dc:title>Lempel-Ziv: a &quot;one-bit catastrophe&quot; but not a tragedy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The so-called &quot;one-bit catastrophe&quot; for the compression algorithm LZ'78 asks
whether the compression ratio of an infinite word can change when a single bit
is added in front of it. We answer positively this open question raised by Lutz
and others: we show that there exists an infinite word $w$ such that
$\rho_{sup}(w)=0$ but $\rho_{inf}(0w)&gt;0$, where $\rho_{sup}$ and $\rho_{inf}$
are respectively the $\limsup$ and the $\liminf$ of the compression ratios
$\rho$ of the prefixes. To that purpose we explore the behaviour of LZ'78 on
finite words and show the following results:
  - There is a constant $C&gt;0$ such that, for any finite word $w$ and any letter
$a$, $\rho(aw)\leq C\sqrt{\rho(w)\log|w|}$. Thus, sufficiently compressible
words ($\rho(w)=o(1/\log|w|)$) remain compressible with a letter in front;
  - The previous result is tight up to a multiplicative constant for any
compression ratio $\rho(w)=O(1/\log|w|)$. In particular, there are infinitely
many words $w$ satisfying $\rho(w)=O(1/\log|w|)$ but $\rho(0w)=\Omega(1)$.

 <dc:description>  We present the first general purpose framework for marginal maximum a
posteriori estimation of probabilistic program variables. By using a series of
code transformations, the evidence of any probabilistic program, and therefore
of any graphical model, can be optimized with respect to an arbitrary subset of
its sampled variables. To carry out this optimization, we develop the first
Bayesian optimization package to directly exploit the source code of its
target, leading to innovations in problem-independent hyperpriors, unbounded
optimization, and implicit constraint satisfaction; delivering significant
performance improvements over prominent existing packages. We present
applications of our method to a number of tasks including engineering design
and parameter optimization.

 <dc:description>  The classical Stable Roommates problem (which is a non-bipartite
generalization of the well-known Stable Marriage problem) asks whether there is
a stable matching for a given set of agents (i.e. a partitioning of the agents
into disjoint pairs such that no two agents induce a blocking pair). Herein,
each agent has a preference list denoting who it prefers to have as a partner,
and two agents are blocking if they prefer to be with each other rather than
with their assigned partners. Since stable matchings may not be unique, we
study an NP-hard optimization variant of Stable Roommates, called Egalitarian
Stable Roommates, which seeks to find a stable matching with a minimum
egalitarian cost $\gamma$, (i.e. the sum of the dissatisfaction of the matched
agents is minimum). The dissatisfaction of an agent is the number of agents
that this agent prefers over its partner if it is matched; otherwise it is the
length of its preference list. We also study almost stable matchings, called
Min-Block-Pairs Stable Roommates, which seeks to find a matching with a minimum
number $\beta$ of blocking pairs. Our main result is that Egalitarian Stable
Roommates parameterized by $\gamma$ is fixed-parameter tractable while
Min-Block-Pairs Stable Roommates parameterized by $\beta$ is W[1]-hard.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many computer vision problems are formulated as the optimization of a cost
function. This approach faces two main challenges: (i) designing a cost
function with a local optimum at an acceptable solution, and (ii) developing an
efficient numerical method to search for one (or multiple) of these local
optima. While designing such functions is feasible in the noiseless case, the
stability and location of local optima are mostly unknown under noise,
occlusion, or missing data. In practice, this can result in undesirable local
optima or not having a local optimum in the expected place. On the other hand,
numerical optimization algorithms in high-dimensional spaces are typically
local and often rely on expensive first or second order information to guide
the search. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Discriminative
Optimization (DO), a method that learns search directions from data without the
need of a cost function. Specifically, DO explicitly learns a sequence of
updates in the search space that leads to stationary points that correspond to
desired solutions. We provide a formal analysis of DO and illustrate its
benefits in the problem of 3D point cloud registration, camera pose estimation,
and image denoising. We show that DO performed comparably or outperformed
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness to perturbations,
and computational efficiency.

 <dc:title>Model compression as constrained optimization, with application to

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of deep neural net compression by quantization: given
a large, reference net, we want to quantize its real-valued weights using a
codebook with $K$ entries so that the training loss of the quantized net is
minimal. The codebook can be optimally learned jointly with the net, or fixed,
as for binarization or ternarization approaches. Previous work has quantized
the weights of the reference net, or incorporated rounding operations in the
backpropagation algorithm, but this has no guarantee of converging to a
loss-optimal, quantized net. We describe a new approach based on the recently
proposed framework of model compression as constrained optimization
\citep{Carreir17a}. This results in a simple iterative &quot;learning-compression&quot;
algorithm, which alternates a step that learns a net of continuous weights with
a step that quantizes (or binarizes/ternarizes) the weights, and is guaranteed
to converge to local optimum of the loss for quantized nets. We develop
algorithms for an adaptive codebook or a (partially) fixed codebook. The latter
includes binarization, ternarization, powers-of-two and other important
particular cases. We show experimentally that we can achieve much higher
compression rates than previous quantization work (even using just 1 bit per
weight) with negligible loss degradation.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks have been able to achieve groundbreaking accuracy at tasks
conventionally considered only doable by humans. Using stochastic gradient
descent, optimization in many dimensions is made possible, albeit at a
relatively high computational cost. By splitting training data into batches,
networks can be distributed and trained vastly more efficiently and with
minimal accuracy loss. We have explored the mathematics behind efficiently
implementing tensor-based batch backpropagation algorithms. A common approach
to batch training is iterating over batch items individually. Explicitly using
tensor operations to backpropagate allows training to be performed
non-linearly, increasing computational efficiency.

 <dc:description>  An end-to-end platform for chemical science research has been developed that
integrates data from computational and experimental approaches through a modern
web-based interface. The platform offers a highly interactive visualization and
analytics environment that functions well on mobile, laptop and desktop
devices. It offers pragmatic solutions to ensure that large and complex data
sets are more accessible. Existing desktop applications/frameworks were
extended to integrate with high-performance computing (HPC) resources, and
offer command-line tools to automate interaction---connecting distributed teams
to this software platform on their own terms. The platform was developed
openly, and all source code hosted on the GitHub platform with automated
deployment possible using Ansible coupled with standard Ubuntu-based machine
images deployed to cloud machines.
  The platform is designed to enable teams to reap the benefits of the
connected web---going beyond what conventional search and analytics platforms
offer in this area. It also has the goal of offering federated instances, that
can be customized to the sites/research performed. Data gets stored using JSON,
extending upon previous approaches using XML, building structures that support
computational chemistry calculations. These structures were developed to make
it easy to process data across different languages, and send data to a
JavaScript web client.

 <dc:title>A Tight Approximation for Co-flow Scheduling for Minimizing Total
  Weighted Completion Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Im, Sungjin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Purohit, Manish</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Co-flows model a modern scheduling setting that is commonly found in a
variety of applications in distributed and cloud computing. In co-flow
scheduling, there are $m$ input ports and $m$ output ports. Each co-flow $j \in
J$ can be represented by a bipartite graph between the input and output ports,
where each edge $(i,o)$ with demand $d_{i,o}^j$ means that $d_{i,o}^j$ units of
packets must be delivered from port $i$ to port $o$. To complete co-flow $j$,
we must satisfy all of its demands. Due to capacity constraints, a port can
only transmit (or receive) one unit of data in unit time. A feasible schedule
at each time $t$ must therefore be a bipartite matching.
  We consider co-flow scheduling and seek to optimize the popular objective of
total weighted completion time. Our main result is a
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation for this problem, which is essentially tight, as
the problem is hard to approximate within a factor of $(2 - \epsilon)$. This
improves upon the previous best known 4-approximation. Further, our result
holds even when jobs have release times without any loss in the approximation
guarantee. The key idea of our approach is to construct a continuous-time
schedule using a configuration linear program and interpret each job's
completion time therein as the job's deadline. The continuous-time schedule
serves as a witness schedule meeting the discovered deadlines, which allows us
to reduce the problem to a deadline-constrained scheduling problem.

 <dc:title>Privacy-preserving Decentralized Optimization Based on ADMM</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of privacy-preservation in
decentralized optimization, where $N$ agents cooperatively minimize an
objective function that is the sum of $N$ strongly convex functions private to
these individual agents. In most existing decentralized optimization
approaches, participating agents exchange and disclose estimates explicitly,
which may not be desirable when the estimates contain sensitive information of
individual agents. The problem is more acute when adversaries exist which try
to steal information from other participating agents. To address this issue, we
propose a privacy-preserving decentralized optimization approach based on ADMM
and partially homomorphic cryptography. In contrast to differential privacy
based approaches which use noise to cover sensitive information and are subject
to a trade-off between privacy and accuracy, our approach can provide privacy
without compromising the optimality of the solution. To our knowledge, this is
the first time that cryptographic techniques are incorporated in a fully
decentralized setting to enable privacy preservation in decentralized
optimization in the absence of any third party or aggegator. To facilitate the
incorporation of encryption in a fully decentralized manner, we also introduce
a new ADMM which allows time-varying penalty matrices and rigorously prove its
convergence. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness and low
computational complexity of the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Constructions of cyclic constant dimension codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Subspace codes and particularly constant dimension codes have attracted much
attention in recent years due to their applications in random network coding.
As a particular subclass of subspace codes, cyclic subspace codes have
additional properties that can be applied efficiently in encoding and decoding
algorithms. It is desirable to find cyclic constant dimension codes such that
both the code sizes and the minimum distances are as large as possible. In this
paper, we explore the ideas of constructing cyclic constant dimension codes
proposed in \big([2], IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2016\big) and \big([17], Des.
Codes Cryptogr., 2016\big) to obtain further results. Consequently, new code
constructions are provided and several previously known results in [2] and [17]
are extended.

 <dc:description>  Submodular functions are a broad class of set functions, which naturally
arise in diverse areas. Many algorithms have been suggested for the
maximization of these functions. Unfortunately, once the function deviates from
submodularity, the known algorithms may perform arbitrarily poorly. Amending
this issue, by obtaining approximation results for set functions generalizing
submodular functions, has been the focus of recent works.
  One such class, known as weakly submodular functions, has received a lot of
attention. A key result proved by Das and Kempe (2011) showed that the
approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for weakly submodular maximization
subject to a cardinality constraint degrades smoothly with the distance from
submodularity. However, no results have been obtained for maximization subject
to constraints beyond cardinality. In particular, it is not known whether the
greedy algorithm achieves any non-trivial approximation ratio for such
constraints.
  In this paper, we prove that a randomized version of the greedy algorithm
(previously used by Buchbinder et al. (2014) for a different problem) achieves
an approximation ratio of $(1 + 1/\gamma)^{-2}$ for the maximization of a
weakly submodular function subject to a general matroid constraint, where
$\gamma$ is a parameter measuring the distance of the function from
submodularity. Moreover, we also experimentally compare the performance of this
version of the greedy algorithm on real world problems against natural
benchmarks, and show that the algorithm we study performs well also in
practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm with a
non-trivial approximation guarantee for maximizing a weakly submodular function
subject to a constraint other than the simple cardinality constraint. In
particular, it is the first algorithm with such a guarantee for the important
and broad class of matroid constraints.

 <dc:description>  In geometry processing, smoothness energies are commonly used to model
scattered data interpolation, dense data denoising, and regularization during
shape optimization. The squared Laplacian energy is a popular choice of energy
and has a corresponding standard implementation: squaring the discrete
Laplacian matrix. For compact domains, when values along the boundary are not
known in advance, this construction bakes in low-order boundary conditions.
This causes the geometric shape of the boundary to strongly bias the solution.
For many applications, this is undesirable. Instead, we propose using the
squared Frobenious norm of the Hessian as a smoothness energy. Unlike the
squared Laplacian energy, this energy's natural boundary conditions (those that
best minimize the energy) correspond to meaningful high-order boundary
conditions. These boundary conditions model free boundaries where the shape of
the boundary should not bias the solution locally. Our analysis begins in the
smooth setting and concludes with discretizations using finite-differences on
2D grids or mixed finite elements for triangle meshes. We demonstrate the core
behavior of the squared Hessian as a smoothness energy for various tasks.

 <dc:description>  Phenomics is an emerging branch of modern biology, which uses high throughput
phenotyping tools to capture multiple environment and phenotypic trait
measurements, at a massive scale. The resulting high dimensional data sets
represent a treasure trove of information for providing an indepth
understanding of how multiple factors interact and contribute to control the
growth and behavior of different plant crop genotypes. However, computational
tools that can parse through such high dimensional data sets and aid in
extracting plausible hypothesis are currently lacking. In this paper, we
present a new algorithmic approach to effectively decode and characterize the
role of environment on phenotypic traits, from complex phenomic data. To the
best of our knowledge, this effort represents the first application of
topological data analysis on phenomics data.
  We applied this novel algorithmic approach on a real-world maize data set.
Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to delineate emergent
behavior among subpopulations, as dictated by one or more environmental
factors; notably, our approach shows how the environment plays a key role in
determining the phenotypic behavior of one of the two genotypes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a scalable system which can do real-time analytics
for different health applications. The occurrence of different health
conditions can be regarded as the complex events and thus this concept can be
extended to other use cases easily. Large number of users should be able to
send the data in real-time, and should be able to receive the feedback and
result. Keeping the requirements in mind we used Kafka and Spark to develop our
system. In this setting, multiple users are running Kafka producer clients,
which are sending data in real-time. Spark streaming is used to process data
from Kafka of different window sizes to analyze the health conditions. We have
developed and tested the heart attack risk and stress prediction as our sample
complex events detection use cases. We have simulated and tested our system
with multiple health datasets.

 <dc:description>  Text-dependent speaker verification is becoming popular in the speaker
recognition society. However, the conventional i-vector framework which has
been successful for speaker identification and other similar tasks works
relatively poorly in this task. Researchers have proposed several new methods
to improve performance, but it is still unclear that which model is the best
choice, especially when the pass-phrases are prompted during enrollment and
test. In this paper, we introduce four modeling methods and compare their
performance on the newly published RedDots dataset. To further explore the
influence of different frame alignments, Viterbi and forward-backward
algorithms are both used in the HMM-based models. Several bottleneck features
are also investigated. Our experiments show that, by explicitly modeling the
lexical content, the HMM-based modeling achieves good results in the
fixed-phrase condition. In the prompted-phrase condition, GMM-HMM and
i-vector/HMM are not as successful. In both conditions, the forward-backward
algorithm brings more benefits to the i-vector/HMM system. Additionally, we
also find that even though bottleneck features perform well for
text-independent speaker verification, they do not outperform MFCCs on the most
challenging Imposter-Correct trials on RedDots.

 <dc:description>  Nowozin \textit{et al} showed last year how to extend the GAN
\textit{principle} to all $f$-divergences. The approach is elegant but falls
short of a full description of the supervised game, and says little about the
key player, the generator: for example, what does the generator actually
converge to if solving the GAN game means convergence in some space of
parameters? How does that provide hints on the generator's design and compare
to the flourishing but almost exclusively experimental literature on the
subject?
  In this paper, we unveil a broad class of distributions for which such
convergence happens --- namely, deformed exponential families, a wide superset
of exponential families --- and show tight connections with the three other key
GAN parameters: loss, game and architecture. In particular, we show that
current deep architectures are able to factorize a very large number of such
densities using an especially compact design, hence displaying the power of
deep architectures and their concinnity in the $f$-GAN game. This result holds
given a sufficient condition on \textit{activation functions} --- which turns
out to be satisfied by popular choices. The key to our results is a variational
generalization of an old theorem that relates the KL divergence between regular
exponential families and divergences between their natural parameters. We
complete this picture with additional results and experimental insights on how
these results may be used to ground further improvements of GAN architectures,
via (i) a principled design of the activation functions in the generator and
(ii) an explicit integration of proper composite losses' link function in the
discriminator.

 <dc:title>Symbolic Stochastic Chase Decoding of Reed-Solomon and BCH Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mani, Hossein</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hemati, Saied</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the Symbolic-Stochastic Chase Decoding Algorithm (S-SCA)
for the Reed-Solomon (RS) and BCH codes. By efficient usage of void space
between constellation points for $q$-ary modulations and using soft information
at the input of the decoder, the S-SCA is capable of outperforming conventional
Symbolic-Chase algorithm (S-CA) with less computational cost. Since the S-SCA
starts with the randomized generation of likely test-vectors, it reduces the
complexity to polynomial order and also it does not need to find the least
reliable symbols to generate test-vectors. Our simulation results show that by
increasing the number of test-vectors, the performance of the algorithm can
approach the ML bound. The S-SCA($1K$) provides near $2$ dB gain in comparison
with S-CA($1K$) for $(31, 25)$ RS code using $32$-QAM. Furthermore, the
algorithm provides near $3$ dB further gain with $1K$ iteration compared with
S-CA($65K$) when $(255, 239)$ RS code is used in an AWGN channel. For the
Rayleigh fading channel and the same code, the algorithm provides more that $5$
dB gain. Also for $(63, 57)$ BCH codes and $8$-PSK modulation the proposed
algorithm provides $3$dB gain with less complexity.
  This decoder is Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO) decoder and is highly
attractive in low power applications. Finally, the Symbolic-Search
Bitwise-Transmission Stochastic Chase Algorithm (SSBT-SCA) was introduced for
RS codes over BPSK transmission that is capable of generating symbolic
test-vectors that reduce complexity and mitigate burst errors.

 <dc:description>  Computer science offers a large set of tools for prototyping, writing,
running, testing, validating, sharing and reproducing results, however
computational science lags behind. In the best case, authors may provide their
source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research
is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho
proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results
is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software
environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new
workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to
adapt: source codes are rarely requested, hardly ever actually executed to
check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a
peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the
explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and
open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can
be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing
chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals.
ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational
study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software
tests.

 <dc:title>Comprehensive Analysis on Exact Asymptotics of Random Coding Error
  Probability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Honda, Junya</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers error probabilities of random codes for memoryless
channels in the fixed-rate regime. Random coding is a fundamental scheme to
achieve the channel capacity and many studies have been conducted for the
asymptotics of the decoding error probability. Gallager derived the exact
asymptotics (that is, a bound with asymptotically vanishing relative error) of
the error probability below the critical rate. On the other hand, exact
asymptotics for fixed rate above the critical rate has been unknown except for
symmetric channels (in the strong sense) and strongly nonlattice channels. This
paper derives the exact asymptotics for general memoryless channels covering
all previously unsolved cases. The analysis reveals that strongly symmetric
channels and strongly nonlattice channels correspond to two extreme cases and
the expression of the asymptotics is much complicated for general channels.

 <dc:description>  A significant amount of research in recent years has been dedicated towards
single agent deep reinforcement learning. Much of the success of deep
reinforcement learning can be attributed towards the use of experience replay
memories within which state transitions are stored. Function approximation
methods such as convolutional neural networks (referred to as deep Q-Networks,
or DQNs, in this context) can subsequently be trained through sampling the
stored transitions. However, considerations are required when using experience
replay memories within multi-agent systems, as stored transitions can become
outdated due to agents updating their respective policies in parallel [1]. In
this work we apply leniency [2] to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MA-DRL), acting as a control mechanism to determine which state-transitions
sampled are allowed to update the DQN. Our resulting Lenient-DQN (LDQN) is
evaluated using variations of the Coordinated Multi-Agent Object Transportation
Problem (CMOTP) outlined by Busoniu et al. [3]. The LDQN significantly
outperforms the existing hysteretic DQN (HDQN) [4] within environments that
yield stochastic rewards. Based on results from experiments conducted using
vanilla and double Q-learning versions of the lenient and hysteretic
algorithms, we advocate a hybrid approach where learners initially use vanilla
Q-learning before transitioning to double Q-learners upon converging on a
cooperative joint policy.

 <dc:title>Inner-Scene Similarities as a Contextual Cue for Object Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Using image context is an effective approach for improving object detection.
Previously proposed methods used contextual cues that rely on semantic or
spatial information. In this work, we explore a different kind of contextual
information: inner-scene similarity. We present the CISS (Context by Inner
Scene Similarity) algorithm, which is based on the observation that two
visually similar sub-image patches are likely to share semantic identities,
especially when both appear in the same image. CISS uses base-scores provided
by a base detector and performs as a post-detection stage. For each candidate
sub-image (denoted anchor), the CISS algorithm finds a few similar sub-images
(denoted supporters), and, using them, calculates a new enhanced score for the
anchor. This is done by utilizing the base-scores of the supporters and a
pre-trained dependency model. The new scores are modeled as a linear function
of the base scores of the anchor and the supporters and is estimated using a
minimum mean square error optimization. This approach results in: (a) improved
detection of partly occluded objects (when there are similar non-occluded
objects in the scene), and (b) fewer false alarms (when the base detector
mistakenly classifies a background patch as an object). This work relates to
Duncan and Humphreys' &quot;similarity theory,&quot; a psychophysical study. which
suggested that the human visual system perceptually groups similar image
regions and that the classification of one region is affected by the estimated
identity of the other. Experimental results demonstrate the enhancement of a
base detector's scores on the PASCAL VOC dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present Singlish sentiment lexicon, a concept-level
knowledge base for sentiment analysis that associates multiword expressions to
a set of emotion labels and a polarity value. Unlike many other sentiment
analysis resources, this lexicon is not built by manually labeling pieces of
knowledge coming from general NLP resources such as WordNet or DBPedia.
Instead, it is automatically constructed by applying graph-mining and
multi-dimensional scaling techniques on the affective common-sense knowledge
collected from three different sources. This knowledge is represented
redundantly at three levels: semantic network, matrix, and vector space.
Subsequently, the concepts are labeled by emotions and polarity through the
ensemble application of spreading activation, neural networks and an emotion
categorization model.

 <dc:description>  Semantic parsing shines at analyzing complex natural language that involves
composition and computation over multiple pieces of evidence. However, datasets
for semantic parsing contain many factoid questions that can be answered from a
single web document. In this paper, we propose to evaluate semantic
parsing-based question answering models by comparing them to a question
answering baseline that queries the web and extracts the answer only from web
snippets, without access to the target knowledge-base. We investigate this
approach on COMPLEXQUESTIONS, a dataset designed to focus on compositional
language, and find that our model obtains reasonable performance (35 F1
compared to 41 F1 of state-of-the-art). We find in our analysis that our model
performs well on complex questions involving conjunctions, but struggles on
questions that involve relation composition and superlatives.

 <dc:title>Approximating the Nash Social Welfare with Budget-Additive Valuations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for maximizing
the Nash social welfare when allocating indivisible items to agents with
budget-additive valuation functions. Budget-additive valuations represent an
important class of submodular functions. They have attracted a lot of research
interest in recent years due to many interesting applications. For every
$\varepsilon &gt; 0$, our algorithm obtains a $(2.404 +
\varepsilon)$-approximation in time polynomial in the input size and
$1/\varepsilon$.
  Our algorithm relies on rounding an approximate equilibrium in a linear
Fisher market where sellers have earning limits (upper bounds on the amount of
money they want to earn) and buyers have utility limits (upper bounds on the
amount of utility they want to achieve). In contrast to markets with either
earning or utility limits, these markets have not been studied before. They
turn out to have fundamentally different properties.
  Although the existence of equilibria is not guaranteed, we show that the
market instances arising from the Nash social welfare problem always have an
equilibrium. Further, we show that the set of equilibria is not convex,
answering a question of [Cole et al, EC 2017]. We design an FPTAS to compute an
approximate equilibrium, a result that may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Doctoral theses are an important source of publication in universities,
although little research has been carried out on the publications resulting
from theses, on so-called derivative articles. This study investigates how
derivative articles can be identified through a text analysis based on the
full-text of a set of medical theses and the full-text of articles, with which
they shared authorship. The text similarity analysis methodology applied
consisted in exploiting the full-text articles according to organization of
scientific discourse (IMRaD) using the TurnItIn plagiarism tool. The study
found that the text similarity rate in the Discussion section can be used to
discriminate derivative articles from non-derivative articles. Additional
findings were: the first position of the thesis's author dominated in 85% of
derivative articles, the participation of supervisors as coauthors occurred in
100% of derivative articles, the authorship credit retained by the thesis's
author was 42% in derivative articles, the number of coauthors by article was 5
in derivative articles versus 6.4 coauthors, as average, in non-derivative
articles and the time differential regarding the year of thesis completion
showed that 87.5% of derivative articles were published before or in the same
year of thesis completion.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the problem of localizing an autonomous sea-surface vehicle in
river estuarine areas using monocular camera and angular velocity input from an
inertial sensor. Our method is challenged by two prominent drawbacks associated
with the environment, which are typically not present in standard visual
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) applications on land (or air): a)
Scene depth varies significantly (from a few meters to several kilometers) and,
b) In conjunction to the latter, there exists no ground plane to provide
features with enough disparity based on which to reliably detect motion. To
that end, we use the IMU orientation feedback in order to re-cast the problem
of visual localization without the mapping component, although the map can be
implicitly obtained from the camera pose estimates. We find that our method
produces reliable odometry estimates for trajectories several hundred meters
long in the water. To compare the visual odometry estimates with GPS based
ground truth, we interpolate the trajectory with splines on a common parameter
and obtain position error in meters recovering an optimal affine transformation
between the two splines.

 <dc:description>  We study a Rendezvous problem for 2 autonomous mobile robots in asynchronous
settings with persistent memory called light. It is well known that Rendezvous
is impossible when robots have no lights in basic common models, even if the
system is semi-synchronous. On the other hand, Rendezvous is possible if robots
have lights with a constant number of colors in several types lights. In
asynchronous settings, Rendezvous can be solved by robots with 4 colors of
lights in non-rigid movement, if robots can use not only own light but also
other robot's light (full-light), where non-rigid movement means robots may be
stopped before reaching the computed destination but can move a minimum
distance \delta &gt; 0 and rigid movement means robots can reach the computed
destination. In semi-synchronous settings, Rendezvous can be solved with 2
colors of full-lights in non-rigid movement.
  In this paper, we show that in asynchronous settings, Rendezvous can be
solved with 2 colors of full-lights in rigid movement and in non-rigid movement
if robots know the value of the minimum distance \delta. We also show that
Rendezvous can be solved with 2 colors of full-lights in general non-rigid
movement if we consider some reasonable restricted class of asynchronous
settings.

 <dc:description>  Minimal forbidden factors are a useful tool for investigating properties of
words and languages. Two factorial languages are distinct if and only if they
have different (antifactorial) sets of minimal forbidden factors. There exist
algorithms for computing the minimal forbidden factors of a word, as well as of
a regular factorial language. Conversely, Crochemore et al.~[IPL, 1998] gave an
algorithm that, given the trie recognizing a finite antifactorial language $M$,
computes a DFA recognizing the language having $M$ as set of minimal forbidden
factors. In the same paper, they showed that the obtained DFA is minimal if the
input trie recognizes the minimal forbidden factors of a single word. We
generalize this result to the case of a circular word. We also discuss
combinatorial properties of the minimal forbidden factors of a circular word.
Finally, we characterize the minimal forbidden factors of the circular
Fibonacci words.

 <dc:description>  String-based (or viewpoint) models of tonal harmony often struggle with data
sparsity in pattern discovery and prediction tasks, particularly when modeling
composite events like triads and seventh chords, since the number of distinct
n-note combinations in polyphonic textures is potentially enormous. To address
this problem, this study examines the efficacy of skip-grams in music research,
an alternative viewpoint method developed in corpus linguistics and natural
language processing that includes sub-sequences of n events (or n-grams) in a
frequency distribution if their constituent members occur within a certain
number of skips.
  Using a corpus consisting of four datasets of Western classical music in
symbolic form, we found that including skip-grams reduces data sparsity in
n-gram distributions by (1) minimizing the proportion of n-grams with
negligible counts, and (2) increasing the coverage of contiguous n-grams in a
test corpus. What is more, skip-grams significantly outperformed contiguous
n-grams in discovering conventional closing progressions (called cadences).

 <dc:description>  Finding community structures in social networks is considered to be a
challenging task as many of the proposed algorithms are computationally
expensive and does not scale too well for large graphs. Most of the community
detection algorithms proposed till date are unsuitable for applications that
would require detection of communities in real-time, especially for massive
networks. The Louvain method, which uses modularity maximization to detect
clusters, is usually considered to be one of the fastest running community
detection algorithms even without any provable bound. We propose a novel graph
traversal-based community detection framework, which not only runs faster than
the Louvain method but also generates clusters of better quality for most of
the benchmark datasets. We show that our algorithms run in time O(|V | + |E|)
to create an initial cover before using modularity maximization to get the
final cover.

 <dc:description>  Viral videos can reach global penetration traveling through international
channels of communication similarly to real diseases starting from a
well-localized source. In past centuries, disease fronts propagated in a
concentric spatial fashion from the the source of the outbreak via the short
range human contact network. The emergence of long-distance air-travel changed
these ancient patterns. However, recently, Brockmann and Helbing have shown
that concentric propagation waves can be reinstated if propagation time and
distance is measured in the flight-time and travel volume weighted underlying
air-travel network. Here, we adopt this method for the analysis of viral meme
propagation in Twitter messages, and define a similar weighted network distance
in the communication network connecting countries and states of the World. We
recover a wave-like behavior on average and assess the randomizing effect of
non-locality of spreading. We show that similar result can be recovered from
Google Trends data as well.

 <dc:title>Community Aliveness: Discovering Interaction Decay Patterns in Online
  Social Communities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abufouda, Mohammed</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online Social Communities (OSCs) provide a medium for connecting people,
sharing news, eliciting information, and finding jobs, among others. The
dynamics of the interaction among the members of OSCs is not always growth
dynamics. Instead, a $\textit{decay}$ or $\textit{inactivity}$ dynamics often
happens, which makes an OSC obsolete. Understanding the behavior and the
characteristics of the members of an inactive community help to sustain the
growth dynamics of these communities and, possibly, prevents them from being
out of service. In this work, we provide two prediction models for predicting
the interaction decay of community members, namely: a Simple Threshold Model
(STM) and a supervised machine learning classification framework. We conducted
evaluation experiments for our prediction models supported by a $\textit{ground
truth}$ of decayed communities extracted from the StackExchange platform. The
results of the experiments revealed that it is possible, with satisfactory
prediction performance in terms of the F1-score and the accuracy, to predict
the decay of the activity of the members of these communities using
network-based attributes and network-exogenous attributes of the members. The
upper bound of the prediction performance of the methods we used is $0.91$ and
$0.83$ for the F1-score and the accuracy, respectively. These results indicate
that network-based attributes are correlated with the activity of the members
and that we can find decay patterns in terms of these attributes. The results
also showed that the structure of the decayed communities can be used to
support the alive communities by discovering inactive members.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new semi-supervised GAN architecture (ss-InfoGAN)
for image synthesis that leverages information from few labels (as little as
0.22%, max. 10% of the dataset) to learn semantically meaningful and
controllable data representations where latent variables correspond to label
categories. The architecture builds on Information Maximizing Generative
Adversarial Networks (InfoGAN) and is shown to learn both continuous and
categorical codes and achieves higher quality of synthetic samples compared to
fully unsupervised settings. Furthermore, we show that using small amounts of
labeled data speeds-up training convergence. The architecture maintains the
ability to disentangle latent variables for which no labels are available.
Finally, we contribute an information-theoretic reasoning on how introducing
semi-supervision increases mutual information between synthetic and real data.

 <dc:description>  Freeway merging in congested traffic is a significant challenge toward fully
automated driving. Merging vehicles need to decide not only how to merge into a
spot, but also where to merge. We present a method for the freeway merging
based on multi-policy decision making with a reinforcement learning method
called {\em passive actor-critic} (pAC), which learns with less knowledge of
the system and without active exploration. The method selects a merging spot
candidate by using the state value learned with pAC. We evaluate our method
using real traffic data. Our experiments show that pAC achieves 92\% success
rate to merge into a freeway, which is comparable to human decision making.

 <dc:description>  Consensus is fundamental for distributed systems since it underpins key
functionalities of such systems ranging from distributed information fusion,
decision-making, to decentralized control. In order to reach an agreement,
existing consensus algorithms require each agent to exchange explicit state
information with its neighbors. This leads to the disclosure of private state
information, which is undesirable in cases where privacy is of concern. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach that enables secure and privacy-preserving
average consensus in a decentralized architecture in the absence of an
aggregator or third-party. By leveraging partial homomorphic cryptography to
embed secrecy in pairwise interaction dynamics, our approach can guarantee
consensus to the exact value in a deterministic manner without disclosing a
node's state to its neighbors. In addition to enabling resilience to passive
attackers aiming to steal state information, the approach also allows easy
incorporation of defending mechanisms against active attackers which try to
alter the content of exchanged messages. Furthermore, in contrast to existing
noise-injection based privacy-preserving mechanisms which have to reconfigure
the entire network when the topology or number of nodes varies, our approach is
applicable to dynamic environments with time-varying coupling topologies. This
secure and privacy-preservation approach is also applicable to weighted average
consensus as well as maximum/minimum consensus under a new update rule. The
approach is light-weight in computation and communication. Implementation
details and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the capability of
our approach.

 <dc:title>A Comparative Study of Unipolar OFDM Schemes in Gaussian Optical

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the information rates of unipolar orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) in discrete-time optical intensity channels (OIC) with
Gaussian noise under average optical power constraint. Several single-,
double-, and multicomponent unipolar OFDM schemes are considered under the
assumption that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian or
complex Gaussian codebook ensemble and nearest neighbor decoding (minimum
Euclidean distance decoding) are used. We obtain an array of information rate
result. These results validate existing signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio
(SNDR) based rate analysis, establish the equivalence of information rates of
certain schemes, and demonstrate the evident benefits of using
component-multiplexing at high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). For double- and
multi-component schemes, the component power allocation strategies that
maximize the information rates are investigated. In particular, by utilizing a
power allocation strategy, we prove that several multi-component schemes
approach the high SNR capacity of the discrete-time Gaussian OIC under average
power constraint to within 0.07 bits.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a symbol-level selective transmission for virtual full-duplex
(FD) relaying networks is proposed, which aims to mitigate error propagation
effects and improve system spectral efficiency. The idea is to allow two
half-duplex relays, mimicked as FD relaying, to alternatively serve as
transmitter and receiver to forward the source's messages. In this case, each
relay predicts the correctly decoded symbols of its received frame, based on
the generalized square deviation method, and discard the erroneously decoded
symbols, resulting in fewer errors being forwarded to the destination. Then, a
modified maximum \textit{a posteriori} receiver at the destination is provided
to eliminate the inter-frame interference and identify the positions of
discarded symbols from the relays. In addition, the diversity-multiplexing
trade-off (DMT) for our proposed scheme is also analysed. It is found that our
proposed scheme outperforms the conventional selective decode-and-forward
(S-DF) relaying schemes, such as cyclic redundancy check based S-DF and
threshold based S-DF, in terms of DMT. Moreover, the bit-error-rate performance
are also simulated to confirm the DMT results.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of the location of sound sources is usually done using microphone
arrays. Such settings provide an environment where we know the difference
between the received signals among different microphones in the terms of phase
or attenuation, which enables localization of the sound sources. In our
solution we exploit the properties of the room transfer function in order to
localize a sound source inside a room with only one microphone. The shape of
the room and the position of the microphone are assumed to be known. The design
guidelines and limitations of the sensing matrix are given. Implementation is
based on the sparsity in the terms of voxels in a room that are occupied by a
source. What is especially interesting about our solution is that we provide
localization of the sound sources not only in the horizontal plane, but in the
terms of the 3D coordinates inside the room.

 <dc:description>  Reliability assessment of distribution system, based on historical data and
probabilistic methods, leads to an unreliable estimation of reliability indices
since the data for the distribution components are usually inaccurate or
unavailable. Fuzzy logic is an efficient method to deal with the uncertainty in
reliability inputs. In this paper, the ENS index along with other commonly used
indices in reliability assessment are evaluated for the distribution system
using fuzzy logic. Accordingly, the influential variables on the failure rate
and outage duration time of the distribution components, which are natural or
human-made, are explained using proposed fuzzy membership functions. The
reliability indices are calculated and compared for different cases of the
system operations by simulation on the IEEE RBTS Bus 2. The results of
simulation show how utilities can significantly improve the reliability of
their distribution system by considering the risk of the influential variables.

 <dc:title>Probabilistic Timed Automata with Clock-Dependent Probabilities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sproston, Jeremy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Probabilistic timed automata are classical timed automata extended with
discrete probability distributions over edges. We introduce clock-dependent
probabilistic timed automata, a variant of probabilistic timed automata in
which transition probabilities can depend linearly on clock values.
Clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata allow the modelling of a
continuous relationship between time passage and the likelihood of system
events. We show that the problem of deciding whether the maximum probability of
reaching a certain location is above a threshold is undecidable for
clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata. On the other hand, we show that
the maximum and minimum probability of reaching a certain location in
clock-dependent probabilistic timed automata can be approximated using a
region-graph-based approach.

 <dc:title>On the Construction of Polar Codes for Achieving the Capacity of

 <dc:description>  Achieving security against adversaries with unlimited computational power is
of great interest in a communication scenario. Since polar codes are capacity
achieving codes with low encoding-decoding complexity and they can approach
perfect secrecy rates for binary-input degraded wiretap channels in symmetric
settings, they are investigated extensively in the literature recently. In this
paper, a polar coding scheme to achieve secrecy capacity in non-symmetric
binary input channels is proposed. The proposed scheme satisfies security and
reliability conditions. The wiretap channel is assumed to be stochastically
degraded with respect to the legitimate channel and message distribution is
uniform. The information set is sent over channels that are good for Bob and
bad for Eve. Random bits are sent over channels that are good for both Bob and
Eve. A frozen vector is chosen randomly and is sent over channels bad for both.
We prove that there exists a frozen vector for which the coding scheme
satisfies reliability and security conditions and approaches the secrecy
capacity. We further empirically show that in the proposed scheme for
non-symmetric binary-input discrete memoryless channels, the equivocation rate
achieves its upper bound in the whole capacity-equivocation region.

 <dc:title>Gaussian Process Model Predictive Control of An Unmanned Quadrotor</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Model Predictive Control (MPC) trajectory tracking problem of an unmanned
quadrotor with input and output constraints is addressed. In this article, the
dynamic models of the quadrotor are obtained purely from operational data in
the form of probabilistic Gaussian Process (GP) models. This is different from
conventional models obtained through Newtonian analysis. A hierarchical control
scheme is used to handle the trajectory tracking problem with the translational
subsystem in the outer loop and the rotational subsystem in the inner loop.
Constrained GP based MPC are formulated separately for both subsystems. The
resulting MPC problems are typically nonlinear and non-convex. We derived 15 a
GP based local dynamical model that allows these optimization problems to be
relaxed to convex ones which can be efficiently solved with a simple active-set
algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with an
existing unconstrained Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Simulation
results show that the two approaches exhibit similar trajectory tracking
performance. However, our approach has the advantage of incorporating
constraints on the control inputs. In addition, our approach only requires 20%
of the computational time for NMPC.

 <dc:description>  The generalized k-server problem is a far-reaching extension of the k-server
problem with several applications. Here, each server $s_i$ lies in its own
metric space $M_i$. A request is a k-tuple $r = (r_1,r_2,\dotsc,r_k)$ and to
serve it, we need to move some server $s_i$ to the point $r_i \in M_i$, and the
goal is to minimize the total distance traveled by the servers. Despite much
work, no f(k)-competitive algorithm is known for the problem for k &gt; 2 servers,
even for special cases such as uniform metrics and lines.
  Here, we consider the problem in uniform metrics and give the first
f(k)-competitive algorithms for general k. In particular, we obtain
deterministic and randomized algorithms with competitive ratio $O(k 2^k)$ and
$O(k^3 \log k)$ respectively. Our deterministic bound is based on a novel
application of the polynomial method to online algorithms, and essentially
matches the long-known lower bound of $2^k-1$. We also give a
$2^{2^{O(k)}}$-competitive deterministic algorithm for weighted uniform
metrics, which also essentially matches the recent doubly exponential lower
bound for the problem.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) problem in a
millimeter wave (mmWave) massive MIMO (mMIMO) system with non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA). Multiple two-user clusters are formulated according to
their channel correlation and gain difference. Following this, we propose a
hybrid analog/digital precoding scheme for the low radio frequency (RF) chains
structure at the base station (BS). On this basis, we formulate a power
allocation problem aiming to maximize the EE under users' quality of service
(QoS) requirements and per-cluster power constraint. An iterative algorithm is
proposed to obtain the optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that
the proposed NOMA achieves superior EE performance than that of conventional
OMA.

 <dc:description>  Many important complex networks, including critical infrastructure and
emerging industrial automation systems, are becoming increasingly intricate
webs of interacting feedback control loops. A fundamental concern is to
quantify the control properties and performance limitations of the network as a
function of its dynamical structure and control architecture. We study
performance bounds for networks in terms of optimal feedback control costs. We
provide a set of complementary bounds as a function of the system dynamics and
actuator structure. For unstable network dynamics, we characterize a tradeoff
between feedback control performance and the number of control inputs, in
particular showing that optimal cost can increase exponentially with the size
of the network. We also derive a bound on the performance of the worst-case
actuator subset for stable networks, providing insight into dynamics properties
that affect the potential efficacy of actuator selection. We illustrate our
results with numerical experiments that analyze performance in regular and
random networks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper challenges a cross-genre document retrieval task, where the
queries are in formal writing and the target documents are in conversational
writing. In this task, a query, is a sentence extracted from either a summary
or a plot of an episode in a TV show, and the target document consists of
transcripts from the corresponding episode. To establish a strong baseline, we
employ the current state-of-the-art search engine to perform document retrieval
on the dataset collected for this work. We then introduce a structure reranking
approach to improve the initial ranking by utilizing syntactic and semantic
structures generated by NLP tools. Our evaluation shows an improvement of more
than 4% when the structure reranking is applied, which is very promising.

both in Social Sciences and in Computational Linguistics. In this paper, we
present a novel approach to study and measure interpersonal influence in daily
interactions. Motivated by the basic principles of influence, we attempt to
identify indicative linguistic features of the posts in an online knitting
community. We present the scheme used to operationalize and label the posts
with indicator features. Experiments with the identified features show an
improvement in the classification accuracy of influence by 3.15%. Our results
illustrate the important correlation between the characteristics of the

is a purely textual neural translation of the source image caption to the
target language. The main feature of the system is the use of additional data
that was acquired by selecting similar sentences from parallel corpora and by
data synthesis with back-translation. For Task 2 (cross-lingual image
captioning), our best submitted system generates an English caption which is
then translated by the best system used in Task 1. We also present negative

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our solution for the video recognition task of the
Google Cloud and YouTube-8M Video Understanding Challenge that ranked the 3rd
place. Because the challenge provides pre-extracted visual and audio features
instead of the raw videos, we mainly investigate various temporal modeling
approaches to aggregate the frame-level features for multi-label video
recognition. Our system contains three major components: two-stream sequence
model, fast-forward sequence model and temporal residual neural networks.
Experiment results on the challenging Youtube-8M dataset demonstrate that our
proposed temporal modeling approaches can significantly improve existing
temporal modeling approaches in the large-scale video recognition tasks. To be
noted, our fast-forward LSTM with a depth of 7 layers achieves 82.75% in term
of GAP@20 on the Kaggle Public test set.

 <dc:description>  A new variation of blockchain proof of work algorithm is proposed to
incentivize the timely execution of image processing algorithms. A sample image
processing algorithm is proposed to determine interesting images using analysis
of the entropy of pixel subsets within images. The efficacy of the image
processing algorithm is examined using two small sets of training and test
data. The interesting image algorithm is then integrated into a simplified
blockchain mining proof of work algorithm based on Bitcoin. The incentive of
cryptocurrency mining is theorized to incentivize the execution of the
algorithm and thus the retrieval of images that satisfy a minimum requirement
set forth by the interesting image algorithm. The digital storage implications
of running an image- based blockchain are then examined mathematically.

 <dc:title>Interference-Aided Energy Harvesting: Cognitive Relaying with Multiple

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We consider a spectrum sharing scenario where a secondary transmitter (ST)
communicates with its destination via a decode-and-forward secondary relay (SR)
in the presence of interference from multiple primary transmitters. The SR
harvests energy from received radio-frequency signals that include primary
interference and uses it to forward the information to the secondary
destination. The relay adopts a time switching policy that switches between
energy harvesting and information decoding over the time. Under the primary
outage constraints and the peak power constraints at both ST and SR, to
determine the average secondary throughput, we derive exact analytical
expressions for the secondary outage probability and the ergodic capacity,
which characterize the delay-limited and the delay-tolerant transmissions,
respectively. We also investigate the effects of the number of primary
transceivers and the peak power constraints on the optimal energy harvesting
time that maximizes the secondary throughput. By utilizing the primary
interference as an energy source, the secondary network achieves a better
throughput performance compared to the case where the primary interference is
ignored for energy harvesting purpose. Finally, we consider a case where ST
also harvests energy from primary transmissions and compare its throughput
performance with that of the non-energy harvesting ST case.

 <dc:description>  We propose an online auto-tuning approach for computing kernels. Differently
from existing online auto-tuners, which regenerate code with long compilation
chains from the source to the binary code, our approach consists on deploying
auto-tuning directly at the level of machine code generation. This allows
auto-tuning to pay off in very short-running applications. As a proof of
concept, our approach is demonstrated in two benchmarks, which execute during
hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds only. In a CPU-bound kernel, the
average speedups achieved are 1.10 to 1.58 depending on the target
micro-architecture, up to 2.53 in the most favourable conditions (all run-time
overheads included). In a memory-bound kernel, less favourable to our runtime
auto-tuning optimizations, the average speedups are 1.04 to 1.10, up to 1.30 in
the best configuration. Despite the short execution times of our benchmarks,
the overhead of our runtime auto-tuning is between 0.2 and 4.2% only of the
total application execution times. By simulating the CPU-bound application in
11 different CPUs, we showed that, despite the clear hardware disadvantage of
In-Order (io) cores vs. Out-of-Order (ooo) equivalent cores, online auto-tuning
in io CPUs obtained an average speedup of 1.03 and an energy efficiency
improvement of 39~\% over the SIMD reference in ooo CPUs.

 <dc:description>  Networks are widely used to model real-world systems and uncover their
topological features. Network properties such as the degree distribution and
shortest path length have been computed in numerous real-world networks, and
most of them have been shown to be both scale-free and small-world networks.
Graphlets and network motifs are subgraph patterns that capture richer
structural information than aforementioned global network properties, and these
local features are often used for network comparison. However, past work on
graphlets and network motifs is almost exclusively applicable only for static
networks. Many systems are better represented as temporal networks which depict
not only how a system was at a given stage but also how they evolved.
Time-dependent information is crucial in temporal networks and, by disregarding
that data, static methods can not achieve the best possible results. This paper
introduces an extension of graphlets for temporal networks. Our proposed method
enumerates all 4-node graphlet-orbits in each network-snapshot, building the
corresponding orbit-transition matrix in the process. Our hypothesis is that
networks representing similar systems have characteristic orbit transitions
which better identify them than simple static patterns, and this is assessed on
a set of real temporal networks split into categories. In order to perform
temporal network comparison we put forward an orbit-transition-agreement metric
(OTA). OTA correctly groups a set of temporal networks that both static network
motifs and graphlets fail to do so adequately. Furthermore, our method produces
interpretable results which we use to uncover characteristic orbit transitions,
and that can be regarded as a network-fingerprint.

 <dc:title>An Efficient Approach to Communication-aware Path Planning for
  Long-range Surveillance Missions undertaken by UAVs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sharma, Hrishikesh</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  While using drones for remote surveillance missions, it is mandatory to do
path planning of the vehicle since these are pilot-less vehicles. Path
planning, whether offline or online, entails setting up the path as a sequence
of locations in the 3D Euclidean space, whose coordinates happen to be
latitude, longitude and altitude. For the specific application of remote
surveillance of long linear infrastructures in non-urban terrain, the
continuous 3D-ESP problem practically entails two important scalar costs. The
first scalar cost is the distance traveled along the planned path. Since drones
are battery operated, hence it is needed that the path length between fixed
start and goal locations of a mission should be minimal at all costs. The other
scalar cost is the cost of transmitting the acquired video during the mission
of remote surveillance, via a camera mounted in the drone's belly. Because of
the length of surveillance target which is long linear infrastructure, the
amount of video generated is very high and cannot be generally stored in its
entirety, on board. If the connectivity is poor along certain segments of a
naive path, to boost video transmission rate, the transmission power of the
signal is kept high, which in turn dissipates more battery energy. Hence a path
is desired that simultaneously also betters what is known as communication
cost. These two costs trade-off, and hence Pareto optimization is needed for
this 3D bi-objective Euclidean shortest path problem. In this report, we study
the mono-objective offline path planning problem, based on the distance cost,
while posing the communication cost as an upper-bounded constraint. The
bi-objective path planning solution is sketched out towards the end.

 <dc:description>  Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons
often exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons.
Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or
random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general
framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is
lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network
models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the
distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for
fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly
available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine
learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to
evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine
learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how
GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical
neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure
avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g.
the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of
the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters
which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties.
Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint
distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary
statistics picked a priori by the user. More generally, this framework opens
the door to fitting theoretically motivated dynamical network models directly
to simultaneously or non-simultaneously recorded neural responses.

 <dc:description>  Hidden variables are well known sources of disturbance when recovering belief
networks from data based only on measurable variables. Hence models assuming
existence of hidden variables are under development.
  This paper presents a new algorithm &quot;accelerating&quot; the known CI algorithm of
Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines {Spirtes:93}. We prove that this algorithm does
not produces (conditional) independencies not present in the data if
statistical independence test is reliable.
  This result is to be considered as non-trivial since e.g. the same claim

 <dc:description>  Deep residual networks (ResNets) have significantly pushed forward the
state-of-the-art on image classification, increasing in performance as networks
grow both deeper and wider. However, memory consumption becomes a bottleneck,
as one needs to store the activations in order to calculate gradients using
backpropagation. We present the Reversible Residual Network (RevNet), a variant
of ResNets where each layer's activations can be reconstructed exactly from the
next layer's. Therefore, the activations for most layers need not be stored in
memory during backpropagation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RevNets on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, establishing nearly identical classification
accuracy to equally-sized ResNets, even though the activation storage
requirements are independent of depth.

 <dc:description>  VAEs (Variational AutoEncoders) have proved to be powerful in the context of
density modeling and have been used in a variety of contexts for creative
purposes. In many settings, the data we model possesses continuous attributes
that we would like to take into account at generation time. We propose in this
paper GLSR-VAE, a Geodesic Latent Space Regularization for the Variational
AutoEncoder architecture and its generalizations which allows a fine control on
the embedding of the data into the latent space. When augmenting the VAE loss
with this regularization, changes in the learned latent space reflects changes
of the attributes of the data. This deeper understanding of the VAE latent
space structure offers the possibility to modulate the attributes of the
generated data in a continuous way. We demonstrate its efficiency on a
monophonic music generation task where we manage to generate variations of
discrete sequences in an intended and playful way.

 <dc:description>  A city's critical infrastructure such as gas, water, and power systems, are
largely interdependent since they share energy, computing, and communication
resources. This, in turn, makes it challenging to endow them with fool-proof
security solutions. In this paper, a unified model for interdependent
gas-power-water infrastructure is presented and the security of this model is
studied using a novel game-theoretic framework. In particular, a zero-sum
noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to
simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure
to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates
communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to
monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this
game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation
is 35\% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over
the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the
interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can
motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems
to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender
allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the
interdependent system to protect the grid from state deviations.

 <dc:description>  Tagging news articles or blog posts with relevant tags from a collection of
predefined ones is coined as document tagging in this work. Accurate tagging of
articles can benefit several downstream applications such as recommendation and
search. In this work, we propose a novel yet simple approach called DocTag2Vec
to accomplish this task. We substantially extend Word2Vec and Doc2Vec---two
popular models for learning distributed representation of words and documents.
In DocTag2Vec, we simultaneously learn the representation of words, documents,
and tags in a joint vector space during training, and employ the simple
$k$-nearest neighbor search to predict tags for unseen documents. In contrast
to previous multi-label learning methods, DocTag2Vec directly deals with raw
text instead of provided feature vector, and in addition, enjoys advantages
like the learning of tag representation, and the ability of handling newly
created tags. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct
experiments on several datasets and show promising results against
state-of-the-art methods.

can run on multiple programming languages, based on a new way of representing
programs called incremental parametric syntax. We implement this approach in
our Cubix system, and construct incremental parametric syntaxes for C, Java,
JavaScript, Lua, and Python, demonstrating three multi-language program
transformations that can run on all of them. Our evaluation shows that (1) once
a transformation is written, relatively little work is required to configure it
for a new language (2) transformations built this way output readable code
which preserve the structure of the original, according to participants in our
human study, and (3) despite dealing with many languages, our transformations
can still handle language corner-cases, and pass 90% of compiler test suites.

 <dc:title>Identification of Overlapping Communities via Constrained Egonet Tensor
  Decomposition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sheikholeslami, Fatemeh</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Giannakis, Georgios B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Detection of overlapping communities in real-world networks is a generally
challenging task. Upon recognizing that a network is in fact the union of its
egonets, a novel network representation using multi-way data structures is
advocated in this contribution. The introduced sparse tensor-based
representation exhibits richer structure compared to its matrix counterpart,
and thus enables a more robust approach to community detection. To leverage
this structure, a constrained tensor approximation framework is introduced
using PARAFAC decomposition. The arising constrained trilinear optimization is
handled via alternating minimization, where intermediate subproblems are solved
using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to ensure
convergence. The factors obtained provide soft community memberships, which can
further be exploited for crisp, and possibly-overlapping community assignments.
The framework is further broadened to include time-varying graphs, where the
edgeset as well as the underlying communities evolve through time. Performance
of the proposed approach is assessed via tests on benchmark synthetic graphs as
well as real-world networks. As corroborated by numerical tests, the proposed
tensor-based representation captures multi-hop nodal connections, that is,
connectivity patterns within single-hop neighbors, whose exploitation yields a
more robust community identification in the presence of mixing as well as
overlapping communities.

Vectors problem, 3SUM, and the Negative-Weight Triangle problem (which is
closely related to All-Pairs Shortest Path). In this paper, we consider the
approximate counting version of each problem; thus instead of simply deciding
whether a witness exists, we attempt to (multiplicatively) approximate the
number of witnesses. In each case, we provide a fine-grained reduction from the
approximate counting form to the usual decision form.
  For example, if there is an $O(c^n)$-time algorithm that solves k-SAT for all
$k$, then we prove there is an $O((c+o(1))^n)$-time algorithm to approximately
count the satisfying assignments. Similarly, we get that the exponential time
hypothesis (ETH) is equivalent to an approximate counting version. This mirrors
a result of Sipser (STOC 1983) and Stockmeyer (SICOMP 1985), who proved such a
result in the classical polynomial-time setting, and a similar result due to
M\&quot;uller (IWPEC 2006) in the FPT setting.
  Our algorithm for polynomial-time problems applies in a general setting in
which we approximately count edges of a bipartite graph to which we have
limited access. In particular, this means it can be applied to problem variants
in which significant improvements over the conjectured running time bounds are
already known. For example, the Orthogonal Vectors problem over GF$(m)^d$ for
constant $m$ can be solved in time $n\cdot\text{poly}(d)$ by a result of
Williams and Yu (SODA 2014); our result implies that we can approximately count
the number of orthogonal pairs with essentially the same running time.
Moreover, our overhead is only polylogarithmic, so it can be applied to
subpolynomial improvements such as the $n^3/\exp(\Theta(\sqrt{\log n}))$ time
algorithm for the Negative-Weight Triangle problem due to Williams (STOC 2014).

 <dc:title>Towards Efficient Deep Inference for Mobile Applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guo, Tian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Mobile applications are benefiting significantly from the advancement in deep
learning, e.g. providing new features. Given a trained deep learning model,
applications usually need to perform a series of matrix operations based on the
input data, in order to infer possible output values. Because of model
computation complexity and increased model sizes, those trained models are
usually hosted in the cloud. When mobile apps need to utilize those models,
they will have to send input data over the network. While cloud-based deep
learning can provide reasonable response time for mobile apps, it also
restricts the use case scenarios, e.g. mobile apps need to have access to
network. With mobile specific deep learning optimizations, it is now possible
to employ device-based inference. However, because mobile hardware, e.g. GPU
and memory size, can be very different and limited when compared to desktop
counterpart, it is important to understand the feasibility of this new
device-based deep learning inference architecture. In this paper, we
empirically evaluate the inference efficiency of three Convolutional Neural
Networks using a benchmark Android application we developed. Based on our
application-driven analysis, we have identified several performance bottlenecks
for mobile applications powered by on-device deep learning inference.

 <dc:description>  The stunning empirical successes of neural networks currently lack rigorous
theoretical explanation. What form would such an explanation take, in the face
of existing complexity-theoretic lower bounds? A first step might be to show
that data generated by neural networks with a single hidden layer, smooth
activation functions and benign input distributions can be learned efficiently.
We demonstrate here a comprehensive lower bound ruling out this possibility:
for a wide class of activation functions (including all currently used), and
inputs drawn from any logconcave distribution, there is a family of
one-hidden-layer functions whose output is a sum gate, that are hard to learn
in a precise sense: any statistical query algorithm (which includes all known
variants of stochastic gradient descent with any loss function) needs an
exponential number of queries even using tolerance inversely proportional to
the input dimensionality. Moreover, this hard family of functions is realizable
with a small (sublinear in dimension) number of activation units in the single
hidden layer. The lower bound is also robust to small perturbations of the true
weights. Systematic experiments illustrate a phase transition in the training
error as predicted by the analysis.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new method for performing multiscale analysis of functions
defined on the vertices of a finite connected weighted graph. Our approach
relies on a random spanning forest to downsample the set of vertices, and on
approximate solutions of Markov intertwining relation to provide a subgraph
structure and a filter bank leading to a wavelet basis of the set of functions.
Our construction involves two parameters q and q'. The first one controls the
mean number of kept vertices in the downsampling, while the second one is a
tuning parameter between space localization and frequency localization. We
provide an explicit reconstruction formula, bounds on the reconstruction
operator norm and on the error in the intertwining relation, and a Jackson-like
inequality. These bounds lead to recommend a way to choose the parameters q and
q'. We illustrate the method by numerical experiments.

 <dc:title>A Real-Time Solver For Time-Optimal Control Of Omnidirectional Robots
  with Bounded Acceleration</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Balaban, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We are interested in the problem of time-optimal control of omnidirectional
robots with bounded acceleration (TOC-ORBA). While there exist approximate
solutions for such robots, and exact solutions with unbounded acceleration,
exact solvers to the TOC-ORBA problem have remained elusive until now. In this
paper, we present a real-time solver for true time-optimal control of
omnidirectional robots with bounded acceleration. We first derive the general
parameterized form of the solution to the TOC-ORBA problem by application of
Pontryagin's maximum principle. Next, we derive bounds for the parameters for
the optimal control solution, thus defining a closed trust region over the
parameter space. We then frame the boundary value problem of TOC-ORBA as an
optimization problem over the parametrized control space. To overcome local
minima and poor initial guesses to the optimization problem, we introduce a
two-stage optimal control solver (TSOCS) that first solves an approximation of
the problem to satisfy the location and direction constraints of the TOC-ORBA
problem, followed by a second stage where the solution to the approximate
problem is used as an initial seed to solve the complete TOC-ORBA problem. We
present extensive experimental results over the space of TOC-ORBA problems
demonstrating the accuracy, robustness, and successful convergence properties
of TSOCS. We further demonstrate the numerical stability, and convergence
properties of TSOCS under closed-loop control, even in the presence of noisy
actuation. Finally, by comparing our exact solver to existing approximate
solvers, we empirically demonstrate the extent of improvement in the quality of
solutions, even under noisy actuation.

 <dc:title>Communication Lower Bounds of Bilinear Algorithms for Symmetric Tensor
  Contractions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Accurate numerical calculations of electronic structure are often dominated
in cost by tensor contractions. These tensors are typically symmetric under
interchange of modes, enabling reduced-size representations as well as a
reduced computation cost. Direct evaluation algorithms for such contractions
use matrix and vector unfoldings of the tensors, computing and accumulating
products of input elements. Symmetry preserving algorithms reduce the number of
products by multiplying linear combinations of input elements. The two schemes
can be encoded via sparse matrices as bilinear algorithms. We formulate a
general notion of expansion for bilinear algorithms in terms of the rank of
submatrices of the sparse matrix encoding. This expansion bounds the number of
products that can be computed provided a bounded amount of data. Consequently,
we derive communication lower bounds for any sequential or parallel schedule of
a bilinear algorithm with a given expansion. After deriving such expansion
bounds for the tensor contraction algorithms, we obtain new results that
demonstrate asymptotic communication overheads associated with exploiting
symmetries. Computing a nonsymmetric tensor contraction requires less
communication than either method for symmetric contractions when either (1)
computing a symmetrized tensor-product of tensors of different orders or (2)
the tensor unfolding of the contraction corresponds to a matrix-vector product
with a nonsquare matrix. Further, when the unfolding is a product of two
non-square matrices, asymptotically more communication is needed by the
symmetry preserving algorithm than the traditional algorithm, despite its lower
computation cost.

 <dc:description>  We present five variants of the standard Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)
recurrent neural networks by uniformly reducing blocks of adaptive parameters
in the gating mechanisms. For simplicity, we refer to these models as LSTM1,
LSTM2, LSTM3, LSTM4, and LSTM5, respectively. Such parameter-reduced variants
enable speeding up data training computations and would be more suitable for
implementations onto constrained embedded platforms. We comparatively evaluate
and verify our five variant models on the classical MNIST dataset and
demonstrate that these variant models are comparable to a standard
implementation of the LSTM model while using less number of parameters.
Moreover, we observe that in some cases the standard LSTM's accuracy
performance will drop after a number of epochs when using the ReLU
nonlinearity; in contrast, however, LSTM3, LSTM4 and LSTM5 will retain their
performance.

 <dc:description>  Communication at mmWave bands carries critical importance for 5G wireless
networks. In this paper, we study the characterization of mmWave air-to-ground
(AG) channels for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. In particular,
we use ray tracing simulations using Remcom Wireless InSite software to study
the behavior of AG mmWave bands at two different frequencies: 28~GHz and
60~GHz. Received signal strength (RSS) and root mean square delay spread
(RMS-DS) of multipath components (MPCs) are analyzed for different UAV heights
considering four different environments: urban, suburban, rural, and over sea.
It is observed that the RSS mostly follows the two ray propagation model along
the UAV flight path for higher altitudes. This two ray propagation model is
affected by the presence of high rise scatterers in urban scenario. Moreover,
we present details of a universal serial radio peripheral (USRP) based channel
sounder that can be used for AG channel measurements for mmWave (60 GHz) UAV
communications.

 <dc:description>  Simultaneously achieving low trajectory errors and compliant control
\emph{without} explicit models of the task was effectively addressed with
Compliant Movement Primitives (CMP). For a single-robot task, this means that
it is accurately following its trajectory, but also exhibits compliant behavior
in case of perturbations. In this paper we extend this kind of behavior without
explicit models to bimanual tasks. In the presence of an external perturbation
on any of the robots, they will both move in synchrony in order to maintain
their relative posture, and thus not exert force on the object they are
carrying. Thus, they will act compliantly in their absolute task, but remain
stiff in their relative task. To achieve compliant absolute behavior and stiff
relative behavior, we combine joint-space CMPs with the well known symmetric
control approach. To reduce the necessary feedback reaction of symmetric
control, we further augment it with copying of a virtual force vector at the
end-effector, calculated through the measured external joint torques.
Real-world results on two Kuka LWR-4 robots in a bimanual setting confirm the
applicability of the approach.

 <dc:description>  Motivation: Understanding functions of proteins in specific human tissues is
essential for insights into disease diagnostics and therapeutics, yet
prediction of tissue-specific cellular function remains a critical challenge
for biomedicine.
  Results: Here we present OhmNet, a hierarchy-aware unsupervised node feature
learning approach for multi-layer networks. We build a multi-layer network,
where each layer represents molecular interactions in a different human tissue.
OhmNet then automatically learns a mapping of proteins, represented as nodes,
to a neural embedding based low-dimensional space of features. OhmNet
encourages sharing of similar features among proteins with similar network
neighborhoods and among proteins activated in similar tissues. The algorithm
generalizes prior work, which generally ignores relationships between tissues,
by modeling tissue organization with a rich multiscale tissue hierarchy. We use
OhmNet to study multicellular function in a multi-layer protein interaction
network of 107 human tissues. In 48 tissues with known tissue-specific cellular
functions, OhmNet provides more accurate predictions of cellular function than
alternative approaches, and also generates more accurate hypotheses about
tissue-specific protein actions. We show that taking into account the tissue
hierarchy leads to improved predictive power. Remarkably, we also demonstrate
that it is possible to leverage the tissue hierarchy in order to effectively
transfer cellular functions to a functionally uncharacterized tissue. Overall,
OhmNet moves from flat networks to multiscale models able to predict a range of

 <dc:description>  Employee theft and dishonesty is a major contributor to loss in the retail
industry. Retailers have reported the need for more automated analytic tools to
assess the liability of their employees. In this work, we train and optimize
several machine learning models for regression prediction and analysis on this
data, which will help retailers identify and manage risky employees. Since the
data we use is very high dimensional, we use feature selection techniques to
identify the most contributing factors to an employee's assessed risk. We also
use dimension reduction and data embedding techniques to present this dataset
in a easy to interpret format.

 <dc:description>  The work presented here applies deep learning to the task of automated
cardiac auscultation, i.e. recognizing abnormalities in heart sounds. We
describe an automated heart sound classification algorithm that combines the
use of time-frequency heat map representations with a deep convolutional neural
network (CNN). Given the cost-sensitive nature of misclassification, our CNN
architecture is trained using a modified loss function that directly optimizes
the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. We evaluated our algorithm
at the 2016 PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology challenge where the objective was
to accurately classify normal and abnormal heart sounds from single, short,
potentially noisy recordings. Our entry to the challenge achieved a final
specificity of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.73 and overall score of 0.84. We achieved
the greatest specificity score out of all challenge entries and, using just a
single CNN, our algorithm differed in overall score by only 0.02 compared to
the top place finisher, which used an ensemble approach.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by work on bio-operations on DNA strings, we consider an
outfix-guided insertion operation that can be viewed as a generalization of the
overlap assembly operation on strings studied previously. As the main result we
construct a finite language $L$ such that the outfix-guided insertion closure
of $L$ is non-regular. We consider also the closure properties of regular and
(deterministic) context-free languages under the outfix-guided insertion
operation and decision problems related to outfix-guided insertion. Deciding
whether a language recognized by a deterministic finite automaton is closed
under outfix-guided insertion can be done in polynomial time. The complexity of
the corresponding question for nondeterministic finite automata remains open.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the release of EmojiNet, the largest machine-readable
emoji sense inventory that links Unicode emoji representations to their English
meanings extracted from the Web. EmojiNet is a dataset consisting of: (i)
12,904 sense labels over 2,389 emoji, which were extracted from the web and
linked to machine-readable sense definitions seen in BabelNet, (ii) context
words associated with each emoji sense, which are inferred through word
embedding models trained over Google News corpus and a Twitter message corpus
for each emoji sense definition, and (iii) recognizing discrepancies in the
presentation of emoji on different platforms, specification of the most likely
platform-based emoji sense for a selected set of emoji. The dataset is hosted
as an open service with a REST API and is available at
http://emojinet.knoesis.org/. The development of this dataset, evaluation of
its quality, and its applications including emoji sense disambiguation and
emoji sense similarity are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Emoji have grown to become one of the most important forms of communication
on the web. With its widespread use, measuring the similarity of emoji has
become an important problem for contemporary text processing since it lies at
the heart of sentiment analysis, search, and interface design tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive analysis of the semantic similarity of emoji through
embedding models that are learned over machine-readable emoji meanings in the
EmojiNet knowledge base. Using emoji descriptions, emoji sense labels and emoji
sense definitions, and with different training corpora obtained from Twitter
and Google News, we develop and test multiple embedding models to measure emoji
similarity. To evaluate our work, we create a new dataset called EmoSim508,
which assigns human-annotated semantic similarity scores to a set of 508
carefully selected emoji pairs. After validation with EmoSim508, we present a
real-world use-case of our emoji embedding models using a sentiment analysis
task and show that our models outperform the previous best-performing emoji
embedding model on this task. The EmoSim508 dataset and our emoji embedding
models are publicly released with this paper and can be downloaded from
http://emojinet.knoesis.org/.

 <dc:description>  In order to overcome the branch execution penalties of hard-to-predict
instruction branches, two new instruction fetch micro-architectural methods are
proposed in this paper. In addition, to compare performance of the two proposed
methods, different instruction fetch policy schemes of existing multi-branch
path architectures are evaluated. An improvement in Instructions Per Cycle
(IPC) of 29.4% on average over single-thread execution with gshare branch
predictor on SPEC 2000/2006 benchmark is shown. In this paper, wide pipeline
machines are simulated for evaluation purposes. The methods discussed in this
paper can be extended to High Performance Scientific Computing needs, if the
demands of IPC improvement are far more critical than $cost.

 <dc:title>Rotations and Interpretability of Word Embeddings: the Case of the

 <dc:description>  Consider a continuous word embedding model. Usually, the cosines between word
vectors are used as a measure of similarity of words. These cosines do not
change under orthogonal transformations of the embedding space. We demonstrate
that, using some canonical orthogonal transformations from SVD, it is possible
both to increase the meaning of some components and to make the components more
stable under re-learning. We study the interpretability of components for
publicly available models for the Russian language (RusVectores, fastText,
RDT).

 <dc:description>  Network Flying Platforms (NFPs) such as unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned
balloons or drones flying at low/medium/high altitude can be employed to
enhance network coverage and capacity by deploying a swarm of flying platforms
that implement novel radio resource management techniques. In this paper, we
propose a novel layered architecture where NFPs, of various types and flying at
low/medium/high layers in a swarm of flying platforms, are considered as an
integrated part of the future cellular networks to inject additional capacity
and expand the coverage for exceptional scenarios (sports events, concerts,
etc.) and hard-to-reach areas (rural or sparsely populated areas). Successful
roll-out of the proposed architecture depends on several factors including, but
are not limited to: network optimisation for NFP placement and association,
safety operations of NFP for network/equipment security, and reliability for
NFP transport and control/signaling mechanisms. In this work, we formulate the
optimum placement of NFP at a Lower Layer (LL) by exploiting the airborne
Self-organising Network (SON) features. Our initial simulations show the NFP-LL
can serve more User Equipment (UE)s using this placement technique.

 <dc:title>Learning linear structural equation models in polynomial time and sample

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  The problem of learning structural equation models (SEMs) from data is a
fundamental problem in causal inference. We develop a new algorithm --- which
is computationally and statistically efficient and works in the
high-dimensional regime --- for learning linear SEMs from purely observational
data with arbitrary noise distribution. We consider three aspects of the
problem: identifiability, computational efficiency, and statistical efficiency.
We show that when data is generated from a linear SEM over $p$ nodes and
maximum degree $d$, our algorithm recovers the directed acyclic graph (DAG)
structure of the SEM under an identifiability condition that is more general
than those considered in the literature, and without faithfulness assumptions.
In the population setting, our algorithm recovers the DAG structure in
$\mathcal{O}(p(d^2 + \log p))$ operations. In the finite sample setting, if the
estimated precision matrix is sparse, our algorithm has a smoothed complexity
of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p^3 + pd^7)$, while if the estimated precision
matrix is dense, our algorithm has a smoothed complexity of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(p^5)$. For sub-Gaussian noise, we show that our
algorithm has a sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{d^8}{\varepsilon^2}
\log (\frac{p}{\sqrt{\delta}}))$ to achieve $\varepsilon$ element-wise additive
error with respect to the true autoregression matrix with probability at most
$1 - \delta$, while for noise with bounded $(4m)$-th moment, with $m$ being a
positive integer, our algorithm has a sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{d^8}{\varepsilon^2} (\frac{p^2}{\delta})^{1/m})$.

 <dc:description>  Model-free policy learning has enabled robust performance of complex tasks
with relatively simple algorithms. However, this simplicity comes at the cost
of requiring an Oracle and arguably very poor sample complexity. This renders
such methods unsuitable for physical systems. Variants of model-based methods
address this problem through the use of simulators, however, this gives rise to
the problem of policy transfer from simulated to the physical system. Model
mismatch due to systematic parameter shift and unmodelled dynamics error may
cause sub-optimal or unsafe behavior upon direct transfer. We introduce the
Adaptive Policy Transfer for Stochastic Dynamics (ADAPT) algorithm that
achieves provably safe and robust, dynamically-feasible zero-shot transfer of
RL-policies to new domains with dynamics error. ADAPT combines the strengths of
offline policy learning in a black-box source simulator with online tube-based
MPC to attenuate bounded model mismatch between the source and target dynamics.
ADAPT allows online transfer of policy, trained solely in a simulation offline,
to a family of unknown targets without fine-tuning. We also formally show that
(i) ADAPT guarantees state and control safety through state-action tubes under
the assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the divergence in dynamics and, (ii)
ADAPT results in a bounded loss of reward accumulation relative to a policy
trained and evaluated in the source environment. We evaluate ADAPT on 2
continuous, non-holonomic simulated dynamical systems with 4 different
disturbance models, and find that ADAPT performs between 50%-300% better on
mean reward accrual than direct policy transfer.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims at task-oriented action prediction, i.e., predicting a
sequence of actions towards accomplishing a specific task under a certain
scene, which is a new problem in computer vision research. The main challenges
lie in how to model task-specific knowledge and integrate it in the learning
procedure. In this work, we propose to train a recurrent long-short term memory
(LSTM) network for handling this problem, i.e., taking a scene image (including
pre-located objects) and the specified task as input and recurrently predicting
action sequences. However, training such a network usually requires large
amounts of annotated samples for covering the semantic space (e.g., diverse
action decomposition and ordering). To alleviate this issue, we introduce a
temporal And-Or graph (AOG) for task description, which hierarchically
represents a task into atomic actions. With this AOG representation, we can
produce many valid samples (i.e., action sequences according with common sense)
by training another auxiliary LSTM network with a small set of annotated
samples. And these generated samples (i.e., task-oriented action sequences)
effectively facilitate training the model for task-oriented action prediction.
In the experiments, we create a new dataset containing diverse daily tasks and
extensively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.

combine to form lines, lines form segments, and segments form a complete song -
we adapt a hierarchical attention network (HAN) to exploit these layers and in
addition learn the importance of the words, lines, and segments. We test the
model over a 117-genre dataset and a reduced 20-genre dataset. Experimental
results show that the HAN outperforms both non-neural models and simpler neural
models, whilst also classifying over a higher number of genres than previous
research. Through the learning process we can also visualise which words or
lines in a song the model believes are important to classifying the genre. As a
result the HAN provides insights, from a computational perspective, into
lyrical structure and language features that differentiate musical genres.

 <dc:description>  Sub-8-bit representation of DNNs incur some discernible loss of accuracy
despite rigorous (re)training at low-precision. Such loss of accuracy
essentially makes them equivalent to a much shallower counterpart, diminishing
the power of being deep networks. To address this problem of accuracy drop we
introduce the notion of \textit{residual networks} where we add more
low-precision edges to sensitive branches of the sub-8-bit network to
compensate for the lost accuracy. Further, we present a perturbation theory to
identify such sensitive edges. Aided by such an elegant trade-off between
accuracy and compute, the 8-2 model (8-bit activations, ternary weights),
enhanced by ternary residual edges, turns out to be sophisticated enough to
achieve very high accuracy ($\sim 1\%$ drop from our FP-32 baseline), despite
$\sim 1.6\times$ reduction in model size, $\sim 26\times$ reduction in number
of multiplications, and potentially $\sim 2\times$ power-performance gain
comparing to 8-8 representation, on the state-of-the-art deep network
ResNet-101 pre-trained on ImageNet dataset. Moreover, depending on the varying
accuracy requirements in a dynamic environment, the deployed low-precision
model can be upgraded/downgraded on-the-fly by partially enabling/disabling
residual connections. For example, disabling the least important residual
connections in the above enhanced network, the accuracy drop is $\sim 2\%$
(from FP32), despite $\sim 1.9\times$ reduction in model size, $\sim 32\times$
reduction in number of multiplications, and potentially $\sim 2.3\times$
power-performance gain comparing to 8-8 representation. Finally, all the
ternary connections are sparse in nature, and the ternary residual conversion
can be done in a resource-constraint setting with no low-precision
(re)training.

 <dc:title>Early MFCC And HPCP Fusion for Robust Cover Song Identification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  While most schemes for automatic cover song identification have focused on
note-based features such as HPCP and chord profiles, a few recent papers
surprisingly showed that local self-similarities of MFCC-based features also
have classification power for this task. Since MFCC and HPCP capture
complementary information, we design an unsupervised algorithm that combines
normalized, beat-synchronous blocks of these features using cross-similarity
fusion before attempting to locally align a pair of songs. As an added bonus,
our scheme naturally incorporates structural information in each song to fill
in alignment gaps where both feature sets fail. We show a striking jump in
performance over MFCC and HPCP alone, achieving a state of the art mean
reciprocal rank of 0.87 on the Covers80 dataset. We also introduce a new
medium-sized hand designed benchmark dataset called &quot;Covers 1000,&quot; which
consists of 395 cliques of cover songs for a total of 1000 songs, and we show
that our algorithm achieves an MRR of 0.9 on this dataset for the first
correctly identified song in a clique. We provide the precomputed HPCP and MFCC
features, as well as beat intervals, for all songs in the Covers 1000 dataset
for use in further research.

 <dc:description>  An emerging problem in computer vision is the reconstruction of 3D shape and
pose of an object from a single image. Hitherto, the problem has been addressed
through the application of canonical deep learning methods to regress from the
image directly to the 3D shape and pose labels. These approaches, however, are
problematic from two perspectives. First, they are minimizing the error between
3D shapes and pose labels - with little thought about the nature of this label
error when reprojecting the shape back onto the image. Second, they rely on the
onerous and ill-posed task of hand labeling natural images with respect to 3D
shape and pose. In this paper we define the new task of pose-aware shape
reconstruction from a single image, and we advocate that cheaper 2D annotations
of objects silhouettes in natural images can be utilized. We design
architectures of pose-aware shape reconstruction which re-project the predicted
shape back on to the image using the predicted pose. Our evaluation on several
object categories demonstrates the superiority of our method for predicting
pose-aware 3D shapes from natural images.

 <dc:description>  We improve our earlier lower bounds on the number of electrical
transformations required to reduce an $n$-vertex plane graph in the worst case
[SOCG 2016] in two different directions. Our previous $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ lower
bound applies only to facial electrical transformations on plane graphs with no
terminals. First we provide a stronger $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound when the graph
has two or more terminals, which follows from a quadratic lower bound on the
number of homotopy moves in the annulus, described in a companion paper. Our
second result extends our earlier $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ lower bound to the wider
class of planar electrical transformations, which preserve the planarity of the
graph but may delete cycles that are not faces of the given embedding. This new
lower bound follows from the observation that the defect of the medial graph of
a planar graph is the same for all its planar embeddings.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic inference from real-time input data is becoming increasingly
popular and may be one of the potential pathways at enabling cognitive
intelligence. As a matter of fact, preliminary research has revealed that
stochastic functionalities also underlie the spiking behavior of neurons in
cortical microcircuits of the human brain. In tune with such observations,
neuromorphic and other unconventional computing platforms have recently started
adopting the usage of computational units that generate outputs
probabilistically, depending on the magnitude of the input stimulus. In this
work, we experimentally demonstrate a spintronic device that offers a direct
mapping to the functionality of such a controllable stochastic switching
element. We show that the probabilistic switching of Ta/CoFeB/MgO
heterostructures in presence of spin-orbit torque and thermal noise can be
harnessed to enable probabilistic inference in a plethora of unconventional
computing scenarios. This work can potentially pave the way for hardware that
directly mimics the computational units of Bayesian inference.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art convolutional neural networks are enormously costly in both
compute and memory, demanding massively parallel GPUs for execution. Such
networks strain the computational capabilities and energy available to embedded
and mobile processing platforms, restricting their use in many important
applications. In this paper, we push the boundaries of hardware-effective CNN
design by proposing BCNN with Separable Filters (BCNNw/SF), which applies
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on BCNN kernels to further reduce
computational and storage complexity. To enable its implementation, we provide
a closed form of the gradient over SVD to calculate the exact gradient with
respect to every binarized weight in backward propagation. We verify BCNNw/SF
on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets, and implement an accelerator for
CIFAR-10 on FPGA hardware. Our BCNNw/SF accelerator realizes memory savings of
17% and execution time reduction of 31.3% compared to BCNN with only minor
accuracy sacrifices.

 <dc:title>The Intricacies of 3-Valued Extensional Semantics for Higher-Order Logic

 <dc:description>  In (Bezem 1999; Bezem 2001), M. Bezem defined an extensional semantics for
positive higher-order logic programs. Recently, it was demonstrated in
(Rondogiannis and Symeonidou 2016) that Bezem's technique can be extended to
higher-order logic programs with negation, retaining its extensional
properties, provided that it is interpreted under a logic with an infinite
number of truth values. In (Rondogiannis and Symeonidou 2017) it was also
demonstrated that Bezem's technique, when extended under the stable model
semantics, does not in general lead to extensional stable models. In this paper
we consider the problem of extending Bezem's technique under the well-founded
semantics. We demonstrate that the well-founded extension fails to retain
extensionality in the general case. On the positive side, we demonstrate that
for stratified higher-order logic programs, extensionality is indeed achieved.
We analyze the reasons of the failure of extensionality in the general case,
arguing that a three-valued setting can not distinguish between certain
predicates that appear to have a different behaviour inside a program context,
but which happen to be identical as three-valued relations. The paper is under
consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing has been regarded as the technology enabler for the Internet
of Things (IoT). To ensure the most effective collection of IoT-based evidence,
it is vital for forensic practitioners to possess a contemporary understanding
of the artefacts from different cloud services. In this paper, we seek to
determine the data remnants from the use of BitTorrent Sync version 2.0.
Findings from our research using mobile and computer devices running Windows
8.1, Mac OS X Mavericks 10.9.5, Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, iOS 7.1.2, and Android
KitKat 4.4.4 suggested that artefacts relating to the installation,
uninstallation, log-in, log-off, and file synchronisation could be recovered,
which are potential sources of IoT forensics. We also present a forensically
sound investigation methodology for BitTorrent Sync.

 <dc:title>Memoisation: Purely, Left-recursively, and with (Continuation Passing)
  Style</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Memoisation, or tabling, is a well-known technique that yields large
improvements in the performance of some recursive computations. Tabled
resolution in Prologs such as XSB and B-Prolog can transform so called
left-recursive predicates from non-terminating computations into finite and
well-behaved ones. In the functional programming literature, memoisation has
usually been implemented in a way that does not handle left-recursion,
requiring supplementary mechanisms to prevent non-termination. A notable
exception is Johnson's (1995) continuation passing approach in Scheme. This,
however, relies on mutation of a memo table data structure and coding in
explicit continuation passing style. We show how Johnson's approach can be
implemented purely functionally in a modern, strongly typed functional language
(OCaml), presented via a monadic interface that hides the implementation
details, yet providing a way to return a compact represention of the memo
tables at the end of the computation.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of allocating indivisible goods fairly and efficiently
among a set of agents who have additive valuations for the goods. Here, an
allocation is said to be fair if it is envy-free up to one good (EF1), which
means that each agent prefers its own bundle over the bundle of any other
agent, up to the removal of one good. In addition, an allocation is deemed to
be efficient if it satisfies Pareto efficiency. A notable result of Caragiannis
et al. (2016) shows that---under additive valuations---there is no need to
trade efficiency for fairness; specifically, an allocation that maximizes the
Nash social welfare (NSW) objective simultaneously satisfies these two
seemingly incompatible properties. However, this approach does not directly
provide an efficient algorithm for finding fair and efficient allocations,
since maximizing NSW is an NP-hard problem.
  In this paper, we bypass this barrier, and develop a pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm for finding allocations which are EF1 and Pareto efficient; in
particular, when the valuations are bounded, our algorithm finds such an
allocation in polynomial time. Furthermore, we establish a stronger existence
result compared to Caragiannis et al. (2016): For additive valuations, there
always exists an allocation that is EF1 and fractionally Pareto efficient. The
approach developed in the paper leads to a polynomial-time 1.45-approximation
for maximizing the Nash social welfare objective. This improves upon the best
known approximation ratio for this problem. Our results are based on
constructing Fisher markets wherein specific equilibria are not only efficient,
but also fair.

 <dc:title>On the Axiomatizability of Multiplicative Theory of Numbers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The multiplicative theory of a set of numbers (which could be natural,
integer, rational, real or complex numbers) is the first-order theory of the
structure of that set with (solely) the multiplication operation (that set is
taken to be multiplicative, i.e., closed under multiplication). In this paper
we study the multiplicative theories of the complex, real and (positive)
rational numbers. These theories (and also the multiplicative theories of
natural and integer numbers) are known to be decidable (i.e., there exists an
algorithm that decides whether a given sentence is derivable form the theory);
here we present explicit axiomatizations for them and show that they are not
finitely axiomatizable. For each of these sets (of complex, real and [positive]
rational numbers) a language, including the multiplication operation, is
introduced in a way that it allows quantifier elimination (for the theory of
that set).

 <dc:title>Annotated Defeasible Logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Governatori, Guido</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Defeasible logics provide several linguistic features to support the
expression of defeasible knowledge. There is also a wide variety of such
logics, expressing different intuitions about defeasible reasoning. However,
the logics can only combine in trivial ways. This limits their usefulness in
contexts where different intuitions are at play in different aspects of a
problem. In particular, in some legal settings, different actors have different
burdens of proof, which might be expressed as reasoning in different defeasible
logics.
  In this paper, we introduce annotated defeasible logic as a flexible
formalism permitting multiple forms of defeasibility, and establish some
properties of the formalism.
  This paper is under consideration for acceptance in Theory and Practice of
Logic Programming.

 <dc:description>  In the field of automated program repair, the redundancy assumption claims
large programs contain the seeds of their own repair. However, most
redundancy-based program repair techniques do not reason about the repair
ingredients---the code that is reused to craft a patch. We aim to reason about
the repair ingredients by using code similarities to prioritize and transform
statements in a codebase for patch generation. Our approach, DeepRepair, relies
on deep learning to reason about code similarities. Code fragments at
well-defined levels of granularity in a codebase can be sorted according to
their similarity to suspicious elements (i.e., code elements that contain
suspicious statements) and statements can be transformed by mapping
out-of-scope identifiers to similar identifiers in scope. We examined these new
search strategies for patch generation with respect to effectiveness from the
viewpoint of a software maintainer. Our comparative experiments were executed
on six open-source Java projects including 374 buggy program revisions and
consisted of 19,949 trials spanning 2,616 days of computation time.
DeepRepair's search strategy using code similarities generally found compilable
ingredients faster than the baseline, jGenProg, but this improvement neither
yielded test-adequate patches in fewer attempts (on average) nor found
significantly more patches than the baseline. Although the patch counts were
not statistically different, there were notable differences between the nature
of DeepRepair patches and baseline patches. The results demonstrate that our
learning-based approach finds patches that cannot be found by existing
redundancy-based repair techniques.

 <dc:description>  The ccns3Sim project is an open source implementation of the CCNx 1.0
protocols for the NS3 simulator. We describe the implementation and several
important features including modularity and process delay simulation. The
ccns3Sim implementation is a fresh NS3-specific implementation. Like NS3
itself, it uses C++98 standard, NS3 code style, NS3 smart pointers, NS3 xUnit,
and integrates with the NS3 documentation and manual. A user or developer does
not need to learn two systems. If one knows NS3, one should be able to get
started with the CCNx code right away. A developer can easily use their own
implementation of the layer 3 protocol, layer 4 protocol, forwarder, routing
protocol, Pending Interest Table (PIT) or Forwarding Information Base (FIB) or
Content Store (CS). A user may configure or specify a new implementation for
any of these features at runtime in the simulation script. In this paper, we
describe the software architecture and give examples of using the simulator. We
evaluate the implementation with several example experiments on ICN caching.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this functional pearl, we examine the use of definitional interpreters as
a basis for abstract interpretation of higher-order programming languages. As
it turns out, definitional interpreters, especially those written in monadic
style, can provide a nice basis for a wide variety of collecting semantics,
abstract interpretations, symbolic executions, and their intermixings.
  But the real insight of this story is a replaying of an insight from
Reynold's landmark paper, Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order
Programming Languages, in which he observes definitional interpreters enable
the defined-language to inherit properties of the defining-language. We show
the same holds true for definitional abstract interpreters. Remarkably, we
observe that abstract definitional interpreters can inherit the so-called
&quot;pushdown control flow&quot; property, wherein function calls and returns are
precisely matched in the abstract semantics, simply by virtue of the function
call mechanism of the defining-language.
  The first approaches to achieve this property for higher-order languages
appeared within the last ten years, and have since been the subject of many
papers. These approaches start from a state-machine semantics and uniformly
involve significant technical engineering to recover the precision of pushdown
control flow. In contrast, starting from a definitional interpreter, the
pushdown control flow property is inherent in the meta-language and requires no
further technical mechanism to achieve.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We revisit the problem of finding a minimum enclosing ball with differential
privacy: Given a set of $n$ points in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an
integer $t\leq n$, the goal is to find a ball of the smallest radius $r_{opt}$
enclosing at least $t$ input points. The problem is motivated by its various
applications to differential privacy, including the sample and aggregate
technique, private data exploration, and clustering.
  Without privacy concerns, minimum enclosing ball has a polynomial time
approximation scheme (PTAS), which computes a ball of radius almost $r_{opt}$
(the problem is NP-hard to solve exactly). In contrast, under differential
privacy, until this work, only a $O(\sqrt{\log n})$-approximation algorithm was
known.
  We provide new constructions of differentially private algorithms for minimum
enclosing ball achieving constant factor approximation to $r_{opt}$ both in the
centralized model (where a trusted curator collects the sensitive information
and analyzes it with differential privacy) and in the local model (where each
respondent randomizes her answers to the data curator to protect her privacy).
  We demonstrate how to use our algorithms as a building block for
approximating $k$-means in both models.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The goal of fair division is to distribute resources among competing players
in a &quot;fair&quot; way. Envy-freeness is the most extensively studied fairness notion
in fair division. Envy-free allocations do not always exist with indivisible
goods, motivating the study of relaxed versions of envy-freeness. We study the
envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) property, which states that no player
prefers the bundle of another player following the removal of any single good,
and prove the first general results about this property. We use the leximin
solution to show existence of EFX allocations in several contexts, sometimes in
conjunction with Pareto optimality. For two players with valuations obeying a
mild assumption, one of these results provides stronger guarantees than the
currently deployed algorithm on Spliddit, a popular fair division website.
Unfortunately, finding the leximin solution can require exponential time. We
show that this is necessary by proving an exponential lower bound on the number
of value queries needed to identify an EFX allocation, even for two players
with identical valuations. We consider both additive and more general
valuations, and our work suggests that there is a rich landscape of problems to
explore in the fair division of indivisible goods with different classes of
player valuations.

 <dc:description>  Vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) is a
well-established problem in mobile robotics and monocular vSLAM is one of the
most challenging variations of that problem nowadays. In this work we study one
of the core post-processing optimization mechanisms in vSLAM, e.g. loop-closure
detection. We analyze the existing methods and propose original algorithm for
loop-closure detection, which is suitable for dense, semi-dense and
feature-based vSLAM methods. We evaluate the algorithm experimentally and show
that it contribute to more accurate mapping while speeding up the monocular
vSLAM pipeline to the extent the latter can be used in real-time for
controlling small multi-rotor vehicle (drone).

 <dc:description>  Among the many anticipated roles for robots in the future is that of being a
human teammate. Aside from all the technological hurdles that have to be
overcome with respect to hardware and control to make robots fit to work with
humans, the added complication here is that humans have many conscious and
subconscious expectations of their teammates - indeed, we argue that teaming is
mostly a cognitive rather than physical coordination activity. This introduces
new challenges for the AI and robotics community and requires fundamental
changes to the traditional approach to the design of autonomy. With this in
mind, we propose an update to the classical view of the intelligent agent
architecture, highlighting the requirements for mental modeling of the human in
the deliberative process of the autonomous agent. In this article, we outline
briefly the recent efforts of ours, and others in the community, towards
developing cognitive teammates along these guidelines.

learning, speech recognition, computer vision, and so on. Taking inspiration
from the network properties of biological neural networks (e.g. sparsity,
scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice) Artificial Neural
Networks (ANN), too, should not have fully-connected layers. We show how ANNs
perform perfectly well with sparsely-connected layers. Following a Darwinian
evolutionary approach, we propose a novel algorithm which evolves an initial
random sparse topology (i.e. an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph) of two
consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during the ANN
training process. The resulting sparse layers can safely replace the
corresponding fully-connected layers. Our method allows to quadratically reduce
the number of parameters in the fully conencted layers of ANNs, yielding
quadratically faster computational times in both phases (i.e. training and
inference), at no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on two
popular ANN types (restricted Boltzmann machine and multi-layer perceptron), on
two types of tasks (supervised and unsupervised learning), and on 14 benchmark
datasets. We anticipate that our approach will enable ANNs having billions of
neurons and evolved topologies to be capable of handling complex real-world
tasks that are intractable using state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Color in an image is resolved into 3 or 4 color components and 2-Dimages of
these components are stored in separate channels. Most of the color image
enhancement algorithms are applied channel-by-channel on each image. But such a
system of color image processing is not processing the original color. When a
color image is represented as a quaternion image, processing is done in
original colors. This paper proposes an implementation of the quaternion
approach of enhancement algorithm for enhancing color images and is referred as
the modified alpha-rooting by the two-dimensional quaternion discrete Fourier
transform (2-D QDFT). Enhancement results of this proposed method are compared
with the channel-by-channel image enhancement by the 2-D DFT. Enhancements in
color images are quantitatively measured by the color enhancement measure
estimation (CEME), which allows for selecting optimum parameters for processing
by the genetic algorithm. Enhancement of color images by the quaternion based
method allows for obtaining images which are closer to the genuine
representation of the real original color.

 <dc:title>New Classes of Ternary Bent Functions from the Coulter-Matthews Bent
  Functions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  It has been an active research issue for many years to construct new bent
functions. For $k$ odd with $\gcd(n, k)=1$, and $a\in\mathbb{F}_{3^n}^{*}$, the
function $f(x)=Tr(ax^{\frac{3^k+1}{2}})$ is weakly regular bent over
$\mathbb{F}_{3^n}$, where $Tr(\cdot):\mathbb{F}_{3^n}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_3$
is the trace function. This is the well-known Coulter-Matthews bent function.
In this paper, we determine the dual function of $f(x)$ completely. As a
consequence, we find many classes of ternary bent functions not reported in the
literature previously. Such bent functions are not quadratic if $k&gt;1$, and have
$\left(\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{w+1}-\right.$
$\left.\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{w+1}\right)/\sqrt{5}$ or
$\left(\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n-w+1}-\right.$
$\left.\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n-w+1}\right)/\sqrt{5}$ trace terms,
where $0&lt;w&lt;n$ and $wk\equiv 1\ (\bmod\;n)$. Among them, five special cases are
especially interesting: for the case of $k=(n+1)/2$, the number of trace terms
is $\left(\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n-1}-\right.$
$\left.\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n-1}\right)/\sqrt{5}$; for the case
of $k=n-1$, the number of trace terms is
$\left(\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n-\right.$
$\left.\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n\right)/\sqrt{5}$; for the case of
$k=(n-1)/2$, the number of trace terms is
$\left(\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n-1}-\right.$
$\left.\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n-1}\right)/\sqrt{5}$; for the case
of $(n, k)=(5t+4, 4t+3)$ or $(5t+1, 4t+1)$ with $t\geq 1$, the number of trace
terms is 8; and for the case of $(n, k)=(7t+6, 6t+5)$ or $(7t+1, 6t+1)$ with
$t\geq 1$, the number of trace terms is 21. As a byproduct, we find new classes
of ternary bent functions with only 8 or 21 trace terms.

 <dc:title>MPIgnite: An MPI-Like Language and Prototype Implementation for Apache
  Spark</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Morris, Brandon L.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Scale-out parallel processing based on MPI is a 25-year-old standard with at
least another decade of preceding history of enabling technologies in the High
Performance Computing community. Newer frameworks such as MapReduce, Hadoop,
and Spark represent industrial scalable computing solutions that have received
broad adoption because of their comparative simplicity of use, applicability to
relevant problems, and ability to harness scalable, distributed resources.
While MPI provides performance and portability, it lacks in productivity and
fault tolerance. Likewise, Spark is a specific example of a current-generation
MapReduce and data-parallel computing infrastructure that addresses those goals
but in turn lacks peer communication support to allow featherweight, highly
scalable peer-to-peer data-parallel code sections. The key contribution of this
paper is to demonstrate how to introduce the collective and point-to-point peer
communication concepts of MPI into a Spark environment. This is done in order
to produce performance-portable, peer-oriented and group-oriented communication
services while retaining the essential, desirable properties of Spark.
Additional concepts of fault tolerance and productivity are considered. This
approach is offered in contrast to adding MapReduce framework as
upper-middleware based on a traditional MPI implementation as baseline
infrastructure.

 <dc:title>On the complexity of range searching among curves</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Afshani, Peyman</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Driemel, Anne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modern tracking technology has made the collection of large numbers of
densely sampled trajectories of moving objects widely available. We consider a
fundamental problem encountered when analysing such data: Given $n$ polygonal
curves $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, preprocess $S$ into a data structure that answers
queries with a query curve $q$ and radius $\rho$ for the curves of $S$ that
have \Frechet distance at most $\rho$ to $q$.
  We initiate a comprehensive analysis of the space/query-time trade-off for
this data structuring problem. Our lower bounds imply that any data structure
in the pointer model model that achieves $Q(n) + O(k)$ query time, where $k$ is
the output size, has to use roughly $\Omega\left((n/Q(n))^2\right)$ space in
the worst case, even if queries are mere points (for the discrete \Frechet
distance) or line segments (for the continuous \Frechet distance). More
importantly, we show that more complex queries and input curves lead to
additional logarithmic factors in the lower bound. Roughly speaking, the number
of logarithmic factors added is linear in the number of edges added to the
query and input curve complexity. This means that the space/query time
trade-off worsens by an exponential factor of input and query complexity. This
behaviour addresses an open question in the range searching literature: whether
it is possible to avoid the additional logarithmic factors in the space and
query time of a multilevel partition tree. We answer this question negatively.
  On the positive side, we show we can build data structures for the \Frechet
distance by using semialgebraic range searching. Our solution for the discrete
\Frechet distance is in line with the lower bound, as the number of levels in
the data structure is $O(t)$, where $t$ denotes the maximal number of vertices
of a curve. For the continuous \Frechet distance, the number of levels
increases to $O(t^2)$.

 <dc:title>Automatic Identification of Non-Meaningful Body-Movements and What It

 <dc:description>  We present a framework to identify whether a public speaker's body movements
are meaningful or non-meaningful (&quot;Mannerisms&quot;) in the context of their
speeches. In a dataset of 84 public speaking videos from 28 individuals, we
extract 314 unique body movement patterns (e.g. pacing, gesturing, shifting
body weights, etc.). Online workers and the speakers themselves annotated the
meaningfulness of the patterns. We extracted five types of features from the
audio-video recordings: disfluency, prosody, body movements, facial, and
lexical. We use linear classifiers to predict the annotations with AUC up to
0.82. Analysis of the classifier weights reveals that it puts larger weights on
the lexical features while predicting self-annotations. Contrastingly, it puts
a larger weight on prosody features while predicting audience annotations. This
analysis might provide subtle hint that public speakers tend to focus more on
the verbal features while evaluating self-performances. The audience, on the
other hand, tends to focus more on the non-verbal aspects of the speech. The
dataset and code associated with this work has been released for peer review
and further analysis.

 <dc:description>  This work explores the trade-off between the number of samples required to
accurately build models of dynamical systems and the degradation of performance
in various control objectives due to a coarse approximation. In particular, we
show that simple models can be easily fit from input/output data and are
sufficient for achieving various control objectives. We derive bounds on the
number of noisy input/output samples from a stable linear time-invariant system
that are sufficient to guarantee that the corresponding finite impulse response
approximation is close to the true system in the $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm. We
demonstrate that these demands are lower than those derived in prior art which
aimed to accurately identify dynamical models. We also explore how different
physical input constraints, such as power constraints, affect the sample
complexity. Finally, we show how our analysis fits within the established
framework of robust control, by demonstrating how a controller designed for an
approximate system provably meets performance objectives on the true system.

 <dc:title>From the Lab to the Street: Solving the Challenge of Accelerating
  Automated Vehicle Testing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Ding</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As automated vehicles and their technology become more advanced and
technically sophisticated, evaluation procedures that can measure the safety
and reliability of these new driverless cars must develop far beyond existing
safety tests. To get an accurate assessment in field tests, such cars would
have to be driven millions or even billions of miles to arrive at an acceptable
level of certainty - a time-consuming process that would cost tens of millions
of dollars.
  Instead, researchers affiliated with the University of Michigan's Mcity
connected and automated vehicle center have developed an accelerated evaluation
process that eliminates the many miles of uneventful driving activity to filter
out only the potentially dangerous driving situations where an automated
vehicle needs to respond, creating a faster, less expensive testing program.
This approach can reduce the amount of testing needed by a factor of 300 to
100,000 so that an automated vehicle driven for 1,000 test miles can yield the
equivalent of 300,000 to 100 million miles of real-world driving.
  While more research and development needs to be done to perfect this
technique, the accelerated evaluation procedure offers a ground-breaking
solution for safe and efficient testing that is crucial to deploying automated
vehicles.

 <dc:description>  Clustering has been well studied for desktop malware analysis as an effective

cannot be immediately applied to Android malware analysis due to the excessive
use of third-party libraries in Android application development and the
widespread use of repackaging in malware development. We design and implement
an Android malware clustering system through iterative mining of malicious
payload and checking whether malware samples share the same version of
malicious payload. Our system utilizes a hierarchical clustering technique and
an efficient bit-vector format to represent Android apps. Experimental results
demonstrate that our clustering approach achieves precision of 0.90 and recall
of 0.75 for Android Genome malware dataset, and average precision of 0.98 and
recall of 0.96 with respect to manually verified ground-truth.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural network (DNN) architectures have been shown to outperform
traditional pipelines for object segmentation and pose estimation using RGBD
data, but the performance of these DNN pipelines is directly tied to how
representative the training data is of the true data. Hence a key requirement
for employing these methods in practice is to have a large set of labeled data
for your specific robotic manipulation task, a requirement that is not
generally satisfied by existing datasets. In this paper we develop a pipeline
to rapidly generate high quality RGBD data with pixelwise labels and object
poses. We use an RGBD camera to collect video of a scene from multiple
viewpoints and leverage existing reconstruction techniques to produce a 3D
dense reconstruction. We label the 3D reconstruction using a human assisted
ICP-fitting of object meshes. By reprojecting the results of labeling the 3D
scene we can produce labels for each RGBD image of the scene. This pipeline
enabled us to collect over 1,000,000 labeled object instances in just a few
days. We use this dataset to answer questions related to how much training data
is required, and of what quality the data must be, to achieve high performance
from a DNN architecture.

 <dc:title>A Streamline Selection Technique Overlaying with Isosurfaces</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Integration of scalar and vector visualization has been an interesting topic.
This paper presents a technique to appropriately select and display multiple
streamlines while overlaying with isosurfaces, aiming an integrated scalar and
vector field visualization. The technique visualizes a scalar field by multiple
semitransparent isosurfaces, and a vector field by multiple streamlines, while
the technique adequately selects the streamlines considering reduction of
cluttering among the isosurfaces and streamlines. The technique first selects
and renders isosurfaces, and then generates large number of streamlines from
randomly selected seed points. The technique evaluates each of the streamlines
according to their shapes on a 2D display space, distances to critical points
of the given vector fields, and occlusion by isosurfaces. It then selects the
specified number of highly evaluated streamlines. As a result, we can visualize
both scalar and vector fields as a set of view-independently selected
isosurfaces and view-dependently selected streamlines.

 <dc:title>RED: Reinforced Encoder-Decoder Networks for Action Anticipation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Action anticipation aims to detect an action before it happens. Many real
world applications in robotics and surveillance are related to this predictive
capability. Current methods address this problem by first anticipating visual
representations of future frames and then categorizing the anticipated
representations to actions. However, anticipation is based on a single past
frame's representation, which ignores the history trend. Besides, it can only
anticipate a fixed future time. We propose a Reinforced Encoder-Decoder (RED)
network for action anticipation. RED takes multiple history representations as
input and learns to anticipate a sequence of future representations. One
salient aspect of RED is that a reinforcement module is adopted to provide
sequence-level supervision; the reward function is designed to encourage the
system to make correct predictions as early as possible. We test RED on
TVSeries, THUMOS-14 and TV-Human-Interaction datasets for action anticipation
and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all datasets.

 <dc:creator>Abdolmalaki, Reza Yazdanpanah</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper discusses modelling two 6 DOF arm robots. The first step of
modelling a robot is establishing its Denavit-Hartenberg parameters. It
requires assigning proper coordinates for each link and finding their exact
dimensions. In this project we will develop the direct kinematics and workspace
representations for two manipulators: the Smokie Robot and the Barrett WAM.
After finding the D-H parameters and creating Transformation Matrices,MATLAB
programming is used to represent their workspaces.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses deriving geometric jacobians and identifying and
analyzing the kinematic singularities for two 6 DOF arm robots. First we show
the direct kinematics and D-H parameters derived for these two arms. The
Geometric jacobian is computed for Barrett WAM and Smokie OUR. By analyzing the
jacobian matrices we find the configurations at which J is rank deficient and
derive the kinematic singularities through jacobian's determinent. Schematic
are provided to show the singular configurations of both robots. Finally a
survey is done on redundant kinematic allocation schemesfor 7 DoF Barrett WAM.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a generic and simple algorithmic framework for
first order optimization. The framework essentially contains two consecutive
steps in each iteration: 1) computing and normalizing the mini-batch stochastic
gradient; 2) selecting adaptive step size to update the decision variable
(parameter) towards the negative of the normalized gradient. We show that the
proposed approach, when customized to the popular adaptive stepsize methods,
such as AdaGrad, can enjoy a sublinear convergence rate, if the objective is
convex. We also conduct extensive empirical studies on various non-convex
neural network optimization problems, including multi layer perceptron,
convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks. The results indicate
the normalized gradient with adaptive step size can help accelerate the
training of neural networks. In particular, significant speedup can be observed
if the networks are deep or the dependencies are long.

 <dc:description>  Materials design and development typically takes several decades from the
initial discovery to commercialization with the traditional trial and error
development approach. With the accumulation of data from both experimental and
computational results, data based machine learning becomes an emerging field in
materials discovery, design and property prediction. This manuscript reviews
the history of materials science as a disciplinary the most common machine
learning method used in materials science, and specifically how they are used
in materials discovery, design, synthesis and even failure detection and
analysis after materials are deployed in real application. Finally, the
limitations of machine learning for application in materials science and
challenges in this emerging field is discussed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we demonstrate the application of Fuzzy Markup Language (FML)
to construct an FML-based Dynamic Assessment Agent (FDAA), and we present an
FML-based Human-Machine Cooperative System (FHMCS) for the game of Go. The
proposed FDAA comprises an intelligent decision-making and learning mechanism,
an intelligent game bot, a proximal development agent, and an intelligent
agent. The intelligent game bot is based on the open-source code of Facebook
Darkforest, and it features a representational state transfer application
programming interface mechanism. The proximal development agent contains a
dynamic assessment mechanism, a GoSocket mechanism, and an FML engine with a
fuzzy knowledge base and rule base. The intelligent agent contains a GoSocket
engine and a summarization agent that is based on the estimated win rate,
real-time simulation number, and matching degree of predicted moves.
Additionally, the FML for player performance evaluation and linguistic
descriptions for game results commentary are presented. We experimentally
verify and validate the performance of the FDAA and variants of the FHMCS by
testing five games in 2016 and 60 games of Google Master Go, a new version of
the AlphaGo program, in January 2017. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed FDAA can work effectively for Go applications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The performance of deep learning in natural language processing has been
spectacular, but the reasons for this success remain unclear because of the
inherent complexity of deep learning. This paper provides empirical evidence of
its effectiveness and of a limitation of neural networks for language
engineering. Precisely, we demonstrate that a neural language model based on
long short-term memory (LSTM) effectively reproduces Zipf's law and Heaps' law,
two representative statistical properties underlying natural language. We
discuss the quality of reproducibility and the emergence of Zipf's law and
Heaps' law as training progresses. We also point out that the neural language
model has a limitation in reproducing long-range correlation, another
statistical property of natural language. This understanding could provide a
direction for improving the architectures of neural networks.

 <dc:description>  We consider data transmission across discrete memoryless channels (DMCs)
using variable-length codes with feedback. We consider the family of such codes
whose rates are $\rho_N$ below the channel capacity $C$, where $\rho_N$ is a
positive sequence that tends to zero slower than the reciprocal of the square
root of the expectation of the (random) blocklength $N$. This is known as the
moderate deviations regime and we establish the optimal moderate deviations
constant. We show that in this scenario, the error probability decays
sub-exponentially with speed $\exp(-(B/C)N\rho_N)$, where $B$ is the maximum
relative entropy between output distributions of the DMC.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose an improvement for flowpipe-construction-based
reachability analysis techniques for hybrid systems. Such methods apply
iterative successor computations to pave the reachable region of the state
space by state sets in an over-approximative manner. As the computational costs
steeply increase with the dimension, in this work we analyse the possibilities
for improving scalability by dividing the search space in sub-spaces and
execute reachability computations in the sub-spaces instead of the global
space. We formalise such an algorithm and provide experimental evaluations to
compare the efficiency as well as the precision of our sub-space search to the
original search in the global space.

 <dc:description>  Catastrophic interference has been a major roadblock in the research of
continual learning. Here we propose a variant of the back-propagation
algorithm, &quot;conceptor-aided back-prop&quot; (CAB), in which gradients are shielded
by conceptors against degradation of previously learned tasks. Conceptors have
their origin in reservoir computing, where they have been previously shown to
overcome catastrophic forgetting. CAB extends these results to deep feedforward
networks. On the disjoint MNIST task CAB outperforms two other methods for
coping with catastrophic interference that have recently been proposed in the
deep learning field.

 <dc:title>On Approximating the Number of $k$-cliques in Sublinear Time</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of approximating the number of $k$-cliques in a graph
when given query access to the graph.
  We consider the standard query model for general graphs via (1) degree
queries, (2) neighbor queries and (3) pair queries. Let $n$ denote the number
of vertices in the graph, $m$ the number of edges, and $C_k$ the number of
$k$-cliques. We design an algorithm that outputs a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation (with high probability) for $C_k$, whose
expected query complexity and running time are
$O\left(\frac{n}{C_k^{1/k}}+\frac{m^{k/2}}{C_k} \right)\textrm{poly}(\log n,
1/\varepsilon,C_k)$.
  Hence, the complexity of the algorithm is sublinear in the size of the graph
for $C_k= \omega(m^{k/2-1})$. Furthermore, we prove a lower bound showing that
the query complexity of our algorithm is essentially optimal (up to the
dependence on $\log n$, $1/\varepsilon$ and $k$).
  The previous results in this vein are by Feige (SICOMP 06) and Goldreich-Ron
(RSA 08) for edge counting ($k=2$) and by Eden-Levi-Ron-Seshadhri (FOCS 2015)
for triangle counting ($k=3$). Our result matches the complexities of these
results.
  The heart of our algorithm is a procedure for sampling each $k$-clique
incident to a given set $S$ of vertices with approximately equal probability.
This is done by first sampling an edge $(u,v)$ incident to $S$ uniformly at
random, and then trying to extend the edge to a $k$-clique. We prove that by
considering only $v$'s higher-degree neighbors, we can sample a $k$-clique
incident to $S$ almost uniformly, and show that each such neighbor can be
sampled with almost uniform and sufficiently high probability.

 <dc:description>  Compared with the perfect complementary sequence sets, quasi-complementary
sequence sets (QCSSs) can support more users to work in multicarrier CDMA
communications. A near-optimal periodic QCSS is constructed in this paper by
using an optimal quaternary sequence set and an almost difference set. With the
change of the values of parameters in the almost difference set, the
near-optimal QCSS can become asymptotically optimal and the number of users
supported by the subcarrier channels in CDMA system has an exponential growth.

 <dc:description>  This study considers the problem of automated detection of non-relevant posts
on Web forums and discusses the approach of resolving this problem by
approximation it with the task of detection of semantic relatedness between the
given post and the opening post of the forum discussion thread. The
approximated task could be resolved through learning the supervised classifier
with a composed word embeddings of two posts. Considering that the success in
this task could be quite sensitive to the choice of word representations, we
propose a comparison of the performance of different word embedding models. We
train 7 models (Word2Vec, Glove, Word2Vec-f, Wang2Vec, AdaGram, FastText,
Swivel), evaluate embeddings produced by them on dataset of human judgements
and compare their performance on the task of non-relevant posts detection. To
make the comparison, we propose a dataset of semantic relatedness with posts
from one of the most popular Russian Web forums, imageboard &quot;2ch&quot;, which has
challenging lexical and grammatical features.

 <dc:title>Uncertainty principles and optimally sparse wavelet transforms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levie, Ron</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a new localization framework for wavelet
transforms, such as the 1D wavelet transform and the Shearlet transform. Our
goal is to design nonadaptive window functions that promote sparsity in some
sense. For that, we introduce a framework for analyzing localization aspects of
window functions. Our localization theory diverges from the conventional theory
in two ways. First, we distinguish between the group generators, and the
operators that measure localization (called observables). Second, we define the
uncertainty of a signal transform based on a window as a whole, instead of
defining the uncertainty of an individual window. We show that the uncertainty
of a window function, in the signal space, is closely related to the
localization of the reproducing kernel of the wavelet transform, in phase
space. As a result, we show that using uncertainty minimizing window functions,
results in representations which are optimally sparse in some sense.

 <dc:title>Testing bounded arboricity</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of testing whether a graph has bounded
arboricity. The family of graphs with bounded arboricity includes, among
others, bounded-degree graphs, all minor-closed graph classes (e.g. planar
graphs, graphs with bounded treewidth) and randomly generated preferential
attachment graphs. Graphs with bounded arboricity have been studied extensively
in the past, in particular since for many problems they allow for much more
efficient algorithms and/or better approximation ratios.
  We present a tolerant tester in the sparse-graphs model. The sparse-graphs
model allows access to degree queries and neighbor queries, and the distance is
defined with respect to the actual number of edges. More specifically, our
algorithm distinguishes between graphs that are $\epsilon$-close to having
arboricity $\alpha$ and graphs that $c \cdot \epsilon$-far from having
arboricity $3\alpha$, where $c$ is an absolute small constant. The query
complexity and running time of the algorithm are
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}\cdot \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon} +
\frac{n\cdot \alpha}{m} \cdot
\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}\right)$ where $n$ denotes
the number of vertices and $m$ denotes the number of edges. In terms of the
dependence on $n$ and $m$ this bound is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors
since $\Omega(n/\sqrt{m})$ queries are necessary (and $\alpha = O(\sqrt{m}))$.
  We leave it as an open question whether the dependence on $1/\epsilon$ can be
improved from quasi-polynomial to polynomial. Our techniques include an
efficient local simulation for approximating the outcome of a global (almost)
forest-decomposition algorithm as well as a tailored procedure of edge
sampling.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the problem of computing a sparse subgraph of a
weighted directed graph such that the exact distances from a designated source
vertex to all other vertices are preserved under bounded weight increment.
Finding a small sized subgraph that preserves distances between any pair of
vertices is a well studied problem. Since in the real world any network is
prone to failures, it is natural to study the fault tolerant version of the
above problem. Unfortunately, it turns out that there may not always exist such
a sparse subgraph even under single edge failure [Demetrescu \emph{et al.}
'08]. However in real applications it is not always the case that a link (edge)
in a network becomes completely faulty. Instead, it can happen that some links
become more congested which can easily be captured by increasing weight on the
corresponding edges. Thus it makes sense to try to construct a sparse distance
preserving subgraph under the above weight increment model. To the best of our
knowledge this problem has not been studied so far. In this paper we show that
given any weighted directed graph with $n$ vertices and a source vertex, one
can construct a subgraph that contains at most $e \cdot (k-1)!2^kn$ many edges
such that it preserves distances between the source and all other vertices as
long as the total weight increment is bounded by $k$ and we are allowed to have
only integer valued (can be negative) weight on each edge and also weight of an
edge can only be increased by some positive integer. Next we show a lower bound
of $c\cdot 2^kn$, for some constant $c \ge 5/4$, on the size of the subgraph.
We also argue that restriction of integer valued weight and integer valued
weight increment are actually essential by showing that if we remove any one of
these two restrictions we may need to store $\Omega(n^2)$ edges to preserve
distances.

 <dc:description>  Techniques for automatically designing deep neural network architectures such
as reinforcement learning based approaches have recently shown promising
results. However, their success is based on vast computational resources (e.g.
hundreds of GPUs), making them difficult to be widely used. A noticeable
limitation is that they still design and train each network from scratch during
the exploration of the architecture space, which is highly inefficient. In this
paper, we propose a new framework toward efficient architecture search by
exploring the architecture space based on the current network and reusing its
weights. We employ a reinforcement learning agent as the meta-controller, whose
action is to grow the network depth or layer width with function-preserving
transformations. As such, the previously validated networks can be reused for
further exploration, thus saves a large amount of computational cost. We apply
our method to explore the architecture space of the plain convolutional neural
networks (no skip-connections, branching etc.) on image benchmark datasets
(CIFAR-10, SVHN) with restricted computational resources (5 GPUs). Our method
can design highly competitive networks that outperform existing networks using
the same design scheme. On CIFAR-10, our model without skip-connections
achieves 4.23\% test error rate, exceeding a vast majority of modern
architectures and approaching DenseNet. Furthermore, by applying our method to
explore the DenseNet architecture space, we are able to achieve more accurate
networks with fewer parameters.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of compressed sensing with asymmetric prior information,
as motivated by networking applications such as identity tracking in an
Internet-of-Things environment. We focus on the scenario in which a
resource-limited encoder needs to report a small subset $S$ from a universe of
$N$ objects to a more powerful decoder. The distinguishing feature of our model
is asymmetry: the subset $S$ is an i.i.d. sample from a prior distribution
$\mu$, and $\mu$ is only known to the decoder. This scenario implies that the
encoder must use an oblivious compression scheme which can, nonetheless,
achieve communication comparable to the entropy rate $|S| \cdot H(\mu)$, the
standard benchmark when both encoder and decoder have access to the prior $\mu$
(as achieved by the Huffman code).
  We first show that in order to exploit the prior $\mu$ in a non-trivial way
in such asymmetric information scenario, the compression scheme must be
randomized. This stands in contrast to the symmetric case (when both the
encoder and decoder know $\mu$), where the Huffman code provides a near-optimal
deterministic solution. On the other hand, a rather simple argument shows that,
when $|S|=k$, a random linear code achieves essentially optimal communication
rate of $O(k\cdot H(\mu))$ bits, nearly-matching the communication benchmark in
the symmetric case. Alas, the resulting scheme has prohibitive decoding time:
about ${N\choose k} \approx (N/k)^k$.
  Our main result is a computationally efficient and linear coding scheme,
which achieves an $O(\lg\lg N)$-competitive communication ratio compared to the
optimal benchmark, and runs in $\text{poly}(N,k)$ time. Our &quot;multi-level&quot;
coding scheme uses a combination of hashing and syndrome-decoding of
Reed-Solomon codes, and relies on viewing the (unknown) prior $\mu$ as a rather
small convex combination of uniform (&quot;flat&quot;) distributions.

 <dc:description>  Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is an important technology within Music
Information Retrieval. Deep learning models show promising results on OMR
tasks, but symbol-level annotated data sets of sufficient size to train such
models are not available and difficult to develop. We present a deep learning
architecture called a Convolutional Sequence-to-Sequence model to both move
towards an end-to-end trainable OMR pipeline, and apply a learning process that
trains on full sentences of sheet music instead of individually labeled
symbols. The model is trained and evaluated on a human generated data set, with
various image augmentations based on real-world scenarios. This data set is the
first publicly available set in OMR research with sufficient size to train and
evaluate deep learning models. With the introduced augmentations a pitch
recognition accuracy of 81% and a duration accuracy of 94% is achieved,
resulting in a note level accuracy of 80%. Finally, the model is compared to
commercially available methods, showing a large improvements over these
applications.

 <dc:description>  Despite the close relationship between speech perception and production,
research in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech synthesis
(TTS) has progressed more or less independently without exerting much mutual
influence on each other. In human communication, on the other hand, a
closed-loop speech chain mechanism with auditory feedback from the speaker's
mouth to her ear is crucial. In this paper, we take a step further and develop
a closed-loop speech chain model based on deep learning. The
sequence-to-sequence model in close-loop architecture allows us to train our
model on the concatenation of both labeled and unlabeled data. While ASR
transcribes the unlabeled speech features, TTS attempts to reconstruct the
original speech waveform based on the text from ASR. In the opposite direction,
ASR also attempts to reconstruct the original text transcription given the
synthesized speech. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep
learning model that integrates human speech perception and production
behaviors. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach
significantly improved the performance more than separate systems that were
only trained with labeled data.

 <dc:description>  The GANs promote an adversarive game to approximate complex and jointed
example probability. The networks driven by noise generate fake examples to
approximate realistic data distributions. Later the conditional GAN merges
prior-conditions as input in order to transfer attribute vectors to the
corresponding data. However, the CGAN is not designed to deal with the high
dimension conditions since indirect guide of the learning is inefficiency. In
this paper, we proposed a network ResGAN to generate fine images in terms of
extremely degenerated images. The coarse images aligned to attributes are
embedded as the generator inputs and classifier labels. In generative network,
a straight path similar to the Resnet is cohered to directly transfer the
coarse images to the higher layers. And adversarial training is circularly
implemented to prevent degeneration of the generated images. Experimental
results of applying the ResGAN to datasets MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and CELEBA show
its higher accuracy to the state-of-art GANs.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new probabilistic approach to embedding message text on
an elliptic curve, by using the concept of the RSA Algorithm and its security,
and such approach allows us discovering the message from the point, only
according to the security of the RSA Algorithm. By mixing between the concept
of this approach and the concept of EC-ELGamal Cryptographic System, we have
built a cryptographic System and we named it 'EC-RSA-ELGamal'

 <dc:description>  In this project, we have extended previous work on the formalization of the
process algebra CCS in HOL4. We have added full supports on weak bisimulation
equivalence and observation congruence (rooted weak equivalence), with related
definitions, theorems and algebraic laws. Some deep lemmas were also formally
proved in this project, including Deng Lemma, Hennessy Lemma and several
versions of the &quot;Coarsest congruence contained in weak equivalence&quot;. For the
last theorem, we have proved the full version (without any assumption) based on
ordinals.

 <dc:title>An Accelerated Testing Approach for Automated Vehicles with Background
  Traffic Described by Joint Distributions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new framework based on joint statistical models for
evaluating risks of automated vehicles in a naturalistic driving environment.
The previous studies on the Accelerated Evaluation for automated vehicles are
extended from multi-independent-variate models to joint statistics. The
proposed toolkit includes exploration of the rare event (e.g. crash) sets and
construction of accelerated distributions for Gaussian Mixture models using
Importance Sampling techniques. Furthermore, the monotonic property is used to
avoid the curse of dimensionality introduced by the joint distributions.
Simulation results show that the procedure is effective and has a great
potential to reduce the test cost for automated vehicles.

 <dc:description>  It is quite exceptional, if it ever happens, that a new conceptual domain be
built from scratch. Usually, it is developed and mastered in interaction, both
positive and negative, with other more operational existing domains. Few
reasoning mechanisms have been proposed to account for the interplay of
different conceptual domains and the transfer of information from one to
another. Analogical reasoning is one, blending is another. This paper presents
a new mechanism, called 'tunnel effect', that may explain, in part, how
scientists and students reason while constructing a new conceptual domain. One
experimental study with high school students and analyses from the history of
science, particularly about the birth of classical thermodynamics, provide
evidence and illustrate this mechanism. The knowledge organization, processes
and conditions for its appearance are detailed and put into the perspective of
a computational model. Specifically, we put forward the hypothesis that two
levels of knowledge, notional and conceptual, cooperate in the scientific
discovery process when a new conceptual domain is being built. The type of
conceptual learning that can be associated with tunnel effect is discussed and
a thorough comparison is made with analogical reasoning in order to underline
the main features of the new proposed mechanism.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new network architecture for Chinese typography
transformation based on deep learning. The architecture consists of two
sub-networks: (1)a fully convolutional network(FCN) aiming at transferring
specified typography style to another in condition of preserving structure
information; (2)an adversarial network aiming at generating more realistic
strokes in some details. Unlike models proposed before 2012 relying on the
complex segmentation of Chinese components or strokes, our model treats every
Chinese character as an inseparable image, so pre-processing or
post-preprocessing are abandoned. Besides, our model adopts end-to-end training
without pre-trained used in other deep models. The experiments demonstrates
that our model can synthesize realistic-looking target typography from any
source typography both on printed style and handwriting style.

 <dc:description>  Many recent machine learning approaches used in medical imaging are highly
reliant on large amounts of image and ground truth data. In the context of
object segmentation, pixel-wise annotations are extremely expensive to collect,
especially in video and 3D volumes. To reduce this annotation burden, we
propose a novel framework to allow annotators to simply observe the object to
segment and record where they have looked at with a \$200 eye gaze tracker. Our
method then estimates pixel-wise probabilities for the presence of the object
throughout the sequence from which we train a classifier in semi-supervised
setting using a novel Expected Exponential loss function. We show that our
framework provides superior performances on a wide range of medical image
settings compared to existing strategies and that our method can be combined
with current crowd-sourcing paradigms as well.

 <dc:title>Polylogarithmic Approximation Algorithms for

 <dc:description>  For a family of graphs $\cal F$, the canonical Weighted $\cal F$ Vertex
Deletion problem is defined as follows: given an $n$-vertex undirected graph
$G$ and a weight function $w: V(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, find a minimum weight
subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ such that $G-S$ belongs to $\cal F$. We devise a
recursive scheme to obtain $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$-approximation algorithms for such
problems, building upon the classic technique of finding balanced separators in
a graph. Roughly speaking, our scheme applies to problems where an optimum
solution $S$, together with a well-structured set $X$, form a balanced
separator of $G$. We obtain the first $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$-approximation
algorithms for the following problems.
  * We give an $O(\log^2n)$-factor approximation algorithm for Weighted Chordal
Vertex Deletion (WCVD), the vertex deletion problem to the family of chordal
graphs. On the way, we also obtain a constant factor approximation algorithm
for Multicut on chordal graphs.
  * We give an $O(\log^3n)$-factor approximation algorithm for Weighted
Distance Hereditary Vertex Deletion (WDHVD). This is the vertex deletion
problem to the family of distance hereditary graphs, or equivalently, the
family of graphs of rankwidth 1.
  Our methods also allow us to obtain in a clean fashion a
$O(\log^{1.5}n)$-approximation algorithm for the Weighted $\cal F$ Vertex
Deletion problem when $\cal F$ is a minor closed family excluding at least one
planar graph. For the unweighted version of the problem constant factor
approximation algorithms are were known~[Fomin et al., FOCS~2012], while for
the weighted version considered here an $O(\log n \log\log n)$-approximation
algorithm follows from~[Bansal et al., SODA~2017]. We believe that our
recursive scheme can be applied to obtain $O(\log^{O(1)}n)$-approximation
algorithms for many other problems as well.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have demonstrated very promising performance on accurate
segmentation of challenging organs (e.g., pancreas) in abdominal CT and MRI
scans. The current deep learning approaches conduct pancreas segmentation by
processing sequences of 2D image slices independently through deep, dense
per-pixel masking for each image, without explicitly enforcing spatial
consistency constraint on segmentation of successive slices. We propose a new
convolutional/recurrent neural network architecture to address the contextual
learning and segmentation consistency problem. A deep convolutional sub-network
is first designed and pre-trained from scratch. The output layer of this
network module is then connected to recurrent layers and can be fine-tuned for
contextual learning, in an end-to-end manner. Our recurrent sub-network is a
type of Long short-term memory (LSTM) network that performs segmentation on an
image by integrating its neighboring slice segmentation predictions, in the
form of a dependent sequence processing. Additionally, a novel
segmentation-direct loss function (named Jaccard Loss) is proposed and deep
networks are trained to optimize Jaccard Index (JI) directly. Extensive
experiments are conducted to validate our proposed deep models, on quantitative
pancreas segmentation using both CT and MRI scans. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art work on CT [11] and MRI pancreas segmentation [1],
respectively.

 <dc:description>  Most state-of-the-art information extraction approaches rely on token-level
labels to find the areas of interest in text. Unfortunately, these labels are
time-consuming and costly to create, and consequently, not available for many
real-life IE tasks. To make matters worse, token-level labels are usually not
the desired output, but just an intermediary step. End-to-end (E2E) models,
which take raw text as input and produce the desired output directly, need not
depend on token-level labels. We propose an E2E model based on pointer
networks, which can be trained directly on pairs of raw input and output text.
We evaluate our model on the ATIS data set, MIT restaurant corpus and the MIT
movie corpus and compare to neural baselines that do use token-level labels. We
achieve competitive results, within a few percentage points of the baselines,
showing the feasibility of E2E information extraction without the need for
token-level labels. This opens up new possibilities, as for many tasks
currently addressed by human extractors, raw input and output data are
available, but not token-level labels.

 <dc:description>  Music genres allow to categorize musical items that share common
characteristics. Although these categories are not mutually exclusive, most
related research is traditionally focused on classifying tracks into a single
class. Furthermore, these categories (e.g., Pop, Rock) tend to be too broad for
certain applications. In this work we aim to expand this task by categorizing
musical items into multiple and fine-grained labels, using three different data
modalities: audio, text, and images. To this end we present MuMu, a new dataset
of more than 31k albums classified into 250 genre classes. For every album we
have collected the cover image, text reviews, and audio tracks. Additionally,
we propose an approach for multi-label genre classification based on the
combination of feature embeddings learned with state-of-the-art deep learning
methodologies. Experiments show major differences between modalities, which not
only introduce new baselines for multi-label genre classification, but also
suggest that combining them yields improved results.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k$, the Chordal Vertex Deletion (CVD)
problem asks whether there exists a subset $U\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most
$k$ that hits all induced cycles of size at least 4. The existence of a
polynomial kernel for CVD was a well-known open problem in the field of
Parameterized Complexity. Recently, Jansen and Pilipczuk resolved this question
affirmatively by designing a polynomial kernel for CVD of size
$O(k^{161}\log^{58}k)$, and asked whether one can design a kernel of size
$O(k^{10})$. While we do not completely resolve this question, we design a
significantly smaller kernel of size $O(k^{12}\log^{10}k)$, inspired by the
$O(k^2)$-size kernel for Feedback Vertex Set. Furthermore, we introduce the
notion of the independence degree of a vertex, which is our main conceptual
contribution.

 <dc:description>  The ultimate objective of medical cyber-physical systems is to enhance the
safety and effectiveness of patient care. To ensure safe and effective care
during emergency patient transfer from rural areas to center tertiary
hospitals, reliable and real-time communication is essential. Unfortunately,
real-time monitoring of patients involves transmission of various clinical
multimedia data including videos, medical images, and vital signs, which
requires use of mobile network with high-fidelity communication bandwidth.
However, the wireless networks along the roads in rural areas range from 4G to
2G to low speed satellite links, which poses a significant challenge to
transmit critical patient information.
  In this paper, we present a bandwidth-compliant criticality-aware system for
transmission of massive clinical multimedia data adaptive to varying bandwidths
during patient transport. Model-based clinical automata are used to determine
the criticality of clinical multimedia data. We borrow concepts from DASH, and
propose physiology-aware adaptation techniques to transmit more critical
clinical data with higher fidelity in response to changes in disease, clinical
states, and bandwidth condition. In collaboration with Carle's ambulance
service center, we develop a bandwidth profiler, and use it as proof of concept
to support our experiments. Our preliminary evaluation results show that our
solutions ensure that most critical patient's clinical data are communicated
with higher fidelity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the problem of learning a shallow artificial neural
network that best fits a training data set. We study this problem in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of observations are fewer than the
number of parameters in the model. We show that with quadratic activations the
optimization landscape of training such shallow neural networks has certain
favorable characteristics that allow globally optimal models to be found
efficiently using a variety of local search heuristics. This result holds for
an arbitrary training data of input/output pairs. For differentiable activation
functions we also show that gradient descent, when suitably initialized,
converges at a linear rate to a globally optimal model. This result focuses on
a realizable model where the inputs are chosen i.i.d. from a Gaussian
distribution and the labels are generated according to planted weight
coefficients.

 <dc:description>  The network alignment problem asks for the best correspondence between two
given graphs, so that the largest possible number of edges are matched. This
problem appears in many scientific problems (like the study of protein-protein
interactions) and it is very closely related to the quadratic assignment
problem which has graph isomorphism, traveling salesman and minimum bisection
problems as particular cases. The graph matching problem is NP-hard in general.
However, under some restrictive models for the graphs, algorithms can
approximate the alignment efficiently. In that spirit the recent work by Feizi
and collaborators introduce EigenAlign, a fast spectral method with convergence
guarantees for Erd\H{o}s-Reny\'i graphs. In this work we propose the algorithm
Projected Power Alignment, which is a projected power iteration version of
EigenAlign. We numerically show it improves the recovery rates of EigenAlign
and we describe the theory that may be used to provide performance guarantees
for Projected Power Alignment.

 <dc:description>  The automatic segmentation of retinal layer structures enables
clinically-relevant quantification and monitoring of eye disorders over time in
OCT imaging. Eyes with late-stage diseases are particularly challenging to
segment, as their shape is highly warped due to pathological biomarkers. In
this context, we propose a novel fully Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture which combines dilated residual blocks in an asymmetric U-shape
configuration, and can segment multiple layers of highly pathological eyes in
one shot. We validate our approach on a dataset of late-stage AMD patients and
demonstrate lower computational costs and higher performance compared to other
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Even though transitivity is a central structural feature of social networks,
its influence on epidemic spread on coevolving networks has remained relatively
unexplored. Here we introduce and study an adaptive SIS epidemic model wherein
the infection and network coevolve with non-trivial probability to close
triangles during edge rewiring, leading to substantial reinforcement of network
transitivity. This new model provides a unique opportunity to study the role of
transitivity in altering the SIS dynamics on a coevolving network. Using
numerical simulations and Approximate Master Equations (AME), we identify and
examine a rich set of dynamical features in the new model. In many cases, the
AME including transitivity reinforcement provide accurate predictions of
stationary-state disease prevalence and network degree distributions.
Furthermore, for some parameter settings, the AME accurately trace the temporal
evolution of the system. We show that higher transitivity reinforcement in the
model leads to lower levels of infective individuals in the population; when
closing a triangle is the only rewiring mechanism. These methods and results
may be useful in developing ideas and modeling strategies for controlling SIS
type epidemics.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss the generation of symbols (and alphabets) based on
specific user requirements (medium, priorities, type of information that needs
to be conveyed). A framework for the generation of alphabets is proposed, and
its use for the generation of a shorthand writing system is explored. We
discuss the possible use of machine learning and genetic algorithms to gather
inputs for generation of such alphabets and for optimization of already
generated ones. The alphabets generated using such methods may be used in very
different fields, from the creation of synthetic languages and constructed
scripts to the creation of sensible commands for multimodal interaction through
Human-Computer Interfaces, such as mouse gestures, touchpads, body gestures,
eye-tracking cameras, and brain-computing Interfaces, especially in
applications for elderly care and people with disabilities.

 <dc:description>  Recently, due to rapid development of information and communication
technologies, the data are created and consumed in the avalanche way.
Distributed computing create preconditions for analyzing and processing such
Big Data by distributing the computations among a number of compute nodes. In
this work, performance of distributed computing environments on the basis of
Hadoop and Spark frameworks is estimated for real and virtual versions of
clusters. As a test task, we chose the classic use case of word counting in
texts of various sizes. It was found that the running times grow very fast with
the dataset size and faster than a power function even. As to the real and
virtual versions of cluster implementations, this tendency is the similar for
both Hadoop and Spark frameworks. Moreover, speedup values decrease
significantly with the growth of dataset size, especially for virtual version
of cluster configuration. The problem of growing data generated by IoT and
multimodal (visual, sound, tactile, neuro and brain-computing, muscle and eye
tracking, etc.) interaction channels is presented. In the context of this
problem, the current observations as to the running times and speedup on Hadoop
and Spark frameworks in real and virtual cluster configurations can be very
useful for the proper scaling-up and efficient job management, especially for
machine learning and Deep Learning applications, where Big Data are widely
present.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning (deep structured learning, hierarchi- cal learning or deep
machine learning) is a branch of machine learning based on a set of algorithms
that attempt to model high- level abstractions in data by using multiple
processing layers with complex structures or otherwise composed of multiple
non-linear transformations. In this paper, we present the results of testing
neural networks architectures on H2O platform for various activation functions,
stopping metrics, and other parameters of machine learning algorithm. It was
demonstrated for the use case of MNIST database of handwritten digits in
single-threaded mode that blind selection of these parameters can hugely
increase (by 2-3 orders) the runtime without the significant increase of
precision. This result can have crucial influence for opitmization of available
and new machine learning methods, especially for image recognition problems.

 <dc:description>  In this note we derive the backward (automatic) differentiation (adjoint
[automatic] differentiation) for an algorithm containing a conditional
expectation operator. As an example we consider the backward algorithm as it is
used in Bermudan product valuation, but the method is applicable in full
generality.
  The method relies on three simple properties: 1) a forward or backward
(automatic) differentiation of an algorithm containing a conditional
expectation operator results in a linear combination of the conditional
expectation operators; 2) the differential of an expectation is the expectation
of the differential $\frac{d}{dx} E(Y) = E(\frac{d}{dx}Y)$; 3) if we are only
interested in the expectation of the final result (as we are in all valuation
problems), we may use $E(A \cdot E(B\vert\mathcal{F})) = E(E(A\vert\mathcal{F})
\cdot B)$, i.e., instead of applying the (conditional) expectation operator to
a function of the underlying random variable (continuation values), it may be
applied to the adjoint differential. \end{enumerate}
  The methodology not only allows for a very clean and simple implementation,
but also offers the ability to use different conditional expectation estimators
in the valuation and the differentiation.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Can we evolve better training data for machine learning algorithms? To
investigate this question we use population-based optimisation algorithms to
generate artificial surrogate training data for naive Bayes for regression. We
demonstrate that the generalisation performance of naive Bayes for regression
models is enhanced by training them on the artificial data as opposed to the
real data. These results are important for two reasons. Firstly, naive Bayes
models are simple and interpretable but frequently underperform compared to
more complex &quot;black box&quot; models, and therefore new methods of enhancing
accuracy are called for. Secondly, the idea of using the real training data
indirectly in the construction of the artificial training data, as opposed to
directly for model training, is a novel twist on the usual machine learning
paradigm.

 <dc:description>  Management of chronic diseases such as heart failure (HF) is a major public
health problem. A standard approach to managing chronic diseases by medical
community is to have a committee of experts develop guidelines that all
physicians should follow. Due to their complexity, these guidelines are
difficult to implement and are adopted slowly by the medical community at
large. We have developed a physician advisory system that codes the entire set
of clinical practice guidelines for managing HF using answer set
programming(ASP). In this paper we show how abductive reasoning can be deployed
to find missing symptoms and conditions that the patient must exhibit in order
for a treatment prescribed by a physician to work effectively. Thus, if a
physician does not make an appropriate recommendation or makes a non-adherent
recommendation, our system will advise the physician about symptoms and
conditions that must be in effect for that recommendation to apply. It is under
consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

 <dc:description>  Our work focuses on the problem of predicting the transfer of pediatric
patients from the general ward of a hospital to the pediatric intensive care
unit. Using data collected over 5.5 years from the electronic health records of
two medical facilities, we develop classifiers based on adaptive boosting and
gradient tree boosting. We further combine these learned classifiers into an
ensemble model and compare its performance to a modified pediatric early
warning score (PEWS) baseline that relies on expert defined guidelines. To
gauge model generalizability, we perform an inter-facility evaluation where we
train our algorithm on data from one facility and perform evaluation on a
hidden test dataset from a separate facility. We show that improvements are
witnessed over the PEWS baseline in accuracy (0.77 vs. 0.69), sensitivity (0.80
vs. 0.68), specificity (0.74 vs. 0.70) and AUROC (0.85 vs. 0.73).

 <dc:title>Query-Focused Video Summarization: Dataset, Evaluation, and A Memory
  Network Based Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed a resurgence of interest in video summarization.
However, one of the main obstacles to the research on video summarization is
the user subjectivity - users have various preferences over the summaries. The
subjectiveness causes at least two problems. First, no single video summarizer
fits all users unless it interacts with and adapts to the individual users.
Second, it is very challenging to evaluate the performance of a video
summarizer.
  To tackle the first problem, we explore the recently proposed query-focused
video summarization which introduces user preferences in the form of text
queries about the video into the summarization process. We propose a memory
network parameterized sequential determinantal point process in order to attend
the user query onto different video frames and shots. To address the second
challenge, we contend that a good evaluation metric for video summarization
should focus on the semantic information that humans can perceive rather than
the visual features or temporal overlaps. To this end, we collect dense
per-video-shot concept annotations, compile a new dataset, and suggest an
efficient evaluation method defined upon the concept annotations. We conduct
extensive experiments contrasting our video summarizer to existing ones and
present detailed analyses about the dataset and the new evaluation method.

 <dc:description>  This paper exploits a memory-augmented neural network to predict accurate
answers to visual questions, even when those answers occur rarely in the
training set. The memory network incorporates both internal and external memory
blocks and selectively pays attention to each training exemplar. We show that
memory-augmented neural networks are able to maintain a relatively long-term
memory of scarce training exemplars, which is important for visual question
answering due to the heavy-tailed distribution of answers in a general VQA
setting. Experimental results on two large scale benchmark datasets show the
favorable performance of the proposed algorithm with a comparison to state of
the art.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a kernel subspace clustering method that can handle
non-linear models. In contrast to recent kernel subspace clustering methods
which use predefined kernels, we propose to learn a low-rank kernel matrix,
with which mapped data in feature space are not only low-rank but also
self-expressive. In this manner, the low-dimensional subspace structures of the
(implicitly) mapped data are retained and manifested in the high-dimensional
feature space. We evaluate the proposed method extensively on both motion
segmentation and image clustering benchmarks, and obtain superior results,
outperforming the kernel subspace clustering method that uses standard
kernels[Patel 2014] and other state-of-the-art linear subspace clustering
methods.

 <dc:description>  We present new practical local differentially private heavy hitters
algorithms achieving optimal or near-optimal worst-case error and running time
-- TreeHist and Bitstogram. In both algorithms, server running time is $\tilde
O(n)$ and user running time is $\tilde O(1)$, hence improving on the prior
state-of-the-art result of Bassily and Smith [STOC 2015] requiring $O(n^{5/2})$
server time and $O(n^{3/2})$ user time. With a typically large number of
participants in local algorithms ($n$ in the millions), this reduction in time
complexity, in particular at the user side, is crucial for making locally
private heavy hitters algorithms usable in practice. We implemented Algorithm
TreeHist to verify our theoretical analysis and compared its performance with
the performance of Google's RAPPOR code.

 <dc:description>  Instead of a monolithic programming language trying to cover all features of
interest, some programming systems are designed by combining together simpler
languages that cooperate to cover the same feature space. This can improve
usability by making each part simpler than the whole, but there is a risk of
abstraction leaks from one language to another that would break expectations of
the users familiar with only one or some of the involved languages.
  We propose a formal specification for what it means for a given language in a
multi-language system to be usable without leaks: it should embed into the
multi-language in a fully abstract way, that is, its contextual equivalence
should be unchanged in the larger system.
  To demonstrate our proposed design principle and formal specification
criterion, we design a multi-language programming system that combines an
ML-like statically typed functional language and another language with linear
types and linear state. Our goal is to cover a good part of the expressiveness
of languages that mix functional programming and linear state (ownership), at
only a fraction of the complexity. We prove that the embedding of ML into the
multi-language system is fully abstract: functional programmers should not fear
abstraction leaks. We show examples of combined programs demonstrating in-place
memory updates and safe resource handling, and an implementation extending
OCaml with our linear language.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which
bandits are streamed one at a time to the player, and at each point, the player
can either choose to pull the current bandit or move on to the next bandit.
Once a player has moved on from a bandit, they may never visit it again, which
is a crucial difference between our problem and classic multi-armed bandit
problems. In this online context, we study Bernoulli bandits (bandits with
payout Ber($p_i$) for some underlying mean $p_i$) with underlying means drawn
i.i.d. from various distributions, including the uniform distribution, and in
general, all distributions that have a CDF satisfying certain differentiability
conditions near zero. In all cases, we suggest several strategies and
investigate their expected performance. Furthermore, we bound the performance
of any optimal strategy and show that the strategies we have suggested are
indeed optimal up to a constant factor. We also investigate the case where the
distribution from which the underlying means are drawn is not known ahead of
time. We again, are able to suggest algorithms that are optimal up to a
constant factor for this case, given certain mild conditions on the universe of
distributions.

 <dc:title>Tracking as Online Decision-Making: Learning a Policy from Streaming

 <dc:creator>Supancic III, James Steven</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ramanan, Deva</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We formulate tracking as an online decision-making process, where a tracking
agent must follow an object despite ambiguous image frames and a limited
computational budget. Crucially, the agent must decide where to look in the
upcoming frames, when to reinitialize because it believes the target has been
lost, and when to update its appearance model for the tracked object. Such
decisions are typically made heuristically. Instead, we propose to learn an
optimal decision-making policy by formulating tracking as a partially
observable decision-making process (POMDP). We learn policies with deep
reinforcement learning algorithms that need supervision (a reward signal) only
when the track has gone awry. We demonstrate that sparse rewards allow us to
quickly train on massive datasets, several orders of magnitude more than past
work. Interestingly, by treating the data source of Internet videos as
unlimited streams, we both learn and evaluate our trackers in a single, unified
computational stream.

 <dc:description>  Visual signals in a video can be divided into content and motion. While
content specifies which objects are in the video, motion describes their
dynamics. Based on this prior, we propose the Motion and Content decomposed
Generative Adversarial Network (MoCoGAN) framework for video generation. The
proposed framework generates a video by mapping a sequence of random vectors to
a sequence of video frames. Each random vector consists of a content part and a
motion part. While the content part is kept fixed, the motion part is realized
as a stochastic process. To learn motion and content decomposition in an
unsupervised manner, we introduce a novel adversarial learning scheme utilizing
both image and video discriminators. Extensive experimental results on several
challenging datasets with qualitative and quantitative comparison to the
state-of-the-art approaches, verify effectiveness of the proposed framework. In
addition, we show that MoCoGAN allows one to generate videos with same content
but different motion as well as videos with different content and same motion.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Both bottom-up and top-down strategies have been used for neural
transition-based constituent parsing. The parsing strategies differ in terms of
the order in which they recognize productions in the derivation tree, where
bottom-up strategies and top-down strategies take post-order and pre-order
traversal over trees, respectively. Bottom-up parsers benefit from rich
features from readily built partial parses, but lack lookahead guidance in the
parsing process; top-down parsers benefit from non-local guidance for local
decisions, but rely on a strong encoder over the input to predict a constituent
hierarchy before its construction.To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel
parsing system based on in-order traversal over syntactic trees, designing a
set of transition actions to find a compromise between bottom-up constituent
information and top-down lookahead information. Based on stack-LSTM, our
psycholinguistically motivated constituent parsing system achieves 91.8 F1 on
WSJ benchmark. Furthermore, the system achieves 93.6 F1 with supervised
reranking and 94.2 F1 with semi-supervised reranking, which are the best
results on the WSJ benchmark.

 <dc:description>  An approach for coalition formation of multi-agent pursuit based on neural
network and AGRMF model is proposed.This paper constructs a novel neural work
called AGRMF-ANN which consists of feature extraction part and group generation
part. On one hand,The convolutional layers of feature extraction part can
abstract the features of agent group role membership function(AGRMF) for all of
the groups,on the other hand,those features will be fed to the group generation
part based on self-organizing map(SOM) layer which is used to group the
pursuers with similar features in the same group. Besides, we also come up the
group attractiveness function(GAF) to evaluate the quality of groups and the
pursuers contribution in order to adjust the main ability indicators of AGRMF
and other weight of all neural network. The simulation experiment showed that
this proposal can improve the effectiveness of coalition formation for
multi-agent pursuit and ability to adopt pursuit-evasion problem with the scale
of pursuer team growing.

 <dc:description>  Informational dependence between statistical or quantum subsystems can be
described with Fisher matrix or Fubini-Study metric obtained from variations of
the sample/configuration space coordinates. Using these non-covariant objects
as macroscopic constraints we consider statistical ensembles over the space of
classical probability distributions or quantum wave-functions. The ensembles
are covariantized using dual field theories with either complex or real scalar
fields identified with complex wave-functions or square root of probabilities.
We argue that a full space-time covariance on a field theory side is dual to
local computations (defined in terms of parallel computing) on the information
theory side. We define a fully covariant information-computation tensor and
show that it must satisfy conservation equations. Then we switch to a
thermodynamic description and argue that the (inverse of) space-time metric
tensor is a conjugate thermodynamic variable to the ensemble-averaged
information-computation tensor. In the equilibrium the entropy production
vanishes and the metric is not dynamical, but away from equilibrium the entropy
production gives rise to an emergent dynamics of the metric. This dynamics can
be described by expanding the entropy production into products of generalized
forces (derivatives of metric) and conjugate fluxes. Near equilibrium these
fluxes are given by an Onsager tensor contracted with generalized forces and on
the grounds of time-reversal symmetry the Onsager tensor is expected to be
symmetric. We show that a particularly simple and highly symmetric form of the
Onsager tensor gives rise to the Einstein-Hilbert term. This proves that
general relativity is equivalent to a theory of non-equilibrium
(thermo)dynamics of the metric which is expected to break down far away from
equilibrium where the symmetries of the Onsager tensor are to be broken.

 <dc:description>  Recent works on representation learning for graph structured data
predominantly focus on learning distributed representations of graph
substructures such as nodes and subgraphs. However, many graph analytics tasks
such as graph classification and clustering require representing entire graphs
as fixed length feature vectors. While the aforementioned approaches are
naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the
most effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph kernels use
handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are
hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation,
in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn
data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's
embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence,
they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification,
clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our
experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that
graph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering
accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are
competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.

 <dc:description>  Rigid structure-from-motion (RSfM) and non-rigid structure-from-motion
(NRSfM) have long been treated in the literature as separate (different)
problems. Inspired by a previous work which solved directly for 3D scene
structure by factoring the relative camera poses out, we revisit the principle
of &quot;maximizing rigidity&quot; in structure-from-motion literature, and develop a
unified theory which is applicable to both rigid and non-rigid structure
reconstruction in a rigidity-agnostic way. We formulate these problems as a
convex semi-definite program, imposing constraints that seek to apply the
principle of minimizing non-rigidity. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of
the approach, with state-of-the-art accuracy on various 3D reconstruction
problems.

 <dc:description>  Modeling physiological time-series in ICU is of high clinical importance.
However, data collected within ICU are irregular in time and often contain
missing measurements. Since absence of a measure would signify its lack of
importance, the missingness is indeed informative and might reflect the
decision making by the clinician. Here we propose a deep learning architecture
that can effectively handle these challenges for predicting ICU mortality
outcomes. The model is based on Long Short-Term Memory, and has layered
attention mechanisms. At the sensing layer, the model decides whether to
observe and incorporate parts of the current measurements. At the reasoning
layer, evidences across time steps are weighted and combined. The model is
evaluated on the PhysioNet 2012 dataset showing competitive and interpretable
results.

 <dc:description>  Proton computed tomography (pCT) is a novel medical imaging modality for
mapping the distribution of proton relative stopping power (RSP) in medical
objects of interest. Compared to conventional X-ray computed tomography, where
range uncertainty margins are around 3.5%, pCT has the potential to provide
more accurate measurements to within 1%. This improved efficiency will be
beneficial to proton-therapy planning and pre-treatment verification. A
prototype pCT imaging device has recently been developed capable of rapidly
acquiring low-dose proton radiographs of head-sized objects. We have also
developed an advanced, fast image reconstruction software based on distributed
computing that utilizes parallel processors and graphical processing units. The
combination of fast data acquisition and fast image reconstruction will enable
the availability of RSP images within minutes for use in clinical settings. The
performance of our image reconstruction software has been evaluated using data
collected by the prototype pCT scanner from several phantoms.

 <dc:description>  Today's conversational agents are restricted to simple standalone commands.
In this paper, we present Iris, an agent that draws on human conversational
strategies to combine commands, allowing it to perform more complex tasks that
it has not been explicitly designed to support: for example, composing one
command to &quot;plot a histogram&quot; with another to first &quot;log-transform the data&quot;.
To enable this complexity, we introduce a domain specific language that
transforms commands into automata that Iris can compose, sequence, and execute
dynamically by interacting with a user through natural language, as well as a
conversational type system that manages what kinds of commands can be combined.
We have designed Iris to help users with data science tasks, a domain that
requires support for command combination. In evaluation, we find that data
scientists complete a predictive modeling task significantly faster (2.6 times
speedup) with Iris than a modern non-conversational programming environment.
Iris supports the same kinds of commands as today's agents, but empowers users
to weave together these commands to accomplish complex goals.

 <dc:description>  Parameterized complexity theory has enabled a refined classification of the
difficulty of NP-hard optimization problems on graphs with respect to key
structural properties, and so to a better understanding of their true
difficulties. More recently, hardness results for problems in P were achieved
using reasonable complexity theoretic assumptions such as: Strong Exponential
Time Hypothesis (SETH), 3SUM and All-Pairs Shortest-Paths (APSP). According to
these assumptions, many graph theoretic problems do not admit truly
subquadratic algorithms, nor even truly subcubic algorithms (Williams and
Williams, FOCS 2010 and Abboud, Grandoni, Williams, SODA 2015). A central
technique used to tackle the difficulty of the above mentioned problems is
fixed-parameter algorithms for polynomial-time problems with polynomial
dependency in the fixed parameter (P-FPT). This technique was introduced by
Abboud, Williams and Wang in SODA 2016 and continued by Husfeldt (IPEC 2016)
and Fomin et al. (SODA 2017), using the treewidth as a parameter. Applying this
technique to clique-width, another important graph parameter, remained to be
done. In this paper we study several graph theoretic problems for which
hardness results exist such as cycle problems (triangle detection, triangle
counting, girth, diameter), distance problems (diameter, eccentricities, Gromov
hyperbolicity, betweenness centrality) and maximum matching. We provide
hardness results and fully polynomial FPT algorithms, using clique-width and
some of its upper-bounds as parameters (split-width, modular-width and
$P\_4$-sparseness). We believe that our most important result is an ${\cal
O}(k^4 \cdot n + m)$-time algorithm for computing a maximum matching where $k$
is either the modular-width or the $P\_4$-sparseness. The latter generalizes
many algorithms that have been introduced so far for specific subclasses such
as cographs, $P\_4$-lite graphs, $P\_4$-extendible graphs and $P\_4$-tidy
graphs. Our algorithms are based on preprocessing methods using modular
decomposition, split decomposition and primeval decomposition. Thus they can
also be generalized to some graph classes with unbounded clique-width.

 <dc:description>  A band-pass filtering scheme is proposed to mitigate spectral broadening and
channel coupling in the Nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger (NLS) fiber optic channel. The
scheme is modeled by modifying the NLS Equation to include an attenuation
profile with multiple brick-wall filters centered at different frequencies. It
is shown that this brick-walls profile conserves the total in-band energy of
the launch signal. Furthermore, energy fluctuations between the filtered
channels are characterized, and conditions on the channel spacings are derived
that ensure energy conservation in each channel. The maximum spectral
efficiency of such a system is derived, and a constructive rule for achieving
it using Sidon sequences is provided.

 <dc:description>  Gradient boosting is a state-of-the-art prediction technique that
sequentially produces a model in the form of linear combinations of simple
predictors---typically decision trees---by solving an infinite-dimensional
convex optimization problem. We provide in the present paper a thorough
analysis of two widespread versions of gradient boosting, and introduce a
general framework for studying these algorithms from the point of view of
functional optimization. We prove their convergence as the number of iterations
tends to infinity and highlight the importance of having a strongly convex risk
functional to minimize. We also present a reasonable statistical context
ensuring consistency properties of the boosting predictors as the sample size
grows. In our approach, the optimization procedures are run forever (that is,
without resorting to an early stopping strategy), and statistical
regularization is basically achieved via an appropriate $L^2$ penalization of
the loss and strong convexity arguments.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a lot of single stage detectors using multi-scale features have
been actively proposed. They are much faster than two stage detectors that use
region proposal networks (RPN) without much degradation in the detection
performances. However, the feature maps in the lower layers close to the input
which are responsible for detecting small objects in a single stage detector
have a problem of insufficient representation power because they are too
shallow. There is also a structural contradiction that the feature maps have to
deliver low-level information to next layers as well as contain high-level
abstraction for prediction. In this paper, we propose a method to enrich the
representation power of feature maps using Resblock and deconvolution layers.
In addition, a unified prediction module is applied to generalize output
results and boost earlier layers' representation power for prediction. The
proposed method enables more precise prediction, which achieved higher score
than SSD on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. In addition, it maintains the advantage of
fast computation of a single stage detector, which requires much less
computation than other detectors with similar performance. Code is available at

 <dc:description>  MIL-STD-1553 is a military standard that defines the physical and logical
layers, and a command/response time division multiplexing of a communication
bus used in military and aerospace avionic platforms for more than 40 years. As
a legacy platform, MIL-STD-1553 was designed for high level of fault tolerance
while less attention was taken with regard to security. Recent studies already
addressed the impact of successful cyber attacks on aerospace vehicles that are
implementing MIL-STD-1553. In this study we present a security analysis of
MIL-STD-1553. In addition, we present a method for anomaly detection in
MIL-STD-1553 communication bus and its performance in the presence of several
attack scenarios implemented in a testbed, as well as results on real system

 <dc:description>  The celebrated integer relation finding algorithm PSLQ has been successfully
used in many applications. However, the PSLQ was only analyzed theoretically
for exact input. When the input data are irrational numbers, they must be
approximate ones due to finite precision in computer. That is, when the
algorithm takes empirical data (inexact data with error bounded) instead of
exact real numbers as its input, how do we ensure theoretically the output of
the algorithm to be an exact integer relation? In this paper, we investigate
the PSLQ algorithm for empirical data as its input. First, we give a
termination condition for this case. Secondly we analyze a perturbation on the
hyperplane matrix constructed from the input data and hence disclose a
relationship between the accuracy of the input data and the output quality (an
upper bound on the absolute value of the inner product of the exact data and
the computed integer relation). Further, we also analyze the computational
complexity for PSLQ with empirical data. Examples on transcendental numbers and
algebraic numbers show the meaningfulness of our error control strategies.

 <dc:description>  Characterizing the interconnectivity of networks at a country level is an
interesting but non-trivial task. The IXP Country Jedi is an existing prototype
that uses RIPE Atlas probes in order to explore interconnectivity at a country
level, taking into account all Autonomous Systems (AS) where RIPE Atlas probes
are deployed. In this work, we build upon this basis and specifically focus on
&quot;eyeball&quot; networks, i.e. the user-facing networks with the largest user
populations in any given country, and explore to what extent we can provide
insights on their interconnectivity. In particular, with a focused user-to-user
(and/or user-to-content) version of the IXP Country Jedi we work towards
meaningful statistics and comparisons between countries/economies. This is
something that a general-purpose probe-to-probe version is not able to capture.
We present our preliminary work on the estimation of RIPE Atlas coverage in
eyeball networks, as well as an approach to measure and visualize user
interconnectivity with our Eyeball Jedi tool.

 <dc:description>  Shape formation has been recently studied in distributed systems of
programmable particles. In this paper we consider the shape recovery problem of
restoring the shape when $f$ of the $n$ particles have crashed. We focus on the
basic line shape, used as a tool for the construction of more complex
configurations.
  We present a solution to the line recovery problem by the non-faulty
anonymous particles; the solution works regardless of the initial distribution
and number $f&lt;n-4$ of faults, of the local orientations of the non-faulty
entities, and of the number of non-faulty entities activated in each round
(i.e., semi-synchronous adversarial scheduler).

 <dc:title>Economic MPC of Nonlinear Systems with Non-Monotonic Lyapunov Functions

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a Lyapunov-based economic MPC scheme for nonlinear sytems
with non-monotonic Lyapunov functions. Relaxed Lyapunov-based constraints are
used in the MPC formulation to improve the economic performance. These
constraints will enforce a Lyapunov decrease after every few steps. Recursive
feasibility and asymptotical convergence to the steady state can be achieved
using Lyapunov-like stability analysis. The proposed economic MPC can be
applied to minimize energy consumption in HVAC control of commercial buildings.
The Lyapunov-based constraints in the online MPC problem enable the tracking of
the desired set-point temperature. The performance is demonstrated by a virtual
building composed of two adjacent zones.

 <dc:title>Modeling travel demand over a period of one week: The mobiTopp model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mallig, Nicolai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Vortisch, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When mobiTopp was initially designed, more than 10 years ago, it has been the
first travel demand simulation model intended for an analysis period of one
week. However, the first version supported only an analysis period of one day.
This paper describes the lessons learned while extending the simulation period
from one day to one week. One important issue is ensuring realistic start times
of activities. Due to differences between the realized trip durations during
the simulation and the trip durations assumed when creating the activity
schedule, the realized activity schedule and the planned activity schedule may
deviate from each other at some point in time during simulation. A suitable
rescheduling strategy is needed to prevent this. Another issue is the different
behavior at weekends, when more joint activities take place than on weekdays,
resulting in an increased share of trips made using the mode car as passenger.
If a mode choice model that takes availability of ride-sharing opportunities
into account is used, it can be difficult to reproduce the correct modal split
without modeling explicitly these joint activities. When modeling travel demand
for a week, it is also important to account for infrequent long-distance trips.
While the share of these trips is low, the total number is not negligible. It
seems that these long-distance trips are not well covered by the destination
choice model used for the day-to-day trips, indicating the need for a
long-distance trip model of infrequent events.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel, purely affinity-based natural image matting algorithm.
Our method relies on carefully defined pixel-to-pixel connections that enable
effective use of information available in the image. We control the information
flow from the known-opacity regions into the unknown region, as well as within
the unknown region itself, by utilizing multiple definitions of pixel
affinities. Among other forms of information flow, we introduce color-mixture
flow, which builds upon local linear embedding and effectively encapsulates the
relation between different pixel opacities. Our resulting novel linear system
formulation can be solved in closed-form and is robust against several
fundamental challenges of natural matting such as holes and remote intricate
structures. Our evaluation using the alpha matting benchmark suggests a
significant performance improvement over the current methods. While our method
is primarily designed as a standalone matting tool, we show that it can also be
used for regularizing mattes obtained by sampling-based methods. We extend our
formulation to layer color estimation and show that the use of multiple
channels of flow increases the layer color quality. We also demonstrate our
performance in green-screen keying and further analyze the characteristics of
the affinities used in our method.

 <dc:description>  K{\&quot;o}hler's method is a useful multi-thresholding technique based on
boundary contrast. However, the direct algorithm has a too high complexity-O(N
2) i.e. quadratic with the pixel numbers N-to process images at a sufficient
speed for practical applications. In this paper, a new algorithm to speed up
K{\&quot;o}hler's method is introduced with a complexity in O(N M), M is the number
of grey levels. The proposed algorithm is designed for parallelisation and
vector processing , which are available in current processors, using OpenMP
(Open Multi-Processing) and SIMD instructions (Single Instruction on Multiple
Data). A fast implementation allows a gain factor of 405 in an image of 18
million pixels and a video processing in real time (gain factor of 96).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we prove lower and matching upper bounds for the number of
servers required to implement a regular shared register that tolerates
unsynchronized Mobile Byzantine failures. We consider the strongest model of
Mobile Byzantine failures to date: agents are moved arbitrarily by an
omniscient adversary from a server to another in order to deviate their
computation in an unforeseen manner. When a server is infected by an Byzantine
agent, it behaves arbitrarily until the adversary decides to move the agent to
another server. Previous approaches considered asynchronous servers with
synchronous mobile Byzantine agents (yielding impossibility results), and
synchronous servers with synchronous mobile Byzantine agents (yielding optimal
solutions for regular register implementation, even in the case where servers
and agents periods are decoupled). We consider the remaining open case of
synchronous servers with unsynchronized agents, that can move at their own
pace, and change their pace during the execution of the protocol. Most of our
findings relate to lower bounds, and characterizing the model parameters that
make the problem solvable. It turns out that unsynchronized mobile Byzantine
agent movements requires completely new proof arguments, that can be of
independent interest when studying other problems in this model. Additionally,
we propose a generic server-based algorithm that emulates a regular register in
this model, that is tight with respect to the number of mobile Byzantine agents
that can be tolerated. Our emulation spans two awareness models: servers with
and without self-diagnose mechanisms. In the first case servers are aware that
the mobile Byzantine agent has left and hence they can stop running the
protocol until they recover a correct state while in the second case, servers
are not aware of their faulty state and continue to run the protocol using an
incorrect local state.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new class of polynomial-time algorithms for submodular function
minimization (SFM), as well as a unified framework to obtain strongly
polynomial SFM algorithms. Our new algorithms are based on simple iterative
methods for the minimum-norm problem, such as the conditional gradient and the
Fujishige-Wolfe algorithms. We exhibit two techniques to turn simple iterative
methods into polynomial-time algorithms.
  Firstly, we use the geometric rescaling technique, which has recently gained
attention in linear programming. We adapt this technique to SFM and obtain a
weakly polynomial bound $O((n^4\cdot EO + n^5)\log (n L))$.
  Secondly, we exhibit a general combinatorial black-box approach to turn any
strongly polynomial $\varepsilon L$-approximate SFM oracle into a strongly
polynomial exact SFM algorithm. This framework can be applied to a wide range
of combinatorial and continuous algorithms, including pseudo-polynomial ones.
In particular, we can obtain strongly polynomial algorithms by a repeated
application of the conditional gradient or of the Fujishige-Wolfe algorithm.
Combined with the geometric rescaling technique, the black-box approach
provides a $O((n^5\cdot EO + n^6)\log^2 n)$ algorithm.
  Finally, we show that one of the techniques we develop in the paper,
&quot;sliding&quot;, can also be combined with the cutting-plane method of Lee, Sidford,
and Wong, yielding a simplified variant of their $O(n^3 \log^2 n \cdot EO +
n^4\log^{O(1)} n)$ algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Suppose we are sending out $k$ robots from $0$ to search the real line at
constant speed (with turns) to find a target at an unknown location; $f$ of the
robots are faulty, meaning that they fail to report the target although
visiting its location (called crash type). The goal is to find the target in
time at most $\lambda |d|$, if the target is located at $d$, $|d| \ge 1$, for
$\lambda$ as small as possible. We show that it cannot be achieved for $\lambda
&lt; 2\frac{(1+\rho)^{1+\rho}}{\rho^\rho}+1$, $\rho := 2\frac{f+1}{k} -1$, which
is tight due to earlier work.
  This also gives some better than previously known lower bounds for so-called
Byzantine-type faulty robots (that may actually wrongly report a target).

 <dc:description>  Security-critical tasks require proper isolation from untrusted software.
Chip manufacturers design and include trusted execution environments (TEEs) in
their processors to secure these tasks. The integrity and security of the
software in the trusted environment depend on the verification process of the
system.
  We find a form of attack that can be performed on the current implementations
of the widely deployed ARM TrustZone technology. The attack exploits the fact
that the trustlet (TA) or TrustZone OS loading verification procedure may use
the same verification key and may lack proper rollback prevention across
versions. If an exploit works on an out-of-date version, but the vulnerability
is patched on the latest version, an attacker can still use the same exploit to
compromise the latest system by downgrading the software to an older and
exploitable version.
  We did experiments on popular devices on the market including those from
Google, Samsung and Huawei, and found that all of them have the risk of being
attacked. Also, we show a real-world example to exploit Qualcomm's QSEE.
  In addition, in order to find out which device images share the same
verification key, pattern matching schemes for different vendors are analyzed
and summarized.

  Mechanism for Blockchain Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A decentralized payment system is not secure if transactions are transferred
directly between clients. In such a situation it is not possible to prevent a
client from redeeming some coins twice in separate transactions that means a
double-spending attack. Bitcoin uses a simple method to preventing this attack
i.e. all transactions are published in a unique log (blockchain). This approach
requires a global consensus on the blockchain that because of significant
latency for transaction confirmation is vulnerable against double-spending. The
solution is to accelerate confirmations. In this paper, we try to introduce an
alternative for PoW because of all its major and significant problems that lead
to collapsing decentralization of the Bitcoin, while a full decentralized
payment system is the main goal of Bitcoin idea. As the network is growing and
becoming larger day-today , Bitcoin is approaching this risk. The method we
introduce is based on a distributed voting process: RDV: Register, Deposit,
Vote.

 <dc:description>  It is a major open problem whether the $(\min,+)$-product of two $n\times n$
matrices has a truly sub-cubic (i.e. $O(n^{3-\epsilon})$ for $\epsilon&gt;0$) time
algorithm, in particular since it is equivalent to the famous
All-Pairs-Shortest-Paths problem (APSP) in $n$-vertex graphs. Some restrictions
of the $(\min,+)$-product to special types of matrices are known to admit truly
sub-cubic algorithms, each giving rise to a special case of APSP that can be
solved faster. In this paper we consider a new, different and powerful
restriction in which all matrix entries are integers and one matrix can be
arbitrary, as long as the other matrix has &quot;bounded differences&quot; in either its
columns or rows, i.e. any two consecutive entries differ by only a small
amount. We obtain the first truly sub-cubic algorithm for this
bounded-difference $(\min,+)$-product (answering an open problem of Chan and
Lewenstein).
  Our new algorithm, combined with a strengthening of an approach of L.~Valiant
for solving context-free grammar parsing with matrix multiplication, yields the
first truly sub-cubic algorithms for the following problems: Language Edit
Distance (a major problem in the parsing community), RNA-folding (a major
problem in bioinformatics) and Optimum Stack Generation (answering an open
problem of Tarjan).

 <dc:description>  We study revenue optimization learning algorithms for repeated posted-price
auctions where a seller interacts with a single strategic buyer that holds a
fixed private valuation for a good and seeks to maximize his cumulative
discounted surplus. For this setting, first, we propose a novel algorithm that
never decreases offered prices and has a tight strategic regret bound in
$\Theta(\log\log T)$ under some mild assumptions on the buyer surplus
discounting. This result closes the open research question on the existence of
a no-regret horizon-independent weakly consistent pricing. The proposed
algorithm is inspired by our observation that a double decrease of offered
prices in a weakly consistent algorithm is enough to cause a linear regret.
This motivates us to construct a novel transformation that maps a
right-consistent algorithm to a weakly consistent one that never decreases
offered prices.
  Second, we outperform the previously known strategic regret upper bound of
the algorithm PRRFES, where the improvement is achieved by means of a finer
constant factor $C$ of the principal term $C\log\log T$ in this upper bound.
Finally, we generalize results on strategic regret previously known for
geometric discounting of the buyer's surplus to discounting of other types,
namely: the optimality of the pricing PRRFES to the case of geometrically
concave decreasing discounting; and linear lower bound on the strategic regret
of a wide range of horizon-independent weakly consistent algorithms to the case
of arbitrary discounts.

 <dc:description>  Over the last decade, malicious software (or malware, for short) has shown an
increasing sophistication and proliferation, fueled by a flourishing
underground economy, in response to the increasing complexity of modern defense
mechanisms. PDF documents are among the major vectors used to convey malware,
thanks to the flexibility of their structure and the ability of embedding
different kinds of content, ranging from images to JavaScript code. Despite the
numerous efforts made by the research and industrial communities, PDF malware
is still one of the major threats on the cyber-security landscape. In this
paper, we provide an overview of the current attack techniques used to convey
PDF malware, and discuss state-of-the-art PDF malware analysis tools that
provide valuable support to digital forensic investigations. We finally discuss
limitations and open issues of the current defense mechanisms, and sketch some
interesting future research directions.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this article is to provide an understanding of social networks as
a useful addition to the standard tool-box of techniques used by system
designers. To this end, we give examples of how data about social links have
been collected and used in di erent application contexts. We develop a broad
taxonomy-based overview of common properties of social networks, review how
they might be used in di erent applications, and point out potential pitfalls
where appropriate. We propose a framework, distinguishing between two main
types of social network-based user selection-personalised user selection which
identi es target users who may be relevant for a given source node, using the
social network around the source as a context, and generic user selection or
group delimitation, which lters for a set of users who satisfy a set of
application requirements based on their social properties. Using this
framework, we survey applications of social networks in three typical kinds of
application scenarios: recommender systems, content-sharing systems (e.g., P2P
or video streaming), and systems which defend against users who abuse the
system (e.g., spam or sybil attacks). In each case, we discuss potential
directions for future research that involve using social network properties.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a method to control a quadrotor with a neural
network trained using reinforcement learning techniques. With reinforcement
learning, a common network can be trained to directly map state to actuator
command making any predefined control structure obsolete for training.
Moreover, we present a new learning algorithm which differs from the existing
ones in certain aspects. Our algorithm is conservative but stable for
complicated tasks. We found that it is more applicable to controlling a
quadrotor than existing algorithms. We demonstrate the performance of the
trained policy both in simulation and with a real quadrotor. Experiments show
that our policy network can react to step response relatively accurately. With
the same policy, we also demonstrate that we can stabilize the quadrotor in the
air even under very harsh initialization (manually throwing it upside-down in
the air with an initial velocity of 5 m/s). Computation time of evaluating the
policy is only 7 {\mu}s per time step which is two orders of magnitude less
than common trajectory optimization algorithms with an approximated model.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a hierarchical attentional neural translation model which
focuses on enhancing source-side hierarchical representations by covering both
local and global semantic information using a bidirectional tree-based encoder.
To maximize the predictive likelihood of target words, a weighted variant of an
attention mechanism is used to balance the attentive information between
lexical and phrase vectors. Using a tree-based rare word encoding, the proposed
model is extended to sub-word level to alleviate the out-of-vocabulary (OOV)
problem. Empirical results reveal that the proposed model significantly
outperforms sequence-to-sequence attention-based and tree-based neural
translation models in English-Chinese translation tasks.

 <dc:title>The Power of Constraint Grammars Revisited</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Sequential Constraint Grammar (SCG) (Karlsson, 1990) and its extensions have
lacked clear connections to formal language theory. The purpose of this article
is to lay a foundation for these connections by simplifying the definition of
strings processed by the grammar and by showing that Nonmonotonic SCG is
undecidable and that derivations similar to the Generative Phonology exist. The
current investigations propose resource bounds that restrict the generative
power of SCG to a subset of context sensitive languages and present a strong
finite-state condition for grammars as wholes. We show that a grammar is
equivalent to a finite-state transducer if it is implemented with a Turing
machine that runs in o(n log n) time. This condition opens new finite-state
hypotheses and avenues for deeper analysis of SCG instances in the way inspired
by Finite-State Phonology.

 <dc:description>  Does normalization help Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging accuracy on noisy,
non-canonical data? To the best of our knowledge, little is known on the actual
impact of normalization in a real-world scenario, where gold error detection is
not available. We investigate the effect of automatic normalization on POS
tagging of tweets. We also compare normalization to strategies that leverage
large amounts of unlabeled data kept in its raw form. Our results show that
normalization helps, but does not add consistently beyond just word embedding
layer initialization. The latter approach yields a tagging model that is
competitive with a Twitter state-of-the-art tagger.

Editing task of WMT 2017. We propose two neural post-editing models: a
monosource model with a task-specific attention mechanism, which performs
particularly well in a low-resource scenario; and a chained architecture which
makes use of the source sentence to provide extra context. This latter
architecture manages to slightly improve our results when more training data is
available. We present and discuss our results on two datasets (en-de and de-en)
that are made available for the task.

 <dc:title>Approximate Directed Minimum Degree Spanning Tree in Polynomial Time</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a directed graph $G$ and a sink vertex $s$, the directed minimum degree
spanning tree problem requires computing an incoming spanning tree rooted at
$s$ whose maximum tree in-degree is the smallest among all such trees. The
problem is known to be NP-hard, since it generalizes the Hamiltonian path
problem. For the approximation version of this problem, a polynomial time
algorithm with $O(\Delta^*\log n)$ approximation guarantee and a
quasi-polynomial time algorithm with $O(\Delta^* + \log n)$ approximation
guarantee are already known; here $n = |V|$ and $\Delta^*$ denotes the optimal
tree in-degree. In this paper, we propose a simple polynomial time algorithm
that also achieves an $O(\Delta^* + \log n)$ approximation. Then we improve
this algorithm to obtain a $(1+\epsilon)\Delta^* + O(\frac{\log n}{\log\log
n})$ approximation for any constant $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$ in polynomial time.

 <dc:title>Tight Analysis of Randomized Greedy MIS</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fischer, Manuela</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide a tight analysis which settles the round complexity of the
well-studied parallel randomized greedy MIS algorithm, thus answering the main
open question of Blelloch, Fineman, and Shun [SPAA'12].
  The parallel/distributed randomized greedy Maximal Independent Set (MIS)
algorithm works as follows. An order of the vertices is chosen uniformly at
random. Then, in each round, all vertices that appear before their neighbors in
the order are added to the independent set and removed from the graph along
with their neighbors. The main question of interest is the number of rounds it
takes until the graph is empty. This algorithm has been studied since 1987,
initiated by Coppersmith, Raghavan, and Tompa [FOCS'87], and the previously
best known bounds were $O(\log n)$ rounds in expectation for
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs by Calkin and Frieze [Random Struc. \&amp; Alg.
'90] and $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds with high probability for general graphs by
Blelloch, Fineman, and Shun [SPAA'12].
  We prove a high probability upper bound of $O(\log n)$ on the round
complexity of this algorithm in general graphs, and that this bound is tight.
This also shows that parallel randomized greedy MIS is as fast as the
celebrated algorithm of Luby [STOC'85, JALG'86].

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a neural reranking system for named entity recognition (NER). The
basic idea is to leverage recurrent neural network models to learn
sentence-level patterns that involve named entity mentions. In particular,
given an output sentence produced by a baseline NER model, we replace all
entity mentions, such as \textit{Barack Obama}, into their entity types, such
as \textit{PER}. The resulting sentence patterns contain direct output
information, yet is less sparse without specific named entities. For example,
&quot;PER was born in LOC&quot; can be such a pattern. LSTM and CNN structures are
utilised for learning deep representations of such sentences for reranking.
Results show that our system can significantly improve the NER accuracies over
two different baselines, giving the best reported results on a standard
benchmark.

 <dc:description>  We study the fundamental problems of identity testing (goodness of fit), and
closeness testing (two sample test) of distributions over $k$ elements, under
differential privacy. While the problems have a long history in statistics,
finite sample bounds for these problems have only been established recently.
  In this work, we derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of
both the problems under $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy. We
provide optimal sample complexity algorithms for identity testing problem for
all parameter ranges, and the first results for closeness testing. Our
closeness testing bounds are optimal in the sparse regime where the number of
samples is at most $k$.
  Our upper bounds are obtained by privatizing non-private estimators for these
problems. The non-private estimators are chosen to have small sensitivity. We
propose a general framework to establish lower bounds on the sample complexity
of statistical tasks under differential privacy. We show a bound on
differentially private algorithms in terms of a coupling between the two
hypothesis classes we aim to test. By constructing carefully chosen priors over
the hypothesis classes, and using Le Cam's two point theorem we provide a
general mechanism for proving lower bounds. We believe that the framework can
be used to obtain strong lower bounds for other statistical tasks under
privacy.

\emph{Consensus} in distributed systems formed by a set of $n$ anonymous nodes
interacting via a communication network. We consider this dynamics in the
parallel \pull\ communication model on the complete graph for the binary case,
i.e., when every node can either support one of two possible colors (say,
\colA\ and \colB) or stay in the \emph{undecided} state. Previous work in this
setting only considers initial color configurations with no undecided nodes and
a large \emph{bias} (i.e., $\Theta(n)$) towards the majority color. A major
open question here is whether this dynamics reaches consensus \emph{quickly},
i.e. within a polylogarithmic number of rounds.
  In this paper we present an \textit{unconditional} analysis of the
Undecided-State Dynamics which answers to the above question in the
affermative. Our analysis shows that, starting from \textit{any} initial
configuration, the Undecided-State Dynamics reaches a monochromatic
configuration within $O(\log^2 n)$ rounds, with high probability (w.h.p.).
%This bound is almost tight since a lower bound $\Omega(\log n)$ is known.
Moreover, we prove that if the initial configuration has bias
$\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$, then the dynamics converges toward the initial
majority color within $O(\log n)$ round, w.h.p.
  At the heart of our approach there is a new analysis of the
\textit{symmetry-breaking} phase that the process must perform in order to
escape from (almost-)unbiased configurations. Previous symmetry-breaking
analysis of consensus dynamics essentially concern sequential communication
models (such as \textit{Population Protocols}) and/or symmetric updated rules
(such as \textit{majority} rules).

 <dc:description>  Augmenting X-ray imaging with 3D roadmap to improve guidance is a common
strategy. Such approaches benefit from automated analysis of the X-ray images,
such as the automatic detection and tracking of instruments. In this paper, we
propose a real-time method to segment the catheter and guidewire in 2D X-ray
fluoroscopic sequences. The method is based on deep convolutional neural
networks. The network takes as input the current image and the three previous
ones, and segments the catheter and guidewire in the current image.
Subsequently, a centerline model of the catheter is constructed from the
segmented image. A small set of annotated data combined with data augmentation
is used to train the network. We trained the method on images from 182 X-ray
sequences from 23 different interventions. On a testing set with images of 55
X-ray sequences from 5 other interventions, a median centerline distance error
of 0.2 mm and a median tip distance error of 0.9 mm was obtained. The
segmentation of the instruments in 2D X-ray sequences is performed in a
real-time fully-automatic manner.

 <dc:description>  We present high performance implementations of the QR and the singular value
decomposition of a batch of small matrices hosted on the GPU with applications
in the compression of hierarchical matrices. The one-sided Jacobi algorithm is
used for its simplicity and inherent parallelism as a building block for the
SVD of low rank blocks using randomized methods. We implement multiple kernels
based on the level of the GPU memory hierarchy in which the matrices can reside
and show substantial speedups against streamed cuSOLVER SVDs. The resulting
batched routine is a key component of hierarchical matrix compression, opening
up opportunities to perform H-matrix arithmetic efficiently on GPUs.

 <dc:description>  We show that the space in which scientific, technological and economic
developments interplay with each other can be mathematically shaped using
pioneering multilayer network and complexity techniques. We build the
tri-layered network of human activities (scientific production, patenting, and
industrial production) and study the interactions among them, also taking into
account the possible time delays. Within this construction we can identify
which capabilities and prerequisites are needed to be competitive in a given
activity, and even measure how much time is needed to transform, for instance,
the technological know-how into economic wealth and scientific innovation,
being able to make predictions with a very long time horizon. Quite
unexpectedly, we find empirical evidence that the naive knowledge flow from
science, to patents, to products is not supported by data, being instead
technology the best predictor for industrial and scientific production for the
next decades.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the trade-offs of different inference approaches for
Bayesian matrix factorisation methods, which are commonly used for predicting
missing values, and for finding patterns in the data. In particular, we
consider Bayesian nonnegative variants of matrix factorisation and
tri-factorisation, and compare non-probabilistic inference, Gibbs sampling,
variational Bayesian inference, and a maximum-a-posteriori approach. The
variational approach is new for the Bayesian nonnegative models. We compare
their convergence, and robustness to noise and sparsity of the data, on both
synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we extend the models with the
Bayesian automatic relevance determination prior, allowing the models to
perform automatic model selection, and demonstrate its efficiency.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we are interested in modeling the diffusion of information in
a multilayer network using thermodynamic diffusion approach. State of each
agent is viewed as a topic mixture represented by a distribution over multiple
topics. We have observed and learned diffusion-related thermodynamical patterns
in the training data set, and we have used the estimated diffusion structure to
predict the future states of the agents. A priori knowledge of a fraction of
the state of all agents changes the problem to be a Kalman predictor problem
that refines the predicted system state using the error in estimation of the
agents. A real world Twitter data set is then used to evaluate and validate our
information diffusion model.

 <dc:description>  Among the myriad of desirable properties discussed in the context of
forgetting in Answer Set Programming (ASP), strong persistence naturally
captures its essence. Recently, it has been shown that it is not always
possible to forget a set of atoms from a program while obeying this property,
and a precise criterion regarding what can be forgotten has been presented,
accompanied by a class of forgetting operators that return the correct result
when forgetting is possible.
  However, it is an open question what to do when we have to forget a set of
atoms, but cannot without violating this property. In this paper, we address
this issue and investigate three natural alternatives to forget when forgetting
without violating strong persistence is not possible, which turn out to
correspond to the different possible relaxations of the characterization of
strong persistence. Additionally, we discuss their preferable usage, shed light
on the relation between forgetting and notions of relativized equivalence
established earlier in the context of ASP, and present a detailed study on
their computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  While neural network approaches are achieving breakthrough performance in the
natural language related fields, there have been few similar attempts at
mathematical language related tasks. In this study, we explore the potential of
applying neural representation techniques to Mathematical Information Retrieval
(MIR) tasks. In more detail, we first briefly analyze the characteristic
differences between natural language and mathematical language. Then we design
a &quot;symbol2vec&quot; method to learn the vector representations of formula symbols
(numbers, variables, operators, functions, etc.) Finally, we propose a
&quot;formula2vec&quot; based MIR approach and evaluate its performance. Preliminary
experiment results show that there is a promising potential for applying
formula embedding models to mathematical language representation and MIR tasks.

 <dc:description>  As Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs) move into the petascale age,
where the output from global high-resolution model runs can be of the order of
hundreds of terabytes in size, tools to analyse the output of these models will
need to scale up too. Lagrangian Ocean Analysis, where virtual particles are
tracked through hydrodynamic fields, is an increasingly popular way to analyse
OGCM output, by mapping pathways and connectivity of biotic and abiotic
particulates. However, the current software stack of Lagrangian Ocean Analysis
codes is not dynamic enough to cope with the increasing complexity, scale and
need for customisation of use-cases. Furthermore, most community codes are
developed for stand-alone use, making it a nontrivial task to integrate virtual
particles at runtime of the OGCM. Here, we introduce the new Parcels code,
which was designed from the ground up to be sufficiently scalable to cope with
petascale computing. We highlight its API design that combines flexibility and
customisation with the ability to optimise for HPC workflows, following the
paradigm of domain-specific languages. Parcels is primarily written in Python,
utilising the wide range of tools available in the scientific Python ecosystem,
while generating low-level C-code and using Just-In-Time compilation for
performance-critical computation. We show a worked-out example of its API, and
validate the accuracy of the code against seven idealised test cases. This
version~0.9 of Parcels is focussed on laying out the API, with future work
concentrating on optimisation, efficiency and at-runtime coupling with OGCMs.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to introduce the Lempel-Ziv permutation complexity
vs permutation entropy plane as a tool to analyze time series of different
nature. This two quantities make use of the Bandt and Pompe representation to
quantify continuous-state time series. The strength of this plane is to combine
two different perspectives to analyze a signal, one being statistic (the
permutation entropy) and the other being deterministic (the Lempel-Ziv
complexity). This representation is applied (i) to characterize non-linear
chaotic maps, (ii) to distinguish deterministic from stochastic processes and
(iii) to analyze and differentiate fractional Brownian motion from fractional
Gaussian noise and K-noise given a same (averaged) spectrum. The results allow
to conclude that this plane is &quot;robust&quot; to distinguish chaotic signals from
random signals, as well as to discriminate between different Gaussian and
nonGaussian noises.

 <dc:description>  The highly influential framework of conceptual spaces provides a geometric
way of representing knowledge. Instances are represented by points and concepts
are represented by regions in a (potentially) high-dimensional space. Based on
our recent formalization, we present a comprehensive implementation of the

 <dc:title>Capacitated Covering Problems in Geometric Spaces</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this article, we consider the following capacitated covering problem. We
are given a set $P$ of $n$ points and a set $\mathcal{B}$ of balls from some
metric space, and a positive integer $U$ that represents the capacity of each
of the balls in $\mathcal{B}$. We would like to compute a subset $\mathcal{B}'
\subseteq \mathcal{B}$ of balls and assign each point in $P$ to some ball in
$\mathcal{B}$ that contains it, such that the number of points assigned to any
ball is at most $U$. The objective function that we would like to minimize is
the cardinality of $\mathcal{B}$.
  We consider this problem in arbitrary metric spaces as well as Euclidean
spaces of constant dimension. In the metric setting, even the uncapacitated
version of the problem is hard to approximate to within a logarithmic factor.
In the Euclidean setting, the best known approximation guarantee in dimensions
$3$ and higher is logarithmic in the number of points. Thus we focus on
obtaining &quot;bi-criteria&quot; approximations. In particular, we are allowed to expand
the balls in our solution by some factor, but optimal solutions do not have
that flexibility. Our main result is that allowing constant factor expansion of
the input balls suffices to obtain constant approximations for these problems.
In fact, in the Euclidean setting, only $(1+\epsilon)$ factor expansion is
sufficient for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, with the approximation factor being a
polynomial in $1/\epsilon$. We obtain these results using a unified scheme for
rounding the natural LP relaxation; this scheme may be useful for other
capacitated covering problems. We also complement these bi-criteria
approximations by obtaining hardness of approximation results that shed light
on our understanding of these problems.

 <dc:description>  Automated program repair (APR) has attracted great research attention, and
various techniques have been proposed. Search-based APR is one of the most
important categories among these techniques. Existing researches focus on the
design of effective mutation operators and searching algorithms to better find
the correct patch. Despite various efforts, the effectiveness of these
techniques are still limited by the search space explosion problem. One of the
key factors attribute to this problem is the quality of fault spaces as
reported by existing studies. This motivates us to study the importance of the
fault space to the success of finding a correct patch. Our empirical study aims
to answer three questions. Does the fault space significantly correlate with
the performance of search-based APR? If so, are there any indicative
measurements to approximate the accuracy of the fault space before applying
expensive APR techniques? Are there any automatic methods that can improve the
accuracy of the fault space? We observe that the accuracy of the fault space
affects the effectiveness and efficiency of search-based APR techniques, e.g.,
the failure rate of GenProg could be as high as $60\%$ when the real fix
location is ranked lower than 10 even though the correct patch is in the search
space. Besides, GenProg is able to find more correct patches and with fewer
trials when given a fault space with a higher accuracy. We also find that the
negative mutation coverage, which is designed in this study to measure the
capability of a test suite to kill the mutants created on the statements
executed by failing tests, is the most indicative measurement to estimate the
efficiency of search-based APR. Finally, we confirm that automated generated
test cases can help improve the accuracy of fault spaces, and further improve
the performance of search-based APR techniques.

 <dc:description>  AI systems are increasingly applied to complex tasks that involve interaction
with humans. During training, such systems are potentially dangerous, as they
haven't yet learned to avoid actions that could cause serious harm. How can an
AI system explore and learn without making a single mistake that harms humans
or otherwise causes serious damage? For model-free reinforcement learning,
having a human &quot;in the loop&quot; and ready to intervene is currently the only way
to prevent all catastrophes. We formalize human intervention for RL and show
how to reduce the human labor required by training a supervised learner to
imitate the human's intervention decisions. We evaluate this scheme on Atari
games, with a Deep RL agent being overseen by a human for four hours. When the
class of catastrophes is simple, we are able to prevent all catastrophes
without affecting the agent's learning (whereas an RL baseline fails due to
catastrophic forgetting). However, this scheme is less successful when
catastrophes are more complex: it reduces but does not eliminate catastrophes
and the supervised learner fails on adversarial examples found by the agent.
Extrapolating to more challenging environments, we show that our implementation
would not scale (due to the infeasible amount of human labor required). We
outline extensions of the scheme that are necessary if we are to train
model-free agents without a single catastrophe.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new neural architecture for collaborative ranking with
implicit feedback. Our model, LRML (\textit{Latent Relational Metric Learning})
is a novel metric learning approach for recommendation. More specifically,
instead of simple push-pull mechanisms between user and item pairs, we propose
to learn latent relations that describe each user item interaction. This helps
to alleviate the potential geometric inflexibility of existing metric learing
approaches. This enables not only better performance but also a greater extent
of modeling capability, allowing our model to scale to a larger number of
interactions. In order to do so, we employ a augmented memory module and learn
to attend over these memory blocks to construct latent relations. The
memory-based attention module is controlled by the user-item interaction,
making the learned relation vector specific to each user-item pair. Hence, this
can be interpreted as learning an exclusive and optimal relational translation
for each user-item interaction. The proposed architecture demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance across multiple recommendation benchmarks. LRML
outperforms other metric learning models by $6\%-7.5\%$ in terms of Hits@10 and
nDCG@10 on large datasets such as Netflix and MovieLens20M. Moreover,
qualitative studies also demonstrate evidence that our proposed model is able
to infer and encode explicit sentiment, temporal and attribute information
despite being only trained on implicit feedback. As such, this ascertains the
ability of LRML to uncover hidden relational structure within implicit
datasets.

 <dc:title>Weak Modular Product of Bipartite Graphs, Bicliques and Isomorphism</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A 1978 theorem of Kozen states that two graphs on $n$ vertices are isomorphic
if and only if there is a clique of size $n$ in the weak modular product
between the two graphs. Restricting to bipartite graphs and considering
complete bipartite subgraphs (bicliques) therein, we study the combinatorics of
the weak modular product. We identify cases where isomorphism is tractable
using this approach, which we call Isomorphism via Biclique Enumeration (IvBE).
We find that IvBE is polynomial for bipartite $2K_2$-free graphs and
quasi-polynomial for families of bipartite graphs, where the largest induced
matching and largest induced crown graph grows slowly in $n$, that is,
$O(\mathrm{polylog }\, n)$. Furthermore, as expected a straightforward
corollary of Kozen's theorem and Lov\'{a}sz's sandwich theorem is if the weak
modular product between two graphs is perfect, then checking if the graphs are
isomorphic is polynomial in $n$. However, we show that for balanced, bipartite
graphs this is only true in a few trivial cases. In doing so we define a new
graph product on bipartite graphs, the very weak modular product. The results
pertaining to bicliques in bipartite graphs proved here may be of independent
interest.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce the algorithm and the fixed point hardware to
calculate the normalized singular value decomposition of a non-symmetric
matrices using Givens fast (approximate) rotations. This algorithm only uses
the basic combinational logic modules such as adders, multiplexers, encoders,
Barrel shifters (B-shifters), and comparators and does not use any lookup
table. This method in fact combines the iterative properties of singular value
decomposition method and CORDIC method in one single iteration. The introduced
architecture is a systolic architecture that uses two different types of
processors, diagonal and non-diagonal processors. The diagonal processor
calculates, transmits and applies the horizontal and vertical rotations, while
the non-diagonal processor uses a fully combinational architecture to receive,
and apply the rotations. The diagonal processor uses priority encoders, Barrel
shifters, and comparators to calculate the rotation angles. Both processors use
a series of adders to apply the rotation angles. The design presented in this
work provides $2.83\sim649$ times better energy per matrix performance compared
to the state of the art designs. This performance achieved without the
employment of pipelining; a better performance advantage is expected to be
achieved employing pipelining.

 <dc:description>  We revisit a classical scenario in communication theory: a source is
generating a waveform which we sample at regular intervals; we wish to
transform the signal in such a way as to minimize distortion in its
reconstruction, despite noise. The transformation must be online (also called
causal), in order to enable real-time signaling. The noise model we consider is
adversarial $\ell_1$-bounded; this is the &quot;atomic norm&quot; convex relaxation of
the standard adversary model in discrete-alphabet communications, namely
sparsity (low Hamming weight). We require that our encoding not increase the
power of the original signal.
  In the &quot;block coding&quot; setting such encoding is possible due to the existence
of large almost-Euclidean sections in $\ell_1$ spaces (established in the work
of Dvoretzky, Milman, Ka\v{s}in, and Figiel, Lindenstrauss and Milman).
  Our main result is that an analogous result is achievable even online.
Equivalently, we show a &quot;lower triangular&quot; version of $\ell_1$ Dvoretzky
theorems. In terms of communication, the result has the following form: If the
signal is a stream of reals $x_1,\ldots$, one per unit time, which we encode
causally into $\rho$ (a constant) reals per unit time (forming altogether an
output stream $\mathcal{E}(x)$), and if the adversarial noise added to this
encoded stream up to time $s$ is a vector $\vec{y}$, then at time $s$ the
decoder's reconstruction of the input prefix $x_{[s]}$ is accurate in a
time-weighted $\ell_2$ norm, to within $s^{-1/2+\delta}$ (any $\delta&gt;0$) times
the adversary's noise as measured in a time-weighted $\ell_1$ norm. The
time-weighted decoding norm forces increasingly accurate reconstruction of the
distant past, while the time-weighted noise norm permits only vanishing effect
from noise in the distant past.
  Encoding is linear, and decoding is performed by an LP analogous to those
used in compressed sensing.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the basic problem of recognizing moving objects in
video images using Visual Vocabulary model and Bag of Words and track our
object of interest in the subsequent video frames using species inspired PSO.
Initially, the shadow free images are obtained by background modelling followed
by foreground modeling to extract the blobs of our object of interest.
Subsequently, we train a cubic SVM with human body datasets in accordance with
our domain of interest for recognition and tracking. During training, using the
principle of Bag of Words we extract necessary features of certain domains and
objects for classification. Subsequently, matching these feature sets with
those of the extracted object blobs that are obtained by subtracting the shadow
free background from the foreground, we detect successfully our object of
interest from the test domain. The performance of the classification by cubic
SVM is satisfactorily represented by confusion matrix and ROC curve reflecting
the accuracy of each module. After classification, our object of interest is
tracked in the test domain using species inspired PSO. By combining the
adaptive learning tools with the efficient classification of description, we
achieve optimum accuracy in recognition of the moving objects. We evaluate our
algorithm benchmark datasets: iLIDS, VIVID, Walking2, Woman. Comparative
analysis of our algorithm against the existing state-of-the-art trackers shows
very satisfactory and competitive results.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the utility of different auxiliary objectives and training
strategies within a neural sequence labeling approach to error detection in
learner writing. Auxiliary costs provide the model with additional linguistic
information, allowing it to learn general-purpose compositional features that
can then be exploited for other objectives. Our experiments show that a joint
learning approach trained with parallel labels on in-domain data improves
performance over the previous best error detection system. While the resulting
model has the same number of parameters, the additional objectives allow it to
be optimised more efficiently and achieve better performance.

 <dc:description>  In Computer Vision domain, moving Object Tracking considered as one of the
toughest problem.As there so many factors associated like illumination of
light, noise, occlusion, sudden start and stop of moving object, shading which
makes tracking even harder problem not only for dynamic background but also for
static background.In this paper we present a new object tracking algorithm
based on Dominant points on tracked object using Quantum particle swarm
optimization (QPSO) which is a new different version of PSO based on Quantum
theory. The novelty in our approach is that it can be successfully applicable
in variable background as well as static background and application of quantum
PSO makes the algorithm runs lot faster where other basic PSO algorithm failed
to do so due to heavy computation.In our approach firstly dominants points of
tracked objects detected, then a group of particles form a swarm are
initialized randomly over the image search space and then start searching the
curvature connected between two consecutive dominant points until they satisfy
fitness criteria. Obviously it is a Multi-Swarm approach as there are multiple
dominant points, as they moves, the curvature moves and the curvature movement
is tracked by the swarm throughout the video and eventually when the swarm
reaches optimal solution , a bounding box drawn based on particles final
position.Experimental results demonstrate this proposed QPSO based method work
efficiently and effectively in visual object tracking in both dynamic and
static environments and run time shows that it runs closely 90% faster than
basic PSO.in our approach we also apply parallelism using MatLab Parfor command
to show how very less number of iteration and swarm size will enable us to
successfully track object.

 <dc:description>  We present a new method for the automated synthesis of safe and robust
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for stochastic hybrid
systems. Despite their widespread use in industry, no automated method
currently exists for deriving a PID controller (or any other type of
controller, for that matter) with safety and performance guarantees for such a
general class of systems. In particular, we consider hybrid systems with
nonlinear dynamics (Lipschitz-continuous ordinary differential equations) and
random parameters, and we synthesize PID controllers such that the resulting
closed-loop systems satisfy safety and performance constraints given as
probabilistic bounded reachability properties. Our technique leverages SMT
solvers over the reals and nonlinear differential equations to provide formal
guarantees that the synthesized controllers satisfy such properties. These
controllers are also robust by design since they minimize the probability of
reaching an unsafe state in the presence of random disturbances. We apply our
approach to the problem of insulin regulation for type 1 diabetes, synthesizing
controllers with robust responses to large random meal disturbances, thereby
enabling them to maintain blood glucose levels within healthy, safe ranges.

 <dc:description>  We approach the tomographic problem in terms of linear system of equations
$A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{p}$ in an $(M\times N)$-sized lattice grid $\mathcal{A}$.
Using a finite number of directions always yields the presence of ghosts, so
preventing uniqueness. Ghosts can be managed by increasing the number of
directions, which implies that also the number of collected projections (also
called bins) increases. Therefore, for a best performing outcome, a kind of
compromise should be sought among the number of employed directions, the number
of collected projections, and the percentage of exactly reconstructed image. In
this paper we wish to investigate such a problem in the case of binary images.
  We move from a theoretical result that allow uniqueness in $\mathcal{A}$ with
just four suitably selected X-ray directions. This is exploited in studying the
structure of the allowed ghosts in the given lattice grid. The knowledge of the
ghost sizes, combined with geometrical information concerning the real valued
solution of $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{p}$ having minimal Euclidean norm, leads to an
explicit implementation of the previously obtained uniqueness theorem. This
provides an easy binary algorithm (BRA) that, in the grid model, quickly
returns perfect noise-free tomographic reconstructions.
  Then we focus on the tomography-side relevant problem of reducing the number
of collected projections and, in the meantime, preserving a good quality of
reconstruction. It turns out that, using sets of just four suitable directions,
a high percentage of reconstructed pixel is preserved, even when the size of
the projection vector $\mathbf{p}$ is considerably smaller than the size of the
image to be reconstructed.
  Results are commented and discussed, also showing applications of BRA on
phantoms with different features.

 <dc:description>  Automated methods for essay scoring have made great progress in recent years,
achieving accuracies very close to human annotators. However, a known weakness
of such automated scorers is not taking into account the semantic relevance of
the submitted text. While there is existing work on detecting answer relevance
given a textual prompt, very little previous research has been done to
incorporate visual writing prompts. We propose a neural architecture and
several extensions for detecting off-topic responses to visual prompts and
evaluate it on a dataset of texts written by language learners.

 <dc:description>  Shortage of available training data is holding back progress in the area of
automated error detection. This paper investigates two alternative methods for
artificially generating writing errors, in order to create additional
resources. We propose treating error generation as a machine translation task,
where grammatically correct text is translated to contain errors. In addition,
we explore a system for extracting textual patterns from an annotated corpus,
which can then be used to insert errors into grammatically correct sentences.
Our experiments show that the inclusion of artificially generated errors
significantly improves error detection accuracy on both FCE and CoNLL 2014
datasets.

 <dc:title>Coloring Down: $3/2$-approximation for special cases of the weighted
  tree augmentation problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Iglesias, Jennifer</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>G.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the weighted tree augmentation problem (TAP),
where the goal is to augment a tree with a minimum cost set of edges such that
the graph becomes two edge connected. First we show that in weighted TAP, we
can restrict our attention to trees which are binary and where all the non-tree
edges go between two leaves of the tree. We then give two different top-down
coloring algorithms. Both algorithms differ from known techniques for a
3/2-approximation in unweighted TAP and current attempts to reach a
3/2-approximation for weighted TAP.
  The first algorithm we describe always gives a 2-approximation for any
feasible fractional solution to the natural edge cover LP. When the fractional
solution is such that all the edges with non-zero weight are at least $\alpha$,
then this algorithm achieves a $2/(1+\alpha)$-approximation. We propose a new
conjecture on extreme points of LP relaxations for the problem, which if true,
will lead to a constructive proof of an integrality gap of at most 3/2 for
weighted TAP. In the second algorithm, we introduce simple valid constraints to
the edge cover LP. In this algorithm, we focus on deficient edges, edges
covered to an extent less than 4/3 in the fractional solution. We show that for
fractional feasible solutions, deficient edges occur in node-disjoint paths in
the tree. When the number of such paths is at most two, we give a top-down
coloring algorithm which decomposes 3/2 times the fractional solution into a
convex combination of integer solutions. We believe our algorithms will be
useful in eventually resolving the integrality gap of linear programming
formulations for TAP.
  We also investigate a variant of TAP where each edge in the solution must be
covered by a cycle of length three. We give a $\Theta(\log n)$-approximation
algorithm for this problem in the weighted case and a 4-approximation in the
unweighted case.

 <dc:description>  Domain similarity measures can be used to gauge adaptability and select
suitable data for transfer learning, but existing approaches define ad hoc
measures that are deemed suitable for respective tasks. Inspired by work on
curriculum learning, we propose to \emph{learn} data selection measures using
Bayesian Optimization and evaluate them across models, domains and tasks. Our
learned measures outperform existing domain similarity measures significantly
on three tasks: sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and parsing. We
show the importance of complementing similarity with diversity, and that
learned measures are -- to some degree -- transferable across models, domains,
and even tasks.

 <dc:description>  We introduce EnhanceGAN, an adversarial learning based model that performs
automatic image enhancement. Traditional image enhancement frameworks involve
training separate models for automatic cropping or color enhancement in a
fully-supervised manner, which requires expensive annotations in the form of
image pairs. In contrast to these approaches, our proposed EnhanceGAN only
requires weak supervision (binary labels on image aesthetic quality) and is
able to learn enhancement parameters for tasks including image cropping and
color enhancement. The full differentiability of our image enhancement modules
enables training the proposed EnhanceGAN in an end-to-end manner. A novel
stage-wise learning scheme is further proposed to stabilize the training of
each enhancement task and facilitate the extensibility for other image
enhancement techniques. Our weakly-supervised EnhanceGAN reports competitive
quantitative results against supervised models in automatic image cropping
using standard benchmarking datasets, and a user study confirms that the images
enhancement results are on par with or even preferred over professional
enhancement.

proposed which generate explanations from the content and reviews written for
items. When review text is unavailable, generating explanations is still a hard
problem. In this paper, we illustrate how explanations can be generated in such

Our method jointly ranks items and knowledge graph entities using a
Personalized PageRank procedure to produce recommendations together with their

 <dc:description>  Many projects relies on cognitives sciences, neurosciences, computer sciences
and robotics. They concerned today the building of autonomous artificial beings
able to think. This paper shows a model to compare the human thinking with an
hypothetic numerical way of thinking based on four hierarchies : the
information system classification, the cognitive pyramid, the linguistic
pyramid and the digital information hierarchy. After a state of art on the
nature of human thinking, feasibility of autonomous multi-agent systems
provided with artificial consciousness which are able to think is discussed.
The ethical aspects and consequences for humanity of such systems is evaluated.
These systems lead the scientific community to react.

 <dc:description>  Poor timing predictability of multicore processors has been a long-standing
challenge in the real-time systems community. In this paper, we make a case
that a fundamental problem that prevents efficient and predictable real-time
com- puting on multicore is the lack of a proper memory abstraction to express
memory criticality, which cuts across various layers of the system: the
application, OS, and hardware. We therefore propose a new holistic resource
management approach driven by a new memory abstraction, which we call
Deterministic Memory. The key characteristic of deterministic memory is that
the platform - the OS and hardware - guarantees small and tightly bounded
worst-case memory access timing. In contrast, we call the conventional memory
abstraction as best-effort memory in which only highly pessimistic worst-case
bounds can be achieved.
  We present how the two memory abstractions can be realized with small
extensions to existing OS and hardware architecture. In particular, we show the
potential benefits of our approach in the context of shared cache management,
by presenting a deterministic memory-aware cache architecture and its manage-
ment scheme. We evaluate the effectiveness of the deterministic memory-aware
cache management approach compared with a conventional way-based cache
partitioning approach, using a set of synthetic and real benchmarks. The
results show that our approach achieves (i) the same degree of temporal
determinism of traditional way-based cache partitioning for deterministic
memory, (ii) while freeing up to 49% of additional cache space, on average, for
best-effort memory, and consequently improving the cache hit rate by 39%, on
average, for non-real-time workloads. We also discuss how the deterministic
memory abstraction can be leveraged in other parts of the memory hierarchy,
particularly in the memory controller.

 <dc:description>  When working with a new dataset, it is important to first explore and
familiarize oneself with it, before applying any advanced machine learning
algorithms. However, to the best of our knowledge, no tools exist that quickly
and reliably give insight into the contents of a selection of documents with
respect to what distinguishes them from other documents belonging to different
categories. In this paper we propose to extract `relevant words' from a
collection of texts, which summarize the contents of documents belonging to a
certain class (or discovered cluster in the case of unlabeled datasets), and
visualize them in word clouds to allow for a survey of salient features at a
glance. We compare three methods for extracting relevant words and demonstrate
the usefulness of the resulting word clouds by providing an overview of the
classes contained in a dataset of scientific publications as well as by
discovering trending topics from recent New York Times article snippets.

 <dc:description>  In this study, we introduce a new approach for learning language models by
training them to estimate word-context pointwise mutual information (PMI), and
then deriving the desired conditional probabilities from PMI at test time.
Specifically, we show that with minor modifications to word2vec's algorithm, we
get principled language models that are closely related to the well-established
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) based language models. A compelling aspect
of our approach is that our models are trained with the same simple negative
sampling objective function that is commonly used in word2vec to learn word
embeddings.

 <dc:description>  Mobile apps have exploded in popularity, encouraging developers to provide
content to the massive user base of the main app stores. Although there exist
automated techniques that can classify user comments into various topics with
high levels of precision, recent studies have shown that the top apps in the
app stores do not have customer ratings that directly correlate with the app's
success. This implies that no single requirements elicitation technique can
cover the full depth required to produce a successful product and that applying
alternative requirements gathering techniques can lead to success when these
two are combined. Since user involvement has been found to be the most
impactful contribution to project success, in this paper we will explore how
the Wizard of Oz (WOz) technique and user reviews available in Google Play, can
be integrated to produce a product that meets the demand of more stakeholders
than either method alone. To compare the role of early interactive requirements
specification and app reviews, we conducted two studies (i) a case study
analysis on 13 mobile app development teams who used very early stages
Requirements Engineering (RE) by applying WOz, and (ii) a study analyzing 40
(70, 592 reviews) similar mobile apps on Google Play. The results of both
studies show that while each of WOz and app review analysis techniques can be
applied to capture specific types of requirements, an integrated process
including both methods would eliminate the communication gap between users and
developers at early stages of the development process and mitigates the risk of
requirements change in later stages.

 <dc:title>Computation Rate Maximization for Wireless Powered Mobile Edge Computing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Feng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Integrating mobile edge computing (MEC) and wireless power transfer (WPT) has
been regarded as a promising technique to improve computation capabilities for
self-sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This paper investigates a
wireless powered multiuser MEC system, where a multi-antenna access point (AP)
(integrated with an MEC server) broadcasts wireless power to charge multiple
users for mobile computing. We consider a time-division multiple access (TDMA)
protocol for multiuser computation offloading. Under this setup, we aim to
maximize the weighted sum of the computation rates (in terms of the number of
computation bits) across all the users, by jointly optimizing the energy
transmit beamformer at the AP, the task partition for the users (for local
computing and offloading, respectively), and the time allocation among the
users. We derive the optimal solution in a semi-closed form via convex
optimization techniques. Numerical results show the merit of the proposed
design over alternative benchmark schemes.

 <dc:title>On the Pitfalls of End-to-End Encrypted Communications: A Study of
  Remote Key-Fingerprint Verification</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many widely used Internet messaging and calling apps, such as WhatsApp,
Viber, Telegram, and Signal, have deployed an end-to-end encryption
functionality. To defeat potential MITM attackers against the key exchange
protocol, the approach relies on users to perform a code verification task
whereby each user must compare the code (a fingerprint of the cryptographic
keys) computed by her app with the one computed by the other user's app and
reject the session if the two do not match.
  In this paper, we study the security and usability of this human-centered
code verification task for a setting where the end users are remotely located,
and compare it as a baseline to a less frequent scenario where the users are in
close proximity. We consider several variations of the code presentation and
verification methods, incorporated into representative real-world apps,
including codes encoded as numbers or images, displayed on the screen, and
verbally spoken by the users. We perform a human factors study in a lab setting
to quantify the security and usability of these different methods.
  Our study results expose key weaknesses in the security and usability of the
code verification methods employed in the apps. First, we show that most code
verification methods offer poor security (high false accepts) and low usability
(high false rejects and low user experience ratings) in the remote setting.
Second, we demonstrate that, security and usability under the remote code
verification setting is significantly lower than that in the proximity setting.
We attribute this result to the increased cognitive overhead associated with
comparing the codes across two apps on the same device (remote setting) rather
than across two devices (proximity setting). Overall, our work serves to
highlight a serious vulnerability of Internet-based communication apps in the
remote setting stemming from human errors.

 <dc:description>  In many complex networked systems, such as online social networks, activity
originates at certain nodes and subsequently spreads on the network through
influence. In this work, we consider the problem of modeling the spread of
influence and the identification of influential entities in a complex network
when nodal activation can happen via two different mechanisms. The first
mechanism of activation stems from factors that are intrinsic to the node. The
second mechanism comes from the influence of connected neighbors. After
introducing the model, we provide an algorithm to mine for the influential
nodes in such a scenario by modifying the well-known influence maximization
algorithm to work with our model that incorporates both forms of activation.
Our model can be considered as a variation of the independent cascade diffusion
model. We provide small motivating examples to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of the effect of including the intrinsic activation mechanism. We
sketch a proof of the submodularity of the influence function under the new
formulation and demonstrate the same on larger graphs. Based on the model, we
explain how influential content creators can drive engagement on social media
platforms. Using additional experiments on a Twitter dataset, we then show how
the formulation can be applied to real-world social media datasets. Finally, we
derive a centrality metric that takes into account, both the mechanisms of
activation and provides for an accurate, computationally efficient, alternate
approach to the problem of identifying influencers under intrinsic activation.

 <dc:description>  Entity linking has recently been the subject of a significant body of
research. Currently, the best performing approaches rely on trained
mono-lingual models. Porting these approaches to other languages is
consequently a difficult endeavor as it requires corresponding training data
and retraining of the models. We address this drawback by presenting a novel
multilingual, knowledge-based agnostic and deterministic approach to entity
linking, dubbed MAG. MAG is based on a combination of context-based retrieval
on structured knowledge bases and graph algorithms. We evaluate MAG on 23 data
sets and in 7 languages. Our results show that the best approach trained on
English datasets (PBOH) achieves a micro F-measure that is up to 4 times worse
on datasets in other languages. MAG, on the other hand, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on English datasets and reaches a micro F-measure
that is up to 0.6 higher than that of PBOH on non-English languages.

 <dc:description>  Many relevant tasks require an agent to reach a certain state, or to
manipulate objects into a desired configuration. For example, we might want a
robot to align and assemble a gear onto an axle or insert and turn a key in a
lock. These goal-oriented tasks present a considerable challenge for
reinforcement learning, since their natural reward function is sparse and
prohibitive amounts of exploration are required to reach the goal and receive
some learning signal. Past approaches tackle these problems by exploiting
expert demonstrations or by manually designing a task-specific reward shaping
function to guide the learning agent. Instead, we propose a method to learn
these tasks without requiring any prior knowledge other than obtaining a single
state in which the task is achieved. The robot is trained in reverse, gradually
learning to reach the goal from a set of start states increasingly far from the
goal. Our method automatically generates a curriculum of start states that
adapts to the agent's performance, leading to efficient training on
goal-oriented tasks. We demonstrate our approach on difficult simulated
navigation and fine-grained manipulation problems, not solvable by
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.

 <dc:description>  To date, self-driving experimental wheelchair technologies have been either
inexpensive or robust, but not both. Yet, in order to achieve real-world
acceptance, both qualities are fundamentally essential. We present a unique
approach to achieve inexpensive and robust autonomous and semi-autonomous
assistive navigation for existing fielded wheelchairs, of which there are
approximately 5 million units in Canada and United States alone. Our prototype
wheelchair platform is capable of localization and mapping, as well as robust
obstacle avoidance, using only a commodity RGB-D sensor and wheel odometry. As
a specific example of the navigation capabilities, we focus on the single most
common navigation problem: the traversal of narrow doorways in arbitrary
environments. The software we have developed is generalizable to corridor
following, desk docking, and other navigation tasks that are either extremely
difficult or impossible for people with upper-body mobility impairments.

convolutional neural networks to predict cost functions from input video which
are directly suitable for online trajectory optimization with MPC. We

 <dc:description>  In complex reasoning tasks, as expressible by Answer Set Programming (ASP),
problems often permit for multiple solutions. In dynamic environments, where
knowledge is continuously changing, the question arises how a given model can
be incrementally adjusted relative to new and outdated information. This paper
introduces Ticker, a prototypical engine for well-defined logical reasoning
over streaming data. Ticker builds on a practical fragment of the recent
rule-based language LARS which extends Answer Set Programming for streams by
providing flexible expiration control and temporal modalities. We discuss
Ticker's reasoning strategies: First, the repeated one-shot solving mode calls
Clingo on an ASP encoding. We show how this translation can be incrementally
updated when new data is streaming in or time passes by. Based on this, we
build on Doyle's classic justification-based truth maintenance system (TMS) to
update models of non-stratified programs. Finally, we empirically compare the
obtained evaluation mechanisms. This paper is under consideration for
acceptance in TPLP.

 <dc:description>  Machine Learning has been a big success story during the AI resurgence. One
particular stand out success relates to learning from a massive amount of data.
In spite of early assertions of the unreasonable effectiveness of data, there
is increasing recognition for utilizing knowledge whenever it is available or
can be created purposefully. In this paper, we discuss the indispensable role
of knowledge for deeper understanding of content where (i) large amounts of
training data are unavailable, (ii) the objects to be recognized are complex,
(e.g., implicit entities and highly subjective content), and (iii) applications
need to use complementary or related data in multiple modalities/media. What
brings us to the cusp of rapid progress is our ability to (a) create relevant
and reliable knowledge and (b) carefully exploit knowledge to enhance ML/NLP
techniques. Using diverse examples, we seek to foretell unprecedented progress
in our ability for deeper understanding and exploitation of multimodal data and
continued incorporation of knowledge in learning techniques.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation has come a long way since the early days of computer
vision, and still remains a challenging task. Modern variations of the
classical (purely bottom-up) approach, involve, e.g., some form of user
assistance (interactive segmentation) or ask for the simultaneous segmentation
of two or more images (co-segmentation). At an abstract level, all these
variants can be thought of as &quot;constrained&quot; versions of the original
formulation, whereby the segmentation process is guided by some external source
of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach to tackle this kind of
problems in a unified way. Our work is based on some properties of a family of
quadratic optimization problems related to dominant sets, a well-known
graph-theoretic notion of a cluster which generalizes the concept of a maximal
clique to edge-weighted graphs. In particular, we show that by properly
controlling a regularization parameter which determines the structure and the
scale of the underlying problem, we are in a position to extract groups of
dominant-set clusters that are constrained to contain predefined elements. In
particular, we shall focus on interactive segmentation and co-segmentation (in
both the unsupervised and the interactive versions). The proposed algorithm can
deal naturally with several type of constraints and input modality, including
scribbles, sloppy contours, and bounding boxes, and is able to robustly handle
noisy annotations on the part of the user. Experiments on standard benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our approach as compared to state-of-the-art
algorithms on a variety of natural images under several input conditions and
constraints.

to define the notions of accepting and rejecting degrees of inputs,
computationally. We use a BFS-based search method and obtain an upper level
bound to guarantee the existence of accepting and rejecting degrees. We show
that fuzzy, generalized fuzzy and classical Turing machines have the same
computational power. Next, we introduce the class of Extended Fuzzy Turing
Machines equipped with indeterminacy states. These machines are used to catch
some types of loops of the classical Turing machines. Moreover, to each r.e. or
co-r.e language, we correspond a fuzzy language which is indeterminable by an
extended fuzzy Turing machine.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we aim to automatically discover high quality frame-level
speech features and acoustic tokens directly from unlabeled speech data. A
Multi-granular Acoustic Tokenizer (MAT) was proposed for automatic discovery of
multiple sets of acoustic tokens from the given corpus. Each acoustic token set
is specified by a set of hyperparameters describing the model configuration.
These different sets of acoustic tokens carry different characteristics for the
given corpus and the language behind, thus can be mutually reinforced. The
multiple sets of token labels are then used as the targets of a Multi-target
Deep Neural Network (MDNN) trained on frame-level acoustic features. Bottleneck
features extracted from the MDNN are then used as the feedback input to the MAT
and the MDNN itself in the next iteration. The multi-granular acoustic token
sets and the frame-level speech features can be iteratively optimized in the
iterative deep learning framework. We call this framework the Multi-granular
Acoustic Tokenizing Deep Neural Network (MATDNN). The results were evaluated
using the metrics and corpora defined in the Zero Resource Speech Challenge
organized at Interspeech 2015, and improved performance was obtained with a set
of experiments of query-by-example spoken term detection on the same corpora.
Visualization for the discovered tokens against the English phonemes was also
shown.

 <dc:title>Current-mode Memristor Crossbars for Neuromemristive Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Motivated by advantages of current-mode design, this brief contribution
explores the implementation of weight matrices in neuromemristive systems via
current-mode memristor crossbar circuits. After deriving theoretical results
for the range and distribution of weights in the current-mode design, it is
shown that any weight matrix based on voltage-mode crossbars can be mapped to a
current-mode crossbar if the voltage-mode weights are carefully bounded. Then,
a modified gradient descent rule is derived for the current-mode design that
can be used to perform backpropagation training. Behavioral simulations on the
MNIST dataset indicate that both voltage and current-mode designs are able to
achieve similar accuracy and have similar defect tolerance. However, analysis
of trained weight distributions reveals that current-mode and voltage-mode
designs may use different feature representations.

 <dc:description>  Electronic medical records contain multi-format electronic medical data that
consist of an abundance of medical knowledge. Facing with patient's symptoms,
experienced caregivers make right medical decisions based on their professional
knowledge that accurately grasps relationships between symptoms, diagnosis and
corresponding treatments. In this paper, we aim to capture these relationships
by constructing a large and high-quality heterogenous graph linking patients,
diseases, and drugs (PDD) in EMRs. Specifically, we propose a novel framework
to extract important medical entities from MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart
for Intensive Care III) and automatically link them with the existing
biomedical knowledge graphs, including ICD-9 ontology and DrugBank. The PDD
graph presented in this paper is accessible on the Web via the SPARQL endpoint,
and provides a pathway for medical discovery and applications, such as
effective treatment recommendations.

 <dc:description>  Bandlimiting and timelimiting operators play a fundamental role in analyzing
bandlimited signals that are approximately timelimited (or vice versa). In this
paper, we consider a time-frequency (in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
domain) limiting operator whose eigenvectors are known as the periodic discrete
prolate spheroidal sequences (PDPSSs). We establish new nonasymptotic results
on the eigenvalue distribution of this operator. As a byproduct, we also
characterize the eigenvalue distribution of a set of submatrices of the DFT
matrix, which is of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  We develop and implement a concurrent dictionary data structure based on the
Log Structured Merge tree (LSM), suitable for current massively parallel GPU
architectures. Our GPU LSM is dynamic (mutable) in that it provides fast
updates (insertions and deletions). For example, on an NVIDIA K40c GPU we can
get an average update rate of 225 M elements/s (13.5x faster than merging with
a sorted array). GPU LSM also supports lookup, count, and range query
operations with an average rate of 75 M, 32 M and 23 M queries/s respectively.
For lookups, we are 7.5x (and 1.75x) slower than a hash table (and a sorted
array). However, none of these other data structures are considered mutable,
and hash tables cannot even support count and range queries. We believe that
our GPU LSM is the first dynamic general-purpose GPU data structure.

 <dc:description>  With the explosion of video content on the Internet, there is a need for
research on methods for video analysis which take human cognition into account.
One such cognitive measure is memorability, or the ability to recall visual
content after watching it. Prior research has looked into image memorability
and shown that it is intrinsic to visual content, but the problem of modeling
video memorability has not been addressed sufficiently. In this work, we
develop a prediction model for video memorability, including complexities of
video content in it. Detailed feature analysis reveals that the proposed method
correlates well with existing findings on memorability. We also describe a
novel experiment of predicting video sub-shot memorability and show that our
approach improves over current memorability methods in this task. Experiments
on standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed metric can achieve results
on par or better than the state-of-the art methods for video summarization.

 <dc:description>  Visible light communications (VLC) is a promising technology to address the
spectrum crunch problem in radio frequency (RF) networks. A major advantage of
VLC networks is that they can use the existing lighting infrastructure in
indoor environments, which may have large number of LEDs for illumination.
While LEDs used for lighting typically have limited bandwidth, presence of many
LEDs can be exploited for indoor VLC networks, to serve each user by multiple
LEDs for improving link quality and throughput. In this paper, LEDs are grouped
and assigned to the users based on received signal strength from each LED, for
which different solutions are proposed to achieve maximum throughput,
proportional fairness and quality of service (QoS). Additionally, power
optimization of LEDs for a given assignment is investigated, and Jacobian and
Hessian matrices of the corresponding optimization problem are derived.
Moreover, for multi-element receivers with LED grouping at the transmitter, an
improved optimal combining method is proposed. This method suppresses
interference caused by simultaneous data transfer of LEDs and improves the
overall signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) by 2 dB to 5 dB. Lastly,
an efficient calculation of channel response is presented to simulate multipath
VLC channel with low computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  We present a real-time method for synthesizing highly complex human motions
using a novel training regime we call the auto-conditioned Recurrent Neural
Network (acRNN). Recently, researchers have attempted to synthesize new motion
by using autoregressive techniques, but existing methods tend to freeze or
diverge after a couple of seconds due to an accumulation of errors that are fed
back into the network. Furthermore, such methods have only been shown to be
reliable for relatively simple human motions, such as walking or running. In
contrast, our approach can synthesize arbitrary motions with highly complex
styles, including dances or martial arts in addition to locomotion. The acRNN
is able to accomplish this by explicitly accommodating for autoregressive noise
accumulation during training. Our work is the first to our knowledge that
demonstrates the ability to generate over 18,000 continuous frames (300
seconds) of new complex human motion w.r.t. different styles.

 <dc:description>  Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has resulted in massive amounts
of proteomics and genomics data. This data is of no use if it is not properly
analyzed. ETL (Extraction, Transformation, Loading) is an important step in
designing data analytics applications. ETL requires proper understanding of
features of data. Data format plays a key role in understanding of data,
representation of data, space required to store data, data I/O during
processing of data, intermediate results of processing, in-memory analysis of
data and overall time required to process data. Different data mining and
machine learning algorithms require input data in specific types and formats.
This paper explores the data formats used by different tools and algorithms and
also presents modern data formats that are used on Big Data Platform. It will
help researchers and developers in choosing appropriate data format to be used
for a particular tool or algorithm.

 <dc:title>An Information Theoretic Measure for Robot Expressivity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>LaViers, A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a principled way to think about articulated movement for
artificial agents and a measurement of platforms that produce such movement. In
particular, in human-facing scenarios, the shape evolution of robotic platforms
will become essential in creating systems that integrate and communicate with
human counterparts. This paper provides a tool to measure the expressive
capacity or expressivity of articulated platforms. To do this, it points to the
synergistic relationship between computation and mechanization. Importantly,
this way of thinking gives an information theoretic basis for measuring and
comparing robots of increasing complexity and capability. The paper will
provide concrete examples of this measure in application to current robotic
platforms. It will also provide a comparison between the computational and
mechanical capabilities of robotic platforms and analyze order-of-magnitude
trends over the last 15 years. Implications for future work made by the paper
are to provide a method by which to quantify movement imitation, outline a way
of thinking about designing expressive robotic systems, and contextualize the
capabilities of current robotic systems.

 <dc:title>A robotic vision system to measure tree traits</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tabb, Amy</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Medeiros, Henry</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The autonomous measurement of tree traits, such as branching structure,
branch diameters, branch lengths, and branch angles, is required for tasks such
as robotic pruning of trees as well as structural phenotyping. We propose a
robotic vision system called the Robotic System for Tree Shape Estimation
(RoTSE) to determine tree traits in field settings. The process is composed of
the following stages: image acquisition with a mobile robot unit, segmentation,
reconstruction, curve skeletonization, conversion to a graph representation,
and then computation of traits. Quantitative and qualitative results on apple
trees are shown in terms of accuracy, computation time, and robustness.
Compared to ground truth measurements, the RoTSE produced the following
estimates: branch diameter (mean-squared error $0.99$ mm), branch length
(mean-squared error $45.64$ mm), and branch angle (mean-squared error $10.36$
degrees). The average run time was 8.47 minutes when the voxel resolution was
$3$ mm$^3$.

improving the robustness of learning machines. So far, most existing methods
only work for classification and are not designed to alter the true performance
measure of the problem at hand. We introduce a novel flexible approach named
Houdini for generating adversarial examples specifically tailored for the final
performance measure of the task considered, be it combinatorial and
non-decomposable. We successfully apply Houdini to a range of applications such
as speech recognition, pose estimation and semantic segmentation. In all cases,
the attacks based on Houdini achieve higher success rate than those based on
the traditional surrogates used to train the models while using a less
perceptible adversarial perturbation.

 <dc:description>  Min-SEIS-Cluster is an optimization problem which aims at minimizing the
infection spreading in networks. In this problem, nodes can be susceptible to
an infection, exposed to an infection, or infectious. One of the main features
of this problem is the fact that nodes have different dynamics when interacting
with other nodes from the same community. Thus, the problem is characterized by
distinct probabilities of infecting nodes from both the same and from different
communities. This paper presents a new genetic algorithm that solves the
Min-SEIS-Cluster problem. This genetic algorithm surpassed the current
heuristic of this problem significantly, reducing the number of infected nodes
during the simulation of the epidemics. The results therefore suggest that our
new genetic algorithm is the state-of-the-art heuristic to solve this problem.

 <dc:description>  We show that the Radon number characterizes the existence of weak nets in
separable convexity spaces (an abstraction of the euclidean notion of
convexity). The construction of weak nets when the Radon number is finite is
based on Helly's property and on metric properties of VC classes. The lower
bound on the size of weak nets when the Radon number is large relies on the
chromatic number of the Kneser graph. As an application, we prove a
boosting-type result for weak $\epsilon$-nets.

 <dc:description>  Complex systems are usually modelled through a combination of structural and
behavioural models, where separate behavioural models make it easier to design
and understand partial behaviour. When partial models are combined, we need to
guarantee that they are consistent, and several automated techniques have been
developed to check this. We argue that in some cases it is impossible to
guarantee total consistency, and instead we want to find execution paths across
such models with minimal conflicts with respect to a certain metric of
interest. We present an efficient and scalable solution to find optimal paths
through a combination of the theorem prover Isabelle with the constraint solver
Z3. Our approach has been inspired by a healthcare problem, namely how to
detect conflicts between medications taken by patients with multiple chronic
conditions, and how to find preferable alternatives automatically.

 <dc:description>  Osteoporosis can be identified by looking at 2D x-ray images of the bone. The
high degree of similarity between images of a healthy bone and a diseased one
makes classification a challenge. A good bone texture characterization
technique is essential for identifying osteoporosis cases. Standard texture
feature extraction techniques like Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Gray Level
Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) have been used for this purpose. In this paper, we
draw a comparison between deep features extracted from convolution neural
network against these traditional features. Our results show that deep features
have more discriminative power as classifiers trained on them always outperform
the ones trained on traditional features.

 <dc:title>Applications and Constructions of Cut-Covering Decompositions for

 <dc:description>  We study decompositions of graphs that cover small-cardinality cuts an even
number of times, and we use these decompositions to design algorithms with
improved approximation guarantees for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and
the 2-edge-connected spanning multigraph problem (2EC) on (restricted classes
of) weighted graphs. For example, Boyd, Iwata and Takazawa recently presented
an algorithm to find a cycle cover that covers all 3- and 4-edge cuts in a
bridgeless, cubic graph with applications to 2EC on 3-edge-connected, cubic
graphs. We present several applications of their algorithm to connectivity
problems on node-weighted graphs, which has been suggested as an intermediate
step between graph and general metrics. Specifically, on 3-edge-connected,
cubic, node-weighted graphs, we present a $\frac{7}{5}$-approximation algorithm
for TSP and a $\frac{13}{10}$-approximation algorithm for 2EC.
  To extend this approach to graphs that are 2-edge connected, we present a
procedure to decompose an optimal solution for the subtour linear program into
spanning, connected subgraphs that cover each 2-edge cut an even number of
times. We use this decomposition to design a simple $\frac{4}{3}$-approximation
algorithm for 2EC on subcubic, node-weighted graphs.
  Finally, motivated by the well known &quot;four-thirds conjecture&quot;, we apply these
decomposition tools to the problem of uniform covers. For a cubic,
3-edge-connected graph, we show that the everywhere $\frac{18}{19}$ vector can
be efficiently written as a convex combination of tours, answering a question
of Seb\H{o}. Additionally, for such graphs, we show that the everywhere
$\frac{15}{17}$ can be efficiently written as a convex combination of
2-edge-connected spanning multigraphs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new method to analyze the impact of errors in algorithms for
multi-instance pose estimation and a principled benchmark that can be used to
compare them. We define and characterize three classes of errors -
localization, scoring, and background - study how they are influenced by
instance attributes and their impact on an algorithm's performance. Our
technique is applied to compare the two leading methods for human pose
estimation on the COCO Dataset, measure the sensitivity of pose estimation with
respect to instance size, type and number of visible keypoints, clutter due to
multiple instances, and the relative score of instances. The performance of
algorithms, and the types of error they make, are highly dependent on all these
variables, but mostly on the number of keypoints and the clutter. The analysis
and software tools we propose offer a novel and insightful approach for
understanding the behavior of pose estimation algorithms and an effective
method for measuring their strengths and weaknesses.

 <dc:description>  We present an implementation of a probabilistic first-order logic called
TensorLog, in which classes of logical queries are compiled into differentiable
functions in a neural-network infrastructure such as Tensorflow or Theano. This
leads to a close integration of probabilistic logical reasoning with
deep-learning infrastructure: in particular, it enables high-performance deep
learning frameworks to be used for tuning the parameters of a probabilistic
logic. Experimental results show that TensorLog scales to problems involving
hundreds of thousands of knowledge-base triples and tens of thousands of
examples.

 <dc:description>  Sonography synthesis has a wide range of applications, including medical
procedure simulation, clinical training and multimodality image registration.
In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to simulate ultrasound
images at given 3D spatial locations (relative to the patient anatomy), based
on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). In particular, we
introduce a novel neural network architecture that can sample anatomically
accurate images conditionally on spatial position of the (real or mock)
freehand ultrasound probe. To ensure an effective and efficient spatial
information assimilation, the proposed spatially-conditioned GANs take
calibrated pixel coordinates in global physical space as conditioning input,
and utilise residual network units and shortcuts of conditioning data in the
GANs' discriminator and generator, respectively. Using optically tracked B-mode
ultrasound images, acquired by an experienced sonographer on a fetus phantom,
we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by two sets of
quantitative results: distances were calculated between corresponding
anatomical landmarks identified in the held-out ultrasound images and the
simulated data at the same locations unseen to the networks; a usability study
was carried out to distinguish the simulated data from the real images. In
summary, we present what we believe are state-of-the-art visually realistic
ultrasound images, simulated by the proposed GAN architecture that is stable to
train and capable of generating plausibly diverse image samples.

 <dc:description>  Recognizing facial action units (AUs) from spontaneous facial expressions is
still a challenging problem. Most recently, CNNs have shown promise on facial
AU recognition. However, the learned CNNs are often overfitted and do not
generalize well to unseen subjects due to limited AU-coded training images. We
proposed a novel Incremental Boosting CNN (IB-CNN) to integrate boosting into
the CNN via an incremental boosting layer that selects discriminative neurons
from the lower layer and is incrementally updated on successive mini-batches.
In addition, a novel loss function that accounts for errors from both the
incremental boosted classifier and individual weak classifiers was proposed to
fine-tune the IB-CNN. Experimental results on four benchmark AU databases have
demonstrated that the IB-CNN yields significant improvement over the
traditional CNN and the boosting CNN without incremental learning, as well as
outperforming the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods in AU recognition. The
improvement is more impressive for the AUs that have the lowest frequencies in
the databases.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present a novel compact scene representation based on Stixels
that infers geometric and semantic information. Our approach overcomes the
previous rather restrictive geometric assumptions for Stixels by introducing a
novel depth model to account for non-flat roads and slanted objects. Both
semantic and depth cues are used jointly to infer the scene representation in a
sound global energy minimization formulation. Furthermore, a novel
approximation scheme is introduced that uses an extremely efficient
over-segmentation. In doing so, the computational complexity of the Stixel
inference algorithm is reduced significantly, achieving real-time computation
capabilities with only a slight drop in accuracy. We evaluate the proposed
approach in terms of semantic and geometric accuracy as well as run-time on
four publicly available benchmark datasets. Our approach maintains accuracy on
flat road scene datasets while improving substantially on a novel non-flat road
dataset.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Distributed network optimization has been studied for well over a decade.
However, we still do not have a good idea of how to design schemes that can
simultaneously provide good performance across the dimensions of utility
optimality, convergence speed, and delay. To address these challenges, in this
paper, we propose a new algorithmic framework with all these metrics
approaching optimality. The salient features of our new algorithm are
three-fold: (i) fast convergence: it converges with only $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$
iterations that is the fastest speed among all the existing algorithms; (ii)
low delay: it guarantees optimal utility with finite queue length; (iii) simple
implementation: the control variables of this algorithm are based on virtual
queues that do not require maintaining per-flow information. The new technique
builds on a kind of inexact Uzawa method in the Alternating Directional Method
of Multiplier, and provides a new theoretical path to prove global and linear
convergence rate of such a method without requiring the full rank assumption of
the constraint matrix.

integrate memory and logic dies in a single stack, are becoming popular. These
memories, such as Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC), utilize a network-on-chip (NoC)

of NoC, in addition to aiding processing-in-memory capabilities, enables
numerous benefits such as high bandwidth and memory-level parallelism. However,

of memory access latency and bandwidth have not been fully explored. This paper
addresses this knowledge gap by (i) characterizing an HMC prototype on the
AC-510 accelerator board and revealing its access latency behaviors, and (ii)
by investigating the implications of such behaviors on system and software
designs.

 <dc:description>  Stable Marriage is a fundamental problem to both computer science and
economics. Four well-known NP-hard optimization versions of this problem are
the Sex-Equal Stable Marriage (SESM), Balanced Stable Marriage (BSM),
max-Stable Marriage with Ties (max-SMT) and min-Stable Marriage with Ties
(min-SMT) problems. In this paper, we analyze these problems from the viewpoint
of Parameterized Complexity. We conduct the first study of these problems with
respect to the parameter treewidth. First, we study the treewidth $\mathtt{tw}$
of the primal graph. We establish that all four problems are W[1]-hard. In
particular, while it is easy to show that all four problems admit algorithms
that run in time $n^{O(\mathtt{tw})}$, we prove that all of these algorithms
are likely to be essentially optimal. Next, we study the treewidth
$\mathtt{tw}$ of the rotation digraph. In this context, the max-SMT and min-SMT
are not defined. For both SESM and BSM, we design (non-trivial) algorithms that
run in time $2^{\mathtt{tw}}n^{O(1)}$. Then, for both SESM and BSM, we also
prove that unless SETH is false, algorithms that run in time
$(2-\epsilon)^{\mathtt{tw}}n^{O(1)}$ do not exist for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$.
We thus present a comprehensive, complete picture of the behavior of central
optimization versions of Stable Marriage with respect to treewidth.

 <dc:description>  This paper is about three virtualization modes: VMware, Parallels, and Boot
Camping. The trade off of their testing is the hardware requirements. The main
question is, among the three, which is the most suitable? The answer actually
varies from user to user. It depends on the user needs. Moreover, it is
necessary to consider its performance, graphics, efficiency and reliability,
and interoperability, and that is our major scope. In order to take the final
decision in choosing one of the modes it is important to run some tests, which
costs a lot in terms of money, complexity, and time consumption. Therefore, in
order to overcome this trade off, most of the research has been done through
online benchmarking and my own anticipation. The final solution was extracted
after comparing all previously mentioned above and after rigorous testing made
which will be introduced later in this document.

 <dc:description>  The recent boom of AI has seen the emergence of many human-computer
conversation systems such as Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, Amazon Echo
and Apple Siri. We introduce and formalize the task of predicting questions in
conversations, where the goal is to predict the new question that the user will
ask, given the past conversational context. This task can be modeled as a
&quot;sequence matching&quot; problem, where two sequences are given and the aim is to
learn a model that maps any pair of sequences to a matching probability. Neural
matching models, which adopt deep neural networks to learn sequence
representations and matching scores, have attracted immense research interests
of information retrieval and natural language processing communities. In this
paper, we first study neural matching models for the question retrieval task
that has been widely explored in the literature, whereas the effectiveness of
neural models for this task is relatively unstudied. We further evaluate the
neural matching models in the next question prediction task in conversations.
We have used the publicly available Quora data and Ubuntu chat logs in our
experiments. Our evaluations investigate the potential of neural matching
models with representation learning for question retrieval and next question
prediction in conversations. Experimental results show that neural matching
models perform well for both tasks.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces and evaluates a hybrid technique that fuses efficiently
the eye-tracking principles of photosensor oculography (PSOG) and video
oculography (VOG). The main concept of this novel approach is to use a few fast
and power-economic photosensors as the core mechanism for performing high speed
eye-tracking, whereas in parallel, use a video sensor operating at low
sampling-rate (snapshot mode) to perform dead-reckoning error correction when
sensor movements occur. In order to evaluate the proposed method, we simulate
the functional components of the technique and present our results in
experimental scenarios involving various combinations of horizontal and
vertical eye and sensor movements. Our evaluation shows that the developed
technique can be used to provide robustness to sensor shifts that otherwise
could induce error larger than 5 deg. Our analysis suggests that the technique
can potentially enable high speed eye-tracking at low power profiles, making it
suitable to be used in emerging head-mounted devices, e.g. AR/VR headsets.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a renewed overview of photosensor oculography (PSOG), an
eye-tracking technique based on the principle of using simple photosensors to
measure the amount of reflected (usually infrared) light when the eye rotates.
Photosensor oculography can provide measurements with high precision, low
latency and reduced power consumption, and thus it appears as an attractive
option for performing eye-tracking in the emerging head-mounted interaction
devices, e.g. augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets. In our current
work we employ an adjustable simulation framework as a common basis for
performing an exploratory study of the eye-tracking behavior of different
photosensor oculography designs. With the performed experiments we explore the
effects from the variation of some basic parameters of the designs on the
resulting accuracy and cross-talk, which are crucial characteristics for the
seamless operation of human-computer interaction applications based on
eye-tracking. Our experimental results reveal the design trade-offs that need
to be adopted to tackle the competing conditions that lead to optimum
performance of different eye-tracking characteristics. We also present the
transformations that arise in the eye-tracking output when sensor shifts occur,
and assess the resulting degradation in accuracy for different combinations of
eye movements and sensor shifts.

 <dc:title>Wide Inference Network for Image Denoising via Learning
  Pixel-distribution Prior</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Peng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Fang, Ruogu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We explore an innovative strategy for image denoising by using convolutional
neural networks (CNN) to learn similar pixel-distribution features from noisy
images. Many types of image noise follow a certain pixel-distribution in
common, such as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). By increasing CNN's width
with larger reception fields and more channels in each layer, CNNs can reveal
the ability to extract more accurate pixel-distribution features. The key to
our approach is a discovery that wider CNNs with more convolutions tend to
learn the similar pixel-distribution features, which reveals a new strategy to
solve low-level vision problems effectively that the inference mapping
primarily relies on the priors behind the noise property instead of deeper CNNs
with more stacked nonlinear layers. We evaluate our work, Wide inference
Networks (WIN), on AWGN and demonstrate that by learning pixel-distribution
features from images, WIN-based network consistently achieves significantly
better performance than current state-of-the-art deep CNN-based methods in both
quantitative and visual evaluations. \textit{Code and models are available at

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of false data injection attacks modeled as additive
disturbances in various parts of a general LTI feedback system and derive
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stealthy unbounded
attacks. We also consider the problem of characterizing the worst, bounded and
stealthy attacks. This problem involves a maximization of a convex function
subject to convex constraints, and hence, in principle, it is not easy to
solve. However, by employing a $\ell_\infty$ framework, we show how tractable
Linear Programming (LP) methods can be used to obtain the worst attack design.
Moreover, we provide a controller synthesis iterative method to minimize the
worst impact of such attacks.

 <dc:description>  The cooperative hierarchical structure is a common and significant data
structure observed in, or adopted by, many research areas, such as: text mining
(author-paper-word) and multi-label classification (label-instance-feature).
Renowned Bayesian approaches for cooperative hierarchical structure modeling
are mostly based on topic models. However, these approaches suffer from a
serious issue in that the number of hidden topics/factors needs to be fixed in
advance and an inappropriate number may lead to overfitting or underfitting.
One elegant way to resolve this issue is Bayesian nonparametric learning, but
existing work in this area still cannot be applied to cooperative hierarchical
structure modeling.
  In this paper, we propose a cooperative hierarchical Dirichlet process (CHDP)
to fill this gap. Each node in a cooperative hierarchical structure is assigned
a Dirichlet process to model its weights on the infinite hidden factors/topics.
Together with measure inheritance from hierarchical Dirichlet process, two
kinds of measure cooperation, i.e., superposition and maximization, are defined
to capture the many-to-many relationships in the cooperative hierarchical
structure. Furthermore, two constructive representations for CHDP, i.e.,
stick-breaking and international restaurant process, are designed to facilitate
the model inference. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data with
cooperative hierarchical structures demonstrate the properties and the ability
of CHDP for cooperative hierarchical structure modeling and its potential for
practical application scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of designing efficient regularization algorithms when
regularization is encoded by a (strongly) convex functional. Unlike classical
penalization methods based on a relaxation approach, we propose an iterative
method where regularization is achieved via early stopping. Our results show
that the proposed procedure achieves the same recovery accuracy as penalization
methods, while naturally integrating computational considerations. An empirical
analysis on a number of problems provides promising results with respect to the

 <dc:description>  We propose a highly efficient and faster Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)
model with Deep Convolutional neural networks (Deep CNN). Deep CNN have
recently shown that they have a significant reconstruction performance on
single-image super-resolution. Current trend is using deeper CNN layers to
improve performance. However, deep models demand larger computation resources
and is not suitable for network edge devices like mobile, tablet and IoT
devices. Our model achieves state of the art reconstruction performance with at
least 10 times lower calculation cost by Deep CNN with Residual Net, Skip
Connection and Network in Network (DCSCN). A combination of Deep CNNs and Skip
connection layers is used as a feature extractor for image features on both
local and global area. Parallelized 1x1 CNNs, like the one called Network in
Network, is also used for image reconstruction. That structure reduces the
dimensions of the previous layer's output for faster computation with less
information loss, and make it possible to process original images directly.
Also we optimize the number of layers and filters of each CNN to significantly
reduce the calculation cost. Thus, the proposed algorithm not only achieves the
state of the art performance but also achieves faster and efficient
computation. Code is available at

 <dc:description>  Zero-shot learning (ZSL) highly depends on a good semantic embedding to
connect the seen and unseen classes. Recently, distributed word embeddings
(DWE) pre-trained from large text corpus have become a popular choice to draw
such a connection. Compared with human defined attributes, DWEs are more
scalable and easier to obtain. However, they are designed to reflect semantic
similarity rather than visual similarity and thus using them in ZSL often leads
to inferior performance. To overcome this visual-semantic discrepancy, this
work proposes an objective function to re-align the distributed word embeddings
with visual information by learning a neural network to map it into a new
representation called visually aligned word embedding (VAWE). Thus the
neighbourhood structure of VAWEs becomes similar to that in the visual domain.
Note that in this work we do not design a ZSL method that projects the visual
features and semantic embeddings onto a shared space but just impose a
requirement on the structure of the mapped word embeddings. This strategy
allows the learned VAWE to generalize to various ZSL methods and visual
features. As evaluated via four state-of-the-art ZSL methods on four benchmark
datasets, the VAWE exhibit consistent performance improvement.

 <dc:description>  We study the coordination and control problem of distributed discrete-event
systems with synchronous communication, in the presence of subsystems whose
sensors and/or actuators may be affected by unexpected failures. We model
sensor failures as permanent loss of observability of certain sensor events
that belong to a subsystem, while characterize actuator failures as loss of
controllability of the subsystems' actuator events. The failure tolerance
property requires that the distributed discrete-event systems satisfy a global
specification prior to as well as after occurrences of potential failures. To
prevent the failure-pruned subsystems from jeopardizing the fulfillment of the
specification, we propose automaton-theoretic frameworks corresponding to the
enforcement of sensor and actuator failure tolerance by incorporating
learning-based supervisor synthesis and coordination approaches with
appropriate post-failure control reconfiguration schemes. The effectiveness of
the proposed frameworks is demonstrated by an illustrative example.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  A novel distributed energy allocation mechanism for Distribution System
Operator (DSO) market through a bi-level iterative auction is proposed. With
the locational marginal price at the substation node known, the DSO runs an
upper level auction with aggregators as intermediate agents competing for
energy. This DSO level auction takes into account physical grid constraints
such as line flows, transformer capacities and node voltage limits. This
auction mechanism is a straightforward implementation of projected gradient
descent on the social welfare (SW) of all home level agents. Aggregators, which
serve home level agents - both buyers and sellers, implement lower level
auctions in parallel, through proportional allocation and without asking for
utility functions and generation capacities that are considered private
information. The overall bi-level auction is shown to be efficient and weakly
budget balanced.

 <dc:description>  Most neural machine translation (NMT) models are based on the sequential
encoder-decoder framework, which makes no use of syntactic information. In this
paper, we improve this model by explicitly incorporating source-side syntactic
trees. More specifically, we propose (1) a bidirectional tree encoder which
learns both sequential and tree structured representations; (2) a tree-coverage
model that lets the attention depend on the source-side syntax. Experiments on
Chinese-English translation demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the
sequential attentional model as well as a stronger baseline with a bottom-up
tree encoder and word coverage.

 <dc:description>  Pairwise ranking methods are the basis of many widely used discriminative
training approaches for structure prediction problems in natural language
processing(NLP). Decomposing the problem of ranking hypotheses into pairwise
comparisons enables simple and efficient solutions. However, neglecting the
global ordering of the hypothesis list may hinder learning. We propose a
listwise learning framework for structure prediction problems such as machine
translation. Our framework directly models the entire translation list's
ordering to learn parameters which may better fit the given listwise samples.
Furthermore, we propose top-rank enhanced loss functions, which are more
sensitive to ranking errors at higher positions. Experiments on a large-scale
Chinese-English translation task show that both our listwise learning framework
and top-rank enhanced listwise losses lead to significant improvements in
translation quality.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a novel iterative framework for subspace clustering in a
learned discriminative feature domain. This framework consists of two modules
of fuzzy sparse subspace clustering and discriminative transformation learning.
In the first module, fuzzy latent labels containing discriminative information
and latent representations capturing the subspace structure will be
simultaneously evaluated in a feature domain. Then the linear transforming
operator with respect to the feature domain will be successively updated in the
second module with the advantages of more discrimination, subspace structure
preservation and robustness to outliers. These two modules will be
alternatively carried out and both theoretical analysis and empirical
evaluations will demonstrate its effectiveness and superiorities. In
particular, experimental results on three benchmark databases for subspace
clustering clearly illustrate that the proposed framework can achieve
significant improvements than other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
clustering accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin are gaining traction for exchanging
payments in a secure and decentralized manner. Their need to achieve consensus
across a large number of participants, however, fundamentally limits their
performance. We describe Teechain, a new off-chain payment protocol that
utilizes trusted execution environments (TEEs) to perform secure, efficient and
scalable fund transfers on top of a blockchain, with asynchronous blockchain
access. Teechain introduces secure payment chains to route payments across
multiple payment channels. Teechain mitigates failures of TEEs with two
strategies: (i) backups to persistent storage and (ii) a novel variant of
chain-replication. We evaluate an implementation of Teechain using Intel SGX as
the TEE and the operational Bitcoin blockchain. Our prototype achieves orders
of magnitude improvement in most metrics compared to existing implementations
of payment channels: with replicated Teechain nodes in a trans-atlantic
deployment, we measure a throughput of over 33,000 transactions per second with
0.1 second latency.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we focus on the problem of image instance retrieval with deep
descriptors extracted from pruned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The
objective is to heavily prune convolutional edges while maintaining retrieval
performance. To this end, we introduce both data-independent and data-dependent
heuristics to prune convolutional edges, and evaluate their performance across
various compression rates with different deep descriptors over several
benchmark datasets. Further, we present an end-to-end framework to fine-tune
the pruned network, with a triplet loss function specially designed for the
retrieval task. We show that the combination of heuristic pruning and
fine-tuning offers 5x compression rate without considerable loss in retrieval
performance.

 <dc:description>  We consider a problem of minimum length scheduling for the conflict-free
aggregation convergecast in wireless networks in a case when each element of a
network uses its own frequency channel. This problem is equivalent to the
well-known NP-hard problem of telephone broadcasting since only the conflicts
between the children of the same parent are taken into account. We propose a
new integer programming formulation and compare it with the known one by
running the CPLEX software package. Based on the results of a numerical
experiment, we concluded that our formulation is more preferable in practice to
solve the considered problem by CPLEX than the known one. We also propose a
novel heuristic algorithm, which is based on a genetic algorithm and a local
search metaheuristic. The simulation results demonstrate the high quality of
the proposed algorithm compared to the best known approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the design of a control model to navigate the
differential mobile robot to reach the desired destination from an arbitrary
initial pose. The designed model is divided into two stages: the state
estimation and the stabilization control. In the state estimation, an extended
Kalman filter is employed to optimally combine the information from the system
dynamics and measurements. Two Lyapunov functions are constructed that allow a
hybrid feedback control law to execute the robot movements. The asymptotical
stability and robustness of the closed loop system are assured. Simulations and
experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness and applicability of
the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Multiple-view triangulation by $\ell_{\infty}$ minimisation has become
established in computer vision. State-of-the-art $\ell_{\infty}$ triangulation
algorithms exploit the quasiconvexity of the cost function to derive iterative
update rules that deliver the global minimum. Such algorithms, however, can be
computationally costly for large problem instances that contain many image
measurements, e.g., from web-based photo sharing sites or long-term video
recordings. In this paper, we prove that $\ell_{\infty}$ triangulation admits a
coreset approximation scheme, which seeks small representative subsets of the
input data called coresets. A coreset possesses the special property that the
error of the $\ell_{\infty}$ solution on the coreset is within known bounds
from the global minimum. We establish the necessary mathematical underpinnings
of the coreset algorithm, specifically, by enacting the stopping criterion of
the algorithm and proving that the resulting coreset gives the desired
approximation accuracy. On large-scale triangulation problems, our method
provides theoretically sound approximate solutions. Iterated until convergence,
our coreset algorithm is also guaranteed to reach the true optimum. On
practical datasets, we show that our technique can in fact attain the global

 <dc:title>Detecting Intentional Lexical Ambiguity in English Puns</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The article describes a model of automatic analysis of puns, where a word is
intentionally used in two meanings at the same time (the target word). We
employ Roget's Thesaurus to discover two groups of words which, in a pun, form
around two abstract bits of meaning (semes). They become a semantic vector,
based on which an SVM classifier learns to recognize puns, reaching a score
0.73 for F-measure. We apply several rule-based methods to locate intentionally
ambiguous (target) words, based on structural and semantic criteria. It appears
that the structural criterion is more effective, although it possibly
characterizes only the tested dataset. The results we get correlate with the
results of other teams at SemEval-2017 competition (Task 7 Detection and
Interpretation of English Puns) considering effects of using supervised
learning models and word statistics.

 <dc:description>  Information extraction and user intention identification are central topics
in modern query understanding and recommendation systems. In this paper, we
propose DeepProbe, a generic information-directed interaction framework which
is built around an attention-based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) recurrent
neural network. DeepProbe can rephrase, evaluate, and even actively ask
questions, leveraging the generative ability and likelihood estimation made
possible by seq2seq models. DeepProbe makes decisions based on a derived
uncertainty (entropy) measure conditioned on user inputs, possibly with
multiple rounds of interactions. Three applications, namely a rewritter, a
relevance scorer and a chatbot for ad recommendation, were built around
DeepProbe, with the first two serving as precursory building blocks for the
third. We first use the seq2seq model in DeepProbe to rewrite a user query into
one of standard query form, which is submitted to an ordinary recommendation
system. Secondly, we evaluate DeepProbe's seq2seq model-based relevance
scoring. Finally, we build a chatbot prototype capable of making active user
interactions, which can ask questions that maximize information gain, allowing
for a more efficient user intention idenfication process. We evaluate first two
applications by 1) comparing with baselines by BLEU and AUC, and 2) human judge
evaluation. Both demonstrate significant improvements compared with current
state-of-the-art systems, proving their values as useful tools on their own,
and at the same time laying a good foundation for the ongoing chatbot
application.

 <dc:description>  Techniques for dense semantic correspondence have provided limited ability to
deal with the geometric variations that commonly exist between semantically
similar images. While variations due to scale and rotation have been examined,
there lack practical solutions for more complex deformations such as affine
transformations because of the tremendous size of the associated solution
space. To address this problem, we present a discrete-continuous transformation
matching (DCTM) framework where dense affine transformation fields are inferred
through a discrete label optimization in which the labels are iteratively
updated via continuous regularization. In this way, our approach draws
solutions from the continuous space of affine transformations in a manner that
can be computed efficiently through constant-time edge-aware filtering and a
proposed affine-varying CNN-based descriptor. Experimental results show that
this model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for dense semantic
correspondence on various benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Although neural networks could achieve state-of-the-art performance while
recongnizing images, they often suffer a tremendous defeat from adversarial
examples--inputs generated by utilizing imperceptible but intentional
perturbation to clean samples from the datasets. How to defense against
adversarial examples is an important problem which is well worth researching.
So far, very few methods have provided a significant defense to adversarial
examples. In this paper, a novel idea is proposed and an effective framework
based Generative Adversarial Nets named APE-GAN is implemented to defense
against the adversarial examples. The experimental results on three benchmark
datasets including MNIST, CIFAR10 and ImageNet indicate that APE-GAN is
effective to resist adversarial examples generated from five attacks.

 <dc:description>  The article describes a model of automatic interpretation of English puns,
based on Roget's Thesaurus, and its implementation, PunFields. In a pun, the
algorithm discovers two groups of words that belong to two main semantic
fields. The fields become a semantic vector based on which an SVM classifier
learns to recognize puns. A rule-based model is then applied for recognition of
intentionally ambiguous (target) words and their definitions. In SemEval Task 7
PunFields shows a considerably good result in pun classification, but requires
improvement in searching for the target word and its definition.

 <dc:description>  Being a matter of cognition, user interests should be apt to classification
independent of the language of users, social network and content of interest
itself. To prove it, we analyze a collection of English and Russian Twitter and
Vkontakte community pages by interests of their followers. First, we create a
model of Major Interests (MaIs) with the help of expert analysis and then
classify a set of pages using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Neural Network,
Naive Bayes, and some other). We take three interest domains that are typical
of both English and Russian-speaking communities: football, rock music,
vegetarianism. The results of classification show a greater correlation between
Russian-Vkontakte and Russian-Twitter pages while English-Twitterpages appear
to provide the highest score.

 <dc:description>  Since the advent of online real estate database companies like Zillow, Trulia
and Redfin, the problem of automatic estimation of market values for houses has
received considerable attention. Several real estate websites provide such
estimates using a proprietary formula. Although these estimates are often close
to the actual sale prices, in some cases they are highly inaccurate. One of the
key factors that affects the value of a house is its interior and exterior
appearance, which is not considered in calculating automatic value estimates.
In this paper, we evaluate the impact of visual characteristics of a house on
its market value. Using deep convolutional neural networks on a large dataset
of photos of home interiors and exteriors, we develop a method for estimating
the luxury level of real estate photos. We also develop a novel framework for
automated value assessment using the above photos in addition to home
characteristics including size, offered price and number of bedrooms. Finally,
by applying our proposed method for price estimation to a new dataset of real
estate photos and metadata, we show that it outperforms Zillow's estimates.

 <dc:description>  In the classic Maximum Weight Independent Set problem we are given a graph
$G$ with a nonnegative weight function on vertices, and the goal is to find an
independent set in $G$ of maximum possible weight. While the problem is NP-hard
in general, we give a polynomial-time algorithm working on any $P_6$-free
graph, that is, a graph that has no path on $6$ vertices as an induced
subgraph. This improves the polynomial-time algorithm on $P_5$-free graphs of
Lokshtanov et al. (SODA 2014), and the quasipolynomial-time algorithm on
$P_6$-free graphs of Lokshtanov et al (SODA 2016). The main technical
contribution leading to our main result is enumeration of a polynomial-size
family $\mathcal{F}$ of vertex subsets with the following property: for every
maximal independent set $I$ in the graph, $\mathcal{F}$ contains all maximal
cliques of some minimal chordal completion of $G$ that does not add any edge
incident to a vertex of $I$.

 <dc:description>  We present Autonomous Rssi based RElative poSitioning and Tracking (ARREST),
a new robotic sensing system for tracking and following a moving, RF-emitting
object, which we refer to as the Leader, solely based on signal strength
information. This kind of system can expand the horizon of autonomous mobile
tracking and distributed robotics into many scenarios with limited visibility
such as nighttime, dense forests, and cluttered environments. Our proposed
tracking agent, which we refer to as the TrackBot, uses a single rotating,
off-the-shelf, directional antenna, novel angle and relative speed estimation
algorithms, and Kalman filtering to continually estimate the relative position
of the Leader with decimeter level accuracy (which is comparable to a
state-of-the-art multiple access point based RF-localization system) and the
relative speed of the Leader with accuracy on the order of 1 m/s. The TrackBot
feeds the relative position and speed estimates into a Linear Quadratic
Gaussian (LQG) controller to generate a set of control outputs to control the
orientation and the movement of the TrackBot. We perform an extensive set of
real world experiments with a full-fledged prototype to demonstrate that the
TrackBot is able to stay within 5m of the Leader with: (1) more than $99\%$
probability in line of sight scenarios, and (2) more than $70\%$ probability in
no line of sight scenarios, when it moves 1.8X faster than the Leader. For
ground truth estimation in real world experiments, we also developed an
integrated TDoA based distance and angle estimation system with centimeter
level localization accuracy in line of sight scenarios. While providing a first
proof of concept, our work opens the door to future research aimed at further
improvements of autonomous RF-based tracking.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose the joint learning attention and recurrent neural
network (RNN) models for multi-label classification. While approaches based on
the use of either model exist (e.g., for the task of image captioning),
training such existing network architectures typically require pre-defined
label sequences. For multi-label classification, it would be desirable to have
a robust inference process, so that the prediction error would not propagate
and thus affect the performance. Our proposed model uniquely integrates
attention and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, which not only addresses
the above problem but also allows one to identify visual objects of interests
with varying sizes without the prior knowledge of particular label ordering.
More importantly, label co-occurrence information can be jointly exploited by
our LSTM model. Finally, by advancing the technique of beam search, prediction
of multiple labels can be efficiently achieved by our proposed network model.

population from random samples. Our goal is to develop efficient testers while
guaranteeing Differential Privacy to the individuals of the population. We
describe an approach that yields sample-efficient differentially private
testers for these problems. Our theoretical results show that there exist
private identity and closeness testers that are nearly as sample-efficient as
their non-private counterparts. We perform an experimental evaluation of our
algorithms on synthetic data. Our experiments illustrate that our private
testers achieve small type I and type II errors with sample size sublinear in
the domain size of the underlying distributions.

 <dc:description>  Much work has been done in understanding human creativity and defining
measures to evaluate creativity. This is necessary mainly for the reason of
having an objective and automatic way of quantifying creative artifacts. In
this work, we propose a regression-based learning framework which takes into
account quantitatively the essential criteria for creativity like novelty,
influence, value and unexpectedness. As it is often the case with most creative
domains, there is no clear ground truth available for creativity. Our proposed
learning framework is applicable to all creative domains; yet we evaluate it on
a dataset of movies created from IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes due to availability
of audience and critic scores, which can be used as proxy ground truth labels
for creativity. We report promising results and observations from our
experiments in the following ways : 1) Correlation of creative criteria with
critic scores, 2) Improvement in movie rating prediction with inclusion of
various creative criteria, and 3) Identification of creative movies.

 <dc:description>  Existing Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems are weak AI systems and
exhibit limited capabilities when language generation tasks demand higher
levels of creativity, originality and brevity. Effective solutions or, at least
evaluations of modern NLG paradigms for such creative tasks have been elusive,
unfortunately. This paper introduces and addresses the task of coherent story
generation from independent descriptions, describing a scene or an event.
Towards this, we explore along two popular text-generation paradigms -- (1)
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), posing story generation as a translation
problem and (2) Deep Learning, posing story generation as a sequence to
sequence learning problem. In SMT, we chose two popular methods such as phrase
based SMT (PB-SMT) and syntax based SMT (SYNTAX-SMT) to `translate' the
incoherent input text into stories. We then implement a deep recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture that encodes sequence of variable length input
descriptions to corresponding latent representations and decodes them to
produce well formed comprehensive story like summaries. The efficacy of the
suggested approaches is demonstrated on a publicly available dataset with the
help of popular machine translation and summarization evaluation metrics.

 <dc:title>A hybrid feature selection for network intrusion detection systems:
  Central points</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Moustafa, Nour</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Network intrusion detection systems are an active area of research to
identify threats that face computer networks. Network packets comprise of high
dimensions which require huge effort to be examined effectively. As these
dimensions contain some irrelevant features, they cause a high False Alarm Rate
(FAR). In this paper, we propose a hybrid method as a feature selection, based
on the central points of attribute values and an Association Rule Mining
algorithm to decrease the FAR. This algorithm is designed to be implemented in
a short processing time, due to its dependency on the central points of feature
values with partitioning data records into equal parts. This algorithm is
applied on the UNSW-NB15 and the NSLKDD data sets to adopt the highest ranked
features. Some existing techniques are used to measure the accuracy and FAR.
The experimental results show the proposed model is able to improve the
accuracy and decrease the FAR. Furthermore, its processing time is extremely
short.

 <dc:description>  Several years of academic and industrial research efforts have converged to a
common understanding on fundamental security building blocks for the upcoming
Vehicular Communication (VC) systems. There is a growing consensus towards
deploying a special-purpose identity and credential management infrastructure,
i.e., a Vehicular Public-Key Infrastructure (VPKI), enabling pseudonymous
authentication, with standardization efforts towards that direction. In spite
of the progress made by standardization bodies (IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI) and
harmonization efforts (Car2Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC)), significant
questions remain unanswered towards deploying a VPKI. Deep understanding of the
VPKI, a central building block of secure and privacy-preserving VC systems, is
still lacking. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap. We present
SECMACE, a VPKI system, which is compatible with the IEEE 1609.2 and ETSI
standards specifications. We provide a detailed description of our
state-of-the-art VPKI that improves upon existing proposals in terms of
security and privacy protection, and efficiency. SECMACE facilitates
multi-domain operations in the VC systems and enhances user privacy, notably
preventing linking pseudonyms based on timing information and offering
increased protection even against honest-but-curious VPKI entities. We propose
multiple policies for the vehicle-VPKI interactions, based on which and two
large-scale mobility trace datasets, we evaluate the full-blown implementation
of SECMACE. With very little attention on the VPKI performance thus far, our
results reveal that modest computing resources can support a large area of
vehicles with very low delays and the most promising policy in terms of privacy
protection can be supported with moderate overhead.

 <dc:description>  In the Convex Body Chasing problem, we are given an initial point $v_0$ in
$R^d$ and an online sequence of $n$ convex bodies $F_1, ..., F_n$. When we
receive $F_i$, we are required to move inside $F_i$. Our goal is to minimize
the total distance travelled. This fundamental online problem was first studied
by Friedman and Linial (DCG 1993). They proved an $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$ lower
bound on the competitive ratio, and conjectured that a competitive ratio
depending only on d is possible. However, despite much interest in the problem,
the conjecture remains wide open.
  We consider the setting in which the convex bodies are nested: $F_1 \supset
... \supset F_n$. The nested setting is closely related to extending the online
LP framework of Buchbinder and Naor (ESA 2005) to arbitrary linear constraints.
Moreover, this setting retains much of the difficulty of the general setting
and captures an essential obstacle in resolving Friedman and Linial's
conjecture. In this work, we give the first $f(d)$-competitive algorithm for
chasing nested convex bodies in $R^d$.

 <dc:title>Global optimization for low-dimensional switching linear regression and

 <dc:creator>Lauer, Fabien</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper provides global optimization algorithms for two particularly
difficult nonconvex problems raised by hybrid system identification: switching
linear regression and bounded-error estimation. While most works focus on local
optimization heuristics without global optimality guarantees or with guarantees
valid only under restrictive conditions, the proposed approach always yields a
solution with a certificate of global optimality. This approach relies on a
branch-and-bound strategy for which we devise lower bounds that can be
efficiently computed. In order to obtain scalable algorithms with respect to
the number of data, we directly optimize the model parameters in a continuous
optimization setting without involving integer variables. Numerical experiments
show that the proposed algorithms offer a higher accuracy than convex
relaxations with a reasonable computational burden for hybrid system
identification. In addition, we discuss how bounded-error estimation is related
to robust estimation in the presence of outliers and exact recovery under
sparse noise, for which we also obtain promising numerical results.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Latent Gaussian Process Regression which is a latent variable
extension allowing modelling of non-stationary multi-modal processes using GPs.
The approach is built on extending the input space of a regression problem with
a latent variable that is used to modulate the covariance function over the
training data. We show how our approach can be used to model multi-modal and
non-stationary processes. We exemplify the approach on a set of synthetic data
and provide results on real data from motion capture and geostatistics.

 <dc:title>Beyond Forward Shortcuts: Fully Convolutional Master-Slave Networks
  (MSNets) with Backward Skip Connections for Semantic Segmentation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent deep CNNs contain forward shortcut connections; i.e. skip connections
from low to high layers. Reusing features from lower layers that have higher
resolution (location information) benefit higher layers to recover lost details
and mitigate information degradation. However, during inference the lower
layers do not know about high layer features, although they contain contextual
high semantics that benefit low layers to adaptively extract informative
features for later layers. In this paper, we study the influence of backward
skip connections which are in the opposite direction to forward shortcuts, i.e.
paths from high layers to low layers. To achieve this -- which indeed runs
counter to the nature of feed-forward networks -- we propose a new fully
convolutional model that consists of a pair of networks. A `Slave' network is
dedicated to provide the backward connections from its top layers to the
`Master' network's bottom layers. The Master network is used to produce the
final label predictions. In our experiments we validate the proposed FCN model
on ADE20K (ImageNet scene parsing), PASCAL-Context, and PASCAL VOC 2011
datasets.

enable the interconnection of different avionics domains with mixed-criticality
levels, e.g., legacy AFDX traffic, Flight Control and In-Flight Entertainment.
First, we present the main specifications of such a proposed solution. Then, we
detail the corresponding worst-case timing analysis, using the Network Calculus
framework, to infer real-time guarantees. Finally, we conduct the performance
analysis of such a proposal on a realistic AFDX configuration. Results show the
efficiency of the Extended AFDX standard to noticeably enhance the medium
priority level delay bounds, while respecting the higher priority level
constraints, in comparison with the legacy AFDX standard.

 <dc:description>  With SDN increasingly becoming an enabling technology for NFV in the cloud,
many virtualized network functions need to monitor the network state in order
to function properly. An outdated network view at the controllers can impact
the performance of those virtualized network functions. In earlier work, we
identified two main factors contributing to an outdated network view in the
case of a load-balancer: network state collection and controllers' state
distribution. In this paper, we anticipate that the impact might be different
in case of security functions. Therefore, we study the impact of an outdated
network view on an anomaly-based IDS application. In particular, we
investigate: (1) the impact of controllers' state distribution on the
performance of a distributed IDS in the case of a DDoS attack; and (2) the
impact of network state collection on the performance of an IDS in the case of
a TCP SYN flood attack. Our results showed that the outdated network view had
negative impact on the IDS anomaly-detection performance in the experiments
that we conducted.

 <dc:description>  Visual object tracking is a challenging computer vision task with numerous
real-world applications. Here we propose a simple but efficient Spectral Filter
Tracking (SFT)method. To characterize rotational and translation invariance of
tracking targets, the candidate image region is models as a pixelwise grid
graph. Instead of the conventional graph matching, we convert the tracking into
a plain least square regression problem to estimate the best center coordinate
of the target. But different from the holistic regression of correlation filter
based methods, SFT can operate on localized surrounding regions of each pixel
(i.e.,vertex) by using spectral graph filters, which thus is more robust to
resist local variations and cluttered background.To bypass the eigenvalue
decomposition problem of the graph Laplacian matrix L, we parameterize spectral
graph filters as the polynomial of L by spectral graph theory, in which L k
exactly encodes a k-hop local neighborhood of each vertex. Finally, the filter
parameters (i.e., polynomial coefficients) as well as feature projecting
functions are jointly integrated into the regression model.

 <dc:description>  Indoor wireless communication using Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) is becoming a
major need for the success of Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud robotics in
both developed and developing countries. With different operating conditions,
interference, obstacles and type of building materials used, it is difficult to
predict the path loss components in an indoor environment, which are crucial
for the network design. It has been observed that the indoor path loss models
proposed for western countries cannot be directly used in Indian scenarios due
to variations in building materials utilized, floor plans, etc. In this paper,
we have proposed a non-deterministic statistical indoor path loss model- Tata
Indoor Path Loss Model (T-IPLM) which can be used for the 2.4 - 2.5 GHz,
Industrial Scientific and Medical (ISM) band. To propose and validate, we have
conducted several drive tests with different conditions such as busy office
premise with obstacles, open office premise, corridor, canteen, and
multi-storey office locations, etc. We have also compared T-IPLM with popular
path loss models such as ITU-R and Log-distance; T-IPLM matches closely with
the drive test results as compared to other models. We believe that T-IPLM
model can be used extensively to design accurate indoor communication networks
required for regular WiFi communications and deployment and operations of IoT
and cloud robotics.

 <dc:description>  We present a monitoring approach for verifying systems at runtime. Our
approach targets systems whose components communicate with the monitors over
unreliable channels, where messages can be delayed or lost. In contrast to
prior works, whose property specification languages are limited to
propositional temporal logics, our approach handles an extension of the
real-time logic MTL with freeze quantifiers for reasoning about data values. We
present its underlying theory based on a new three-valued semantics that is
well suited to soundly and completely reason online about event streams in the
presence of message delay or loss. We also evaluate our approach
experimentally. Our prototype implementation processes hundreds of events per
second in settings where messages are received out of order.

 <dc:title>The Finite Satisfiability Problem for Two-Variable, First-Order Logic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the two-variable fragment of first-order logic with one
distinguished binary predicate constrained to be interpreted as a transitive
relation. The finite satisfiability problem for this logic is shown to be
decidable, in triply exponential non-deterministic time. The complexity falls
to doubly exponential non-deterministic time if the distinguished binary
predicate is constrained to be interpreted as a partial order.

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of one-shot learning of visual categories. In this paper
we explore a Bayesian procedure for updating a pretrained convnet to classify a
novel image category for which data is limited. We decompose this convnet into
a fixed feature extractor and softmax classifier. We assume that the target
weights for the new task come from the same distribution as the pretrained
softmax weights, which we model as a multivariate Gaussian. By using this as a
prior for the new weights, we demonstrate competitive performance with
state-of-the-art methods whilst also being consistent with 'normal' methods for
training deep networks on large data.

 <dc:description>  Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) from a monocular camera has been
a well researched area. However, estimating camera pose and 3d geometry
reliably for egocentric videos still remain a challenge. Some of the common
causes of failures are dominant 3D rotations and low parallax between
successive frames, resulting in unreliable pose and 3d estimates. For forward
moving cameras, with no opportunities for loop closures, the drift leads to
eventual failures for traditional feature based and direct SLAM techniques. We
propose a novel batch mode structure from motion based technique for robust
SLAM in such scenarios. In contrast to most of the existing techniques, we
process frames in short batches, wherein we exploit short loop closures arising
out of to-and-fro motion of wearer's head, and stabilize the egomotion
estimates by 2D batch mode techniques such as motion averaging on pairwise
epipolar results. Once pose estimates are obtained reliably over a batch, we
refine the 3d estimate by triangulation and batch mode Bundle Adjustment (BA).
Finally, we merge the batches using 3D correspondences and carry out a BA
refinement post merging. We present both qualitative and quantitative
comparison of our method on various public first and third person video
datasets, to establish the robustness and accuracy of our algorithm over the
state of the art.

 <dc:title>Fast Feature Fool: A data independent approach to universal adversarial

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art object recognition Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are
shown to be fooled by image agnostic perturbations, called universal
adversarial perturbations. It is also observed that these perturbations
generalize across multiple networks trained on the same target data. However,
these algorithms require training data on which the CNNs were trained and
compute adversarial perturbations via complex optimization. The fooling
performance of these approaches is directly proportional to the amount of
available training data. This makes them unsuitable for practical attacks since
its unreasonable for an attacker to have access to the training data. In this
paper, for the first time, we propose a novel data independent approach to
generate image agnostic perturbations for a range of CNNs trained for object
recognition. We further show that these perturbations are transferable across
multiple network architectures trained either on same or different data. In the
absence of data, our method generates universal adversarial perturbations
efficiently via fooling the features learned at multiple layers thereby causing
CNNs to misclassify. Experiments demonstrate impressive fooling rates and
surprising transferability for the proposed universal perturbations generated
without any training data.

 <dc:title>One-shot Face Recognition by Promoting Underrepresented Classes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guo, Yandong</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Lei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study in this paper the problem of one-shot face recognition, with the
goal to build a large-scale face recognizer capable of recognizing a
substantial number of persons. Given that for face recognition one can leverage
a large-scale dataset to learn good face representation, our study shows that
the poor generalization ability of the one-shot classes is mainly caused by the
data imbalance problem, which cannot be effectively addressed by multinomial
logistic regression that is widely used as the final classification layer in
convolutional neural networks. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
supervision signal called underrepresented-classes promotion (UP) loss term,
which aligns the norms of the weight vectors of the one-shot classes (a.k.a.
underrepresented-classes) to those of the normal classes. In addition to the
original cross entropy loss, this new loss term effectively promotes the
underrepresented classes in the learned model and leads to a remarkable
improvement in face recognition performance. The experimental results on a
benchmark dataset of $21,000$ persons show that the new loss term significantly
helps improve the recognition coverage rate from $25.65\%$ to $77.48\%$ at the
precision of $99\%$ for underrepresented classes, while still keeps an overall
top-1 accuracy of $99.8\%$ for normal classes.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method for classifying resume data of job applicants into
27 different job categories using convolutional neural networks. Since resume
data is costly and hard to obtain due to its sensitive nature, we use domain
adaptation. In particular, we train a classifier on a large number of freely

empirically verify a reasonable classification performance of our approach
despite having only a small amount of labeled resume data available.

 <dc:description>  Graph signals offer a very generic and natural representation for data that
lives on networks or irregular structures. The actual data structure is however
often unknown a priori but can sometimes be estimated from the knowledge of the
application domain. If this is not possible, the data structure has to be
inferred from the mere signal observations. This is exactly the problem that we
address in this paper, under the assumption that the graph signals can be
represented as a sparse linear combination of a few atoms of a structured graph
dictionary. The dictionary is constructed on polynomials of the graph
Laplacian, which can sparsely represent a general class of graph signals
composed of localized patterns on the graph. We formulate a graph learning
problem, whose solution provides an ideal fit between the signal observations
and the sparse graph signal model. As the problem is non-convex, we propose to
solve it by alternating between a signal sparse coding and a graph update step.
We provide experimental results that outline the good graph recovery
performance of our method, which generally compares favourably to other recent
network inference algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Ongoing innovations in recurrent neural network architectures have provided a
steady influx of apparently state-of-the-art results on language modelling
benchmarks. However, these have been evaluated using differing code bases and
limited computational resources, which represent uncontrolled sources of
experimental variation. We reevaluate several popular architectures and
regularisation methods with large-scale automatic black-box hyperparameter
tuning and arrive at the somewhat surprising conclusion that standard LSTM
architectures, when properly regularised, outperform more recent models. We
establish a new state of the art on the Penn Treebank and Wikitext-2 corpora,
as well as strong baselines on the Hutter Prize dataset.

 <dc:description>  The Tucker decomposition expresses a given tensor as the product of a small
core tensor and a set of factor matrices. Apart from providing data
compression, the construction is useful in performing analysis such as
principal component analysis (PCA)and finds applications in diverse domains
such as signal processing, computer vision and text analytics. Our objective is
to develop an efficient distributed implementation for the case of dense
tensors. The implementation is based on the HOOI (Higher Order Orthogonal
Iterator) procedure, wherein the tensor-times-matrix product forms the core
routine. Prior work have proposed heuristics for reducing the computational
load and communication volume incurred by the routine. We study the two metrics
in a formal and systematic manner, and design strategies that are optimal under
the two fundamental metrics. Our experimental evaluation on a large benchmark
of tensors shows that the optimal strategies provide significant reduction in
load and volume compared to prior heuristics, and provide up to 7x speed-up in
the overall running time.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces GLINTS, a graphical tool for exploring variant
narrowing computations in Maude. The most recent version of Maude, version
2.7.1, provides quite sophisticated unification features, including
order-sorted equational unification for convergent theories modulo axioms such
as associativity, commutativity, and identity (ACU). This novel equational
unification relies on built-in generation of the set of 'variants' of a term
$t$, i.e., the canonical form of $t \sigma$ for a computed substitution
$\sigma$. Variant generation relies on a novel narrowing strategy called
'folding variant narrowing' that opens up new applications in formal reasoning,
theorem proving, testing, protocol analysis, and model checking, especially
when the theory satisfies the 'finite variant property', i.e., there is a
finite number of most general variants for every term in the theory. However,
variant narrowing computations can be extremely involved and are simply
presented in text format by Maude, often being too heavy to be debugged or even
understood. The GLINTS system provides support for (i) determining whether a
given theory satisfies the finite variant property, (ii) thoroughly exploring
variant narrowing computations, (iii) automatic checking of node 'embedding'
and 'closedness' modulo axioms, and (iv) querying and inspecting selected parts
of the variant trees. This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

 <dc:description>  We present a new technique for learning visual-semantic embeddings for
cross-modal retrieval. Inspired by the use of hard negatives in structured
prediction, and ranking loss functions used in retrieval, we introduce a simple
change to common loss functions used to learn multi-modal embeddings. That,
combined with fine-tuning and the use of augmented data, yields significant
gains in retrieval performance. We showcase our approach, dubbed VSE++, on the
MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, using ablation studies and comparisons with
existing methods. On MS-COCO our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
by 8.8% in caption retrieval, and 11.3% in image retrieval (based on R@1).

two words, are needed to compute the absence probability of a word in a random
text, or the numbers of common words shared by two random texts. In all these
contexts, one needs to compute or to query overlaps between pairs of words in a
given set. For this sake, we designed COvI, a compressed overlap index that
supports multiple queries on overlaps: like computing the correlation of two
words, or listing pairs of words whose longest overlap is maximal among all
possible pairs. COvI stores overlaps in a hierarchical and non-redundant
manner. We propose an implementation that can handle datasets of millions of
words and still answer queries efficiently. Comparison with a baseline solution
- called FullAC - relying on the Aho-Corasick automaton shows that COvI
provides significant advantages. For similar construction times, COvI requires
half the memory FullAC, and still solves complex queries much faster.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel formulation of robotic pick and place as a deep
reinforcement learning (RL) problem. Whereas most deep RL approaches to robotic
manipulation frame the problem in terms of low level states and actions, we
propose a more abstract formulation. In this formulation, actions are target
reach poses for the hand and states are a history of such reaches. We show this
approach can solve a challenging class of pick-place and regrasping problems
where the exact geometry of the objects to be handled is unknown. The only
information our method requires is: 1) the sensor perception available to the
robot at test time; 2) prior knowledge of the general class of objects for
which the system was trained. We evaluate our method using objects belonging to
two different categories, mugs and bottles, both in simulation and on real
hardware. Results show a major improvement relative to a shape primitives
baseline.

 <dc:description>  The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem implies the existence of voters, called
manipulators, who can change the election outcome in their favour by voting
strategically. When a given preference profile admits several such
manipulators, voting becomes a game played by these voters, who have to reason
strategically about each others' actions. To complicate the game even further,
counter-manipulators may then try to counteract the actions of manipulators.
Our voters are boundedly rational and do not think beyond manipulating or
countermanipulating. We call these games Gibbard--Satterthwaite Games. In this
paper we look for conditions that guarantee the existence of a Nash equilibria
in pure strategies.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new problem in the domain of mobile robots, which we term
dispersion. In this problem, $n$ robots are placed in an $n$ node graph
arbitrarily and must coordinate with each other to reach a final configuration
such that exactly one robot is at each node. We study this problem through the
lenses of minimizing the memory required by each robot and of minimizing the
number of rounds required to achieve dispersion.
  Dispersion is of interest due to its relationship to the problems of
scattering on a graph, exploration using mobile robots, and load balancing on a
graph. Additionally, dispersion has an immediate real world application due to
its relationship to the problem of recharging electric cars, as each car can be
considered a robot and recharging stations and the roads connecting them nodes
and edges of a graph respectively. Since recharging is a costly affair relative
to traveling, we want to distribute these cars amongst the various available
recharge points where communication should be limited to car-to-car
interactions.
  We provide lower bounds on both the memory required for robots to achieve
dispersion and the minimum running time to achieve dispersion on any type of
graph. We then analyze the trade-offs between time and memory for various types
of graphs. We provide time optimal and memory optimal algorithms for several
types of graphs and show the power of a little memory in terms of running time.

 <dc:description>  Representing texts as fixed-length vectors is central to many language
processing tasks. Most traditional methods build text representations based on
the simple Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation, which loses the rich semantic
relations between words. Recent advances in natural language processing have
shown that semantically meaningful representations of words can be efficiently
acquired by distributed models, making it possible to build text
representations based on a better foundation called the Bag-of-Word-Embedding
(BoWE) representation. However, existing text representation methods using BoWE
often lack sound probabilistic foundations or cannot well capture the semantic
relatedness encoded in word vectors. To address these problems, we introduce
the Spherical Paragraph Model (SPM), a probabilistic generative model based on
BoWE, for text representation. SPM has good probabilistic interpretability and
can fully leverage the rich semantics of words, the word co-occurrence
information as well as the corpus-wide information to help the representation
learning of texts. Experimental results on topical classification and sentiment
analysis demonstrate that SPM can achieve new state-of-the-art performances on
several benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Low-quality results have been a long-standing problem on microtask
crowdsourcing platforms, driving away requesters and justifying low wages for
workers. To date, workers have been blamed for low-quality results: they are
said to make as little effort as possible, do not pay attention to detail, and
lack expertise. In this paper, we hypothesize that requesters may also be
responsible for low-quality work: they launch unclear task designs that confuse
even earnest workers, under-specify edge cases, and neglect to include
examples. We introduce prototype tasks, a crowdsourcing strategy requiring all
new task designs to launch a small number of sample tasks. Workers attempt
these tasks and leave feedback, enabling the re- quester to iterate on the
design before publishing it. We report a field experiment in which tasks that
underwent prototype task iteration produced higher-quality work results than
the original task designs. With this research, we suggest that a simple and
rapid iteration cycle can improve crowd work, and we provide empirical evidence
that requester &quot;quality&quot; directly impacts result quality.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a generic pre-processor for expediting conventional
template matching techniques. Instead of locating the best matched patch in the
reference image to a query template via exhaustive search, the proposed
algorithm rules out regions with no possible matches with minimum computational
efforts. While working on simple patch features, such as mean, variance and
gradient, the fast pre-screening is highly discriminative. Its computational
efficiency is gained by using a novel octagonal-star-shaped template and the
inclusion-exclusion principle to extract and compare patch features. Moreover,
it can handle arbitrary rotation and scaling of reference images effectively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm greatly reduces
the search space while never missing the best match.

 <dc:title>Factorization Machines Leveraging Lightweight Linked Open Data-enabled

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the popularity of Linked Open Data (LOD) and the associated rise in
freely accessible knowledge that can be accessed via LOD, exploiting LOD for
recommender systems has been widely studied based on various approaches such as
graph-based or using different machine learning models with LOD-enabled
features. Many of the previous approaches require construction of an additional
graph to run graph-based algorithms or to extract path-based features by
combining user- item interactions (e.g., likes, dislikes) and background
knowledge from LOD. In this paper, we investigate Factorization Machines (FMs)
based on particularly lightweight LOD-enabled features which can be directly
obtained via a public SPARQL Endpoint without any additional effort to
construct a graph. Firstly, we aim to study whether using FM with these
lightweight LOD-enabled features can provide competitive performance compared
to a learning-to-rank approach leveraging LOD as well as other well-established
approaches such as kNN-item and BPRMF. Secondly, we are interested in finding
out to what extent each set of LOD-enabled features contributes to the
recommendation performance. Experimental evaluation on a standard dataset shows
that our proposed approach using FM with lightweight LOD-enabled features
provides the best performance compared to other approaches in terms of five
evaluation metrics. In addition, the study of the recommendation performance
based on different sets of LOD-enabled features indicate that property-object
lists and PageRank scores of items are useful for improving the performance,
and can provide the best performance through using them together for FM. We
observe that subject-property lists of items does not contribute to the
recommendation performance but rather decreases the performance.

 <dc:description>  Facial alignment involves finding a set of landmark points on an image with a
known semantic meaning. However, this semantic meaning of landmark points is
often lost in 2D approaches where landmarks are either moved to visible
boundaries or ignored as the pose of the face changes. In order to extract
consistent alignment points across large poses, the 3D structure of the face
must be considered in the alignment step. However, extracting a 3D structure
from a single 2D image usually requires alignment in the first place. We
present our novel approach to simultaneously extract the 3D shape of the face
and the semantically consistent 2D alignment through a 3D Spatial Transformer
Network (3DSTN) to model both the camera projection matrix and the warping
parameters of a 3D model. By utilizing a generic 3D model and a Thin Plate
Spline (TPS) warping function, we are able to generate subject specific 3D
shapes without the need for a large 3D shape basis. In addition, our proposed
network can be trained in an end-to-end framework on entirely synthetic data
from the 300W-LP dataset. Unlike other 3D methods, our approach only requires
one pass through the network resulting in a faster than real-time alignment.
Evaluations of our model on the Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW)
and AFLW2000-3D datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
over other 3D approaches to alignment.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work proposes a formulation of propositional logic, named Eigenlogic,
using quantum observables as propositions. The eigenvalues of these operators
are the truth-values and the associated eigenvectors the interpretations of the
propositional system. Fuzzy logic arises naturally when considering vectors
outside the eigensystem, the fuzzy membership function is obtained by the Born
rule of the logical observable.This approach is then applied in the context of
quantum robots using simple behavioral agents represented by Braitenberg
vehicles. Processing with non-classical logic such as multivalued logic, fuzzy
logic and the quantum Eigenlogic permits to enlarge the behavior possibilities
and the associated decisions of these simple agents.

 <dc:title>Quantum Computation via Sparse Distributed Representation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rinkus, Gerard J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantum superposition says that any physical system simultaneously exists in
all of its possible states, the number of which is exponential in the number of
entities composing the system. The strength of presence of each possible state
in the superposition, i.e., its probability of being observed, is represented
by its probability amplitude coefficient. The assumption that these
coefficients must be represented physically disjointly from each other, i.e.,
localistically, is nearly universal in the quantum theory/computing literature.
Alternatively, these coefficients can be represented using sparse distributed
representations (SDR), wherein each coefficient is represented by small subset
of an overall population of units, and the subsets can overlap. Specifically, I
consider an SDR model in which the overall population consists of Q WTA
clusters, each with K binary units. Each coefficient is represented by a set of
Q units, one per cluster. Thus, K^Q coefficients can be represented with KQ
units. Thus, the particular world state, X, whose coefficient's representation,
R(X), is the set of Q units active at time t has the max probability and the
probability of every other state, Y_i, at time t, is measured by R(Y_i)'s
intersection with R(X). Thus, R(X) simultaneously represents both the
particular state, X, and the probability distribution over all states. Thus,
set intersection may be used to classically implement quantum superposition. If
algorithms exist for which the time it takes to store (learn) new
representations and to find the closest-matching stored representation
(probabilistic inference) remains constant as additional representations are
stored, this meets the criterion of quantum computing. Such an algorithm has
already been described: it achieves this &quot;quantum speed-up&quot; without esoteric
hardware, and in fact, on a single-processor, classical (Von Neumann) computer.

$\mathbb{E}[X_i] = p_i$. The $k$'th power of this distribution, for $k$ in a

Bernoulli random variable $X_i^{(k)}$ has $\mathbb{E}[X_i^{(k)}] = (p_i)^k$.
The learning algorithm can query any power $P_k$ several times and succeeds in
learning all powers in the range, if with probability at least $1- \delta$:
given any $k \in [m]$, it returns a probability distribution $Q_k$ with total
variation distance from $P_k$ at most $\epsilon$. We provide almost matching
lower and upper bounds on query complexity for this problem. We first show a
lower bound on the query complexity on PBD powers instances with many distinct
parameters $p_i$ which are separated, and we almost match this lower bound by
examining the query complexity of simultaneously learning all the powers of a
special class of PBD's resembling the PBD's of our lower bound. We study the
fundamental setting of a Binomial distribution, and provide an optimal
algorithm which uses $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Diakonikolas, Kane and Stewart
[COLT'16] showed a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{1/\epsilon})$ samples to learn the
$p_i$'s within error $\epsilon$. The question whether sampling from powers of
PBDs can reduce this sampling complexity, has a negative answer since we show
that the exponential number of samples is inevitable. Having sampling access to
the powers of a PBD we then give a nearly optimal algorithm that learns its
$p_i$'s. To prove our two last lower bounds we extend the classical minimax
risk definition from statistics to estimating functions of sequences of
distributions.

 <dc:description>  Population aging and the ubiquity of technology in everyday life have made
designing solutions for older adults a necessity. User-centered and
participatory design approaches include elderly users in the software
development process to some extent but do not encourage them to take a leading
role in designing applications to address their unmet needs. Teaching seniors
about software design could help them actively participate in creating much
needed solutions for their age group but this cannot be done without first
understanding their conceptual models of technology. Past experiences play a
significant role in determining the way learners model abstract concepts and so
older adults' conceptual models of user interfaces (and human-computer
interaction in general) differ from those used in teaching application design
to younger students. In this paper we analyze a workshop on user interface
design and prototyping for seniors to better understand older adults' learning
process and the issues they encounter while learning abstract ideas related to
human-computer interaction. We conclude the study by proposing guidelines for
teaching older adults abstract technology related concepts.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous unpowered flight is a challenge for control and guidance systems:
all the energy the aircraft might use during flight has to be harvested
directly from the atmosphere. We investigate the design of an algorithm that
optimizes the closed-loop control of a glider's bank and sideslip angles, while
flying in the lower convective layer of the atmosphere in order to increase its
mission endurance. Using a Reinforcement Learning approach, we demonstrate the
possibility for real-time adaptation of the glider's behaviour to the
time-varying and noisy conditions associated with thermal soaring flight. Our
approach is online, data-based and model-free, hence avoids the pitfalls of
aerological and aircraft modelling and allow us to deal with uncertainties and
non-stationarity. Additionally, we put a particular emphasis on keeping low
computational requirements in order to make on-board execution feasible. This
article presents the stochastic, time-dependent aerological model used for
simulation, together with a standard aircraft model. Then we introduce an
adaptation of a Q-learning algorithm and demonstrate its ability to control the
aircraft and improve its endurance by exploiting updrafts in non-stationary
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We present a method for estimating M-dimensional structured channels that
uses techniques from the field of machine learning. Our channel model is
typical in communications: the channel vector is normally distributed given an
unknown covariance matrix, which depends on random parameters such as the
angles of the propagation paths. If the channel model exhibits certain Toeplitz
and shift-invariance structures, the complexity of the MMSE estimator can be
reduced to O(M log M) floating point operations. For general channels, it is
much higher, but we obtain a similarly efficient estimator by using the
structure of this specific MMSE estimator as an informed guess for the
architecture of a neural network. This network learns the MMSE estimator within
the given class of structured estimators from real or simulated channel
realizations. Numerical simulations with typical spatial channel models
demonstrate the generalization properties of the chosen structure to realistic
channel models.

 <dc:description>  A very desirable Datalog extension investigated by many researchers in the
last thirty years consists in allowing the use of the basic SQL aggregates min,
max, count and sum in recursive rules. In this paper, we propose a simple
comprehensive solution that extends the declarative least-fixpoint semantics of
Horn Clauses, along with the optimization techniques used in the bottom-up
implementation approach adopted by many Datalog systems. We start by
identifying a large class of programs of great practical interest in which the
use of min or max in recursive rules does not compromise the declarative
fixpoint semantics of the programs using those rules. Then, we revisit the
monotonic versions of count and sum aggregates proposed in (Mazuran et al.
2013b) and named, respectively, mcount and msum. Since mcount, and also msum on
positive numbers, are monotonic in the lattice of set-containment, they
preserve the fixpoint semantics of Horn Clauses. However, in many applications
of practical interest, their use can lead to inefficiencies, that can be
eliminated by combining them with max, whereby mcount and msum become the
standard count and sum. Therefore, the semantics and optimization techniques of
Datalog are extended to recursive programs with min, max, count and sum, making
possible the advanced applications of superior performance and scalability
demonstrated by BigDatalog (Shkapsky et al. 2016) and Datalog-MC (Yang et al.
2017). This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

feature extraction framework. The objective is to utilize and re-purpose
trained feature extractors without the need for network retraining on three
remote sensing tasks i.e. superpixel mapping, pixel-level segmentation and
semantic based image visualization. By leveraging the same convolutional
feature extractors and viewing them as visual information extractors that
encode different image representation spaces, we demonstrate a preliminary
inductive transfer learning potential on multiscale experiments that
incorporate edge-level details up to semantic-level information.

 <dc:description>  Very large overhead imagery associated with ground truth maps has the
potential to generate billions of training image patches for machine learning
algorithms. However, random sampling selection criteria often leads to
redundant and noisy-image patches for model training. With minimal research
efforts behind this challenge, the current status spells missed opportunities
to develop supervised learning algorithms that generalize over wide
geographical scenes. In addition, much of the computational cycles for large
scale machine learning are poorly spent crunching through noisy and redundant
image patches. We demonstrate a potential framework to address these challenges
specifically, while evaluating a human settlement detection task. A novel
binary search tree sampling scheme is fused with a kernel based hashing
procedure that maps image patches into hash-buckets using binary codes
generated from image content. The framework exploits inherent redundancy within
billions of image patches to promote mostly high variance preserving samples
for accelerating algorithmic training and increasing model generalization.

 <dc:description>  The ubiquity of online fashion shopping demands effective recommendation
services for customers. In this paper, we study two types of fashion
recommendation: (i) suggesting an item that matches existing components in a
set to form a stylish outfit (a collection of fashion items), and (ii)
generating an outfit with multimodal (images/text) specifications from a user.
To this end, we propose to jointly learn a visual-semantic embedding and the
compatibility relationships among fashion items in an end-to-end fashion. More
specifically, we consider a fashion outfit to be a sequence (usually from top
to bottom and then accessories) and each item in the outfit as a time step.
Given the fashion items in an outfit, we train a bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM)
model to sequentially predict the next item conditioned on previous ones to
learn their compatibility relationships. Further, we learn a visual-semantic
space by regressing image features to their semantic representations aiming to
inject attribute and category information as a regularization for training the
LSTM. The trained network can not only perform the aforementioned
recommendations effectively but also predict the compatibility of a given
outfit. We conduct extensive experiments on our newly collected Polyvore
dataset, and the results provide strong qualitative and quantitative evidence
that our framework outperforms alternative methods.

 <dc:description>  We investigate quantifier alternation hierarchies in first-order logic on

quantifier alternations in formulas. We prove that one can decide membership of
a regular language in the levels $\mathcal{B}{\Sigma}_2$ (finite boolean

(formulas having only two alternations and beginning with an existential
block). Our proofs work by considering a deeper problem, called separation,
which, once solved for lower levels, allows us to solve membership for higher
levels.

 <dc:title>An Iterative BP-CNN Architecture for Channel Decoding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Inspired by recent advances in deep learning, we propose a novel iterative
BP-CNN architecture for channel decoding under correlated noise. This
architecture concatenates a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) with a
standard belief-propagation (BP) decoder. The standard BP decoder is used to
estimate the coded bits, followed by a CNN to remove the estimation errors of
the BP decoder and obtain a more accurate estimation of the channel noise.
Iterating between BP and CNN will gradually improve the decoding SNR and hence
result in better decoding performance. To train a well-behaved CNN model, we
define a new loss function which involves not only the accuracy of the noise
estimation but also the normality test for the estimation errors, i.e., to
measure how likely the estimation errors follow a Gaussian distribution. The
introduction of the normality test to the CNN training shapes the residual
noise distribution and further reduces the BER of the iterative decoding,
compared to using the standard quadratic loss function. We carry out extensive
experiments to analyze and verify the proposed framework. The iterative BP-CNN
decoder has better BER performance with lower complexity, is suitable for
parallel implementation, does not rely on any specific channel model or
encoding method, and is robust against training mismatches. All of these
features make it a good candidate for decoding modern channel codes.

 <dc:description>  Network analysis techniques remain rarely used for understanding
international management strategies. Our paper highlights their value as
research tool in this field of social science using a large set of micro-data
(20,000) to investigate the presence of networks of subsidiaries overseas. The
research question is the following: to what extent did/do global Japanese
business networks mirror organizational models existing in Japan? In
particular, we would like to assess how much the links building such business
networks are shaped by the structure of big-size industrial conglomerates of
firms headquartered in Japan, also described as HK. The major part of the
academic community in the fields of management and industrial organization
considers that formal links can be identified among firms belonging to HK. Miwa
and Ramseyer (Miwa and Ramseyer 2002; Ramseyer 2006) challenge this claim and
argue that the evidence supporting the existence of HK is weak. So far,
quantitative empirical investigation has been conducted exclusively using data
for firms incorporated in Japan. Our study tests the Miwa-Ramseyer hypothesis
(MRH) at the global level using information on the network of Japanese
subsidiaries overseas. The results obtained lead us to reject the MRH for the
global dataset, as well as for subsets restricted to the two main
regions/countries of destination of Japanese foreign investment. The results
are robust to the weighting of the links, with different specifications, and
are observed in most industrial sectors. The global Japanese network became
increasingly complex during the late 20th century as a consequence of increase
in the number of Japanese subsidiaries overseas but the key features of the
structure remained rather stable. We draw implications of these findings for
academic research in international business and for professionals involved in
corporate strategy.

 <dc:description>  We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for consistent root
reconstruction in continuous-time Markov models with countable state space on
bounded-height trees. Here a root state estimator is said to be consistent if
the probability that it returns to the true root state converges to 1 as the
number of leaves tends to infinity. We also derive quantitative bounds on the
error of reconstruction. Our results answer a question of Gascuel and Steel and
have implications for ancestral sequence reconstruction in a classical
evolutionary model of nucleotide insertion and deletion.

 <dc:description>  Simulations of charge transport in graphene are presented by implementing a
recent method published on the paper: V. Romano, A. Majorana, M. Coco, &quot;DSMC
method consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle and comparison with
deterministic solutions for charge transport in graphene&quot;, Journal of
Computational Physics 302 (2015) 267-284. After an overview of the most
important aspects of the semiclassical transport model for the dynamics of
electrons in monolayer graphene, it is made a comparison in computational time
between MATLAB and Fortran implementations of the algorithms. Therefore it is
studied the case of graphene on substrates which it is produced original
results by introducing models for the distribution of distances between
graphene's atoms and impurities. Finally simulations, by choosing different
kind of substrates, are done.

 <dc:description>  In evolutionary biology, the speciation history of living organisms is
represented graphically by a phylogeny, that is, a rooted tree whose leaves
correspond to current species and branchings indicate past speciation events.
Phylogenies are commonly estimated from molecular sequences, such as DNA
sequences, collected from the species of interest. At a high level, the idea
behind this inference is simple: the further apart in the Tree of Life are two
species, the greater is the number of mutations to have accumulated in their
genomes since their most recent common ancestor. In order to obtain accurate
estimates in phylogenetic analyses, it is standard practice to employ
statistical approaches based on stochastic models of sequence evolution on a
tree. For tractability, such models necessarily make simplifying assumptions
about the evolutionary mechanisms involved. In particular, commonly omitted are
insertions and deletions of nucleotides -- also known as indels.
  Properly accounting for indels in statistical phylogenetic analyses remains a
major challenge in computational evolutionary biology. Here we consider the
problem of reconstructing ancestral sequences on a known phylogeny in a model
of sequence evolution incorporating nucleotide substitutions, insertions and
deletions, specifically the classical TKF91 process. We focus on the case of
dense phylogenies of bounded height, which we refer to as the taxon-rich
setting, where statistical consistency is achievable. We give the first
polynomial-time ancestral reconstruction algorithm with provable guarantees
under constant rates of mutation. Our algorithm succeeds when the phylogeny
satisfies the &quot;big bang&quot; condition, a necessary and sufficient condition for
statistical consistency in this context.

 <dc:description>  We formulate a multi-armed bandit (MAB) approach to choosing expert policies
online in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Given a set of expert policies
trained on a state and action space, the goal is to maximize the cumulative
reward of our agent. The hope is to quickly find the best expert in our set.
The MAB formulation allows us to quantify the performance of an algorithm in
terms of the regret incurred from not choosing the best expert from the
beginning. We first develop the theoretical framework for MABs in MDPs, and
then present a basic regret decomposition identity. We then adapt the classical
Upper Confidence Bounds algorithm to the problem of choosing experts in MDPs
and prove that the expected regret grows at worst at a logarithmic rate.
Lastly, we validate the theory on a small MDP.

 <dc:title>Enumeration of Self-Dual Cyclic Codes of some Specific Lengths over

 <dc:description>  Self-dual cyclic codes form an important class of linear codes. It has been
shown that there exists a self-dual cyclic code of length $n$ over a finite
field if and only if $n$ and the field characteristic are even. The enumeration
of such codes has been given under both the Euclidean and Hermitian products.
However, in each case, the formula for self-dual cyclic codes of length $n$
over a finite field contains a characteristic function which is not easily
computed. In this paper, we focus on more efficient ways to enumerate self-dual
cyclic codes of lengths $2^\nu p^r$ and $2^\nu p^rq^s$, where $\nu$, $r$, and
$s$ are positive integers. Some number theoretical tools are established. Based
on these results, alternative formulas and efficient algorithms to determine
the number of self-dual cyclic codes of such lengths are provided.

 <dc:description>  Short-circuit evaluation denotes the semantics of propositional connectives
in which the second argument is evaluated only if the first argument does not
suffice to determine the value of the expression. Free short-circuit logic is
the equational logic in which compound statements are evaluated from left to
right, while atomic evaluations are not memorized throughout the evaluation,
i.e., evaluations of distinct occurrences of an atom in a compound statement
may yield different truth values. We provide a simple semantics for free SCL
and an independent axiomatization. Finally, we discuss evaluation strategies,
some other SCLs, and side effects.

 <dc:title>Grounding Spatio-Semantic Referring Expressions for Human-Robot

 <dc:description>  The human language is one of the most natural interfaces for humans to
interact with robots. This paper presents a robot system that retrieves
everyday objects with unconstrained natural language descriptions. A core issue
for the system is semantic and spatial grounding, which is to infer objects and
their spatial relationships from images and natural language expressions. We
introduce a two-stage neural-network grounding pipeline that maps natural
language referring expressions directly to objects in the images. The first
stage uses visual descriptions in the referring expressions to generate a
candidate set of relevant objects. The second stage examines all pairwise
relationships between the candidates and predicts the most likely referred
object according to the spatial descriptions in the referring expressions. A
key feature of our system is that by leveraging a large dataset of images
labeled with text descriptions, it allows unrestricted object types and natural
language referring expressions. Preliminary results indicate that our system
outperforms a near state-of-the-art object comprehension system on standard
benchmark datasets. We also present a robot system that follows voice commands
to pick and place previously unseen objects.

 <dc:title>Circular Networks from Distorted Metrics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Trees have long been used as a graphical representation of species
relationships. However complex evolutionary events, such as genetic
reassortments or hybrid speciations which occur commonly in viruses, bacteria
and plants, do not fit into this elementary framework. Alternatively, various
network representations have been developed. Circular networks are a natural
generalization of leaf-labeled trees interpreted as split systems, that is,
collections of bipartitions over leaf labels corresponding to current species.
Although such networks do not explicitly model specific evolutionary events of
interest, their straightforward visualization and fast reconstruction have made
them a popular exploratory tool to detect network-like evolution in genetic
datasets.
  Standard reconstruction methods for circular networks, such as Neighbor-Net,
rely on an associated metric on the species set. Such a metric is first
estimated from DNA sequences, which leads to a key difficulty: distantly
related sequences produce statistically unreliable estimates. This is
problematic for Neighbor-Net as it is based on the popular tree reconstruction
method Neighbor-Joining, whose sensitivity to distance estimation errors is
well established theoretically. In the tree case, more robust reconstruction
methods have been developed using the notion of a distorted metric, which
captures the dependence of the error in the distance through a radius of
accuracy. Here we design the first circular network reconstruction method based
on distorted metrics. Our method is computationally efficient. Moreover, the
analysis of its radius of accuracy highlights the important role played by the
maximum incompatibility, a measure of the extent to which the network differs
from a tree.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we carry out a performance analysis from a probabilistic
perspective to introduce the EDHVW methods' expected performances and
limitations. Then, we propose a new general error diffusion based halftone
visual watermarking (EDHVW) method, Content aware Double-sided Embedding Error
Diffusion (CaDEED), via considering the expected watermark decoding performance
with specific content of the cover images and watermark, different noise
tolerance abilities of various cover image content and the different importance
levels of every pixel (when being perceived) in the secret pattern (watermark).
To demonstrate the effectiveness of CaDEED, we propose CaDEED with expectation
constraint (CaDEED-EC) and CaDEED-NVF&amp;IF (CaDEED-N&amp;I). Specifically, we build
CaDEED-EC by only considering the expected performances of specific cover
images and watermark. By adopting the noise visibility function (NVF) and
proposing the importance factor (IF) to assign weights to every embedding
location and watermark pixel, respectively, we build the specific method
CaDEED-N&amp;I. In the experiments, we select the optimal parameters for NVF and IF
via extensive experiments. In both the numerical and visual comparisons, the
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed work.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian optimization has recently attracted the attention of the automatic
machine learning community for its excellent results in hyperparameter tuning.
BO is characterized by the sample efficiency with which it can optimize
expensive black-box functions. The efficiency is achieved in a similar fashion
to the learning to learn methods: surrogate models (typically in the form of
Gaussian processes) learn the target function and perform intelligent sampling.
This surrogate model can be applied even in the presence of noise; however, as
with most regression methods, it is very sensitive to outlier data. This can
result in erroneous predictions and, in the case of BO, biased and inefficient
exploration. In this work, we present a GP model that is robust to outliers
which uses a Student-t likelihood to segregate outliers and robustly conduct
Bayesian optimization. We present numerical results evaluating the proposed
method in both artificial functions and real problems.

 <dc:description>  According to recent statistics, more than 1 zettabytes of data is moved over
the Internet annually, which consumes several terawatt hours of electricity,
and costs billions of US dollars to the world economy. HTTP protocol is used in
the majority of these data transfers, accounting for 70% of the global Internet
traffic. We claim that HTTP transfers, and the services based on HTTP, can
become more energy efficient without any performance degradation by
application-level tuning of certain protocol parameters. In this paper, we
analyze several application-level parameters that affect the throughput and
energy consumption in HTTP data transfers, such as the level of parallelism,
concurrency, and pipelining. We introduce SLA-based algorithms which can decide
the best combination of these parameters based on user-defined energy
efficiency and performance criteria. Our experimental results show that up to
80% energy savings can be achieved at the client and server hosts during HTTP
data transfers and the end-to-end data throughput can be increased at the same
time.

 <dc:description>  Science is conducted collaboratively, often requiring knowledge sharing about
computational experiments. When experiments include only datasets, they can be
shared using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) or Digital Object Identifiers
(DOIs). An experiment, however, seldom includes only datasets, but more often
includes software, its past execution, provenance, and associated
documentation. The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and
systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of
computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not
sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be
able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. In this paper, we
present the sciunit, a reusable research object in which aggregated content is
recomputable. We describe a Git-like client that efficiently creates, stores,
and repeats sciunits. We show through analysis that sciunits repeat
computational experiments with minimal storage and processing overhead.
Finally, we provide an overview of sharing and reproducible cyberinfrastructure
based on sciunits gaining adoption in the domain of geosciences.

 <dc:description>  Object detection is an essential task for autonomous robots operating in
dynamic and changing environments. A robot should be able to detect objects in
the presence of sensor noise that can be induced by changing lighting
conditions for cameras and false depth readings for range sensors, especially
RGB-D cameras. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive fusion
approach for object detection that learns weighting the predictions of
different sensor modalities in an online manner. Our approach is based on a
mixture of convolutional neural network (CNN) experts and incorporates multiple
modalities including appearance, depth and motion. We test our method in
extensive robot experiments, in which we detect people in a combined indoor and
outdoor scenario from RGB-D data, and we demonstrate that our method can adapt
to harsh lighting changes and severe camera motion blur. Furthermore, we
present a new RGB-D dataset for people detection in mixed in- and outdoor
environments, recorded with a mobile robot.

 <dc:description>  Human action recognition in 3D skeleton sequences has attracted a lot of
research attention. Recently, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have shown
promising performance in this task due to their strengths in modeling the
dependencies and dynamics in sequential data. As not all skeletal joints are
informative for action recognition, and the irrelevant joints often bring noise
which can degrade the performance, we need to pay more attention to the
informative ones. However, the original LSTM network does not have explicit
attention ability. In this paper, we propose a new class of LSTM network,
Global Context-Aware Attention LSTM (GCA-LSTM), for skeleton based action
recognition. This network is capable of selectively focusing on the informative
joints in each frame of each skeleton sequence by using a global context memory
cell. To further improve the attention capability of our network, we also
introduce a recurrent attention mechanism, with which the attention performance
of the network can be enhanced progressively. Moreover, we propose a stepwise
training scheme in order to train our network effectively. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmark datasets
for skeleton based action recognition.

 <dc:description>  Digital pathology has advanced substantially over the last decade however
tumor localization continues to be a challenging problem due to highly complex
patterns and textures in the underlying tissue bed. The use of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to analyze such complex images has been well adopted in
digital pathology. However in recent years, the architecture of CNNs have
altered with the introduction of inception modules which have shown great
promise for classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a modified
&quot;transition&quot; module which learns global average pooling layers from filters of
varying sizes to encourage class-specific filters at multiple spatial
resolutions. We demonstrate the performance of the transition module in AlexNet
and ZFNet, for classifying breast tumors in two independent datasets of scanned
histology sections, of which the transition module was superior.

 <dc:description>  We present AirCode, a technique that allows the user to tag physically
fabricated objects with given information. An AirCode tag consists of a group
of carefully designed air pockets placed beneath the object surface. These air
pockets are easily produced during the fabrication process of the object,
without any additional material or postprocessing. Meanwhile, the air pockets
affect only the scattering light transport under the surface, and thus are hard
to notice to our naked eyes. But, by using a computational imaging method, the
tags become detectable. We present a tool that automates the design of air
pockets for the user to encode information. AirCode system also allows the user
to retrieve the information from captured images via a robust decoding
algorithm. We demonstrate our tagging technique with applications for metadata
embedding, robotic grasping, as well as conveying object affordances.

 <dc:title>The Digital Flynn Effect: Complexity of Posts on Social Media Increases

 <dc:description>  Parents and teachers often express concern about the extensive use of social
media by youngsters. Some of them see emoticons, undecipherable initialisms and
loose grammar typical for social media as evidence of language degradation. In
this paper, we use a simple measure of text complexity to investigate how the
complexity of public posts on a popular social networking site changes over
time. We analyze a unique dataset that contains texts posted by 942, 336 users
from a large European city across nine years. We show that the chosen
complexity measure is correlated with the academic performance of users: users
from high-performing schools produce more complex texts than users from
low-performing schools. We also find that complexity of posts increases with
age. Finally, we demonstrate that overall language complexity of posts on the
social networking site is constantly increasing. We call this phenomenon the
digital Flynn effect. Our results may suggest that the worries about language
degradation are not warranted.

 <dc:description>  Security products often create more problems than they solve, drowning users
in alerts without providing the context required to remediate threats. This
challenge is compounded by a lack of experienced personnel and security tools
with complex interfaces. These interfaces require users to become domain
experts or rely on repetitive, time consuming tasks to turn this data deluge
into actionable intelligence. In this paper we present Artemis, a
conversational interface to endpoint detection and response (EDR) event data.
Artemis leverages dialog to drive the automation of complex tasks and reduce
the need to learn a structured query language. Designed to empower
inexperienced and junior security workers to better understand their security
environment, Artemis provides an intuitive platform to ask questions of alert
data as users are guided through triage and hunt workflows. In this paper, we
will discuss our user-centric design methodology, feedback from user
interviews, and the design requirements generated upon completion of our study.
We will also present core functionality, findings from scenario-based testing,
and future research for the Artemis platform.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been shown to be able to sample
impressively realistic images. GAN training consists of a saddle point
optimization problem that can be thought of as an adversarial game between a
generator which produces the images, and a discriminator, which judges if the
images are real. Both the generator and the discriminator are commonly
parametrized as deep convolutional neural networks. The goal of this paper is
to disentangle the contribution of the optimization procedure and the network
parametrization to the success of GANs. To this end we introduce and study
Generative Latent Optimization (GLO), a framework to train a generator without
the need to learn a discriminator, thus avoiding challenging adversarial
optimization problems. We show experimentally that GLO enjoys many of the
desirable properties of GANs: learning from large data, synthesizing
visually-appealing samples, interpolating meaningfully between samples, and
performing linear arithmetic with noise vectors.

 <dc:description>  Phase retrieval has important applications in optical imaging, communications
and sensing. Lifting the dimensionality of the problem allows phase retrieval
to be approximated as a convex optimization problem in a higher-dimensional
space. Convex optimization-based phase retrieval has been shown to yield high
accuracy, yet its low-complexity implementation has not been explored. In this
paper, we study three fundamental approaches for its low-complexity
implementation: the projected gradient method, the Nesterov accelerated
gradient method, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
method. We derive the corresponding estimation algorithms and evaluate their
complexities. We compare their performance in the application area of
direct-detection mode-division multiplexing. We demonstrate that they yield
negligible estimation penalties (less than 0.2 dB for transmitter processing
and less than 0.6 dB for receiver equalization) while yielding low
computational cost, as their implementation complexities all scale
quadratically in the number of unknown parameters. Among the three methods,
ADMM achieves convergence after the smallest number of iterations.

 <dc:description>  The pairwise influence matrix of Dobrushin has long been used as an
analytical tool to bound the rate of convergence of Gibbs sampling. In this
work, we use Dobrushin influence as the basis of a practical tool to certify
and efficiently improve the quality of a discrete Gibbs sampler. Our
Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) offer customized variable selection
orders for a given sampling budget and variable subset of interest, explicit
bounds on total variation distance to stationarity, and certifiable
improvements over the standard systematic and uniform random scan Gibbs
samplers. In our experiments with joint image segmentation and object
recognition, Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation, and Ising
model inference, DoGS consistently deliver higher-quality inferences with
significantly smaller sampling budgets than standard Gibbs samplers.

 <dc:title>A Novel Deep Learning Architecture for Testis Histology Image
  Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Unlike other histology analysis, classification of tubule status in testis
histology is very challenging due to their high similarity of texture and
shape. Traditional deep learning networks have difficulties to capture nuance
details among different tubule categories. In this paper, we propose a novel
deep learning architecture for feature learning, image classification, and
image reconstruction. It is based on stacked auto-encoders with an additional
layer, called a hyperlayer, which is created to capture features of an image at
different layers in the network. This addition effectively combines features at
different scales and thus provides a more complete profile for further
classification. Evaluation is performed on a set of 10,542 tubule image
patches. We demonstrate our approach with two experiments on two different
subsets of the dataset. The results show that the features learned from our
architecture achieve more than 98% accuracy and represent an improvement over
traditional deep network architectures.

 <dc:description>  We propose an approach to discover class-specific pixels for the
weakly-supervised semantic segmentation task. We show that properly combining
saliency and attention maps allows us to obtain reliable cues capable of
significantly boosting the performance. First, we propose a simple yet powerful
hierarchical approach to discover the class-agnostic salient regions, obtained
using a salient object detector, which otherwise would be ignored. Second, we
use fully convolutional attention maps to reliably localize the class-specific
regions in a given image. We combine these two cues to discover class-specific
pixels which are then used as an approximate ground truth for training a CNN.
While solving the weakly supervised semantic segmentation task, we ensure that
the image-level classification task is also solved in order to enforce the CNN
to assign at least one pixel to each object present in the image.
Experimentally, on the PASCAL VOC12 val and test sets, we obtain the mIoU of
60.8% and 61.9%, achieving the performance gains of 5.1% and 5.2% compared to
the published state-of-the-art results. The code is made publicly available.

 <dc:description>  We consider the question of 30-minute prediction of blood glucose levels
measured by continuous glucose monitoring devices, using clinical data. While
most studies of this nature deal with one patient at a time, we take a certain
percentage of patients in the data set as training data, and test on the
remainder of the patients; i.e., the machine need not re-calibrate on the new
patients in the data set. We demonstrate how deep learning can outperform
shallow networks in this example. One novelty is to demonstrate how a
parsimonious deep representation can be constructed using domain knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Video games and the playing thereof have been a fixture of American culture
since their introduction in the arcades of the 1980s. However, it was not until
the recent proliferation of broadband connections robust and fast enough to
handle live video streaming that players of video games have transitioned from
a content consumer role to a content producer role. Simultaneously, the rise of
social media has revealed how interpersonal connections drive user engagement
and interest. In this work, we discuss the recent proliferation of video game
streaming, particularly on Twitch.tv, analyze trends and patterns in video game
viewing, and develop predictive models for determining if a new game will have
substantial impact on the streaming ecosystem.

 <dc:description>  HTTP/2 (h2) is a new standard for Web communications that already delivers a
large share of Web traffic. Unlike HTTP/1, h2 uses only one underlying TCP
connection. In a cellular network with high loss and sudden spikes in latency,
which the TCP stack might interpret as loss, using a single TCP connection can
negatively impact Web performance. In this paper, we perform an extensive
analysis of real world cellular network traffic and design a testbed to emulate
loss characteristics in cellular networks. We use the emulated cellular network
to measure h2 performance in comparison to HTTP/1.1, for webpages synthesized
from HTTP Archive repository data.
  Our results show that, in lossy conditions, h2 achieves faster page load
times (PLTs) for webpages with small objects. For webpages with large objects,
h2 degrades the PLT. We devise a new domain-sharding technique that isolates
large and small object downloads on separate connections. Using sharding, we
show that under lossy cellular conditions, h2 over multiple connections
improves the PLT compared to h2 with one connection and HTTP/1.1 with six
connections. Finally, we recommend content providers and content delivery
networks to apply h2-aware domain-sharding on webpages currently served over h2
for improved mobile Web performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we are interested in the problem of learning an over-complete
basis and a methodology such that the reconstruction or inverse problem does
not need optimization. We analyze the optimality of the presented approaches,
their link to popular already known techniques s.a. Artificial Neural
Networks,k-means or Oja's learning rule. Finally, we will see that one approach
to reach the optimal dictionary is a factorial and hierarchical approach. The
derived approach lead to a formulation of a Deep Oja Network. We present
results on different tasks and present the resulting very efficient learning
algorithm which brings a new vision on the training of deep nets. Finally, the
theoretical work shows that deep frameworks are one way to efficiently have
over-complete (combinatorially large) dictionary yet allowing easy
reconstruction. We thus present the Deep Residual Oja Network (DRON). We
demonstrate that a recursive deep approach working on the residuals allow
exponential decrease of the error w.r.t. the depth.

 <dc:title>Linear Time Complexity Deep Fourier Scattering Network and Extension to
  Nonlinear Invariants</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Balestriero, Randall</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a scalable version of a state-of-the-art
deterministic time-invariant feature extraction approach based on consecutive
changes of basis and nonlinearities, namely, the scattering network. The first
focus of the paper is to extend the scattering network to allow the use of
higher order nonlinearities as well as extracting nonlinear and Fourier based
statistics leading to the required invariants of any inherently structured
input. In order to reach fast convolutions and to leverage the intrinsic
structure of wavelets, we derive our complete model in the Fourier domain. In
addition of providing fast computations, we are now able to exploit sparse
matrices due to extremely high sparsity well localized in the Fourier domain.
As a result, we are able to reach a true linear time complexity with inputs in
the Fourier domain allowing fast and energy efficient solutions to machine
learning tasks. Validation of the features and computational results will be
presented through the use of these invariant coefficients to perform
classification on audio recordings of bird songs captured in multiple different
soundscapes. In the end, the applicability of the presented solutions to deep
artificial neural networks is discussed.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes new factorizations for computing the Neumann series. The
factorizations are based on fast algorithms for small prime sizes series and
the splitting of large sizes into several smaller ones. We propose a different
basis for factorizations other than the well-known binary and ternary basis. We
show that is possible to reduce the overall complexity for the usual binary
decomposition from 2log2(N)-2 multiplications to around 1.72log2(N)-2 using a
basis of size five. Merging different basis we can demonstrate that we can
build fast algorithms for particular sizes. We also show the asymptotic case
where one can reduce the number of multiplications to around 1.70log2(N)-2.
Simulations are performed for applications in the context of wireless
communications and image rendering, where is necessary perform large sized
matrices inversion.

 <dc:description>  Many machine vision applications require predictions for every pixel of the
input image (for example semantic segmentation, boundary detection). Models for
such problems usually consist of encoders which decreases spatial resolution
while learning a high-dimensional representation, followed by decoders who
recover the original input resolution and result in low-dimensional
predictions. While encoders have been studied rigorously, relatively few
studies address the decoder side. Therefore this paper presents an extensive
comparison of a variety of decoders for a variety of pixel-wise prediction
tasks. Our contributions are: (1) Decoders matter: we observe significant
variance in results between different types of decoders on various problems.
(2) We introduce a novel decoder: bilinear additive upsampling. (3) We
introduce new residual-like connections for decoders. (4) We identify two
decoder types which give a consistently high performance.

 <dc:description>  We argue that turning a logic program into a set of completed definitions can
be sometimes thought of as the &quot;reverse engineering&quot; process of generating a
set of conditions that could serve as a specification for it. Accordingly, it
may be useful to define completion for a large class of ASP programs and to
automate the process of generating and simplifying completion formulas.
Examining the output produced by this kind of software may help programmers to
see more clearly what their program does, and to what degree its behavior
conforms with their expectations. As a step toward this goal, we propose here a
definition of program completion for a large class of programs in the input
language of the ASP grounder GRINGO, and study its properties. This note is
under consideration for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic
Programming.

 <dc:description>  In network science, the interplay between dynamical processes and the
underlying topologies of complex systems has led to a diverse family of models
with different interpretations. In graph signal processing, this is manifested
in the form of different graph shifts and their induced algebraic systems. In
this paper, we propose the unifying Z-Laplacian framework, whose instances can
act as graph shift operators. As a generalization of the traditional graph
Laplacian, the Z-Laplacian spans the space of all possible Z-matrices, i.e.,
real square matrices with nonpositive off-diagonal entries. We show that the
Z-Laplacian can model general continuous-time dynamical processes, including
information flows and epidemic spreading on a given graph. It is also closely
related to general nonnegative graph filters in the discrete time domain. We
showcase its flexibility by considering two applications. First, we consider a
wireless communications networking problem modeled with a graph, where the
framework can be applied to model the effects of the underlying communications
protocol and traffic. Second, we examine a structural brain network from the
perspective of low- to high-frequency connectivity.

 <dc:title>Cooperative Estimation via Altruism</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A novel approach, based on the notion of altruism, is presented to
cooperative estimation in a system comprising two information-sharing
estimators. The underlying assumption is that the system's global mission can
be accomplished even if only one of the estimators achieves satisfactory
performance. The notion of altruism motivates a new definition of cooperative
estimation optimality that generalizes the common definition of minimum mean
square error optimality. Fundamental equations are derived for two types of
altruistic cooperative estimation problems, corresponding to heterarchical and
hierarchical setups. Although these equations are hard to solve in the general
case, their solution in the Gaussian case is straightforward and only entails
the largest eigenvalue of the conditional covariance matrix and its
corresponding eigenvector. Moreover, in that case the performance improvement
of the two altruistic cooperative estimation techniques over the conventional
(egoistic) estimation approach is shown to depend on the problem's
dimensionality and statistical distribution. In particular, the performance
improvement grows with the dispersion of the spectrum of the conditional
covariance matrix, rendering the new estimation approach especially appealing
in ill-conditioned problems. The performance of the new approach is
demonstrated using a numerical simulation study.

 <dc:description>  One promising trend in digital system integration consists of boosting
on-chip communication performance by means of silicon photonics, thus
materializing the so-called Optical Networks-on-Chip (ONoCs). Among them,
wavelength routing can be used to route a signal to destination by univocally
associating a routing path to the wavelength of the optical carrier. Such
wavelengths should be chosen so to minimize interferences among optical
channels and to avoid routing faults. As a result, physical parameter selection
of such networks requires the solution of complex constrained optimization
problems. In previous work, published in the proceedings of the International
Conference on Computer-Aided Design, we proposed and solved the problem of
computing the maximum parallelism obtainable in the communication between any
two endpoints while avoiding misrouting of optical signals. The underlying
technology, only quickly mentioned in that paper, is Answer Set Programming
(ASP). In this work, we detail the ASP approach we used to solve such problem.
  Another important design issue is to select the wavelengths of optical
carriers such that they are spread across the available spectrum, in order to
reduce the likelihood that, due to imperfections in the manufacturing process,
unintended routing faults arise. We show how to address such problem in
Constraint Logic Programming on Finite Domains (CLP(FD)).
  This paper is under consideration for possible publication on Theory and
Practice of Logic Programming.

 <dc:description>  Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are spaces designed to educate students
remotely via online platforms. Although traditional VLEs such as iSocial have
shown promise in educating students, they offer limited immersion that
diminishes learning effectiveness. This paper outlines a virtual reality
learning environment (VRLE) over a high-speed network, which promotes
educational effectiveness and efficiency via our creation of flexible content
and infrastructure which meet established VLE standards with improved
immersion. This paper further describes our implementation of multiple learning
modules developed in High Fidelity, a &quot;social VR&quot; platform. Our experiment
results show that the VR mode of content delivery better stimulates the
generalization of lessons to the real world than non-VR lessons and provides
improved immersion when compared to an equivalent desktop version.

 <dc:description>  We consider a system of $N$ servers inter-connected by some underlying graph
topology $G_N$. Tasks arrive at the various servers as independent Poisson
processes of rate $\lambda$. Each incoming task is irrevocably assigned to
whichever server has the smallest number of tasks among the one where it
appears and its neighbors in $G_N$. Tasks have unit-mean exponential service
times and leave the system upon service completion.
  The above model has been extensively investigated in the case $G_N$ is a
clique. Since the servers are exchangeable in that case, the queue length
process is quite tractable, and it has been proved that for any $\lambda &lt; 1$,
the fraction of servers with two or more tasks vanishes in the limit as $N \to
\infty$. For an arbitrary graph $G_N$, the lack of exchangeability severely
complicates the analysis, and the queue length process tends to be worse than
for a clique. Accordingly, a graph $G_N$ is said to be $N$-optimal or
$\sqrt{N}$-optimal when the occupancy process on $G_N$ is equivalent to that on
a clique on an $N$-scale or $\sqrt{N}$-scale, respectively.
  We prove that if $G_N$ is an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with average
degree $d(N)$, then it is with high probability $N$-optimal and
$\sqrt{N}$-optimal if $d(N) \to \infty$ and $d(N) / (\sqrt{N} \log(N)) \to
\infty$ as $N \to \infty$, respectively. This demonstrates that optimality can
be maintained at $N$-scale and $\sqrt{N}$-scale while reducing the number of
connections by nearly a factor $N$ and $\sqrt{N} / \log(N)$ compared to a
clique, provided the topology is suitably random. It is further shown that if
$G_N$ contains $\Theta(N)$ bounded-degree nodes, then it cannot be $N$-optimal.
In addition, we establish that an arbitrary graph $G_N$ is $N$-optimal when its
minimum degree is $N - o(N)$, and may not be $N$-optimal even when its minimum
degree is $c N + o(N)$ for any $0 &lt; c &lt; 1/2$.

 <dc:description>  We explore a generalization of set reconciliation, where the goal is to
reconcile sets of sets. Alice and Bob each have a parent set consisting of $s$
child sets, each containing at most $h$ elements from a universe of size $u$.
They want to reconcile their sets of sets in a scenario where the total number
of differences between all of their child sets (under the minimum difference
matching between their child sets) is $d$. We give several algorithms for this
problem, and discuss applications to reconciliation problems on graphs,
databases, and collections of documents. We specifically focus on graph
reconciliation, providing protocols based on sets of sets reconciliation for
random graphs from $G(n,p)$ and for forests of rooted trees.

 <dc:description>  In many communication networks, the availability of channel state information
at various nodes provides an opportunity for network nodes to work together, or
&quot;cooperate.&quot; This work studies the benefit of cooperation in the multiple
access channel with a cooperation facilitator, distributed state information at
the encoders, and full state information available at the decoder. Under
various causality constraints, sufficient conditions are obtained such that
encoder cooperation through the facilitator results in a gain in sum-capacity
that has infinite slope in the information rate shared with the encoders. This
result extends the prior work of the authors on cooperation in networks where
none of the nodes have access to state information.

 <dc:description>  We consider a revenue optimizing seller selling a single item to a buyer, on
whose private value the seller has a noisy signal. We show that, when the
signal is kept private, arbitrarily more revenue could potentially be extracted
than if the signal is leaked or revealed. We then show that, if the seller is
not allowed to make payments to the buyer, the gap between the two is bounded
by a multiplicative factor of 3, if the value distribution conditioning on each
signal is regular. We give examples showing that both conditions are necessary
for a constant bound to hold.
  We connect this scenario to multi-bidder single-item auctions where bidders'
values are correlated. Similarly to the setting above, we show that the revenue
of a Bayesian incentive compatible, ex post individually rational auction can
be arbitrarily larger than that of a dominant strategy incentive compatible
auction, whereas the two are no more than a factor of 5 apart if the auctioneer
never pays the bidders and if each bidder's value conditioning on the others'
is drawn according to a regular distribution. The upper bounds in both settings
degrade gracefully when the distribution is a mixture of a small number of
regular distributions.

 <dc:description>  Unprecedented high volumes of data are becoming available with the growth of
the advanced metering infrastructure. These are expected to benefit planning
and operation of the future power system, and to help the customers transition
from a passive to an active role. In this paper, we explore for the first time
in the smart grid context the benefits of using Deep Reinforcement Learning, a
hybrid type of methods that combines Reinforcement Learning with Deep Learning,
to perform on-line optimization of schedules for building energy management
systems. The learning procedure was explored using two methods, Deep Q-learning
and Deep Policy Gradient, both of them being extended to perform multiple
actions simultaneously. The proposed approach was validated on the large-scale
Pecan Street Inc. database. This highly-dimensional database includes
information about photovoltaic power generation, electric vehicles as well as
buildings appliances. Moreover, these on-line energy scheduling strategies
could be used to provide real-time feedback to consumers to encourage more
efficient use of electricity.

 <dc:title>On Thin Air Reads: Towards an Event Structures Model of Relaxed Memory</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This is the first paper to propose a pure event structures model of relaxed
memory. We propose confusion-free event structures over an alphabet with a
justification relation as a model. Executions are modeled by justified
configurations, where every read event has a justifying write event.
Justification alone is too weak a criterion, since it allows cycles of the kind
that result in so-called thin-air reads. Acyclic justification forbids such
cycles, but also invalidates event reorderings that result from compiler
optimizations and dynamic instruction scheduling. We propose a notion
well-justification, based on a game-like model, which strikes a middle ground.
We show that well-justified configurations satisfy the DRF theorem: in any
data-race free program, all well-justified configurations are sequentially
consistent. We also show that rely-guarantee reasoning is sound for
well-justified configurations, but not for justified configurations. For
example, well-justified configurations are type-safe. Well-justification allows
many, but not all reorderings performed by relaxed memory. In particular, it
fails to validate the commutation of independent reads. We discuss variations
that may address these shortcomings.

 <dc:title>GPU accelerated computation of Polarized Subsurface BRDF for Flat

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  BRDF of most real world materials has two components, the surface BRDF due to
the light reflecting at the surface of the material and the subsurface BRDF due
to the light entering and going through many scattering events inside the
material. Each of these events modifies light's path, power, polarization
state. Computing polarized subsurface BRDF of a material requires simulating
the light transport inside the material. The transport of polarized light is
modeled by the Vector Radiative Transfer Equation (VRTE), an
integro-differential equation. Computing solution to that equation is
expensive. The Discrete Ordinate Method (DOM) is a common approach to solving
the VRTE. Such solvers are very time consuming for complex uses such as BRDF
computation, where one must solve VRTE for surface radiance distribution due to
light incident from every direction of the hemisphere above the surface. In
this paper, we present a GPU based DOM solution of the VRTE to expedite the
subsurface BRDF computation. As in other DOM based solutions, our solution is
based on Fourier expansions of the phase function and the radiance function.
This allows us to independently solve the VRTE for each order of expansion. We
take advantage of those repetitions and of the repetitions in each of the
sub-steps of the solution process. Our solver is implemented to run mainly on
graphics hardware using the OpenCL library and runs up to seven times faster
than its CPU equivalent, allowing the computation of subsurface BRDF in a
matter of minutes. We compute and present the subsurface BRDF lobes due to
powders and paints of a few materials. We also show the rendering of objects
with the computed BRDF. The solver is available for public use through the
authors' web site.

 <dc:description>  The MIT SuperCloud Portal Workspace enables the secure exposure of web
services running on high performance computing (HPC) systems. The portal allows
users to run any web application as an HPC job and access it from their
workstation while providing authentication, encryption, and access control at
the system level to prevent unintended access. This capability permits users to
seamlessly utilize existing and emerging tools that present their user
interface as a website on an HPC system creating a portal workspace.
Performance measurements indicate that the MIT SuperCloud Portal Workspace
incurs marginal overhead when compared to a direct connection of the same
service.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a parallel offline algorithm for computing hybrid conditional
plans, called HCP-ASP, oriented towards robotics applications. HCP-ASP relies
on modeling actuation actions and sensing actions in an expressive nonmonotonic
language of answer set programming (ASP), and computation of the branches of a
conditional plan in parallel using an ASP solver. In particular, thanks to
external atoms, continuous feasibility checks (like collision checks) are
embedded into formal representations of actuation actions and sensing actions
in ASP; and thus each branch of a hybrid conditional plan describes a feasible
execution of actions to reach their goals. Utilizing nonmonotonic constructs
and nondeterministic choices, partial knowledge about states and
nondeterministic effects of sensing actions can be explicitly formalized in
ASP; and thus each branch of a conditional plan can be computed by an ASP
solver without necessitating a conformant planner and an ordering of sensing
actions in advance. We apply our method in a service robotics domain and report
experimental evaluations. Furthermore, we present performance comparisons with
other compilation based conditional planners on standardized benchmark domains.
This paper is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is an important part of today's world because offloading
computations is a method to reduce costs. In this paper, we investigate
computing the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) using Fully Homomorphic
Encryption (FHE). Performing SURF in FHE enables a method to offload the
computations while maintaining security and privacy of the original data. In
support of this research, we developed a framework to compute SURF via a
rational number based compatible with FHE. Although floating point (R) to
rational numbers (Q) conversion introduces error, our research provides tight
bounds on the magnitude of error in terms of parameters of FHE. We empirically
verified the proposed method against a set of images at different sizes and
showed that our framework accurately computes most of the SURF keypoints in
FHE.

 <dc:description>  In sensing applications, sensors cannot always measure the latent quantity of
interest at the required resolution, sometimes they can only acquire a blurred
version of it due the sensor's transfer function. To recover latent signals
when only noisy mixed measurements of the signal are available, we propose the
Gaussian process mixture of measurements (GPMM), which models the latent signal
as a Gaussian process (GP) and allows us to perform Bayesian inference on such
signal conditional to a set of noisy mixture of measurements. We describe how
to train GPMM, that is, to find the hyperparameters of the GP and the mixing
weights, and how to perform inference on the latent signal under GPMM;
additionally, we identify the solution to the underdetermined linear system
resulting from a sensing application as a particular case of GPMM. The proposed
model is validated in the recovery of three signals: a smooth synthetic signal,
a real-world heart-rate time series and a step function, where GPMM
outperformed the standard GP in terms of estimation error, uncertainty
representation and recovery of the spectral content of the latent signal.

 <dc:description>  Automatic organization of personal photos is a problem with many real world
ap- plications, and can be divided into two main tasks: recognizing the event
type of the photo collection, and selecting interesting images from the
collection. In this paper, we attempt to simultaneously solve both tasks:
album-wise event recognition and image- wise importance prediction. We
collected an album dataset with both event type labels and image importance
labels, refined from an existing CUFED dataset. We propose a hybrid system
consisting of three parts: A siamese network-based event-specific image
importance prediction, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that recognizes the
event type, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequence level event
recognizer. We propose an iterative updating procedure for event type and image
importance score prediction. We experimentally verified that image importance
score prediction and event type recognition can each help the performance of
the other.

 <dc:title>Improving the capacity of molecular communication using enzymatic

 <dc:creator>Awan, Hamdan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers the capacity of a diffusion-based molecular
communication link assuming the receiver uses chemical reactions. The key
contribution is we show that enzymatic reaction cycles, which is a class of
chemical reactions commonly found in cells consisting of a forward and a
backward enzymatic reaction, can improve the capacity of the communication
link. The technical difficulty in analysing enzymatic reaction cycles is that
their reaction rates are nonlinear. We deal with this by assuming that the
amount of certain chemicals in the enzymatic reaction cycle is large. In order
to simplify the problem further, we use singular perturbation to study a
particular operating regime of the enzymatic reaction cycles. This allows us to
derive a closed-form expression of the channel gain. This expression suggests
that we can improve the channel gain by increasing the total amount of
substrate in the enzymatic reaction cycle. By using numerical calculations, we
show that the effect of the enzymatic reaction cycle is to increase the channel
gain and to reduce the noise, which results in a better signalto- noise ratio
and in turn a higher communication capacity. Furthermore, we show that we can
increase the capacity by increasing the total amount of substrate in the
enzymatic reaction cycle.

 <dc:title>Uplink Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Multi-Cell Multi-User Massive

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the performance of uplink spectral efficiency in massive
multiple input multiple output (MIMO) over spacially correlated Ricean fading
channel is presented. The maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver is employed at
the base station (BS) for two different methods of channel estimation. The
first method is based on pilot-assisted least minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
estimation, the second one is based on line-of-sight (LOS) part. The respective
analytical expressions of uplink data rate are given for these two methods. Due
to the existence of pilot contamination, the uplink data rate of pilot-assisted
LMMSE estimation method approaches to a finite value (we name it as asymptotic
rate in the paper) when the BS antenna number is very large. However, the data
rate of LOS method goes linearly with the number of BS antennas. The expression
of the uplink rate of LOS method also show that for Ricean channel, the spacial
correlation between the BS antennas may not only decrease the rate, but also
increase the rate, which depends on the locations of the users. This conclusion
explains why the spacial correlation may increase, rather than decrease the
data rate of pilot-assisted LMMSE. We also discuss the power scaling law of the
two methods, and the asymptotic expressions of the two methods are the same and
both independent of the antenna correlation.

 <dc:title>Weak Memory Models: Balancing Definitional Simplicity and Implementation

 <dc:description>  The memory model for RISC-V, a newly developed open source ISA, has not been
finalized yet and thus, offers an opportunity to evaluate existing memory
models. We believe RISC-V should not adopt the memory models of POWER or ARM,
because their axiomatic and operational definitions are too complicated. We
propose two new weak memory models: WMM and WMM-S, which balance definitional
simplicity and implementation flexibility differently. Both allow all
instruction reorderings except overtaking of loads by a store. We show that
this restriction has little impact on performance and it considerably
simplifies operational definitions. It also rules out the out-of-thin-air
problem that plagues many definitions. WMM is simple (it is similar to the
Alpha memory model), but it disallows behaviors arising due to shared store
buffers and shared write-through caches (which are seen in POWER processors).
WMM-S, on the other hand, is more complex and allows these behaviors. We give
the operational definitions of both models using Instantaneous Instruction
Execution (I2E), which has been used in the definitions of SC and TSO. We also
show how both models can be implemented using conventional cache-coherent
memory systems and out-of-order processors, and encompasses the behaviors of
most known optimizations.

 <dc:description>  LINE [1], as an efficient network embedding method, has shown its
effectiveness in dealing with large-scale undirected, directed, and/or weighted
networks. Particularly, it proposes to preserve both the local structure
(represented by First-order Proximity) and global structure (represented by
Second-order Proximity) of the network. In this study, we prove that LINE with
these two proximities (LINE(1st) and LINE(2nd)) are actually factoring two
different matrices separately. Specifically, LINE(1st) is factoring a matrix M
(1), whose entries are the doubled Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) of vertex
pairs in undirected networks, shifted by a constant. LINE(2nd) is factoring a
matrix M (2), whose entries are the PMI of vertex and context pairs in directed
networks, shifted by a constant. We hope this finding would provide a basis for
further extensions and generalizations of LINE.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have advanced the state of the art in named entity
recognition. However, under typical training procedures, advantages over
classical methods emerge only with large datasets. As a result, deep learning
is employed only when large public datasets or a large budget for manually
labeling data is available. In this work, we show that by combining deep
learning with active learning, we can outperform classical methods even with a
significantly smaller amount of training data.

 <dc:description>  In apparel recognition, specialized models (e.g. models trained for a
particular vertical like dresses) can significantly outperform general models
(i.e. models that cover a wide range of verticals). Therefore, deep neural
network models are often trained separately for different verticals. However,
using specialized models for different verticals is not scalable and expensive
to deploy. This paper addresses the problem of learning one unified embedding
model for multiple object verticals (e.g. all apparel classes) without
sacrificing accuracy. The problem is tackled from two aspects: training data
and training difficulty. On the training data aspect, we figure out that for a
single model trained with triplet loss, there is an accuracy sweet spot in
terms of how many verticals are trained together. To ease the training
difficulty, a novel learning scheme is proposed by using the output from
specialized models as learning targets so that L2 loss can be used instead of
triplet loss. This new loss makes the training easier and make it possible for
more efficient use of the feature space. The end result is a unified model
which can achieve the same retrieval accuracy as a number of separate
specialized models, while having the model complexity as one. The effectiveness
of our approach is shown in experiments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the individual secrecy of two-way wiretap channel is
investigated, where two legitimate users' messages are separately guaranteed
secure against an external eavesdropper. For one thing, in some communication
scenarios, the joint secrecy is impossible to achieve both positive secrecy
rates of two users. For another, the individual secrecy satisfies the secrecy
demand of many practical communication systems. Thus, firstly, an achievable
secrecy rate region is derived for the general two-way wiretap channel with
individual secrecy. In a deterministic channel, the region with individual
secrecy is shown to be larger than that with joint secrecy.Secondly, outer
bounds on the secrecy capacity region are obtained for the general two-way
wiretap channel and for two classes of special two-way wiretap channels.The gap
between inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region is explored via
the binary input two-way wiretap channels and the degraded Gaussian two-way
wiretap. Most notably, the secrecy capacity regions are established for the XOR
channel and the degraded Gaussian two-way wiretap channel.Furthermore, the
secure sum-rate of the degraded Gaussian two-way wiretap channel under the
individual secrecy constraint is demonstrated to be strictly larger than that
under the joint secrecy constraint.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the one-sided secrecy of two-way wiretap channel with feedback
is investigated, where the confidential messages of one user through multiple
transmissions is guaranteed secure against an external eavesdropper. For one
thing, one-sided secrecy satisfies the secure demand of many practical
scenarios. For another, the secrecy is measured over many blocks since the
correlation between eavesdropper's observation and the confidential messages in
successive blocks, instead of secrecy measurement of one block in previous
works. Thus, firstly, an achievable secrecy rate region is derived for the
general two-way wiretap channel with feedback through multiple transmissions
under one-sided secrecy. Secondly, outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region
are also obtained. The gap between inner and outer bounds on the secrecy
capacity region is explored via the binary input two-way wiretap channels. Most
notably, the secrecy capacity regions are established for the XOR channel.
Furthermore, the result shows that the achievable rate region with feedback is
larger than that without feedback. Therefore, the benefit role of feedback is
precisely characterized for two-way wiretap channel with feedback under
one-sided secrecy.

 <dc:description>  We propose an Ensemble of Robust Constrained Local Models for alignment of
faces in the presence of significant occlusions and of any unknown pose and
expression. To account for partial occlusions we introduce, Robust Constrained
Local Models, that comprises of a deformable shape and local landmark
appearance model and reasons over binary occlusion labels. Our occlusion
reasoning proceeds by a hypothesize-and-test search over occlusion labels.
Hypotheses are generated by Constrained Local Model based shape fitting over
randomly sampled subsets of landmark detector responses and are evaluated by
the quality of face alignment. To span the entire range of facial pose and
expression variations we adopt an ensemble of independent Robust Constrained
Local Models to search over a discretized representation of pose and
expression. We perform extensive evaluation on a large number of face images,
both occluded and unoccluded. We find that our face alignment system trained
entirely on facial images captured &quot;in-the-lab&quot; exhibits a high degree of
generalization to facial images captured &quot;in-the-wild&quot;. Our results are
accurate and stable over a wide spectrum of occlusions, pose and expression
variations resulting in excellent performance on many real-world face datasets.

equations. Calculating the bound directly, however, requires exponential time.
In this paper, we present the bound in a different form that can be computed in
polynomial time. We also give an elementary (and arguably simpler) proof for
the bound.

 <dc:description>  We present a proof of concept for adapting the finite-difference time-domain
method (FDTD) for solving a 1+1D complex-valued, delay partial differential
equation (PDE) that emerges in the study of waveguide quantum electrodynamics
(QED). The delay term exists in both spatial and temporal directions, rendering
the conventional approaches such as the method of lines inapplicable. We show
that by properly designing the grid and by using the exact (partial) solution
as the boundary condition, the delay PDE can be numerically solved. Our code
provides a numerically exact solution to the time-dependent multi-photon
scattering problem in waveguide QED. The program is written in C and
open-sourced on GitHub.

 <dc:description>  We extend the notion of locality from the Hamming metric to the rank and
subspace metrics. Our main contribution is to construct a class of array codes
with locality constraints in the rank metric. Our motivation for constructing
such codes stems from designing codes for efficient data recovery from
correlated and/or mixed (i.e., complete and partial) failures in distributed
storage systems. Specifically, the proposed local rank-metric codes can recover
locally from 'crisscross errors and erasures', which affect a limited number of
rows and/or columns of the storage system. We also derive a Singleton-like
upper bound on the minimum rank distance of (linear) codes with 'rank-locality'
constraints. Our proposed construction achieves this bound for a broad range of
parameters. The construction builds upon Tamo and Barg's method for
constructing locally repairable codes with optimal minimum Hamming distance.
Finally, we construct a class of subspace codes (also known as codes in
projective space) with locality constraints in the subspace metric. The key
idea is to show that a subspace code with locality can be easily constructed
from a rank-metric code with locality by using the lifting method proposed by
Silva et al. One potential application of such codes is for distributed storage
systems, wherein nodes are connected over a network that can introduce errors
and erasures.

 <dc:description>  We study an extension of first-order logic that allows to express cardinality
conditions in a similar way as SQL's COUNT operator. The corresponding logic
FOC(P) was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS'17), who showed that query
evaluation for this logic is fixed-parameter tractable on classes of structures
(or databases) of bounded degree. In the present paper, we first show that the
fixed-parameter tractability of FOC(P) cannot even be generalised to very
simple classes of structures of unbounded degree such as unranked trees or
strings with a linear order relation.
  Then we identify a fragment FOC1(P) of FOC(P) which is still sufficiently
strong to express standard applications of SQL's COUNT operator. Our main
result shows that query evaluation for FOC1(P) is fixed-parameter tractable
with almost linear running time on nowhere dense classes of structures. As a
corollary, we also obtain a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for counting
the number of tuples satisfying a query over nowhere dense classes of
structures.

 <dc:title>Generalization Bounds of SGLD for Non-convex Learning: Two Theoretical

 <dc:description>  Algorithm-dependent generalization error bounds are central to statistical
learning theory. A learning algorithm may use a large hypothesis space, but the
limited number of iterations controls its model capacity and generalization
error. The impacts of stochastic gradient methods on generalization error for
non-convex learning problems not only have important theoretical consequences,
but are also critical to generalization errors of deep learning.
  In this paper, we study the generalization errors of Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) with non-convex objectives. Two theories are proposed
with non-asymptotic discrete-time analysis, using Stability and PAC-Bayesian
results respectively. The stability-based theory obtains a bound of
$O\left(\frac{1}{n}L\sqrt{\beta T_k}\right)$, where $L$ is uniform Lipschitz
parameter, $\beta$ is inverse temperature, and $T_k$ is aggregated step sizes.
For PAC-Bayesian theory, though the bound has a slower $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ rate,
the contribution of each step is shown with an exponentially decaying factor by
imposing $\ell^2$ regularization, and the uniform Lipschitz constant is also
replaced by actual norms of gradients along trajectory. Our bounds have no
implicit dependence on dimensions, norms or other capacity measures of
parameter, which elegantly characterizes the phenomenon of &quot;Fast Training
Guarantees Generalization&quot; in non-convex settings. This is the first
algorithm-dependent result with reasonable dependence on aggregated step sizes
for non-convex learning, and has important implications to statistical learning
aspects of stochastic gradient methods in complicated models such as deep
learning.

 <dc:description>  In this article, recent works on 2D Constrained Delaunay triangulation(CDT)
algorithms have been reported. Since the review of CDT algorithms presented by
de Floriani(Issues on Machine Vision, Springer Vienna, pg. 95--104, 1989),
different algorithms for construction and applications of CDT have appeared in
literature each concerned with different aspects of computation and different
suitabilities. Therefore, objective of this work is to report an update over
that review article considering contemporary prominent algorithms and
generalizations for the problem of two dimensional Constrained Delaunay

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose relative projective differential invariants (RPDIs)
which are invariant to general projective transformations. By using RPDIs and
the structural frame of integral invariant, projective weighted moment
invariants (PIs) can be constructed very easily. It is first proved that a kind
of projective invariants exists in terms of weighted integration of images,
with relative differential invariants as the weight functions. Then, some
simple instances of PIs are given. In order to ensure the stability and
discriminability of PIs, we discuss how to calculate partial derivatives of
discrete images more accurately. Since the number of pixels in discrete images
before and after the geometric transformation may be different, we design the
method to normalize the number of pixels. These ways enhance the performance of
PIs. Finally, we carry out some experiments based on synthetic and real image
datasets. We choose commonly used moment invariants for comparison. The results
indicate that PIs have better performance than other moment invariants in image
retrieval and classification. With PIs, one can compare the similarity between
images under the projective transformation without knowing the parameters of
the transformation, which provides a good tool to shape analysis in image
processing, computer vision and pattern recognition.

 <dc:description>  Most of the existing recommender systems assume that user's visiting history
can be constantly recorded. However, in recent online services, the user
identification may be usually unknown and only limited online user behaviors
can be used. It is of great importance to model the temporal online user
behaviors and conduct recommendation for the anonymous users. In this paper, we
propose a list-wise deep neural network based architecture to model the limited
user behaviors within each session. To train the model efficiently, we first
design a session embedding method to pre-train a session representation, which
incorporates different kinds of user search behaviors such as clicks and views.
Based on the learnt session representation, we further propose a list-wise
ranking model to generate the recommendation result for each anonymous user
session. We conduct quantitative experiments on a recently published dataset
from an e-commerce company. The evaluation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed method, which can outperform the state-of-the-art
significantly.

 <dc:description>  Domain adaption (DA) allows machine learning methods trained on data sampled
from one distribution to be applied to data sampled from another. It is thus of
great practical importance to the application of such methods. Despite the fact
that tensor representations are widely used in Computer Vision to capture
multi-linear relationships that affect the data, most existing DA methods are
applicable to vectors only. This renders them incapable of reflecting and
preserving important structure in many problems. We thus propose here a
learning-based method to adapt the source and target tensor representations
directly, without vectorization. In particular, a set of alignment matrices is
introduced to align the tensor representations from both domains into the
invariant tensor subspace. These alignment matrices and the tensor subspace are
modeled as a joint optimization problem and can be learned adaptively from the
data using the proposed alternative minimization scheme. Extensive experiments
show that our approach is capable of preserving the discriminative power of the
source domain, of resisting the effects of label noise, and works effectively
for small sample sizes, and even one-shot DA. We show that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art on the task of cross-domain visual recognition
in both efficacy and efficiency, and particularly that it outperforms all
comparators when applied to DA of the convolutional activations of deep
convolutional networks.

 <dc:description>  With over-deployed network infrastructures, network densification is shown to
hinder the improvement of user experience and system performance. In this
paper, we adopt multi-antenna techniques to overcome the bottleneck and
investigate the performance of single-user beamforming, an effective method to
enhance desired signal power, in small cell networks from the perspective of
user coverage probability (CP) and network spatial throughput (ST).
Pessimistically, it is proved that, even when multi-antenna techniques are
applied, both CP and ST would be degraded and even asymptotically diminish to
zero with the increasing base station (BS) density. Moreover, the results also
reveal that the increase of ST is at the expense of the degradation of CP.
Therefore, to balance the tradeoff between user and system performance, we
further study the critical density, under which ST could be maximized under the
CP constraint. Accordingly, the impact of key system parameters on critical
density is quantified via the derived closed-form expression. Especially, the
critical density is shown to be inversely proportional to the square of antenna
height difference between BSs and users. Meanwhile, single-user beamforming,
albeit incapable of improving CP and ST scaling laws, is shown to significantly
increase the critical density, compared to the single-antenna regime.

 <dc:description>  We describe a new method to automatically discriminate between patients with
Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly
controls, based on multidimensional classification of hippocampal shape
features. This approach uses spherical harmonics (SPHARM) coefficients to model
the shape of the hippocampi, which are segmented from magnetic resonance images
(MRI) using a fully automatic method that we previously developed. SPHARM
coefficients are used as features in a classification procedure based on
support vector machines (SVM). The most relevant features for classification
are selected using a bagging strategy. We evaluate the accuracy of our method
in a group of 23 patients with AD (10 males, 13 females, age $\pm$
standard-deviation (SD) = 73 $\pm$ 6 years, mini-mental score (MMS) = 24.4
$\pm$ 2.8), 23 patients with amnestic MCI (10 males, 13 females, age $\pm$ SD =
74 $\pm$ 8 years, MMS = 27.3 $\pm$ 1.4) and 25 elderly healthy controls (13
males, 12 females, age $\pm$ SD = 64 $\pm$ 8 years), using leave-one-out
cross-validation. For AD vs controls, we obtain a correct classification rate
of 94%, a sensitivity of 96%, and a specificity of 92%. For MCI vs controls, we
obtain a classification rate of 83%, a sensitivity of 83%, and a specificity of
84%. This accuracy is superior to that of hippocampal volumetry and is
comparable to recently published SVM-based whole-brain classification methods,
which relied on a different strategy. This new method may become a useful tool
to assist in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new distributional method for modeling
predicate-argument thematic fit judgments. We use a syntax-based DSM to build a
prototypical representation of verb-specific roles: for every verb, we extract
the most salient second order contexts for each of its roles (i.e. the most
salient dimensions of typical role fillers), and then we compute thematic fit
as a weighted overlap between the top features of candidate fillers and role
prototypes. Our experiments show that our method consistently outperforms a
baseline re-implementing a state-of-the-art system, and achieves better or
comparable results to those reported in the literature for the other
unsupervised systems. Moreover, it provides an explicit representation of the
features characterizing verb-specific semantic roles.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, two-player zero-sum games with multiple objectives have
received a lot of interest as a model for the synthesis of complex reactive
systems. In this framework, Player 1 wins if he can ensure that all objectives
are satisfied against any behavior of Player 2. When this is not possible to
satisfy all the objectives at once, an alternative is to use some preorder on
the objectives according to which subset of objectives Player 1 wants to
satisfy. For example, it is often natural to provide more significance to one
objective over another, a situation that can be modelled with lexicographically
ordered objectives for instance. Inspired by recent work on concurrent games
with multiple {\omega}-regular objectives by Bouyer et al., we investigate in
detail turned-based games with monotonically ordered and {\omega}-regular
objectives. We study the threshold problem which asks whether player 1 can
ensure a payoff greater than or equal to a given threshold w.r.t. a given
monotonic preorder. As the number of objectives is usually much smaller than
the size of the game graph, we provide a parametric complexity analysis and we
show that our threshold problem is in FPT for all monotonic preorders and all
classical types of {\omega}-regular objectives. We also provide polynomial time
algorithms for B\&quot;uchi, coB\&quot;uchi and explicit Muller objectives for a large
subclass of monotonic preorders that includes among others the lexicographic
preorder. In the particular case of lexicographic preorder, we also study the
complexity of computing the values and the memory requirements of optimal
strategies.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a black-box attack against API call based machine
learning malware classifiers, focusing on generating adversarial API call
sequences that would be misclassified by the classifier without affecting the
malware functionality. We show that this attack is effective against many
classifiers due to the transferability principle between RNN variants, feed
forward DNNs, and traditional machine learning classifiers such as SVM. We
further extend our attack against hybrid classifiers based on a combination of
static and dynamic features, focusing on printable strings and API calls.
Finally, we implement GADGET, a software framework to convert any malware
binary to a binary undetected by malware classifiers, using the proposed
attack, without access to the malware source code. We conclude by discussing
possible defense mechanisms against the attack.

 <dc:title>Drone-based Object Counting by Spatially Regularized Regional Proposal

 <dc:description>  Existing counting methods often adopt regression-based approaches and cannot
precisely localize the target objects, which hinders the further analysis
(e.g., high-level understanding and fine-grained classification). In addition,
most of prior work mainly focus on counting objects in static environments with
fixed cameras. Motivated by the advent of unmanned flying vehicles (i.e.,
drones), we are interested in detecting and counting objects in such dynamic
environments. We propose Layout Proposal Networks (LPNs) and spatial kernels to
simultaneously count and localize target objects (e.g., cars) in videos
recorded by the drone. Different from the conventional region proposal methods,
we leverage the spatial layout information (e.g., cars often park regularly)
and introduce these spatially regularized constraints into our network to
improve the localization accuracy. To evaluate our counting method, we present
a new large-scale car parking lot dataset (CARPK) that contains nearly 90,000
cars captured from different parking lots. To the best of our knowledge, it is
the first and the largest drone view dataset that supports object counting, and
provides the bounding box annotations.

 <dc:description>  Identity transformations, used as skip-connections in residual networks,
directly connect convolutional layers close to the input and those close to the
output in deep neural networks, improving information flow and thus easing the
training. In this paper, we introduce two alternative linear transforms,
orthogonal transformation and idempotent transformation. According to the
definition and property of orthogonal and idempotent matrices, the product of
multiple orthogonal (same idempotent) matrices, used to form linear
transformations, is equal to a single orthogonal (idempotent) matrix, resulting
in that information flow is improved and the training is eased. One interesting
point is that the success essentially stems from feature reuse and gradient
reuse in forward and backward propagation for maintaining the information
during flow and eliminating the gradient vanishing problem because of the
express way through skip-connections. We empirically demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed two transformations: similar performance in
single-branch networks and even superior in multi-branch networks in comparison
to identity transformations.

 <dc:description>  In the recent years image processing techniques are used as a tool to improve
detection and diagnostic capabilities in the medical applications. Medical
applications have been so much affected by these techniques which some of them
are embedded in medical instruments such as MRI, CT and other medical devices.
Among these techniques, medical image enhancement algorithms play an essential
role in removal of the noise which can be produced by medical instruments and
during image transfer. It has been proved that impulse noise is a major type of
noise, which is produced during medical operations, such as MRI, CT, and
angiography, by their image capturing devices. An embeddable hardware module
which is able to denoise medical images before and during surgical operations
could be very helpful. In this paper an accurate algorithm is proposed for
real-time removal of impulse noise in medical images. All image blocks are
divided into three categories of edge, smooth, and disordered areas. A
different reconstruction method is applied to each category of blocks for the
purpose of noise removal. The proposed method is tested on MR images.
Simulation results show acceptable denoising accuracy for various levels of
noise. Also an FPAG implementation of our denoising algorithm shows acceptable
hardware resource utilization. Hence, the algorithm is suitable for embedding
in medical hardware instruments such as radiosurgery devices.

 <dc:description>  The Relative Pose based Redundancy Removal(RPRR) scheme is presented, which
has been designed for mobile RGB-D sensor networks operating under
bandwidth-constrained operational scenarios. Participating sensor nodes detect
the redundant visual and depth information to prevent their transmission
leading to a significant improvement in wireless channel usage efficiency and
power savings. Experimental results show that wireless channel utilization is
improved by 250% and battery consumption is halved when the RPRR scheme is used
instead of sending the sensor images independently.

 <dc:description>  SLAM is a very popular research stream in computer vision and robotics
nowadays. For more effective SLAM implementation it is necessary to have
reliable informa- tion about the environment, also the data should be aligned
and scaled according to the real world coordinate system. Monocular SLAM
research is an attractive sub-stream, because of the low equipment cost, size
and weight. In this paper we present a way to build a conversion from LSD-SLAM
coordinate space to the real world coordinates using a true metric scale with
IMU sensor data implementation. The causes of differences between the real and
calculated spaces are explained and the possibility of conversions between the
spaces is proved. Additionally, a closed-form solution for inter space trans-
formation calculation is presented. The synthetic method of generating high
level accurate and well controlled input data for the LSD-SLAM algorithm is
presented. Finally, the reconstructed 3D environment representation is
delivered as an output of the implemented conversion.

 <dc:description>  Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a widely used inference method in
Bayesian statistics to bypass the point-wise computation of the likelihood. In
this paper we develop theoretical bounds for the distance between the
statistics used in ABC. We show that some versions of ABC are inherently robust
to misspecification. The bounds are given in the form of oracle inequalities
for a finite sample size. The dependence on the dimension of the parameter
space and the number of statistics is made explicit. The results are shown to
be amenable to oracle inequalities in parameter space. We apply our theoretical
results to given prior distributions and data generating processes, including a
non-parametric regression model. In a second part of the paper, we propose a
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the pseudo-posterior, improving
upon the state of the art samplers.

 <dc:description>  The exponential growth of mobile data traffic is driving the deployment of
dense wireless networks, which will not only impose heavy backhaul burdens, but
also generate considerable power consumption. Introducing caches to the
wireless network edge is a potential and cost-effective solution to address
these challenges. In this paper, we will investigate the problem of minimizing
the network power consumption of cache-enabled wireless networks, consisting of
the base station (BS) and backhaul power consumption. The objective is to
develop efficient algorithms that unify adaptive BS selection, backhaul content
assignment and multicast beamforming, while taking account of user QoS
requirements and backhaul capacity limitations. To address the NP-hardness of
the network power minimization problem, we first propose a generalized layered
group sparse beamforming (LGSBF) modeling framework, which helps to reveal the
layered sparsity structure in the beamformers. By adopting the reweighted
$\left.\ell_{1}\right/\ell_{2}$-norm technique, we further develop a convex
approximation procedure for the LGSBF problem, followed by a three-stage
iterative LGSBF framework to induce the desired sparsity structure in the
beamformers. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm in reducing the network power consumption, and demonstrate that
caching plays a more significant role in networks with higher user densities
and less power-efficient backhaul links.

 <dc:description>  Tutte paths are one of the most successful tools for attacking Hamiltonicity
problems in planar graphs. Unfortunately, results based on them are
non-constructive, as their proofs inherently use an induction on overlapping
subgraphs and these overlaps hinder to bound the running time to a polynomial.
For special cases however, computational results of Tutte paths are known: For
4-connected planar graphs, Tutte paths are in fact Hamiltonian paths and Chiba
and Nishizeki showed how to compute such paths in linear time. For 3-connected
planar graphs, Tutte paths have a more complicated structure, and it has only
recently been shown that they can be computed in polynomial time. However,
Tutte paths are defined for general 2-connected planar graphs and this is what
most applications need. Unfortunately, no computational results are known. We
give the first efficient algorithm that computes a Tutte path (for the general
case of 2-connected planar graphs). One of the strongest existence results
about such Tutte paths is due to Sanders, which allows to prescribe the end
vertices and an intermediate edge of the desired path. Encompassing and
strengthening all previous computational results on Tutte paths, we show how to
compute this special Tutte path efficiently. Our method refines both, the
results of Thomassen and Sanders, and avoids overlapping subgraphs by using a
novel iterative decomposition along 2-separators. Finally, we show that our
algorithm runs in quadratic time.

 <dc:description>  An important skill in critical thinking and argumentation is the ability to
spot and recognize fallacies. Fallacious arguments, omnipresent in
argumentative discourse, can be deceptive, manipulative, or simply leading to
`wrong moves' in a discussion. Despite their importance, argumentation scholars
and NLP researchers with focus on argumentation quality have not yet
investigated fallacies empirically. The nonexistence of resources dealing with
fallacious argumentation calls for scalable approaches to data acquisition and
annotation, for which the serious games methodology offers an appealing, yet
unexplored, alternative. We present Argotario, a serious game that deals with
fallacies in everyday argumentation. Argotario is a multilingual, open-source,
platform-independent application with strong educational aspects, accessible at
www.argotario.net.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new framework for action localization that tracks
people in videos and extracts full-body human tubes, i.e., spatio-temporal
regions localizing actions, even in the case of occlusions or truncations. This
is achieved by training a novel human part detector that scores visible parts
while regressing full-body bounding boxes. The core of our method is a
convolutional neural network which learns part proposals specific to certain
body parts. These are then combined to detect people robustly in each frame.
Our tracking algorithm connects the image detections temporally to extract
full-body human tubes. We apply our new tube extraction method on the problem
of human action localization, on the popular JHMDB dataset, and a very recent
challenging dataset DALY (Daily Action Localization in YouTube), showing
state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>Better Labeling Schemes for Nearest Common Ancestors through
  Minor-Universal Trees</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A labeling scheme for nearest common ancestors assigns a distinct binary
string, called the label, to every node of a tree, so that given the labels of
two nodes (and no further information about the topology of the tree) we can
compute the label of their nearest common ancestor. The goal is to make the
labels as short as possible. Alstrup, Gavoille, Kaplan, and Rauhe [Theor.
Comput. Syst. 37(3):441-456 2004] showed that $O(\log n)$-bit labels are
enough. More recently, Alstrup, Halvorsen, and Larsen [SODA 2014] refined this
to only $2.772\log n$, and provided a lower bound of $1.008\log n$.
  We connect designing a labeling scheme for nearest common ancestors to the
existence of a tree, called a minor-universal tree, that contains every tree on
$n$ nodes as a topological minor. Even though it is not clear if a labeling
scheme must be based on such a notion, we argue that the existing schemes can
be reformulated as such, and it allows us to obtain clean and good bounds on
the length of the labels. As the main upper bound, we show that $2.318\log
n$-bit labels are enough. Surprisingly, the notion of a minor-universal tree
for binary trees on $n$ nodes has been already used in a different context by
Hrubes et al. [CCC 2010], and Young, Chu, and Wong [J. ACM 46(3):416-435, 1999]
introduced a closely related notion of a universal tree. On the lower bound
side, we show that the size of any minor-universal tree for trees on $n$ nodes
is $\Omega(n^{2.174})$. This highlights a natural limitation for all approaches
based on such trees. Our lower bound technique also implies that the size of
any universal tree in the sense of Young et al. is $\Omega(n^{2.185})$, thus
dramatically improves their lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$. We complement the
existential results with a generic transformation that decreases the query time
to constant in any scheme based on a minor-universal tree.

 <dc:description>  NMT systems have problems with large vocabulary sizes. Byte-pair encoding
(BPE) is a popular approach to solving this problem, but while BPE allows the
system to generate any target-side word, it does not enable effective
generalization over the rich vocabulary in morphologically rich languages with
strong inflectional phenomena. We introduce a simple approach to overcome this
problem by training a system to produce the lemma of a word and its
morphologically rich POS tag, which is then followed by a deterministic
generation step. We apply this strategy for English-Czech and English-German
translation scenarios, obtaining improvements in both settings. We furthermore
show that the improvement is not due to only adding explicit morphological
information.

 <dc:description>  During the past decade, with the significant progress of computational power
as well as ever-rising data availability, deep learning techniques became
increasingly popular due to their excellent performance on computer vision
problems. The size of the Protein Data Bank has increased more than 15 fold
since 1999, which enabled the expansion of models that aim at predicting
enzymatic function via their amino acid composition. Amino acid sequence
however is less conserved in nature than protein structure and therefore
considered a less reliable predictor of protein function. This paper presents
EnzyNet, a novel 3D-convolutional neural networks classifier that predicts the
Enzyme Commission number of enzymes based only on their voxel-based spatial
structure. The spatial distribution of biochemical properties was also examined
as complementary information. The 2-layer architecture was investigated on a
large dataset of 63,558 enzymes from the Protein Data Bank and achieved an
accuracy of 78.4% by exploiting only the binary representation of the protein
shape. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/shervinea/enzynet.

 <dc:description>  In the appstore-centric ecosystem, app developers have an urgent requirement
to optimize their release strategy to maximize the success opportunity of their
apps. To address this problem, we introduce an approach to assisting developers
to select the proper release opportunity based on the purpose of the update and
current condition of the app. Before that, we propose the interval of an update
to its previous update to characterize release patterns, and find significance
of the release opportunity through empirical analysis. We mined the
update-history data of 17,820 apps from 33 categories in Google Play, over a
period of 105 days. With 41,028 releases identified from these apps, we reveal
important characteristics of update intervals and how these factors can
influence update effects. We suggest developers to synthetically consider app
ranking, rating trend, and what to update in addition to the opportunity before
releasing an app version. We propose a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to help
decide an optimal release opportunity to gain better user adoption.

 <dc:description>  The attention mechanisms in deep neural networks are inspired by human's
attention that sequentially focuses on the most relevant parts of the
information over time to generate prediction output. The attention parameters
in those models are implicitly trained in an end-to-end manner, yet there have
been few trials to explicitly incorporate human gaze tracking to supervise the
attention models. In this paper, we investigate whether attention models can
benefit from explicit human gaze labels, especially for the task of video
captioning. We collect a new dataset called VAS, consisting of movie clips, and
corresponding multiple descriptive sentences along with human gaze tracking
data. We propose a video captioning model named Gaze Encoding Attention Network
(GEAN) that can leverage gaze tracking information to provide the spatial and
temporal attention for sentence generation. Through evaluation of language
similarity metrics and human assessment via Amazon mechanical Turk, we
demonstrate that spatial attentions guided by human gaze data indeed improve
the performance of multiple captioning methods. Moreover, we show that the
proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for both gaze
prediction and video captioning not only in our VAS dataset but also in
standard datasets (e.g. LSMDC and Hollywood2).

 <dc:description>  The identification of an unknown quantum gate is a significant issue in
quantum technology. In this paper, we propose a quantum gate identification
method within the framework of quantum process tomography. In this method, a
series of pure states are inputted to the gate and then a fast state tomography
on the output states is performed and the data are used to reconstruct the
quantum gate. Our algorithm has computational complexity $O(d^3)$ with the
system dimension $d$. The algorithm is compared with maximum likelihood
estimation method for the running time, which shows the efficiency advantage of
our method. An error upper bound is established for the identification
algorithm and the robustness of the algorithm against the purity of input
states is also tested. We perform quantum optical experiment on single-qubit
Hadamard gate to verify the effectiveness of the identification algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Automatic detection of liver lesions in CT images poses a great challenge for
researchers. In this work we present a deep learning approach that models
explicitly the variability within the non-lesion class, based on prior
knowledge of the data, to support an automated lesion detection system. A
multi-class convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to categorize input
image patches into sub-categories of boundary and interior patches, the
decisions of which are fused to reach a binary lesion vs non-lesion decision.
For validation of our system, we use CT images of 132 livers and 498 lesions.
Our approach shows highly improved detection results that outperform the
state-of-the-art fully convolutional network. Automated computerized tools, as
shown in this work, have the potential in the future to support the
radiologists towards improved detection.

 <dc:description>  A usual way to model a recommendation system is as a matrix completion
problem. There are several matrix completion methods, typically using
optimization approaches or collaborative filtering. Most approaches assume that
the matrix is either low rank, or that there are a small number of latent
variables that encode the full problem. Here, we propose a novel matrix
completion algorithm for recommendation systems, without any assumptions on the
rank and that is model free, i.e., the entries are not assumed to be a function
of some latent variables. Instead, we use a technique akin to information
theory. Our method performs hybrid neighborhood-based collaborative filtering
using Kolmogorov complexity. It decouples the matrix completion into a vector
completion problem for each user. The recommendation for one user is thus
independent of the recommendation for other users. This makes the algorithm
scalable because the computations are highly parallelizable. Our results are
competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on both synthetic and real-world
dataset benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  In the online bipartite matching problem with replacements, all the vertices
on one side of the bipartition are given, and the vertices on the other side
arrive one by one with all their incident edges. The goal is to maintain a
maximum matching while minimizing the number of changes (replacements) to the
matching. We show that the greedy algorithm that always takes the shortest
augmenting path from the newly inserted vertex (denoted the SAP protocol) uses
at most amortized $O(\log^2 n)$ replacements per insertion, where $n$ is the
total number of vertices inserted. This is the first analysis to achieve a
polylogarithmic number of replacements for \emph{any} replacement strategy,
almost matching the $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound. The previous best strategy
known achieved amortized $O(\sqrt{n})$ replacements [Bosek, Leniowski,
Sankowski, Zych, FOCS 2014]. For the SAP protocol in particular, nothing better
than then trivial $O(n)$ bound was known except in special cases.
  Our analysis immediately implies the same upper bound of $O(\log^2 n)$
reassignments for the capacitated assignment problem, where each vertex on the
static side of the bipartition is initialized with the capacity to serve a
number of vertices.
  We also analyze the problem of minimizing the maximum server load. We show
that if the final graph has maximum server load $L$, then the SAP protocol
makes amortized $O( \min\{L \log^2 n , \sqrt{n}\log n\})$ reassignments. We
also show that this is close to tight because $\Omega(\min\{L, \sqrt{n}\})$
reassignments can be necessary.

 <dc:description>  Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the
activities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and
stability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique
called Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling
in speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting
parameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the
acoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel
noises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed
approach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information
such as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically
generates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep
bidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets
for large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The
experimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms
of transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and
environments.

 <dc:title>Working Locally Thinking Globally: Theoretical Guarantees for

 <dc:description>  The celebrated sparse representation model has led to remarkable results in
various signal processing tasks in the last decade. However, despite its
initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been
commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational
constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around
this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse
representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a
concatenation of banded Circulant matrices. While several works have presented
algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very
few truly-effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In
this work, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model
providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions
and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal
and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as
the $\ell_0$ norm, mutual coherence, Spark and RIP to their counterparts in the
convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global
model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit
problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind
bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local
treatment.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a maximum cardinality
subset of vectors, given a constraint on the normalized squared length of
vectors sum. This problem is closely related to Problem 1 from (Eremeev,
Kel'manov, Pyatkin, 2016). The main difference consists in swapping the
constraint with the optimization criterion.
  We prove that the problem is NP-hard even in terms of finding a feasible
solution. An exact algorithm for solving this problem is proposed. The
algorithm has a pseudo-polynomial time complexity in the special case of the
problem, where the dimension of the space is bounded from above by a constant
and the input data are integer. A computational experiment is carried out,
where the proposed algorithm is compared to COINBONMIN solver, applied to a
mixed integer quadratic programming formulation of the problem. The results of
the experiment indicate superiority of the proposed algorithm when the
dimension of Euclidean space is low, while the COINBONMIN has an advantage for
larger dimensions.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the characteristics of DataCite to determine its
possibilities and potential as a new bibliometric data source to analyze the
scholarly production of open data. Open science and the increasing data sharing
requirements from governments, funding bodies, institutions and scientific
journals has led to a pressing demand for the development of data metrics. As a
very first step towards reliable data metrics, we need to better comprehend the
limitations and caveats of the information provided by sources of open data. In
this paper, we critically examine records downloaded from the DataCite's OAI
API and elaborate a series of recommendations regarding the use of this source
for bibliometric analyses of open data. We highlight issues related to metadata
incompleteness, lack of standardization, and ambiguous definitions of several
fields. Despite these limitations, we emphasize DataCite's value and potential
to become one of the main sources for data metrics development.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge about the graph structure of the Web is important for understanding
this complex socio-technical system and for devising proper policies supporting
its future development. Knowledge about the differences between clean and
malicious parts of the Web is important for understanding potential treats to
its users and for devising protection mechanisms. In this study, we conduct
data science methods on a large crawl of surface and deep Web pages with the
aim to increase such knowledge. To accomplish this, we answer the following
questions. Which theoretical distributions explain important local
characteristics and network properties of websites? How are these
characteristics and properties different between clean and malicious
(malware-affected) websites? What is the prediction power of local
characteristics and network properties to classify malware websites? To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study describing the
differences in global properties between malicious and clean parts of the Web.
In other words, our work is building on and bridging the gap between
\textit{Web science} that tackles large-scale graph representations and
\textit{Web cyber security} that is concerned with malicious activities on the
Web. The results presented herein can also help antivirus vendors in devising
approaches to improve their detection algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Pedestrian attribute inference is a demanding problem in visual surveillance
that can facilitate person retrieval, search and indexing. To exploit semantic
relations between attributes, recent research treats it as a multi-label image
classification task. The visual cues hinting at attributes can be strongly
localized and inference of person attributes such as hair, backpack, shorts,
etc., are highly dependent on the acquired view of the pedestrian. In this
paper we assert this dependence in an end-to-end learning framework and show
that a view-sensitive attribute inference is able to learn better attribute
predictions. Our proposed model jointly predicts the coarse pose (view) of the
pedestrian and learns specialized view-specific multi-label attribute
predictions. We show in an extensive evaluation on three challenging datasets
(PETA, RAP and WIDER) that our proposed end-to-end view-aware attribute
prediction model provides competitive performance and improves on the published
state-of-the-art on these datasets.

 <dc:description>  When dealing with large collections of documents, it is imperative to quickly
get an overview of the texts' contents. In this paper we show how this can be
achieved by using a clustering algorithm to identify topics in the dataset and
then selecting and visualizing relevant words, which distinguish a group of
documents from the rest of the texts, to summarize the contents of the
documents belonging to each topic. We demonstrate our approach by discovering
trending topics in a collection of New York Times article snippets.

 <dc:description>  In 2014, more than 10 million people in the US were affected by an ambulatory
disability. Thus, gait rehabilitation is a crucial part of health care systems.
The quantification of human locomotion enables clinicians to describe and
analyze a patient's gait performance in detail and allows them to base clinical
decisions on objective data. These assessments generate a vast amount of
complex data which need to be interpreted in a short time period. We conducted
a design study in cooperation with gait analysis experts to develop a novel
Knowledge-Assisted Visual Analytics solution for clinical Gait analysis
(KAVAGait). KAVAGait allows the clinician to store and inspect complex data
derived during clinical gait analysis. The system incorporates innovative and
interactive visual interface concepts, which were developed based on the needs
of clinicians. Additionally, an explicit knowledge store (EKS) allows
externalization and storage of implicit knowledge from clinicians. It makes
this information available for others, supporting the process of data
inspection and clinical decision making. We validated our system by conducting
expert reviews, a user study, and a case study. Results suggest that KAVAGait
is able to support a clinician during clinical practice by visualizing complex
gait data and providing knowledge of other clinicians.

 <dc:description>  Microblogging sites like Twitter and Weibo have emerged as important
sourcesof real-time information on ongoing events, including socio-political
events, emergency events, and so on. For instance, during emergency events
(such as earthquakes, floods, terror attacks), microblogging sites are very
useful for gathering situational information in real-time. During such an
event, typically only a small fraction of the microblogs (tweets) posted are
relevant to the information need. Hence, it is necessary to design effective
methodologies for microblog retrieval, so that the relevant tweets can be
automatically extracted from large sets of documents (tweets).
  In this work, we apply and compare various neural network-based IR models for
microblog retrieval for a specific application, as follows. In a disaster
situation, one of the primary and practical challenges in coordinating the
post-disaster relief operations is to know about what resources are needed and
what resources are available in the disaster-affected area. Thus, in this
study, we focus on extracting these two specific types of microblogs or tweets
namely need tweets and avail tweets, which are tweets which define some needs
of the people and the tweets which offer some solutions or aid for the people,
respectively.

 <dc:description>  The dimension of a partially ordered set $P$ is an extensively studied
parameter. Small dimension allows succinct encoding. Indeed if $P$ has
dimension $d$, then to know whether $x &lt; y$ in $P$ it is enough to check
whether $x&lt;y$ in each of the $d$ linear extensions of a witnessing realizer.
Focusing on the encoding aspect Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Pudl\'{a}k defined the
boolean dimension so that $P$ has boolean dimension at most $d$ if it is
possible to decide whether $x &lt; y$ in $P$ by looking at the relative position
of $x$ and $y$ in only $d$ permutations of the elements of $P$.
  Our main result is that posets with cover graphs of bounded tree-width have
bounded boolean dimension. This stays in contrast with the fact that there are
posets with cover graphs of tree-width three and arbitrarily large dimension.
  As a corollary, we obtain a labeling scheme of size $\log(n)$ for
reachability queries on $n$-vertex digraphs with bounded tree-width. Our
techniques seem to be very different from the usual approach for labeling
schemes which is based on divide-and-conquer decompositions of the input
graphs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we propose a novel neural network architecture for the problem
of human action recognition in videos. The proposed architecture expresses the
processing steps of classical Fisher vector approaches, that is dimensionality
reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) projection, Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) and Fisher vector descriptor extraction, as network layers. By
contrast to other methods where these steps are performed consecutively and the
corresponding parameters are learned in an unsupervised manner, having them
defined as a single neural network allows us to refine the whole model
discriminatively in an end to end fashion. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed architecture can be used as a replacement for the fully connected
layers in popular convolutional networks achieving a comparable classification
performance, or even significantly surpassing the performance of similar
architectures while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by a
factor of 5. We show that our method achieves significant improvements in
comparison to the classical chain.

 <dc:description>  Modern cities are complex systems, evolving at a fast pace. Thus, many urban
planning, political, and economic decisions require a deep and up-to-date
understanding of the local context of urban neighborhoods. This study shows
that the structure of openly available social media records, such as Twitter,
offers a possibility for building a unique dynamic signature of urban
neighborhood function, and, therefore, might be used as an efficient and simple
decision support tool. Considering New York City as an example, we investigate
how Twitter data can be used to decompose the urban landscape into
self-defining zones, aligned with the functional properties of individual
neighborhoods and their social and economic characteristics. We further explore
the potential of these data for detecting events and evaluating their impact
over time and space. This approach paves a way to a methodology for immediate
quantification of the impact of urban development programs and the estimation
of socioeconomic statistics at a finer spatial-temporal scale, thus allowing
urban policy-makers to track neighborhood transformations and foresee
undesirable changes in order to take early action before official statistics
would be available.

 <dc:description>  We present a one-sided error property testing algorithm for $H$-minor
freeness in bounded-degree graphs for any minor $H$ that is a minor of the $(k
\times 2)$-grid (for any $k \in \mathbb{N}$). This includes, for example,
testing whether a graph is a cactus graph and testing minor-freeness for minors
which are cycles with parallel chords. The query complexity of our algorithm in
terms of the number of vertices in the graph, $n$, is $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3} /
\epsilon^5)$. Czumaj et al. showed that cycle-freeness and $C_k$-minor freeness
can be tested with query complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. In contrast to these
results, we analyze the structure of the graph and show that either we can find
a subgraph of sublinear size that includes the forbidden minor, $H$, or we can
find a pair of disjoint subsets of vertices whose edge-cut is large, and such
that the induced subgraph of each subset is connected. We then prove a
combinatorial lemma which shows that the latter structure includes $H$ as a
minor.

shape and size of a two-dimensional target object on the plane by using
randomly distributed distance sensors whose locations are unknown. Based on the
analysis using geometric probability, we discuss the observability of these
parameters: which parameters we can estimate and what conditions are required
to estimate them. For a convex target object, its size and perimeter length are
observable, and other parameters are not observable. For a general polygon
target object, convexity in addition to its size and perimeter length is
observable. Parameters related to a concave vertex can be observable when some
conditions are satisfied. We also propose a method for estimating the convexity
of a target object and the perimeter length of the target object.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of densely connected layers
into recurrent neural networks. We evaluate our proposed architecture on the
Penn Treebank language modeling task. We show that we can obtain similar
perplexity scores with six times fewer parameters compared to a standard
stacked 2-layer LSTM model trained with dropout (Zaremba et al. 2014). In
contrast with the current usage of skip connections, we show that densely
connecting only a few stacked layers with skip connections already yields
significant perplexity reductions.

 <dc:description>  Balancing assembly lines, a family of optimization problems commonly known as
Assembly Line Balancing Problem, is notoriously NP-Hard. They comprise a set of
problems of enormous practical interest to manufacturing industry due to the
relevant frequency of this type of production paradigm. For this reason, many
researchers on Computational Intelligence and Industrial Engineering have been
conceiving algorithms for tackling different versions of assembly line
balancing problems utilizing different methodologies. In this article, it was
proposed a problem version referred as Mixed Model Workplace Time-dependent
Assembly Line Balancing Problem with the intention of including pressing issues
of real assembly lines in the optimization problem, to which four versions were
conceived. Heuristic search procedures were used, namely two Swarm Intelligence
algorithms from the Fish School Search family: the original version, named
&quot;vanilla&quot;, and a special variation including a stagnation avoidance routine.
Either approaches solved the newly posed problem achieving good results when
compared to Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

 <dc:title>Constructing Permutation Rational Functions From Isogenies</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A permutation rational function $f\in \mathbb{F}_q(x)$ is a rational function
that induces a bijection on $\mathbb{F}_q$, that is, for all $y\in\mathbb{F}_q$
there exists exactly one $x\in\mathbb{F}_q$ such that $f(x)=y$. Permutation
rational functions are intimately related to exceptional rational functions,
and more generally exceptional covers of the projective line, of which they
form the first important example.
  In this paper, we show how to efficiently generate many permutation rational
functions over large finite fields using isogenies of elliptic curves, and
discuss some cryptographic applications. Our algorithm is based on Fried's
modular interpretation of certain dihedral exceptional covers of the projective
line (Cont. Math., 1994).

 <dc:description>  NuCypher KMS is a decentralized Key Management System (KMS) that addresses
the limitations of using consensus networks to securely store and manipulate
private, encrypted data. It provides encryption and cryptographic access
controls, performed by a decentralized network, leveraging proxy re-encryption.
Unlike centralized KMS as a service solutions, it doesn't require trusting a
service provider. NuCypher KMS enables sharing of sensitive data for both
decentralized and centralized applications, providing security infrastructure
for applications from healthcare to identity management to decentralized
content marketplaces. NuCypher KMS will be an essential part of decentralized
applications, just as SSL/TLS is an essential part of every secure web
application.

 <dc:title>Naive Bayes Classification for Subset Selection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article focuses on the question of learning how to automatically select
a subset of items among a bigger set. We introduce a methodology for the
inference of ensembles of discrete values, based on the Naive Bayes assumption.
Our motivation stems from practical use cases where one wishes to predict an
unordered set of (possibly interdependent) values from a set of observed
features. This problem can be considered in the context of Multi-label
Classification (MLC) where such values are seen as labels associated to
continuous or discrete features. We introduce the \nbx algorithm, an extension
of Naive Bayes classification into the multi-label domain, discuss its
properties and evaluate our approach on real-world problems.

 <dc:description>  Tissue characterization has long been an important component of Computer
Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for automatic lesion detection and further
clinical planning. Motivated by the superior performance of deep learning
methods on various computer vision problems, there has been increasing work
applying deep learning to medical image analysis. However, the development of a
robust and reliable deep learning model for computer-aided diagnosis is still
highly challenging due to the combination of the high heterogeneity in the
medical images and the relative lack of training samples. Specifically,
annotation and labeling of the medical images is much more expensive and
time-consuming than other applications and often involves manual labor from
multiple domain experts. In this work, we propose a multi-stage, self-paced
learning framework utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify
Computed Tomography (CT) image patches. The key contribution of this approach
is that we augment the size of training samples by refining the unlabeled
instances with a self-paced learning CNN. By implementing the framework on high
performance computing servers including the NVIDIA DGX1 machine, we obtained
the experimental result, showing that the self-pace boosted network
consistently outperformed the original network even with very scarce manual
labels. The performance gain indicates that applications with limited training
samples such as medical image analysis can benefit from using the proposed
framework.

 <dc:title>Expect the unexpected: Harnessing Sentence Completion for Sarcasm

 <dc:description>  The trigram `I love being' is expected to be followed by positive words such
as `happy'. In a sarcastic sentence, however, the word `ignored' may be
observed. The expected and the observed words are, thus, incongruous. We model
sarcasm detection as the task of detecting incongruity between an observed and
an expected word. In order to obtain the expected word, we use Context2Vec, a
sentence completion library based on Bidirectional LSTM. However, since the
exact word where such an incongruity occurs may not be known in advance, we
present two approaches: an All-words approach (which consults sentence
completion for every content word) and an Incongruous words-only approach
(which consults sentence completion for the 50% most incongruous content
words). The approaches outperform reported values for tweets but not for
discussion forum posts. This is likely to be because of redundant consultation
of sentence completion for discussion forum posts. Therefore, we consider an
oracle case where the exact incongruous word is manually labeled in a corpus
reported in past work. In this case, the performance is higher than the
all-words approach. This sets up the promise for using sentence completion for
sarcasm detection.

 <dc:description>  This work focuses on the construction of optimized binary signaling schemes
for two-sender uncoded transmission of correlated sources over non-orthogonal
Gaussian multiple access channels. Specifically, signal constellations with
binary pulse-amplitude-modulation are designed for two senders to optimize the
overall system performance. Although the two senders transmit their own
messages independently, it is observed that the correlation between message
sources can be exploited to mitigate the interference present in the
non-orthogonal multiple access channel. Based on a performance analysis under
joint maximum-a-posteriori decoding, optimized constellations for various basic
waveform correlations between the senders are derived. Numerical results
further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this study is the automatic detection of onsets of the singing
voice in polyphonic audio recordings. Starting with a hypothesis that the
knowledge of the current position in a metrical cycle (i.e. metrical accent)
can improve the accuracy of vocal note onset detection, we propose a novel
probabilistic model to jointly track beats and vocal note onsets. The proposed
model extends a state of the art model for beat and meter tracking, in which
a-priori probability of a note at a specific metrical accent interacts with the
probability of observing a vocal note onset. We carry out an evaluation on a
varied collection of multi-instrument datasets from two music traditions
(English popular music and Turkish makam) with different types of metrical
cycles and singing styles. Results confirm that the proposed model reasonably
improves vocal note onset detection accuracy compared to a baseline model that
does not take metrical position into account.

 <dc:description>  This submission investigates alternative machine learning models for

the HTER score, we suggest a model that jointly predicts the amount of the 4
distinct post-editing operations, which are then used to calculate the HTER
score. This also gives the possibility to correct invalid (e.g. negative)
predicted values prior to the calculation of the HTER score. Without any
feature exploration, a multi-layer perceptron with 4 outputs yields small but
significant improvements over the baseline.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new channel pruning method to accelerate very
deep convolutional neural networks.Given a trained CNN model, we propose an
iterative two-step algorithm to effectively prune each layer, by a LASSO
regression based channel selection and least square reconstruction. We further
generalize this algorithm to multi-layer and multi-branch cases. Our method
reduces the accumulated error and enhance the compatibility with various
architectures. Our pruned VGG-16 achieves the state-of-the-art results by 5x
speed-up along with only 0.3% increase of error. More importantly, our method
is able to accelerate modern networks like ResNet, Xception and suffers only
1.4%, 1.0% accuracy loss under 2x speed-up respectively, which is significant.
Code has been made publicly available.

able swarm metaheuristic approaches in order to solve constrained optimization
problems. Sub-swarms are used in order to allow the achievement of many
feasible regions to be exploited in terms of fitness function. The niching
approach employed was wFSS, a version of the Fish School Search algorithm
devised specifically to deal with multi-modal search spaces. A base technique
referred as wrFSS was conceived and three variations applying different
constraint handling procedures were also proposed. Tests were performed in
seven problems from CEC 2010 and a comparison with other approaches was carried
out. Results show that the search strategy proposed is able to handle some
heavily constrained problems and achieve results comparable to the
state-of-the-art algorithms. However, we also observed that the local search
operator present in wFSS and inherited by wrFSS makes the fitness convergence
difficult when the feasible region presents some specific geometrical features.

 <dc:description>  Conventional wisdom holds that model-based planning is a powerful approach to
sequential decision-making. It is often very challenging in practice, however,
because while a model can be used to evaluate a plan, it does not prescribe how
to construct a plan. Here we introduce the &quot;Imagination-based Planner&quot;, the
first model-based, sequential decision-making agent that can learn to
construct, evaluate, and execute plans. Before any action, it can perform a
variable number of imagination steps, which involve proposing an imagined
action and evaluating it with its model-based imagination. All imagined actions
and outcomes are aggregated, iteratively, into a &quot;plan context&quot; which
conditions future real and imagined actions. The agent can even decide how to
imagine: testing out alternative imagined actions, chaining sequences of
actions together, or building a more complex &quot;imagination tree&quot; by navigating
flexibly among the previously imagined states using a learned policy. And our
agent can learn to plan economically, jointly optimizing for external rewards
and computational costs associated with using its imagination. We show that our
architecture can learn to solve a challenging continuous control problem, and
also learn elaborate planning strategies in a discrete maze-solving task. Our
work opens a new direction toward learning the components of a model-based
planning system and how to use them.

 <dc:description>  Existing region-based object detectors are limited to regions with fixed box
geometry to represent objects, even if those are highly non-rectangular. In
this paper we introduce DP-FCN, a deep model for object detection which
explicitly adapts to shapes of objects with deformable parts. Without
additional annotations, it learns to focus on discriminative elements and to
align them, and simultaneously brings more invariance for classification and
geometric information to refine localization. DP-FCN is composed of three main
modules: a Fully Convolutional Network to efficiently maintain spatial
resolution, a deformable part-based RoI pooling layer to optimize positions of
parts and build invariance, and a deformation-aware localization module
explicitly exploiting displacements of parts to improve accuracy of bounding
box regression. We experimentally validate our model and show significant
gains. DP-FCN achieves state-of-the-art performances of 83.1% and 80.9% on
PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 with VOC data only.

 <dc:description>  In the face of scarcity in detailed training annotations, the ability to
perform object localization tasks in real-time with weak-supervision is very
valuable. However, the computational cost of generating and evaluating region
proposals is heavy. We adapt the concept of Class Activation Maps (CAM) into
the very first weakly-supervised 'single-shot' detector that does not require
the use of region proposals. To facilitate this, we propose a novel global
pooling technique called Spatial Pyramid Averaged Max (SPAM) pooling for
training this CAM-based network for object extent localisation with only weak
image-level supervision. We show this global pooling layer possesses a near
ideal flow of gradients for extent localization, that offers a good trade-off
between the extremes of max and average pooling. Our approach only requires a
single network pass and uses a fast-backprojection technique, completely
omitting any region proposal steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach to do so. Due to this, we are able to perform inference in
real-time at 35fps, which is an order of magnitude faster than all previous
weakly supervised object localization frameworks.

 <dc:description>  Preparing and scanning histopathology slides consists of several steps, each
with a multitude of parameters. The parameters can vary between pathology labs
and within the same lab over time, resulting in significant variability of the
tissue appearance that hampers the generalization of automatic image analysis
methods. Typically, this is addressed with ad-hoc approaches such as staining
normalization that aim to reduce the appearance variability. In this paper, we
propose a systematic solution based on domain-adversarial neural networks. We
hypothesize that removing the domain information from the model representation
leads to better generalization. We tested our hypothesis for the problem of
mitosis detection in breast cancer histopathology images and made a comparative
analysis with two other approaches. We show that combining color augmentation
with domain-adversarial training is a better alternative than standard
approaches to improve the generalization of deep learning methods.

 <dc:description>  Many assembly lines related optimization problems have been tackled by
researchers in the last decades due to its relevance for the decision makers
within manufacturing industry. Many of theses problems, more specifically
Assembly Lines Balancing and Sequencing problems, are known to be NP-Hard.
Therefore, Computational Intelligence solution approaches have been conceived
in order to provide practical use decision making tools. In this work, we
proposed a simultaneous solution approach in order to tackle both Balancing and
Sequencing problems utilizing an effective meta-heuristic algorithm referred as
Fish School Search. Three different test instances were solved with the
original and two modified versions of this algorithm and the results were
compared with Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm.

 <dc:description>  For decomposable score-based structure learning of Bayesian networks,
existing approaches first compute a collection of candidate parent sets for
each variable and then optimize over this collection by choosing one parent set
for each variable without creating directed cycles while maximizing the total
score. We target the task of constructing the collection of candidate parent
sets when the score of choice is the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We
provide new non-trivial results that can be used to prune the search space of
candidate parent sets of each node. We analyze how these new results relate to
previous ideas in the literature both theoretically and empirically. We show in
experiments with UCI data sets that gains can be significant. Since the new
pruning rules are easy to implement and have low computational costs, they can
be promptly integrated into all state-of-the-art methods for structure learning
of Bayesian networks.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes a novel approach to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) keyword search
(KWS) task. The proposed approach is based on using high-level features from an
automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, so called phoneme posterior based
(PPB) features, for decoding. These features are obtained by calculating
time-dependent phoneme posterior probabilities from word lattices, followed by
their smoothing. For the PPB features we developed a special novel very fast,
simple and efficient OOV decoder. Experimental results are presented on the
Georgian language from the IARPA Babel Program, which was the test language in
the OpenKWS 2016 evaluation campaign. The results show that in terms of maximum
term weighted value (MTWV) metric and computational speed, for single ASR
systems, the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
approach based on using in-vocabulary proxies for OOV keywords in the indexed
database. The comparison of the two OOV KWS approaches on the fusion results of
the nine different ASR systems demonstrates that the proposed OOV decoder
outperforms the proxy-based approach in terms of MTWV metric given the
comparable processing speed. Other important advantages of the OOV decoder
include extremely low memory consumption and simplicity of its implementation
and parameter optimization.

 <dc:description>  This paper is first-line research expanding GANs into graph topology
analysis. By leveraging the hierarchical connectivity structure of a graph, we
have demonstrated that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can successfully
capture topological features of any arbitrary graph, and rank edge sets by
different stages according to their contribution to topology reconstruction.
Moreover, in addition to acting as an indicator of graph reconstruction, we
find that these stages can also preserve important topological features in a
graph.

devices can be controlled, programmed, and integrated with existing
computational workflows. We briefly describe several prominent quantum
computational models, their associated quantum processing units (QPUs), and the
adoption of these devices as accelerators within high-performance computing
systems. Emphasizing the interface to the QPU, we analyze instruction set
architectures based on reduced and complex instruction sets, i.e., RISC and
CISC architectures. We clarify the role of conventional constraints on memory
addressing and instruction widths within the quantum computing context.
Finally, we examine existing quantum computing platforms, including the D-Wave
2000Q and IBM Quantum Experience, within the context of future ISA development
and HPC needs.

deep reinforcement learning combining model-free and model-based aspects. In
contrast to most existing model-based reinforcement learning and planning
methods, which prescribe how a model should be used to arrive at a policy, I2As
learn to interpret predictions from a learned environment model to construct
implicit plans in arbitrary ways, by using the predictions as additional
context in deep policy networks. I2As show improved data efficiency,
performance, and robustness to model misspecification compared to several
baselines.

are described by independent stationary and ergodic processes. We extend a
TTL-based approximation of the cache hit probability first proposed by Fagin
for the independence reference model to this more general workload model. We
show that under very general conditions this approximation is exact as the
cache size and the number of contents go to infinity. Moreover, we establish
this not only for the aggregate cache hit probability but also for every
individual content. Last, we obtain the rate of convergence.

 <dc:description>  Designing quality in is a cornerstone of modern quality management
philosophies. Design for X (DfX) techniques provide guidelines, heuristics, and
metrics to ensure that a particular quality attribute exists in a design.
Although hundreds of papers have been published on DfX approaches, few
researchers have explored systematically applying multiple DfX in a particular
problem context. As the Internet of Things (IoT) evolves, boundaries between
people, computers, and objects will become less distinct, underscoring the need
for more holistic design. Using mixed methods, this paper examines the utility
of DfX in the emerging IoT ecosystem. We identify DfX that are applicable to
IoT-related design, and find gaps that demand further research and development.
The results from this study can be used to help designers and quality managers
select or develop appropriate DfX to use in designing components for the
Internet of Things (IoT), supporting actionable strategies for quality and

 <dc:description>  We present a novel method for obtaining high-quality, domain-targeted
multiple choice questions from crowd workers. Generating these questions can be
difficult without trading away originality, relevance or diversity in the
answer options. Our method addresses these problems by leveraging a large
corpus of domain-specific text and a small set of existing questions. It
produces model suggestions for document selection and answer distractor choice
which aid the human question generation process. With this method we have
assembled SciQ, a dataset of 13.7K multiple choice science exam questions
(Dataset available at http://allenai.org/data.html). We demonstrate that the
method produces in-domain questions by providing an analysis of this new
dataset and by showing that humans cannot distinguish the crowdsourced
questions from original questions. When using SciQ as additional training data
to existing questions, we observe accuracy improvements on real science exams.

 <dc:title>College Student Retention: When Do We Losing Them?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the long term goals of any college or university is increasing the
student retention. The negative impact of student dropout are clear to
students, parents, universities and society. The positive effect of decreasing
student attrition is also self-evident including higher chance of having a
better career and higher standard of life for college graduate. In view of
these reasons, directors in higher education feel increasingly pressurized to
outline and implement strategies to increase student retention. In this paper,
we provide a detailed analysis of the student attrition problem and use
statistical methods to predict when students are going to dropout from school
using real case data. Our work has a number of advantages with the potential of
being employed by higher education administrator of universities. We take
advantage of multiple kinds of information about different aspects of student's
characteristic and efficiently utilize them to make a personalized decision
about the risk of dropout for a particular student.

 <dc:title>Submodular Minimization Under Congruency Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Submodular function minimization (SFM) is a fundamental and efficiently
solvable problem class in combinatorial optimization with a multitude of
applications in various fields. Surprisingly, there is only very little known
about constraint types under which SFM remains efficiently solvable. The
arguably most relevant non-trivial constraint class for which polynomial SFM
algorithms are known are parity constraints, i.e., optimizing only over sets of
odd (or even) cardinality. Parity constraints capture classical combinatorial
optimization problems like the odd-cut problem, and they are a key tool in a
recent technique to efficiently solve integer programs with a constraint matrix
whose subdeterminants are bounded by two in absolute value.
  We show that efficient SFM is possible even for a significantly larger class
than parity constraints, by introducing a new approach that combines techniques
from Combinatorial Optimization, Combinatorics, and Number Theory. In
particular, we can show that efficient SFM is possible over all sets (of any
given lattice) of cardinality r mod m, as long as m is a constant prime power.
This covers generalizations of the odd-cut problem with open complexity status,
and with relevance in the context of integer programming with higher
subdeterminants. To obtain our results, we establish a connection between the
correctness of a natural algorithm, and the inexistence of set systems with
specific combinatorial properties. We introduce a general technique to disprove
the existence of such set systems, which allows for obtaining extensions of our
results beyond the above-mentioned setting. These extensions settle two open
questions raised by Geelen and Kapadia [Combinatorica, 2017] in the context of
computing the girth and cogirth of certain types of binary matroids.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a family of regression problems in a semi-supervised setting.
The task is to assign real-valued labels to a set of $n$ sample points,
provided a small training subset of $N$ labeled points. A goal of
semi-supervised learning is to take advantage of the (geometric) structure
provided by the large number of unlabeled data when assigning labels. We
consider random geometric graphs, with connection radius $\epsilon(n)$, to
represent the geometry of the data set. Functionals which model the task reward
the regularity of the estimator function and impose or reward the agreement
with the training data. Here we consider the discrete $p$-Laplacian
regularization.
  We investigate asymptotic behavior when the number of unlabeled points
increases, while the number of training points remains fixed. We uncover a
delicate interplay between the regularizing nature of the functionals
considered and the nonlocality inherent to the graph constructions. We
rigorously obtain almost optimal ranges on the scaling of $\epsilon(n)$ for the
asymptotic consistency to hold. We prove that the minimizers of the discrete
functionals in random setting converge uniformly to the desired continuum
limit. Furthermore we discover that for the standard model used there is a
restrictive upper bound on how quickly $\epsilon(n)$ must converge to zero as
$n \to \infty$. We introduce a new model which is as simple as the original
model, but overcomes this restriction.

 <dc:description>  Pairwise comparison data arises in many domains, including tournament
rankings, web search, and preference elicitation. Given noisy comparisons of a
fixed subset of pairs of items, we study the problem of estimating the
underlying comparison probabilities under the assumption of strong stochastic
transitivity (SST). We also consider the noisy sorting subclass of the SST
model. We show that when the assignment of items to the topology is arbitrary,
these permutation-based models, unlike their parametric counterparts, do not
admit consistent estimation for most comparison topologies used in practice. We
then demonstrate that consistent estimation is possible when the assignment of
items to the topology is randomized, thus establishing a dichotomy between
worst-case and average-case designs. We propose two estimators in the
average-case setting and analyze their risk, showing that it depends on the
comparison topology only through the degree sequence of the topology. The rates
achieved by these estimators are shown to be optimal for a large class of
graphs. Our results are corroborated by simulations on multiple comparison
topologies.

 <dc:description>  Computational models for sarcasm detection have often relied on the content
of utterances in isolation. However, speaker's sarcastic intent is not always
obvious without additional context. Focusing on social media discussions, we
investigate two issues: (1) does modeling of conversation context help in
sarcasm detection and (2) can we understand what part of conversation context
triggered the sarcastic reply. To address the first issue, we investigate
several types of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks that can model both the
conversation context and the sarcastic response. We show that the conditional
LSTM network (Rocktaschel et al., 2015) and LSTM networks with sentence level
attention on context and response outperform the LSTM model that reads only the
response. To address the second issue, we present a qualitative analysis of
attention weights produced by the LSTM models with attention and discuss the
results compared with human performance on the task.

 <dc:title>From Bach to the Beatles: The simulation of human tonal expectation

 <dc:description>  Tonal structure is in part conveyed by statistical regularities between
musical events, and research has shown that computational models reflect tonal
structure in music by capturing these regularities in schematic constructs like
pitch histograms. Of the few studies that model the acquisition of perceptual
learning from musical data, most have employed self-organizing models that
learn a topology of static descriptions of musical contexts. Also, the stimuli
used to train these models are often symbolic rather than acoustically faithful
representations of musical material. In this work we investigate whether
sequential predictive models of musical memory (specifically, recurrent neural
networks), trained on audio from commercial CD recordings, induce tonal
knowledge in a similar manner to listeners (as shown in behavioral studies in
music perception). Our experiments indicate that various types of recurrent
neural networks produce musical expectations that clearly convey tonal
structure. Furthermore, the results imply that although implicit knowledge of
tonal structure is a necessary condition for accurate musical expectation, the
most accurate predictive models also use other cues beyond the tonal structure
of the musical context.

 <dc:description>  While recognized as a theoretical and practical concept for over 20 years,
only now ransomware has taken centerstage as one of the most prevalent
cybercrimes. Various reports demonstrate the enormous burden placed on
companies, which have to grapple with the ongoing attack waves. At the same
time, our strategic understanding of the threat and the adversarial interaction
between organizations and cybercriminals perpetrating ransomware attacks is
lacking.
  In this paper, we develop, to the best of our knowledge, the first
game-theoretic model of the ransomware ecosystem. Our model captures a
multi-stage scenario involving organizations from different industry sectors
facing a sophisticated ransomware attacker. We place particular emphasis on the
decision of companies to invest in backup technologies as part of a contingency
plan, and the economic incentives to pay a ransom if impacted by an attack. We
further study to which degree comprehensive industry-wide backup investments
can serve as a deterrent for ongoing attacks.

 <dc:description>  It is generally accepted that machines can replicate cognitive tasks
performed by conscious agents as long as they are not based on the capacity of
awareness. We consider several views on the nature of subjective awareness,
which is fundamental for self-reflection and review, and present reasons why
this property is not computable. We argue that consciousness is more than an
epiphenomenon and assuming it to be a separate category is consistent with both
quantum mechanics and cognitive science. We speak of two kinds of
consciousness, little-C and big-C, and discuss the significance of this
classification in analyzing the current academic debates in the field. The
interaction between the system and the measuring apparatus of the experimenter
is examined both from the perspectives of decoherence and the quantum Zeno
effect. These ideas are used as context to address the question of limits to
machine consciousness.

 <dc:description>  Estimation is a critical component of synchronization in wireless and signal
processing systems. There is a rich body of work on estimator derivation,
optimization, and statistical characterization from analytic system models
which are used pervasively today. We explore an alternative approach to
building estimators which relies principally on approximate regression using
large datasets and large computationally efficient artificial neural network
models capable of learning non-linear function mappings which provide compact
and accurate estimates. For single carrier PSK modulation, we explore the
accuracy and computational complexity of such estimators compared with the
current gold-standard analytically derived alternatives. We compare performance
in various wireless operating conditions and consider the trade offs between
the two different classes of systems. Our results show the learned estimators
can provide improvements in areas such as short-time estimation and estimation
under non-trivial real world channel conditions such as fading or other
non-linear hardware or propagation effects.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel weakly supervised discriminative algorithm for learning
context specific registration metrics as a linear combination of conventional
similarity measures. Conventional metrics have been extensively used over the
past two decades and therefore both their strengths and limitations are known.
The challenge is to find the optimal relative weighting (or parameters) of
different metrics forming the similarity measure of the registration algorithm.
Hand-tuning these parameters would result in sub optimal solutions and quickly
become infeasible as the number of metrics increases. Furthermore, such
hand-crafted combination can only happen at global scale (entire volume) and
therefore will not be able to account for the different tissue properties. We
propose a learning algorithm for estimating these parameters locally,
conditioned to the data semantic classes. The objective function of our
formulation is a special case of non-convex function, difference of convex
function, which we optimize using the concave convex procedure. As a proof of
concept, we show the impact of our approach on three challenging datasets for
different anatomical structures and modalities.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Robust Speech Recognition via

 <dc:description>  Domain mismatch between training and testing can lead to significant
degradation in performance in many machine learning scenarios. Unfortunately,
this is not a rare situation for automatic speech recognition deployments in
real-world applications. Research on robust speech recognition can be regarded
as trying to overcome this domain mismatch issue. In this paper, we address the
unsupervised domain adaptation problem for robust speech recognition, where
both source and target domain speech are presented, but word transcripts are
only available for the source domain speech. We present novel
augmentation-based methods that transform speech in a way that does not change
the transcripts. Specifically, we first train a variational autoencoder on both
source and target domain data (without supervision) to learn a latent
representation of speech. We then transform nuisance attributes of speech that
are irrelevant to recognition by modifying the latent representations, in order
to augment labeled training data with additional data whose distribution is
more similar to the target domain. The proposed method is evaluated on the
CHiME-4 dataset and reduces the absolute word error rate (WER) by as much as
35% compared to the non-adapted baseline.

 <dc:title>Shape Generation using Spatially Partitioned Point Clouds</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a method to generate 3D shapes using point clouds. Given a
point-cloud representation of a 3D shape, our method builds a kd-tree to
spatially partition the points. This orders them consistently across all
shapes, resulting in reasonably good correspondences across all shapes. We then
use PCA analysis to derive a linear shape basis across the spatially
partitioned points, and optimize the point ordering by iteratively minimizing
the PCA reconstruction error. Even with the spatial sorting, the point clouds
are inherently noisy and the resulting distribution over the shape coefficients
can be highly multi-modal. We propose to use the expressive power of neural
networks to learn a distribution over the shape coefficients in a
generative-adversarial framework. Compared to 3D shape generative models
trained on voxel-representations, our point-based method is considerably more
light-weight and scalable, with little loss of quality. It also outperforms
simpler linear factor models such as Probabilistic PCA, both qualitatively and
quantitatively, on a number of categories from the ShapeNet dataset.
Furthermore, our method can easily incorporate other point attributes such as
normal and color information, an additional advantage over voxel-based
representations.

 <dc:title>Optimal Beamforming for Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels with Two Transmit

 <dc:description>  A Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channel in which the
eavesdropper and legitimate receiver are equipped with arbitrary numbers of
antennas and the transmitter has two antennas is studied in this paper. Under
an average power constraint, the optimal input covariance to obtain the secrecy
capacity of this channel is unknown, in general. In this paper, the input
covariance matrix required to achieve the capacity is determined. It is shown
that the secrecy capacity of this channel can be achieved by linear precoding.
The optimal precoding and power allocation schemes that maximize the achievable
secrecy rate, and thus achieve the capacity, are developed subsequently. The
secrecy capacity is then compared with the achievable secrecy rate of
generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD)-based precoding, which is the
best previously proposed technique for this problem. Numerical results
demonstrate that substantial gain can be obtained in secrecy rate between the
proposed and GSVD-based precodings.

 <dc:description>  We present ClaimChains, a cryptographic construction useful for storing
claims regarding users' key material and beliefs about the state of other users
in a decentralized system. We use ClaimChains to build a decentralized public
key infrastructure (PKI). ClaimChains maintain high integrity through the use
of authenticated data structures, namely hash chains and Merkle trees, and
ensure authenticity and non-repudiation through the use of digital signatures.
We introduce the concept of cross-referencing of ClaimChains to efficiently and
verifiably vouch for the state of other users in a decentralized system.
ClaimChains use cryptographic protections to ensure the privacy of claims,
i.e., to guarantee that they can only be read by the authorized users, and that
ClaimChain owners can not equivocate about the state of other users. We discuss
how ClaimChains support different degrees of PKI decentralization, to trade off
key availability for privacy. We show that ClaimChains provide the sought
security and privacy properties, and demonstrate that they have very reasonable
computation and memory requirements using a prototype implementation. We
evaluate the effectiveness of key propagation using a real email dataset in a
fully decentralized setting, which offers the best privacy properties. Our
results suggest that a high level of privacy comes at the cost of small
coverage in terms of key distribution.

 <dc:title>Modelling of Path Arrival Rate for In-Room Radio Channels with Directive
  Antennas</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pedersen, Troels</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We analyze the path arrival rate for an inroom radio channel with directive
antennas. The impulse response of this channel exhibits a transition from early
separate components followed by a diffuse reverberation tail. Under the
assumption that the transmitter's (or receiver's) position and orientation are
picked uniformly at random we derive an exact expression of the mean arrival
rate for a rectangular room predicted by the mirror source theory. The rate is
quadratic in delay, inversely proportional to the room volume, and proportional
to the product of beam coverage fractions of the transmitter and receiver
antennas. Making use of the exact formula, we characterize the onset of the
diffuse tail by defining a &quot;mixing time&quot; as the point in time where the arrival
rate exceeds one component per transmit pulse duration. We also give an
approximation for the power-delay spectrum. It turns out that the power-delay
spectrum is unaffected by the antenna directivity. However, Monte Carlo
simulations show that antenna directivity does indeed play an important role
for the distribution of instantaneous mean delay and rms delay spread

which was defined by S.Ramanujan in 1918. In this paper we have proposed
Orthog- onal Ramanujan Sums (ORS) based on Ramanujan sums. In this paper we
present two novel application of ORS. Firstly a new representation of a finite
length signal is given using ORS which is defined as Orthogonal Ramanujan
Periodic Transform.Secondly ORS has been applied to multiresolution analysis
and it is shown that Haar transform is a spe- cial case.

 <dc:description>  Mobile users in an urban environment access content on the internet from
different locations. It is challenging for the current service providers to
cope with the increasing content demand from a large number of collocated
mobile users. In-network caching to offload content at nodes closer to users
alleviate the issue, though efficient cache management is required to find out
who should cache what, when and where in an urban environment, given nodes
limited computing, communication and caching resources. To address this, we
first define a novel relation between content popularity and availability in
the network and investigate a node's eligibility to cache content based on its
urban reachability. We then allow nodes to self-organize into mobile fogs to
increase the distributed cache and maximize content availability in a
cost-effective manner. However, to cater rational nodes, we propose a coalition
game for the nodes to offer a maximum &quot;virtual cache&quot; assuming a monetary
reward is paid to them by the service/content provider. Nodes are allowed to
merge into different spatio-temporal coalitions in order to increase the
distributed cache size at the network edge. Results obtained through
simulations using realistic urban mobility trace validate the performance of
our caching system showing a ratio of 60-85% of cache hits compared to the
30-40% obtained by the existing schemes and 10% in case of no coalition.

 <dc:description>  Face alignment has witnessed substantial progress in the last decade. One of
the recent focuses has been aligning a dense 3D face shape to face images with
large head poses. The dominant technology used is based on the cascade of
regressors, e.g., CNN, which has shown promising results. Nonetheless, the
cascade of CNNs suffers from several drawbacks, e.g., lack of end-to-end
training, hand-crafted features and slow training speed. To address these
issues, we propose a new layer, named visualization layer, that can be
integrated into the CNN architecture and enables joint optimization with
different loss functions. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method on
multiple datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, while reducing the
training time by more than half compared to the typical cascade of CNNs. In
addition, we compare multiple CNN architectures with the visualization layer to
further demonstrate the advantage of its utilization.

 <dc:description>  A new trend in medicine is the use of algorithms to analyze big datasets,
e.g. using everything your phone measures about you for diagnostics or
monitoring. However, these algorithms are commonly compared against weak
baselines, which may contribute to excessive optimism. To assess how well an
algorithm works, scientists typically ask how well its output correlates with
medically assigned scores. Here we perform a meta-analysis to quantify how the
literature evaluates their algorithms for monitoring mental wellbeing. We find
that the bulk of the literature ($\sim$77%) uses meaningless comparisons that
ignore patient baseline state. For example, having an algorithm that uses phone
data to diagnose mood disorders would be useful. However, it is possible to
over 80% of the variance of some mood measures in the population by simply
guessing that each patient has their own average mood - the patient-specific
baseline. Thus, an algorithm that just predicts that our mood is like it
usually is can explain the majority of variance, but is, obviously, entirely
useless. Comparing to the wrong (population) baseline has a massive effect on
the perceived quality of algorithms and produces baseless optimism in the
field. To solve this problem we propose &quot;user lift&quot; that reduces these
systematic errors in the evaluation of personalized medical monitoring.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose STag, a fiducial marker system that provides stable
pose estimation. The outer square border of the marker is used for detection
and pose estimation. This is followed by a novel pose refinement step using the
inner circular border. The refined pose is more stable and robust across
viewing conditions compared to the state of the art. In addition, the
lexicographic generation algorithm is adapted for fiducial markers, and
libraries with various sizes are created. This makes the system suitable for
applications that require many unique markers, or few unique markers with high
occlusion resistance. The edge segment-based detection algorithm is of low
complexity, and returns few false candidates. These features are demonstrated
with experiments on real images, including comparisons with the state of the
art fiducial marker systems.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning is widely used for dialogue policy optimization where
the reward function often consists of more than one component, e.g., the
dialogue success and the dialogue length. In this work, we propose a structured
method for finding a good balance between these components by searching for the
optimal reward component weighting. To render this search feasible, we use
multi-objective reinforcement learning to significantly reduce the number of
training dialogues required. We apply our proposed method to find optimized
component weights for six domains and compare them to a default baseline.

(evolutionary and particle swarm algorithms). These strategies are trained to
perform well against a corpus of over 170 distinct opponents, including many

strategies and one particular human made designed strategy are the top
performers in noisy tournaments also.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Bridge-Finding in $\tilde{O}(\log ^2 n)$ Amortized Time</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a deterministic fully-dynamic data structure for maintaining
information about the bridges in a graph. We support updates in
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^2)$ amortized time, and can find a bridge in the component
of any given vertex, or a bridge separating any two given vertices, in $O(\log
n / \log \log n)$ worst case time. Our bounds match the current best for bounds
for deterministic fully-dynamic connectivity up to $\log\log n$ factors. The
previous best dynamic bridge finding was an $\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$ amortized
time algorithm by Thorup [STOC2000], which was a bittrick-based improvement on
the $O((\log n)^4)$ amortized time algorithm by Holm et al.[STOC98, JACM2001].
  Our approach is based on a different and purely combinatorial improvement of
the algorithm of Holm et al., which by itself gives a new combinatorial
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$ amortized time algorithm. Combining it with Thorup's
bittrick, we get down to the claimed $\tilde{O}((\log n)^2)$ amortized time.
  Essentially the same new trick can be applied to the biconnectivity data
structure from [STOC98, JACM2001], improving the amortized update time to
$\tilde{O}((\log n)^3)$.
  We also offer improvements in space. We describe a general trick which
applies to both of our new algorithms, and to the old ones, to get down to
linear space, where the previous best use $O(m + n\log n\log\log n)$. Finally,
we show how to obtain $O(\log n/\log \log n)$ query time, matching the optimal
trade-off between update and query time.
  Our result yields an improved running time for deciding whether a unique
perfect matching exists in a static graph.

 <dc:description>  Calcium imaging is a technique for observing neuron activity as a series of
images showing indicator fluorescence over time. Manually segmenting neurons is
time-consuming, leading to research on automated calcium imaging segmentation
(ACIS). We evaluated several deep learning models for ACIS on the Neurofinder
competition datasets and report our best model: U-Net2DS, a fully convolutional
network that operates on 2D mean summary images. U-Net2DS requires minimal
domain-specific pre/post-processing and parameter adjustment, and predictions
are made on full $512\times512$ images at $\approx$9K images per minute. It
ranks third in the Neurofinder competition ($F_1=0.569$) and is the best model
to exclusively use deep learning. We also demonstrate useful segmentations on
data from outside the competition. The model's simplicity, speed, and quality
results make it a practical choice for ACIS and a strong baseline for more
complex models in the future.

 <dc:title>FLAME: A Fast Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly Approach to Causal

 <dc:description>  A classical problem in causal inference is that of matching, where treatment
units need to be matched to control units. Some of the main challenges in
developing matching methods arise from the tension among (i) inclusion of as
many covariates as possible in defining the matched groups, (ii) having matched
groups with enough treated and control units for a valid estimate of Average
Treatment Effect (ATE) in each group, and (iii) computing the matched pairs
efficiently for large datasets. In this paper we propose a fast method for
approximate and exact matching in causal analysis called FLAME (Fast
Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly). We define an optimization objective for
match quality, which gives preferences to matching on covariates that can be
useful for predicting the outcome while encouraging as many matches as
possible. FLAME aims to optimize our match quality measure, leveraging
techniques that are natural for query processing in the area of database
management. We provide two implementations of FLAME using SQL queries and
bit-vector techniques.

 <dc:description>  Classical approaches for estimating optical flow have achieved rapid progress
in the last decade. However, most of them are too slow to be applied in
real-time video analysis. Due to the great success of deep learning, recent
work has focused on using CNNs to solve such dense prediction problems. In this
paper, we investigate a new deep architecture, Densely Connected Convolutional
Networks (DenseNet), to learn optical flow. This specific architecture is ideal
for the problem at hand as it provides shortcut connections throughout the
network, which leads to implicit deep supervision. We extend current DenseNet
to a fully convolutional network to learn motion estimation in an unsupervised
manner. Evaluation results on three standard benchmarks demonstrate that
DenseNet is a better fit than other widely adopted CNN architectures for
optical flow estimation.

 <dc:description>  Segmentation of retinal vessels from retinal fundus images is the key step in
the automatic retinal image analysis. In this paper, we propose a new
unsupervised automatic method to segment the retinal vessels from retinal
fundus images. Contrast enhancement and illumination correction are carried out
through a series of image processing steps followed by adaptive histogram
equalization and anisotropic diffusion filtering. This image is then converted
to a gray scale using weighted scaling. The vessel edges are enhanced by
boosting the detail curvelet coefficients. Optic disk pixels are removed before
applying fuzzy C-mean classification to avoid the misclassification.
Morphological operations and connected component analysis are applied to obtain
the segmented retinal vessels. The performance of the proposed method is
evaluated using DRIVE database to be able to compare with other state-of-art
supervised and unsupervised methods. The overall segmentation accuracy of the
proposed method is 95.18% which outperforms the other algorithms.

 <dc:description>  LPMLN is a recent addition to probabilistic logic programming languages. Its
main idea is to overcome the rigid nature of the stable model semantics by
assigning a weight to each rule in a way similar to Markov Logic is defined. We
present two implementations of LPMLN, $\text{LPMLN2ASP}$ and
$\text{LPMLN2MLN}$. System $\text{LPMLN2ASP}$ translates LPMLN programs into
the input language of answer set solver $\text{CLINGO}$, and using weak
constraints and stable model enumeration, it can compute most probable stable
models as well as exact conditional and marginal probabilities. System
$\text{LPMLN2MLN}$ translates LPMLN programs into the input language of Markov
Logic solvers, such as $\text{ALCHEMY}$, $\text{TUFFY}$, and $\text{ROCKIT}$,
and allows for performing approximate probabilistic inference on LPMLN
programs. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the LPMLN systems for computing
other languages, such as ProbLog and Pearl's Causal Models, that are shown to
be translatable into LPMLN. (Under consideration for acceptance in TPLP)

 <dc:title>Multi-Branch Fully Convolutional Network for Face Detection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bai, Yancheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ghanem, Bernard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Face detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision. It is still a
challenging task in unconstrained conditions due to significant variations in
scale, pose, expressions, and occlusion. In this paper, we propose a
multi-branch fully convolutional network (MB-FCN) for face detection, which
considers both efficiency and effectiveness in the design process. Our MB-FCN
detector can deal with faces at all scale ranges with only a single pass
through the backbone network. As such, our MB-FCN model saves computation and
thus is more efficient, compared to previous methods that make multiple passes.
For each branch, the specific skip connections of the convolutional feature
maps at different layers are exploited to represent faces in specific scale
ranges. Specifically, small faces can be represented with both shallow
fine-grained and deep powerful coarse features. With this representation,
superior improvement in performance is registered for the task of detecting
small faces. We test our MB-FCN detector on two public face detection
benchmarks, including FDDB and WIDER FACE. Extensive experiments show that our
detector outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all these datasets in general
and by a substantial margin on the most challenging among them (e.g. WIDER FACE
Hard subset). Also, MB-FCN runs at 15 FPS on a GPU for images of size 640 x 480
with no assumption on the minimum detectable face size.

algorithm is employed to obtain the relay pair and the packets in the buffer

data transmission. We also devise PLNC schemes based on the design of linear
network coding matrices using maximum likelihood and minimum mean-square error
criteria to generate the network coded symbols that are sent to the
destination. Simulation results show that the proposed techniques significantly

 <dc:description>  Learning cooperative policies for multi-agent systems is often challenged by
partial observability and a lack of coordination. In some settings, the
structure of a problem allows a distributed solution with limited
communication. Here, we consider a scenario where no communication is
available, and instead we learn local policies for all agents that collectively
mimic the solution to a centralized multi-agent static optimization problem.
Our main contribution is an information theoretic framework based on rate
distortion theory which facilitates analysis of how well the resulting fully
decentralized policies are able to reconstruct the optimal solution. Moreover,
this framework provides a natural extension that addresses which nodes an agent
should communicate with to improve the performance of its individual policy.

 <dc:description>  The difficulty of image recognition has gradually increased from general
category recognition to fine-grained recognition and to the recognition of some
subtle attributes such as temperature and geolocation. In this paper, we try to
focus on the classification between sunrise and sunset and hope to give a hint
about how to tell the difference in subtle attributes. Sunrise vs. sunset is a
difficult recognition task, which is challenging even for humans. Towards
understanding this new problem, we first collect a new dataset made up of over
one hundred webcams from different places. Since existing algorithmic methods
have poor accuracy, we propose a new pairwise learning strategy to learn
features from selective pairs of images. Experiments show that our approach
surpasses baseline methods by a large margin and achieves better results even
compared with humans. We also apply our approach to existing subtle attribute
recognition problems, such as temperature estimation, and achieve
state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  In the digital age, the amount of data produced is growing exponentially.
Governments and institutions can no longer rely on old methods for storing data
and passing on the knowledge to future generations. Digital data preservation
is a mandatory issue that needs proper strategies and tools. With this
awareness, efforts are being made to create and perfect software solutions
capable of responding to the challenge of properly preserving digital
information. This paper focuses on the state-of-the-art in open-source software
solutions for the digital preservation and curation field used to assimilate
and disseminate information to designated audiences. Eleven open source
projects for digital preservation are surveyed in areas such as supported
standards and protocols, strategies for preservation, methodologies for
reporting, dynamic of development, targeted operating systems, multilingual
support and open source license. Furthermore, five of these open source
projects, are further analysed, with focus on features deemed important for the
area. Along open source solutions, the paper also briefly surveys the standards

 <dc:description>  Shannon's sampling theorem provides a link between the continuous and the
discrete realms stating that bandlimited signals are uniquely determined by its
values on a discrete set. This theorem is realized in practice using so called
analog--to--digital converters (ADCs). Unlike Shannon's sampling theorem, the
ADCs are limited in dynamic range. Whenever a signal exceeds some preset
threshold, the ADC saturates, resulting in aliasing due to clipping. The goal
of this paper is to analyze an alternative approach that does not suffer from
these problems. Our work is based on recent developments in ADC design, which
allow for ADCs that reset rather than to saturate, thus producing modulo
samples. An open problem that remains is: Given such modulo samples of a
bandlimited function as well as the dynamic range of the ADC, how can the
original signal be recovered and what are the sufficient conditions that
guarantee perfect recovery? In this paper, we prove such sufficiency conditions
and complement them with a stable recovery algorithm. Our results are not
limited to certain amplitude ranges, in fact even the same circuit architecture
allows for the recovery of arbitrary large amplitudes as long as some estimate
of the signal norm is available when recovering. Numerical experiments that
corroborate our theory indeed show that it is possible to perfectly recover
function that takes values that are orders of magnitude higher than the ADC's
threshold.

 <dc:title>A Sub-Character Architecture for Korean Language Processing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stratos, Karl</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel sub-character architecture that exploits a unique
compositional structure of the Korean language. Our method decomposes each
character into a small set of primitive phonetic units called jamo letters from
which character- and word-level representations are induced. The jamo letters
divulge syntactic and semantic information that is difficult to access with
conventional character-level units. They greatly alleviate the data sparsity
problem, reducing the observation space to 1.6% of the original while
increasing accuracy in our experiments. We apply our architecture to dependency
parsing and achieve dramatic improvement over strong lexical baselines.

 <dc:description>  We propose an efficient and unified framework, namely ThiNet, to
simultaneously accelerate and compress CNN models in both training and
inference stages. We focus on the filter level pruning, i.e., the whole filter
would be discarded if it is less important. Our method does not change the
original network structure, thus it can be perfectly supported by any
off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. We formally establish filter pruning as
an optimization problem, and reveal that we need to prune filters based on
statistics information computed from its next layer, not the current layer,
which differentiates ThiNet from existing methods. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy, which has advanced the
state-of-the-art. We also show the performance of ThiNet on ILSVRC-12
benchmark. ThiNet achieves 3.31$\times$ FLOPs reduction and 16.63$\times$
compression on VGG-16, with only 0.52$\%$ top-5 accuracy drop. Similar
experiments with ResNet-50 reveal that even for a compact network, ThiNet can
also reduce more than half of the parameters and FLOPs, at the cost of roughly
1$\%$ top-5 accuracy drop. Moreover, the original VGG-16 model can be further
pruned into a very small model with only 5.05MB model size, preserving AlexNet
level accuracy but showing much stronger generalization ability.

 <dc:title>Inapproximability of the Standard Pebble Game and Hard to Pebble Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Demaine, Erik D.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Pebble games are single-player games on DAGs involving placing and moving
pebbles on nodes of the graph according to a certain set of rules. The goal is
to pebble a set of target nodes using a minimum number of pebbles. In this
paper, we present a possibly simpler proof of the result in [CLNV15] and
strengthen the result to show that it is PSPACE-hard to determine the minimum
number of pebbles to an additive $n^{1/3-\epsilon}$ term for all $\epsilon &gt;
0$, which improves upon the currently known additive constant hardness of
approximation [CLNV15] in the standard pebble game. We also introduce a family
of explicit, constant indegree graphs with $n$ nodes where there exists a graph
in the family such that using constant $k$ pebbles requires $\Omega(n^k)$ moves
to pebble in both the standard and black-white pebble games. This independently
answers an open question summarized in [Nor15] of whether a family of DAGs
exists that meets the upper bound of $O(n^k)$ moves using constant $k$ pebbles
with a different construction than that presented in [AdRNV17].

 <dc:description>  We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement
learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the
environment, and optimizing a &quot;surrogate&quot; objective function using stochastic
gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient
update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables
multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal
policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy
optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and
have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a
collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari
game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient
methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity,
simplicity, and wall-time.

 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) enables power-domain multiplexing via
successive interference cancellation (SIC) and has been viewed as a promising
technology for 5G communication. The full benefit of NOMA depends on resource
allocation, including power allocation and channel assignment, for all users,
which, however, leads to mixed integer programs. In the literature, the optimal
power allocation has only been found in some special cases, while the joint
optimization of power allocation and channel assignment generally requires
exhaustive search. In this paper, we investigate resource allocation in
downlink NOMA systems. As the main contribution, we analytically characterize
the optimal power allocation with given channel assignment over multiple
channels under different performance criteria. Specifically, we consider the
maximin fairness, weighted sum rate maximization, sum rate maximization with
quality of service (QoS) constraints, energy efficiency maximization with
weights or QoS constraints in NOMA systems. We also take explicitly into
account the order constraints on the powers of the users on each channel, which
are often ignored in theexisting works, and show that they have a significant
impact on SIC in NOMA systems. Then, we provide the optimal power allocation
for the considered criteria in closed or semi-closed form. We also propose a
low-complexity efficient method to jointly optimize channel assignment and
power allocation in NOMA systems by incorporating the matching algorithm with
the optimal power allocation. Simulation results show that the joint resource
optimization using our optimal power allocation yields better performance than
the existing schemes.

 <dc:description>  For an autonomous system to provide value (e.g., to customers, designers, or
society at large) it must have a reliable method to determine the intended
goal. This is the essence of the value-alignment problem: ensuring that the
objectives of an autonomous system match those of its human users. In robotics,
value alignment is crucial to the design of collaborative robots that can
integrate into human workflows, successfully learning and adapting to the
objectives of their users as they go. We argue that a meaningful solution to
the value-alignment problem will combine multi-agent decision theory with rich
mathematical models of human cognition, enabling robots to tap into people's
natural collaborative capabilities. We present a solution to the cooperative
inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL) dynamic game using well-established
models of decision making and theory of mind from cognitive science. The
solution accounts for two crucial aspects of collaborative value alignment:
that the human will not plan her actions in isolation, but will reason
pedagogically about how the robot might learn from them; and that the robot
should anticipate this and interpret the human's actions pragmatically. To our
knowledge, this constitutes the first equilibrium analysis of value alignment
grounded in an empirically validated cognitive model of the human.

 <dc:description>  Video Question Answering is a challenging problem in visual information
retrieval, which provides the answer to the referenced video content according
to the question. However, the existing visual question answering approaches
mainly tackle the problem of static image question, which may be ineffectively
for video question answering due to the insufficiency of modeling the temporal
dynamics of video contents. In this paper, we study the problem of video
question answering by modeling its temporal dynamics with frame-level attention
mechanism. We propose the attribute-augmented attention network learning
framework that enables the joint frame-level attribute detection and unified
video representation learning for video question answering. We then incorporate
the multi-step reasoning process for our proposed attention network to further
improve the performance. We construct a large-scale video question answering
dataset. We conduct the experiments on both multiple-choice and open-ended
video question answering tasks to show the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

 <dc:description>  The naive approach to annotation projection is not effective to project
discourse annotations from one language to another because implicit discourse
relations are often changed to explicit ones and vice-versa in the translation.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on the intersection between
statistical word-alignment models to identify unsupported discourse
annotations. This approach identified 65% of the unsupported annotations in the
English-French parallel sentences from Europarl. By filtering out these
unsupported annotations, we induced the first PDTB-style discourse annotated
corpus for French from Europarl. We then used this corpus to train a classifier
to identify the discourse-usage of French discourse connectives and show a 15%
improvement of F1-score compared to the classifier trained on the non-filtered
annotations.

 <dc:description>  The amount of information available to the mathematics teacher is so enormous
that the selection of desirable content is gradually becoming a huge task in
itself. With respect to the inclusion of elements of history of mathematics in
mathematics instruction, the era of Big Data introduces a high likelihood of
Recency Bias, a hitherto unconnected challenge for stakeholders in mathematics
education. This tendency to choose recent information at the expense of
relevant older, composite, historical facts stands to defeat the aims and
objectives of the epistemological and cultural approach to mathematics
instructional delivery. This study is a didactic discourse with focus on this
threat to the history and pedagogy of mathematics, particularly as it affects
mathematics education in Nigeria. The implications for mathematics curriculum
developers, teacher-training programmes, teacher lesson preparation, and
publication of mathematics instructional materials were also deeply considered.

 <dc:description>  Variance-based logic (VBL) uses the fluctuations or the variance in the state
of a particle or a physical quantity to represent different logic levels. In
this letter we show that compared to the traditional bi-stable logic
representation the variance-based representation can theoretically achieve a
superior performance trade-off (in terms of energy dissipation and information
capacity) when operating at fundamental limits imposed by thermal-noise. We
show that for a bi-stable logic device the lower limit on energy dissipated per
bit is 4.35KT/bit, whereas under similar operating conditions, a VBL device
could achieve a lower limit of sub-KT/bit. These theoretical results are
general enough to be applicable to different instantiations and variants of VBL
ranging from digital processors based on energy-scavenging or to processors
based on the emerging valleytronic devices.

 <dc:title>An Alon-Boppana Type Bound for Weighted Graphs and Lowerbounds for
  Spectral Sparsification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Srivastava, Nikhil</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We prove the following Alon-Boppana type theorem for general (not necessarily
regular) weighted graphs: if $G$ is an $n$-node weighted undirected graph of
average combinatorial degree $d$ (that is, $G$ has $dn/2$ edges) and girth $g&gt;
2d^{1/8}+1$, and if $\lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \lambda_n$ are the
eigenvalues of the (non-normalized) Laplacian of $G$, then \[ \frac
{\lambda_n}{\lambda_2} \geq 1 + \frac 4{\sqrt d} - O \left( \frac 1{d^{\frac
58} }\right) \] (The Alon-Boppana theorem implies that if $G$ is unweighted and
$d$-regular, then $\frac {\lambda_n}{\lambda_2} \geq 1 + \frac 4{\sqrt d} -
O\left( \frac 1 d \right)$ if the diameter is at least $d^{1.5}$.)
  Our result implies a lower bound for spectral sparsifiers. A graph $H$ is a
spectral $\epsilon$-sparsifier of a graph $G$ if \[ L(G) \preceq L(H) \preceq
(1+\epsilon) L(G) \] where $L(G)$ is the Laplacian matrix of $G$ and $L(H)$ is
the Laplacian matrix of $H$. Batson, Spielman and Srivastava proved that for
every $G$ there is an $\epsilon$-sparsifier $H$ of average degree $d$ where
$\epsilon \approx \frac {4\sqrt 2}{\sqrt d}$ and the edges of $H$ are a
(weighted) subset of the edges of $G$. Batson, Spielman and Srivastava also
show that the bound on $\epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\approx \frac
2{\sqrt d}$ when $G$ is a clique; our Alon-Boppana-type result implies that
$\epsilon$ cannot be reduced below $\approx \frac 4{\sqrt d}$ when $G$ comes
from a family of expanders of super-constant degree and super-constant girth.
  The method of Batson, Spielman and Srivastava proves a more general result,
about sparsifying sums of rank-one matrices, and their method applies to an
&quot;online&quot; setting. We show that for the online matrix setting the $4\sqrt 2 /
\sqrt d$ bound is tight, up to lower order terms.

 <dc:description>  We describe a new deep learning architecture for learning to rank question
answer pairs. Our approach extends the long short-term memory (LSTM) network
with holographic composition to model the relationship between question and
answer representations. As opposed to the neural tensor layer that has been
adopted recently, the holographic composition provides the benefits of scalable
and rich representational learning approach without incurring huge parameter
costs. Overall, we present Holographic Dual LSTM (HD-LSTM), a unified
architecture for both deep sentence modeling and semantic matching.
Essentially, our model is trained end-to-end whereby the parameters of the LSTM
are optimized in a way that best explains the correlation between question and
answer representations. In addition, our proposed deep learning architecture
requires no extensive feature engineering. Via extensive experiments, we show
that HD-LSTM outperforms many other neural architectures on two popular
benchmark QA datasets. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of
holographic composition over the neural tensor layer.

 <dc:title>Document Listing on Repetitive Collections with Guaranteed Performance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Navarro, Gonzalo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider document listing on string collections, that is, finding in which
strings a given pattern appears. In particular, we focus on repetitive
collections: a collection of size $N$ over alphabet $[1,\sigma]$ is composed of
$D$ copies of a string of size $n$, and $s$ single-character or block edits are
applied on ranges of copies. We introduce the first document listing index with
size $\tilde{O}(n+s)$, precisely $O((n\log\sigma+s\log^2 N)\log D)$ bits, and
with useful worst-case time guarantees: Given a pattern of length $m$, the
index reports the $\ndoc$ strings where it appears in time $O(m^2 +
m\log^{1+\epsilon} N \cdot \ndoc)$, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. Our
technique is to augment a range data structure that is commonly used on
grammar-based indexes, so that instead of retrieving all the pattern
occurrences, it computes useful summaries on them. We show that the idea has
independent interest: we introduce the first grammar-based index that, on a
text $T[1,N]$ with a grammar of size $r$, uses $O(r\log N)$ bits and counts the
number of occurrences of a pattern $P[1,m]$ in time $O(m^2 + m\log^{2+\epsilon}
r)$, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for reconstructing 3D shapes from 2D sketches in the form
of line drawings. Our method takes as input a single sketch, or multiple
sketches, and outputs a dense point cloud representing a 3D reconstruction of
the input sketch(es). The point cloud is then converted into a polygon mesh. At
the heart of our method lies a deep, encoder-decoder network. The encoder
converts the sketch into a compact representation encoding shape information.
The decoder converts this representation into depth and normal maps capturing
the underlying surface from several output viewpoints. The multi-view maps are
then consolidated into a 3D point cloud by solving an optimization problem that
fuses depth and normals across all viewpoints. Based on our experiments,
compared to other methods, such as volumetric networks, our architecture offers
several advantages, including more faithful reconstruction, higher output
surface resolution, better preservation of topology and shape structure.

 <dc:description>  We transfer a key idea from the field of sentiment analysis to a new domain:
community question answering (cQA). The cQA task we are interested in is the
following: given a question and a thread of comments, we want to re-rank the
comments so that the ones that are good answers to the question would be ranked
higher than the bad ones. We notice that good vs. bad comments use specific
vocabulary and that one can often predict the goodness/badness of a comment
even ignoring the question, based on the comment contents only. This leads us
to the idea to build a good/bad polarity lexicon as an analogy to the
positive/negative sentiment polarity lexicons, commonly used in sentiment
analysis. In particular, we use pointwise mutual information in order to build
large-scale goodness polarity lexicons in a semi-supervised manner starting
with a small number of initial seeds. The evaluation results show an
improvement of 0.7 MAP points absolute over a very strong baseline and
state-of-the art performance on SemEval-2016 Task 3.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a learning rule based on a back-propagation (BP)
algorithm that can be applied to a hardware-based deep neural network (HW-DNN)
using electronic devices that exhibit discrete and limited conductance
characteristics. This adaptive learning rule, which enables forward, backward
propagation, as well as weight updates in hardware, is helpful during the
implementation of power-efficient and high-speed deep neural networks. In
simulations using a three-layer perceptron network, we evaluate the learning
performance according to various conductance responses of electronic synapse
devices and weight-updating methods. It is shown that the learning accuracy is
comparable to that obtained when using a software-based BP algorithm when the
electronic synapse device has a linear conductance response with a high dynamic
range. Furthermore, the proposed unidirectional weight-updating method is
suitable for electronic synapse devices which have nonlinear and finite
conductance responses. Because this weight-updating method can compensate the
demerit of asymmetric weight updates, we can obtain better accuracy compared to
other methods. This adaptive learning rule, which can be applied to full
hardware implementation, can also compensate the degradation of learning
accuracy due to the probable device-to-device variation in an actual electronic
synapse device.

 <dc:description>  Both hybrid automata and action languages are formalisms for describing the
evolution of dynamic systems. This paper establishes a formal relationship
between them. We show how to succinctly represent hybrid automata in an action
language which in turn is defined as a high-level notation for answer set
programming modulo theories (ASPMT) --- an extension of answer set programs to
the first-order level similar to the way satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)
extends propositional satisfiability (SAT). We first show how to represent
linear hybrid automata with convex invariants by an action language modulo
theories. A further translation into SMT allows for computing them using SMT
solvers that support arithmetic over reals. Next, we extend the representation
to the general class of non-linear hybrid automata allowing even non-convex
invariants. We represent them by an action language modulo ODE (Ordinary
Differential Equations), which can be compiled into satisfiability modulo ODE.
We developed a prototype system cplus2aspmt based on these translations, which
allows for a succinct representation of hybrid transition systems that can be
computed effectively by the state-of-the-art SMT solver dReal.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study the problem of dispersion of mobile robots on dynamic
rings. The problem of dispersion of $n$ robots on an $n$ node graph, introduced
by Augustine and Moses Jr. [1], requires robots to coordinate with each other
and reach a configuration where exactly one robot is present on each node. This
problem has real world applications and applies whenever we want to minimize
the total cost of $n$ agents sharing $n$ resources, located at various places,
subject to the constraint that the cost of an agent moving to a different
resource is comparatively much smaller than the cost of multiple agents sharing
a resource (e.g. smart electric cars sharing recharge stations). The study of
this problem also provides indirect benefits to the study of scattering on
graphs, the study of exploration by mobile robots, and the study of load
balancing on graphs.
  We solve the problem of dispersion in the presence of two types of dynamism
in the underlying graph: (i) vertex permutation and (ii) 1-interval
connectivity. We introduce the notion of vertex permutation dynamism and have
it mean that for a given set of nodes, in every round, the adversary ensures a
ring structure is maintained, but the connections between the nodes may change.
We use the idea of 1-interval connectivity from Di Luna et al. [10], where for
a given ring, in each round, the adversary chooses at most one edge to remove.
  We assume robots have full visibility and present asymptotically time optimal
algorithms to achieve dispersion in the presence of both types of dynamism when
robots have chirality. When robots do not have chirality, we present
asymptotically time optimal algorithms to achieve dispersion subject to certain
constraints. Finally, we provide impossibility results for dispersion when
robots have no visibility.

 <dc:description>  Learning and recognition is a fundamental process performed in many robot
operations such as mapping and localization. The majority of approaches share
some common characteristics, such as attempting to extract salient features,
landmarks or signatures, and growth in data storage and computational
requirements as the size of the environment increases. In biological systems,
spatial encoding in the brain is definitively known to be performed using a
fixed-size neural encoding framework - the place, head-direction and grid cells
found in the mammalian hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Particularly
paradoxically, one of the main encoding centers - the grid cells - represents
the world using a highly aliased, repetitive encoding structure where one
neuron represents an unbounded number of places in the world. Inspired by this
system, in this paper we invert the normal approach used in forming mapping and
localization algorithms, by developing a novel place recognition algorithm that
seeks out and leverages repetitive, mutually complementary landmark frequencies
in the world. The combinatorial encoding capacity of multiple different
frequencies enables not only the ability to achieve efficient data storage, but
also the potential for sub-linear storage growth in a learning and recall
system. Using both ground-based and aerial camera datasets, we demonstrate the
system finding and utilizing these frequencies to achieve successful place
recognition, and discuss how this approach might scale to arbitrarily large
global datasets and dimensions.

 <dc:description>  Reusable model design becomes desirable with the rapid expansion of computer
vision and machine learning applications. In this paper, we focus on the
reusability of pre-trained deep convolutional models. Specifically, different
from treating pre-trained models as feature extractors, we reveal more
treasures beneath convolutional layers, i.e., the convolutional activations
could act as a detector for the common object in the image co-localization
problem. We propose a simple yet effective method, termed Deep Descriptor
Transforming (DDT), for evaluating the correlations of descriptors and then
obtaining the category-consistent regions, which can accurately locate the
common object in a set of unlabeled images, i.e., unsupervised object
discovery. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed DDT
method. On benchmark image co-localization datasets, DDT consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Moreover, DDT
also demonstrates good generalization ability for unseen categories and
robustness for dealing with noisy data. Beyond those, DDT can be also employed
for harvesting web images into valid external data sources for improving
performance of both image recognition and object detection.

 <dc:title>Self-stabilizing Localization of the Middle Point of a Line Segment by

 <dc:description>  This paper poses a question about a simple localization problem, which is
arisen from self-stabilizing location problems by oblivious mobile autonomous
robots with limited visibility. The question is if an oblivious mobile robot on
a line-segment can localize the middle point of the line-segment in finite
steps observing the direction (i.e., Left or Right) and distance to the nearest
end point. This problem is also akin to (a continuous version of) binary
search, and could be closely related to computable real functions. Contrary to
appearances, it is far from trivial if this simple problem is solvable or not,
and unsettled yet. This paper is concerned with three variants of the original
problem, minimally relaxing, and presents self-stabilizing algorithms for them.
We also show an easy impossibility theorem for bilaterally symmetric
algorithms.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Feeding: Achieving Fast and Accurate Detections by Adaptively
  Combining Object Detectors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Object detection aims at high speed and accuracy simultaneously. However,
fast models are usually less accurate, while accurate models cannot satisfy our
need for speed. A fast model can be 10 times faster but 50\% less accurate than
an accurate model. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Feeding (AF) to combine a
fast (but less accurate) detector and an accurate (but slow) detector, by
adaptively determining whether an image is easy or hard and choosing an
appropriate detector for it. In practice, we build a cascade of detectors,
including the AF classifier which make the easy vs. hard decision and the two
detectors. The AF classifier can be tuned to obtain different tradeoff between
speed and accuracy, which has negligible training time and requires no
additional training data. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO and
Caltech Pedestrian datasets confirm that AF has the ability to achieve
comparable speed as the fast detector and comparable accuracy as the accurate
one at the same time. As an example, by combining the fast SSD300 with the
accurate SSD500 detector, AF leads to 50\% speedup over SSD500 with the same
precision on the VOC2007 test set.

 <dc:description>  Performing efficient resource provisioning is a fundamental aspect for any
resource provider. Local Resource Management Systems (LRMS) have been used in
data centers for decades in order to obtain the best usage of the resources,
providing their fair usage and partitioning for the users. In contrast, current
cloud schedulers are normally based on the immediate allocation of resources on
a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that a request will fail if there are
no resources (e.g. OpenStack) or it will be trivially queued ordered by entry
time (e.g. OpenNebula). Moreover, these scheduling strategies are based on a
static partitioning of the resources, meaning that existing quotas cannot be
exceeded, even if there are idle resources allocated to other projects. This is
a consequence of the fact that cloud instances are not associated with a
maximum execution time and leads to a situation where the resources are
under-utilized. These facts have been identified by the INDIGO-DataCloud
project as being too simplistic for accommodating scientific workloads in an
efficient way, leading to an underutilization of the resources, a non desirable
situation in scientific data centers. In this work, we will present the work
done in the scheduling area during the first year of the INDIGO project and the
foreseen evolutions.

 <dc:title>An extension of SPARQL for expressing qualitative preferences</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present SPREFQL, an extension of the SPARQL language that
allows appending a PREFER clause that expresses &quot;soft&quot; preferences over the
query results obtained by the main body of the query. The extension does not
add expressivity and any SPREFQL query can be transformed to an equivalent
standard SPARQL query. However, clearly separating preferences from the &quot;hard&quot;
patterns and filters in the WHERE clause gives queries where the intention of
the client is more cleanly expressed, an advantage for both human readability
and machine optimization. In the paper we formally define the syntax and the
semantics of the extension and we also provide empirical evidence that
optimizations specific to SPREFQL improve run-time efficiency by comparison to
the usually applied optimizations on the equivalent standard SPARQL query.

 <dc:description>  Predicting click and conversion probabilities when bidding on ad exchanges is
at the core of the programmatic advertising industry. Two separated lines of
previous works respectively address i) the prediction of user conversion
probability and ii) the attribution of these conversions to advertising events
(such as clicks) after the fact. We argue that attribution modeling improves
the efficiency of the bidding policy in the context of performance advertising.
Firstly we explain the inefficiency of the standard bidding policy with respect
to attribution. Secondly we learn and utilize an attribution model in the
bidder itself and show how it modifies the average bid after a click. Finally
we produce evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method on both offline
and online experiments with data spanning several weeks of real traffic from
Criteo, a leader in performance advertising.

 <dc:description>  An important goal in both transfer learning and causal inference is to make
accurate predictions when the distribution of the test set and the training
set(s) differ. Such a distribution shift may happen as a result of an external
intervention on the data generating process, causing certain aspects of the
distribution to change, and others to remain invariant. We consider a class of
causal transfer learning problems, where multiple training sets are given that
correspond to different external interventions, and the task is to predict the
distribution of a target variable given measurements of other variables for a
new (yet unseen) intervention on the system. We propose a method for solving
these problems that exploits causal reasoning but does neither rely on prior
knowledge of the causal graph, nor on the the type of interventions and their
targets. We evaluate the method on simulated and real world data and find that
it outperforms a standard prediction method that ignores the distribution
shift.

 <dc:description>  Recent development in fully convolutional neural network enables efficient
end-to-end learning of semantic segmentation. Traditionally, the convolutional
classifiers are taught to learn the representative semantic features of labeled
semantic objects. In this work, we propose a reverse attention network (RAN)
architecture that trains the network to capture the opposite concept (i.e.,
what are not associated with a target class) as well. The RAN is a three-branch
network that performs the direct, reverse and reverse-attention learning
processes simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted to show the
effectiveness of the RAN in semantic segmentation. Being built upon the
DeepLabv2-LargeFOV, the RAN achieves the state-of-the-art mIoU score (48.1%)
for the challenging PASCAL-Context dataset. Significant performance
improvements are also observed for the PASCAL-VOC, Person-Part, NYUDv2 and
ADE20K datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for large displacement optical flow in which local
matching costs are learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a
smoothness prior is imposed by a conditional random field (CRF). We tackle the
computation- and memory-intensive operations on the 4D cost volume by a
min-projection which reduces memory complexity from quadratic to linear and
binary descriptors for efficient matching. This enables evaluation of the cost
on the fly and allows to perform learning and CRF inference on high resolution
images without ever storing the 4D cost volume. To address the problem of
learning binary descriptors we propose a new hybrid learning scheme. In
contrast to current state of the art approaches for learning binary CNNs we can
compute the exact non-zero gradient within our model. We compare several
methods for training binary descriptors and show results on public available
benchmarks.

 <dc:title>A Novel Space-Time Representation on the Positive Semidefinite Con for

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of facial expression recognition using a
novel space-time geometric representation. We describe the temporal evolution
of facial landmarks as parametrized trajectories on the Riemannian manifold of
positive semidefinite matrices of fixed-rank. Our representation has the
advantage to bring naturally a second desirable quantity when comparing shapes
-- the spatial covariance -- in addition to the conventional affine-shape
representation. We derive then geometric and computational tools for
rate-invariant analysis and adaptive re-sampling of trajectories, grounding on
the Riemannian geometry of the manifold. Specifically, our approach involves
three steps: 1) facial landmarks are first mapped into the Riemannian manifold
of positive semidefinite matrices of rank 2, to build time-parameterized
trajectories; 2) a temporal alignment is performed on the trajectories,
providing a geometry-aware (dis-)similarity measure between them; 3) finally,
pairwise proximity function SVM (ppfSVM) is used to classify them,
incorporating the latter (dis-)similarity measure into the kernel function. We
show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on four publicly available
benchmarks (CK+, MMI, Oulu-CASIA, and AFEW). The results of the proposed
approach are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods when
involving only facial landmarks.

 <dc:title>A Linear Algorithm for Computing $\gamma_{[1,2]}$-set in Generalized
  Series-Parallel Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a set $S \subseteq V$ is a $[1,2]$-set if it is a
dominating set for $G$ and each vertex $v \in V \setminus S$ is dominated by at
most two vertices of $S$, i.e. $1 \leq \vert N(v) \cap S \vert \leq 2$.
Moreover a set $S \subseteq V$ is a total $[1,2]$-set if for each vertex of
$V$, it is the case that $1 \leq \vert N(v) \cap S \vert \leq 2$. The
$[1,2]$-domination number of $G$, denoted $\gamma_{[1,2]}(G)$,is the minimum
number of vertices in a $[1,2]$-set. Every $[1,2]$-set with cardinality of
$\gamma_{[1,2]}(G)$ is called a $\gamma_{[1,2]}$-set. Total $[1,2]$-domination
number and $\gamma_{t[1,2]}$-sets of $G$ are defined in a similar way. This
paper presents a linear time algorithm to find a $\gamma_{[1,2]}$-set and a
$\gamma_{t[1,2]}$-set in generalized series-parallel graphs.

 <dc:title>Consistent Tomography under Partial Observations over Adaptive Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This work studies the problem of inferring whether an agent is directly
influenced by another agent over an adaptive diffusion network. Agent i
influences agent j if they are connected (according to the network topology),
and if agent j uses the data from agent i to update its online statistic. The
solution of this inference task is challenging for two main reasons. First,
only the output of the diffusion learning algorithm is available to the
external observer that must perform the inference based on these indirect
measurements. Second, only output measurements from a fraction of the network
agents is available, with the total number of agents itself being also unknown.
The main focus of this article is ascertaining under these demanding conditions
whether consistent tomography is possible, namely, whether it is possible to
reconstruct the interaction profile of the observable portion of the network,
with negligible error as the network size increases. We establish a critical
achievability result, namely, that for symmetric combination policies and for
any given fraction of observable agents, the interacting and non-interacting
agent pairs split into two separate clusters as the network size increases.
This remarkable property then enables the application of clustering algorithms
to identify the interacting agents influencing the observations. We provide a
set of numerical experiments that verify the results for finite network sizes
and time horizons. The numerical experiments show that the results hold for
asymmetric combination policies as well, which is particularly relevant in the
context of causation.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian Filtering for plan and activity recognition is challenging for
scenarios that contain many observation equivalent entities (i.e. entities that
produce the same observations). This is due to the combinatorial explosion in
the number of hypotheses that need to be tracked. However, this class of
problems exhibits a certain symmetry that can be exploited for state space
representation and inference. We analyze current state of the art methods and
find that none of them completely fits the requirements arising in this problem
class. We sketch a novel inference algorithm that provides a solution by
incorporating concepts from Lifted Inference algorithms, Probabilistic Multiset
Rewriting Systems, and Computational State Space Models. Two experiments
confirm that this novel algorithm has the potential to perform efficient
probabilistic inference on this problem class.

 <dc:title>Revisiting Selectional Preferences for Coreference Resolution</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Selectional preferences have long been claimed to be essential for
coreference resolution. However, they are mainly modeled only implicitly by
current coreference resolvers. We propose a dependency-based embedding model of
selectional preferences which allows fine-grained compatibility judgments with
high coverage. We show that the incorporation of our model improves coreference
resolution performance on the CoNLL dataset, matching the state-of-the-art
results of a more complex system. However, it comes with a cost that makes it
debatable how worthwhile such improvements are.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the convergence properties of continuous-time fictitious
play in potential games. It is shown that in almost every potential game and
for almost every initial condition, fictitious play converges to a
pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.
  We focus our study on the class of regular potential games; i.e., the set of
potential games in which all Nash equilibria are regular. As byproducts of the
proof of our main result we show that (i) a regular mixed-strategy equilibrium
of a potential game can only be reached by a fictitious play process from a set
of initial conditions with Lebesgue measure zero, and (ii) in regular potential
games, solutions of fictitious play are unique for almost all initial
conditions.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental problem with the Nash equilibrium concept is the existence of
certain &quot;structurally deficient&quot; equilibria that (i) lack fundamental
robustness properties, and (ii) are difficult to analyze. The notion of a
&quot;regular&quot; Nash equilibrium was introduced by Harsanyi. Such equilibria are
highly robust and relatively simple to analyze. A game is said to be regular if
all equilibria in the game are regular. In this paper it is shown that almost
all potential games are regular. That is, except for a closed subset of
potential games with Lebesgue measure zero, all potential games are regular. As
an immediate consequence of this, the paper also proves an oddness result for
potential games: In almost all potential games, the number of Nash equilibrium
strategies is finite and odd.

 <dc:description>  Due to their simplicity and excellent performance, parallel asynchronous
variants of stochastic gradient descent have become popular methods to solve a
wide range of large-scale optimization problems on multi-core architectures.
Yet, despite their practical success, support for nonsmooth objectives is still
lacking, making them unsuitable for many problems of interest in machine
learning, such as the Lasso, group Lasso or empirical risk minimization with
convex constraints.
  In this work, we propose and analyze ProxASAGA, a fully asynchronous sparse
method inspired by SAGA, a variance reduced incremental gradient algorithm. The
proposed method is easy to implement and significantly outperforms the state of
the art on several nonsmooth, large-scale problems. We prove that our method
achieves a theoretical linear speedup with respect to the sequential version
under assumptions on the sparsity of gradients and block-separability of the
proximal term. Empirical benchmarks on a multi-core architecture illustrate
practical speedups of up to 12x on a 20-core machine.

 <dc:description>  Last several years, GPUs are used to accelerate computations in many computer
science domains. We focused on GPU accelerated Support Vector Machines (SVM)
training with non-linear kernel functions. We had searched for all available
GPU accelerated C++ open-source implementations and created an open-source C++
benchmark project. We modifed all the implementations to run on actual hardware
and software and in both Windows and Linux operating systems. The benchmark
project offers making a fair and direct comparison of the individual
implementations under the same conditions, datasets, and hardware. In addition,
we selected the most popular datasets in the community and tested them.
Finally, based on the evaluation, we recommended the best-performing
implementations for dense and sparse datasets.

 <dc:title>An Explicit Construction of Optimal Dominating Sets in Grid</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A dominating set in a graph $G$ is a subset of vertices $D$ such that every
vertex in $V\setminus D$ is a neighbor of some vertex of $D$. The domination
number of $G$ is the minimum size of a dominating set of $G$ and it is denoted
by $\gamma(G)$. Also, a subset $D$ of a graph $G$ is a $[ 1, 2 ] $-set if, each
vertex $v \in V \setminus D$ is adjacent to either one or two vertices in $D$
and the minimum cardinality of $[ 1, 2 ] $-dominating set of $G$, is denoted by
$\gamma_{[1,2]}(G)$.
  Chang's conjecture say that for every $16 \leq n \leq m, \gamma(G_{m,n})=
\left \lfloor\frac{(n+2)(m+2)}{5}\right \rfloor-4$ and this conjecture has been
proven by Goncalves et al. This paper presents an explicit constructing method
to find an optimal dominating set for grid graph $G_{n,m}$ where $m,n\geq 16$
in $O(\textit{size of answer})$. In addition, we will show that
$\gamma(G_{n,m})=\gamma_{[1,2]}(G_{n,m})$ holds in response to an open question
posed by Chellali et al.

 <dc:description>  We propose the Learned Primal-Dual algorithm for tomographic reconstruction.
The algorithm accounts for a (possibly non-linear) forward operator in a deep
neural network by unrolling a proximal primal-dual optimization method, but
where the proximal operators have been replaced with convolutional neural
networks. The algorithm is trained end-to-end, working directly from raw
measured data and it does not depend on any initial reconstruction such as
filtered back-projection (FBP).
  We compare performance of the proposed method on low dose computed tomography
reconstruction against FBP, total variation (TV), and deep learning based
post-processing of FBP. For the Shepp-Logan phantom we obtain &gt;6 dB PSNR
improvement against all compared methods. For human phantoms the corresponding
improvement is 6.6 dB over TV and 2.2 dB over learned post-processing along
with a substantial improvement in the structural similarity index. Finally, our
algorithm involves only ten forward-back-projection computations, making the
method feasible for time critical clinical applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation algorithm design for
cooperative cognitive relaying multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access
(MC-NOMA) systems. In particular, the secondary base station serves multiple
secondary users and simultaneously acts as a relay assisting the information
transmission in the primary network. The resource allocation aims to maximize
the weighted system throughput by jointly optimizing the power and subcarrier
allocation for both the primary and the secondary networks while satisfying the
quality-of-service requirements of the primary users. The algorithm design is
formulated as a mixed combinatorial non-convex optimization problem. We apply
monotonic optimization theory to solve the problem leading to an optimal
resource allocation policy. Besides, we develop a low-complexity scheme to find
a suboptimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that the performance of
the proposed suboptimal algorithm closely approaches that of the optimal one.
Besides, the combination of MC-NOMA and cognitive relaying improves the system
throughput considerably compared to conventional multicarrier cognitive
relaying systems.

 <dc:description>  Visual recognition requires rich representations that span levels from low to
high, scales from small to large, and resolutions from fine to coarse. Even
with the depth of features in a convolutional network, a layer in isolation is
not enough: compounding and aggregating these representations improves
inference of what and where. Architectural efforts are exploring many
dimensions for network backbones, designing deeper or wider architectures, but
how to best aggregate layers and blocks across a network deserves further
attention. Although skip connections have been incorporated to combine layers,
these connections have been &quot;shallow&quot; themselves, and only fuse by simple,
one-step operations. We augment standard architectures with deeper aggregation
to better fuse information across layers. Our deep layer aggregation structures
iteratively and hierarchically merge the feature hierarchy to make networks
with better accuracy and fewer parameters. Experiments across architectures and
tasks show that deep layer aggregation improves recognition and resolution
compared to existing branching and merging schemes.

 <dc:title>A Nonlinear Kernel Support Matrix Machine for Matrix Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many problems of supervised tensor learning (STL), real world data such as
face images or MRI scans are naturally represented as matrices, which are also
called as second order tensors. Most existing classifiers based on tensor
representation, such as support tensor machine (STM) need to solve iteratively
which occupy much time and may suffer from local minima. In this paper, we
present a kernel support matrix machine (KSMM) to perform supervised learning
when data are represented as matrices. KSMM is a general framework for the
construction of matrix-based hyperplane to exploit structural information. We
analyze a unifying optimization problem for which we propose an asymptotically
convergent algorithm. Theoretical analysis for the generalization bounds is
derived based on Rademacher complexity with respect to a probability
distribution. We demonstrate the merits of the proposed method by exhaustive
experiments on both simulation study and a number of real-word datasets from a
variety of application domains.

 <dc:description>  We propose a minority route choice game to investigate the effect of the
network structure on traffic network performance under the assumption of
drivers' bounded rationality. We investigate ring-and-hub topologies to capture
the nature of traffic networks in cities, and employ a minority game-based
inductive learning process to model the characteristic behavior under the route
choice scenario. Through numerical experiments, we find that topological
changes in traffic networks induce a phase transition from an uncongested phase
to a congested phase. Understanding this phase transition is helpful in
planning new traffic networks.

 <dc:title>Parameterized Approximation Algorithms for Directed Steiner Network
  Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  (See paper for full abstract)
  Given an edge-weighted directed graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set of $k$ terminal
pairs $\{(s_i, t_i)\}_{i=1}^{k}$, the objective of the Directed Steiner Network
(DSN) problem is to compute the cheapest subgraph $N$ of $G$ such that there is
an $s_i\to t_i$ path in $N$ for each $i\in [k]$. This problem is notoriously
hard: there is no polytime $O(2^{\log^{1-\varepsilon}n})$-approximation [Dodis
&amp; Khanna, STOC '99], and it is W[1]-hard [Guo et al., SIDMA '11] for the
well-studied parameter $k$. To circumvent these hardness results we consider
parameterized approximations. Our first result is that under Gap-ETH there is
no $k^{o(1)}$-approximation for DSN in $f(k)\cdot n^{O(1)}$ time, for any
function $f$. Can we obtain faster algorithms or better approximation ratios
for other special cases of DSN when parameterizing by $k$?
  A special case of DSN is the Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph (SCSS)
problem, where the goal is to pairwise connect all $k$ given terminals. We show
that under Gap-ETH there is no $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation in $f(k)\cdot
n^{O(1)}$ time, for any function $f$. This implies a tight parameterized
approximation factor. Next we consider bidirected input graphs, i.e., for every
edge $uv$ the reverse edge $vu$ exists and has the same weight. We call the
respective problems bi-DSN and bi-SCSS and show that bi-SCSS is FPT, while
bi-DSN is W[1]-hard. The former is the first special case where SCSS remains
NP-hard but turns out to be FPT. A standard way to obtain special cases is to
restrict the input graphs. We generalize this concept: for a class
$\mathcal{K}$ of graphs, we define the bi-DSN$_\mathcal{K}$ problem as asking
to find an optimum solution $N$ such that $N\in\mathcal{K}$. We give a
parameterized approximation scheme for minor-closed $\mathcal{K}$, and prove
that no efficient parameterized approximation scheme exists.

 <dc:title>The Euler and Chinese Postman Problems on 2-Arc-Colored Digraphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The famous Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is polynomial time solvable on both
undirected and directed graphs. Gutin et al. [Discrete Applied Math 217 (2016)]
generalized these results by proving that CPP on $c$-edge-colored graphs is
polynomial time solvable for every $c\geq 2$. In CPP on weighted edge-colored
graphs $G$, we wish to find a minimum weight properly colored closed walk
containing all edges of $G$ (a walk is properly colored if every two
consecutive edges are of different color, including the last and first edges in
a closed walk). In this paper, we consider CPP on arc-colored digraphs (for
properly colored closed directed walks), and provide a polynomial-time
algorithm for the problem on weighted 2-arc-colored digraphs. This is a
somewhat surprising result since it is NP-complete to decide whether a
2-arc-colored digraph has a properly colored directed cycle [Gutin et al.,
Discrete Math 191 (1998)]. To obtain the polynomial-time algorithm, we
characterize 2-arc-colored digraphs containing properly colored Euler trails.

 <dc:description>  With the ongoing digitalisation of our everyday tasks, more and more
eGovernment services make it possible for citizens to take care of their
administrative obligations online. This type of services requires a certain
assurance level for user authentication. To meet these requirements, a digital
identity issued to the citizen is essential. Nowadays, due to the widespread
use of smartphones, mobile user authentication is often favoured. This
naturally supports two-factor authentication schemes (2FA). We use the term
mobile derived identity to stress two aspects: a) the identity is enabled for
mobile usage and b) the identity is somehow derived from a physical or digital
proof of identity. This work reviews 21 systems that support mobile derived
identities. One subset of the considered systems is already in place (public or
private sector in Europe), another subset is subject to research. Our goal is
to identify prevalent design and implementation aspects for these systems in
order to gain a better understanding on best practises and common views on
mobile derived identities. We found, that research prefers storing identity
data on the mobile device itself whereas real world systems usually rely on
cloud storage. 2FA is common in both worlds, however biometrics as second
factor is the exception.

 <dc:title>Actor Database Systems: A Manifesto</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Interactive data-intensive applications are becoming ever more pervasive in
domains such as finance, web applications, mobile computing, and Internet of
Things. Typically, these applications are architected to utilize a data tier
for persistence. At one extreme, the data tier is a simple key-value storage
service, and the application code is concentrated in the middle tier. While
this design provides for programmability at the middle tier, it forces
applications to forego classic data management functionality, such as
declarative querying and transactions. At the other extreme, the application
code can be colocated in the data tier itself using stored procedures in a
database system. While providing rich data management functionality natively,
the resulting lack of modularity and state encapsulation creates software
engineering challenges, such as difficulty in isolation of bugs and failures or
complexity in managing source code dependencies. In addition, this monolithic
architectural style makes it harder to scale the application with growing
request volumes and data sizes. In this paper, we advocate a new database
system paradigm bringing to developers the benefits of these two extremes,
while avoiding their pitfalls. To provide modularity and reasoning on
scalability, we argue that data tiers should leverage the actor abstraction; at
the same time, these actor-based data tiers should offer database system
features to reduce bugs and programming effort involved in state manipulation.
Towards this aim, we present a vision for actor database systems. We analyze
current trends justifying the emergence of this abstraction and discuss a set
of features for these new systems. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed
feature set, we present a detailed case study inspired by a smart supermarket
application with self-checkout.

suggest that there is a link between beautiful music and the Dyson distribution
which seems to be the result of a deeper optimisation process between

 <dc:title>Language Transfer of Audio Word2Vec: Learning Audio Segment

 <dc:description>  Audio Word2Vec offers vector representations of fixed dimensionality for
variable-length audio segments using Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA).
These vector representations are shown to describe the sequential phonetic
structures of the audio segments to a good degree, with real world applications
such as query-by-example Spoken Term Detection (STD). This paper examines the
capability of language transfer of Audio Word2Vec. We train SA from one
language (source language) and use it to extract the vector representation of
the audio segments of another language (target language). We found that SA can
still catch phonetic structure from the audio segments of the target language
if the source and target languages are similar. In query-by-example STD, we
obtain the vector representations from the SA learned from a large amount of
source language data, and found them surpass the representations from naive
encoder and SA directly learned from a small amount of target language data.
The result shows that it is possible to learn Audio Word2Vec model from
high-resource languages and use it on low-resource languages. This further
expands the usability of Audio Word2Vec.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the dynamics of social interactions is crucial to comprehend
human behavior. The emergence of online social media has enabled access to data
regarding people relationships at a large scale. Twitter, specifically, is an
information oriented network, with users sharing and consuming information. In
this work, we study whether users tend to be in contact with people interested
in similar topics, i.e., topical homophily. To do so, we propose an approach
based on the use of hashtags to extract information topics from Twitter
messages and model users' interests. Our results show that, on average, users
are connected with other users similar to them and stronger relationships are
due to a higher topical similarity. Furthermore, we show that topical homophily
provides interesting information that can eventually allow inferring users'
connectivity. Our work, besides providing a way to assess the topical
similarity of users, quantifies topical homophily among individuals,
contributing to a better understanding of how complex social systems are
structured.

 <dc:description>  With the irruption of ICTs and the crisis of political representation, many
online platforms have been developed with the aim of improving participatory
democratic processes. However, regarding platforms for online petitioning,
previous research has not found examples of how to effectively introduce
discussions, a crucial feature to promote deliberation. In this study we focus
on the case of Decidim Barcelona, the online participatory-democracy platform
launched by the City Council of Barcelona in which proposals can be discussed
with an interface that combines threaded discussions and comment alignment with
the proposal. This innovative approach allows to examine whether neutral,
positive or negative comments are more likely to generate discussion cascades.
The results reveal that, with this interface, comments marked as negatively
aligned with the proposal were more likely to engage users in online
discussions and, therefore, helped to promote deliberative decision making.

 <dc:description>  Although great progresses have been made in automatic speech recognition
(ASR), significant performance degradation is still observed when recognizing
multi-talker mixed speech. In this paper, we propose and evaluate several
architectures to address this problem under the assumption that only a single
channel of mixed signal is available. Our technique extends permutation
invariant training (PIT) by introducing the front-end feature separation module
with the minimum mean square error (MSE) criterion and the back-end recognition
module with the minimum cross entropy (CE) criterion. More specifically, during
training we compute the average MSE or CE over the whole utterance for each
possible utterance-level output-target assignment, pick the one with the
minimum MSE or CE, and optimize for that assignment. This strategy elegantly
solves the label permutation problem observed in the deep learning based
multi-talker mixed speech separation and recognition systems. The proposed
architectures are evaluated and compared on an artificially mixed AMI dataset
with both two- and three-talker mixed speech. The experimental results indicate
that our proposed architectures can cut the word error rate (WER) by 45.0% and
25.0% relatively against the state-of-the-art single-talker speech recognition
system across all speakers when their energies are comparable, for two- and
three-talker mixed speech, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first
work on the multi-talker mixed speech recognition on the challenging
speaker-independent spontaneous large vocabulary continuous speech task.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies Bayesian ranking and selection (R&amp;S) problems with
correlated prior beliefs and continuous domains, i.e. Bayesian optimization
(BO). Knowledge gradient methods [Frazier et al., 2008, 2009] have been widely
studied for discrete R&amp;S problems, which sample the one-step Bayes-optimal
point. When used over continuous domains, previous work on the knowledge
gradient [Scott et al., 2011, Wu and Frazier, 2016, Wu et al., 2017] often rely
on a discretized finite approximation. However, the discretization introduces
error and scales poorly as the dimension of domain grows. In this paper, we
develop a fast discretization-free knowledge gradient method for Bayesian
optimization. Our method is not restricted to the fully sequential setting, but
useful in all settings where knowledge gradient can be used over continuous
domains. We show how our method can be generalized to handle (i) batch of
points suggestion (parallel knowledge gradient); (ii) the setting where
derivative information is available in the optimization process
(derivative-enabled knowledge gradient). In numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that the discretization-free knowledge gradient method finds global
optima significantly faster than previous Bayesian optimization algorithms on
both synthetic test functions and real-world applications, especially when
function evaluations are noisy; and derivative-enabled knowledge gradient can
further improve the performances, even outperforming the gradient-based
optimizer such as BFGS when derivative information is available.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an image dehazing model built with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), called All-in-One Dehazing Network (AOD-Net). It is designed
based on a re-formulated atmospheric scattering model. Instead of estimating
the transmission matrix and the atmospheric light separately as most previous
models did, AOD-Net directly generates the clean image through a light-weight
CNN. Such a novel end-to-end design makes it easy to embed AOD-Net into other
deep models, e.g., Faster R-CNN, for improving high-level task performance on
hazy images. Experimental results on both synthesized and natural hazy image
datasets demonstrate our superior performance than the state-of-the-art in
terms of PSNR, SSIM and the subjective visual quality. Furthermore, when
concatenating AOD-Net with Faster R-CNN and training the joint pipeline from
end to end, we witness a large improvement of the object detection performance
on hazy images.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to semi-supervised video object segmentation, in the
context of the DAVIS 2017 challenge. Our approach combines category-based
object detection, category-independent object appearance segmentation and
temporal object tracking. We are motivated by the fact that the objects
semantic category tends not to change throughout the video while its appearance
and location can vary considerably. In order to capture the specific object
appearance independent of its category, for each video we train a fully
convolutional network using augmentations of the given annotated frame. We
refine the appearance segmentation mask with the bounding boxes provided either
by a semantic object detection network, when applicable, or by a previous frame
prediction. By introducing a temporal continuity constraint on the detected
boxes, we are able to improve the object segmentation mask of the appearance
network and achieve competitive results on the DAVIS datasets.

 <dc:description>  Publishing reproducible analyses is a long-standing and widespread challenge
for the scientific community, funding bodies and publishers. Although a
definitive solution is still elusive, the problem is recognized to affect all
disciplines and lead to a critical system inefficiency. Here, we propose a
blockchain-based approach to enhance scientific reproducibility, with a focus
on life science studies and precision medicine. While the interest of encoding
permanently into an immutable ledger all the study key information-including
endpoints, data and metadata, protocols, analytical methods and all
findings-has been already highlighted, here we apply the blockchain approach to
solve the issue of rewarding time and expertise of scientists that commit to
verify reproducibility. Our mechanism builds a trustless ecosystem of
researchers, funding bodies and publishers cooperating to guarantee digital and
permanent access to information and reproducible results. As a natural
byproduct, a procedure to quantify scientists' and institutions' reputation for
ranking purposes is obtained.

 <dc:description>  Distributional semantics models are known to struggle with small data. It is
generally accepted that in order to learn 'a good vector' for a word, a model
must have sufficient examples of its usage. This contradicts the fact that
humans can guess the meaning of a word from a few occurrences only. In this
paper, we show that a neural language model such as Word2Vec only necessitates
minor modifications to its standard architecture to learn new terms from tiny
data, using background knowledge from a previously learnt semantic space. We
test our model on word definitions and on a nonce task involving 2-6 sentences'
worth of context, showing a large increase in performance over state-of-the-art
models on the definitional task.

 <dc:description>  Video surveillance always had a negative connotation, among others because of
the loss of privacy and because it may not automatically increase public
safety. If it was able to detect atypical (i.e. dangerous) situations in real
time, autonomously and anonymously, this could change. A prerequisite for this
is a reliable automatic detection of possibly dangerous situations from video
data. This is done classically by object extraction and tracking. From the
derived trajectories, we then want to determine dangerous situations by
detecting atypical trajectories. However, due to ethical considerations it is
better to develop such a system on data without people being threatened or even
harmed, plus with having them know that there is such a tracking system
installed. Another important point is that these situations do not occur very
often in real, public CCTV areas and may be captured properly even less. In the
artistic project leave a trace the tracked objects, people in an atrium of a
institutional building, become actor and thus part of the installation.
Visualisation in real-time allows interaction by these actors, which in turn
creates many atypical interaction situations on which we can develop our
situation detection. The data set has evolved over three years and hence, is
huge. In this article we describe the tracking system and several approaches
for the detection of atypical trajectories.

 <dc:description>  Abstract State Machines (ASMs) have been successfully applied for modeling
critical and complex systems in a wide range of application domains. However,
unlike other well-known formalisms, e.g. Petri nets, ASMs lack inherent,
domain-independent characterisations of computationally important properties.
Here, we provide an ASM-based characterisation of the starvation-free property.
The classic, informal notion of starvation, usually provided in literature, is
analysed and expressed as a necessary condition in terms of ASMs. Thus, we
enrich the ASM framework with the notion of vulnerable rule as a practical tool
for analysing starvation issues in an operational fashion

 <dc:description>  Task selection in micro-task markets can be supported by recommender systems
to help individuals to find appropriate tasks. Previous work showed that for
the selection process of a micro-task the semantic aspects, such as the
required action and the comprehensibility, are rated more important than
factual aspects, such as the payment or the required completion time. This work
gives a foundation to create such similarity measures. Therefore, we show that
an automatic classification based on task descriptions is possible.
Additionally, we propose similarity measures to cluster micro-tasks according
to semantic aspects.

 <dc:description>  We present a model of a configurable underwater drone, whose parts are
optimised for 3D printing processes. We show how - through the use of printable
adapters - several thrusters and ballast configurations can be implemented,
allowing different maneuvering possibilities. After introducing the model and
illustrating a set of possible configurations, we present a functional
prototype based on open source hardware and software solutions. The prototype
has been successfully tested in several dives in rivers and lakes around
Berlin. The reliability of the printed models has been tested only in
relatively shallow waters. However, we strongly believe that their availability
as freely downloadable models will motivate the general public to build and to
test underwater drones, thus speeding up the development of innovative
solutions and applications. The models and their documentation will be
available for download at the following link:

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a multipoint-to-point system consisting K users and a central
node with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique over free space
optical (FSO) channel is characterized for two cases. In the case of guaranteed
user's quality of service (QoS), the outage probability is derived. Another
case is that user's QoS is determined by their own channel conditions. The
developed analytical results of ergodic sum data rate show that NOMA
outperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA). Besides, the power control scheme
is proposed, and results show that the power control scheme has great influence
to the user's QoS. Monto Carlo simulation has been done, and it matches quite
well with the theoretical analysis.

text to speech in voices that are sampled in the wild. Unlike other systems,
our solution is able to deal with unconstrained voice samples and without
requiring aligned phonemes or linguistic features. The network architecture is
simpler than those in the existing literature and is based on a novel shifting
buffer working memory. The same buffer is used for estimating the attention,
computing the output audio, and for updating the buffer itself. The input
sentence is encoded using a context-free lookup table that contains one entry
per character or phoneme. The speakers are similarly represented by a short
vector that can also be fitted to new identities, even with only a few samples.
Variability in the generated speech is achieved by priming the buffer prior to
generating the audio. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate
convincing capabilities, making TTS accessible to a wider range of
applications. In order to promote reproducibility, we release our source code
and models.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in neural word embedding provide significant benefit to
various information retrieval tasks. However as shown by recent studies,
adapting the embedding models for the needs of IR tasks can bring considerable
further improvements. The embedding models in general define the term
relatedness by exploiting the terms' co-occurrences in short-window contexts.
An alternative (and well-studied) approach in IR for related terms to a query
is using local information i.e. a set of top-retrieved documents. In view of
these two methods of term relatedness, in this work, we report our study on
incorporating the local information of the query in the word embeddings. One
main challenge in this direction is that the dense vectors of word embeddings
and their estimation of term-to-term relatedness remain difficult to interpret
and hard to analyze. As an alternative, explicit word representations propose
vectors whose dimensions are easily interpretable, and recent methods show
competitive performance to the dense vectors. We introduce a neural-based
explicit representation, rooted in the conceptual ideas of the word2vec
Skip-Gram model. The method provides interpretable explicit vectors while
keeping the effectiveness of the Skip-Gram model. The evaluation of various
explicit representations on word association collections shows that the newly
proposed method out- performs the state-of-the-art explicit representations
when tasked with ranking highly similar terms. Based on the introduced ex-
plicit representation, we discuss our approaches on integrating local documents
in globally-trained embedding models and discuss the preliminary results.

 <dc:description>  Humanity faces numerous problems of common-pool resource appropriation. This
class of multi-agent social dilemma includes the problems of ensuring
sustainable use of fresh water, common fisheries, grazing pastures, and
irrigation systems. Abstract models of common-pool resource appropriation based
on non-cooperative game theory predict that self-interested agents will
generally fail to find socially positive equilibria---a phenomenon called the
tragedy of the commons. However, in reality, human societies are sometimes able
to discover and implement stable cooperative solutions. Decades of behavioral
game theory research have sought to uncover aspects of human behavior that make
this possible. Most of that work was based on laboratory experiments where
participants only make a single choice: how much to appropriate. Recognizing
the importance of spatial and temporal resource dynamics, a recent trend has
been toward experiments in more complex real-time video game-like environments.
However, standard methods of non-cooperative game theory can no longer be used
to generate predictions for this case. Here we show that deep reinforcement
learning can be used instead. To that end, we study the emergent behavior of
groups of independently learning agents in a partially observed Markov game
modeling common-pool resource appropriation. Our experiments highlight the
importance of trial-and-error learning in common-pool resource appropriation
and shed light on the relationship between exclusion, sustainability, and
inequality.

 <dc:description>  What are the similarities and differences between crowdsourcing and sharing
economy? What factors influence their use in developing countries? In light of
recent developments in the use of IT-mediated technologies, such as
crowdsourcing and the sharing economy, this manuscript examines their
similarities and differences, and the challenges regarding their effective use
in developing countries. We first examine each individually and highlight
different forms of each IT-mediated technology. Given that crowdsourcing and
sharing economy share aspects such as the use of IT, a reliance on crowds,
monetary exchange, and the use of reputation systems, we systematically compare
the similarities and differences of different types of crowdsourcing with the
sharing economy, thus addressing a gap in the current literature. Using this
knowledge, we examine the different challenges faced by developing countries
when using crowdsourcing and the sharing economy, and highlight the differences
in the applicability of these IT-mediated technologies when faced with specific
development issues.

 <dc:title>Improved bounds for testing Dyck languages</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of deciding membership in Dyck
languages, a fundamental family of context-free languages, comprised of
well-balanced strings of parentheses. In this problem we are given a string of
length $n$ in the alphabet of parentheses of $m$ types and must decide if it is
well-balanced. We consider this problem in the property testing setting, where
one would like to make the decision while querying as few characters of the
input as possible.
  Property testing of strings for Dyck language membership for $m=1$, with a
number of queries independent of the input size $n$, was provided in [Alon,
Krivelevich, Newman and Szegedy, SICOMP 2001]. Property testing of strings for
Dyck language membership for $m \ge 2$ was first investigated in [Parnas, Ron
and Rubinfeld, RSA 2003]. They showed an upper bound and a lower bound for
distinguishing strings belonging to the language from strings that are far (in
terms of the Hamming distance) from the language, which are respectively (up to
polylogarithmic factors) the $2/3$ power and the $1/11$ power of the input size
$n$.
  Here we improve the power of $n$ in both bounds. For the upper bound, we
introduce a recursion technique, that together with a refinement of the methods
in the original work provides a test for any power of $n$ larger than $2/5$.
For the lower bound, we introduce a new problem called Truestring Equivalence,
which is easily reducible to the $2$-type Dyck language property testing
problem. For this new problem, we show a lower bound of $n$ to the power of
$1/5$.

divergent approaches, e.g. centralized and decentralized, are surveyed and
analyzed. Decentralized planner - MAPP is described and applied to the task of
finding trajectories for dozens UAVs performing nap-of-the-earth flight in
urban environments. Results of the experimental studies provide an opportunity
to claim that MAPP is a highly efficient planner for solving considered types

 <dc:description>  When it is ethical and legal to use a sensitive attribute (such as gender or
race) in machine learning systems, the question remains how to do so. We show
that the naive application of machine learning algorithms using sensitive
features leads to an inherent tradeoff in accuracy between groups. We provide a
simple and efficient decoupling technique, that can be added on top of any
black-box machine learning algorithm, to learn different classifiers for
different groups. Transfer learning is used to mitigate the problem of having
too little data on any one group.
  The method can apply to a range of fairness criteria. In particular, we
require the application designer to specify as joint loss function that makes
explicit the trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Our reduction is shown to
efficiently find the minimum loss as long as the objective has a certain
natural monotonicity property which may be of independent interest in the study
of fairness in algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We present parametric trajectory optimization, a method for simultaneously
computing physical parameters, actuation requirements, and robot motions for
more efficient robot designs. In this scheme, robot dimensions, masses, and
other physical parameters are solved for concurrently with traditional motion
planning variables, including dynamically consistent robot states, actuation
inputs, and contact forces. Our method requires minimal user domain knowledge,
requiring only a coarse guess of the target robot configuration sequence and a
parameterized robot topology as input. We demonstrate our results on four
simulated robots, one of which we physically fabricated in order to demonstrate
physical consistency. We demonstrate that by optimizing robot body parameters
alongside robot trajectories, motion planning problems which would otherwise be
infeasible can be made feasible, and actuation requirements can be
significantly reduced.

 <dc:description>  We present a unified framework to analyze the global convergence of Langevin
dynamics based algorithms for nonconvex finite-sum optimization with $n$
component functions. At the core of our analysis is a new decomposition scheme
of the optimization error, under which we directly analyze the ergodicity of
the numerical approximations of Langevin dynamics and prove sharp convergence
rates. We establish the first global convergence guarantee of gradient Langevin
dynamics (GLD) with iteration complexity $O\big(1/\epsilon
\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$. In addition, we improve the convergence rate of
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to the &quot;almost minimizer&quot;, which
does not depend on the undesirable uniform spectral gap introduced in previous
studies. Furthermore, we for the first time prove the global convergence
guarantee of variance reduced stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (VR-SGLD)
with iteration complexity $O\big(m/(B\epsilon^3)\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$,
where $B$ is the mini-batch size and $m$ is the length of the inner loop. We
show that the gradient complexity of VR-SGLD is
$O\big(n^{1/2}/\epsilon^{3/2}\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$, which outperforms
$O\big(n/\epsilon\cdot\log(1/\epsilon)\big)$ gradient complexity of GLD, when
the number of component functions satisfies $n \geq 1/\epsilon$. Our
theoretical analysis shed some light on using Langevin dynamics based
algorithms for nonconvex optimization with provable guarantees.

 <dc:title>On the covering radius of small codes versus dual distance</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Tiet\&quot;{a}v\&quot;{a}inen's upper and lower bounds assert that for block-length-$n$
linear codes with dual distance $d$, the covering radius $R$ is at most
$\frac{n}{2}-(\frac{1}{2}-o(1))\sqrt{dn}$ and typically at least
$\frac{n}{2}-\Theta(\sqrt{dn\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$. The gap between those bounds
on $R -\frac{n}{2}$ is an $\Theta(\sqrt{\log{\frac{n}{d}}})$ factor related to
the gap between the worst covering radius given $d$ and the sphere-covering
bound. Our focus in this paper is on the case when $d = o(n)$, i.e., when the
code size is subexponential and the gap is $w(1)$. We show that up to a
constant, the gap can be eliminated by relaxing the covering requirement to
allow for missing $o(1)$ fraction of points. Namely,if the dual distance is at
least $d\geq 7$, where $d=o(n)$ is odd, then for sufficiently large $n$, almost
all points can be covered with radius
$R\leq\frac{n}{2}-\sqrt{\frac{1}{13}(d-5)n\log{\frac{n}{d-1}}}$. Compared to
random linear codes, our bound on $R-\frac{n}{2}$ is asymptotically tight up to
a factor less than $3$. We give applications to dual BCH codes. The proof
builds on the author's previous work on the weight distribution of cosets of
linear codes, which we simplify in this paper and extend from codes to
probability distributions on $\{0,1\}^n$, thus enabling the extension of the
above result to $(d-1)$-wise independent distributions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present two results on slime mold computations. The first
one treats a biologically-grounded model, originally proposed by biologists
analyzing the behavior of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. This primitive
organism was empirically shown by Nakagaki et al. to solve shortest path
problems in wet-lab experiments (Nature'00). We show that the proposed simple
mathematical model actually generalizes to a much wider class of problems,
namely undirected linear programs with a non-negative cost vector.
  For our second result, we consider the discretization of a
biologically-inspired model. This model is a directed variant of the
biologically-grounded one and was never claimed to describe the behavior of a
biological system. Straszak and Vishnoi showed that it can
$\epsilon$-approximately solve flow problems (SODA'16) and even general linear
programs with positive cost vector (ITCS'16) within a finite number of steps.
We give a refined convergence analysis that improves the dependence on
$\epsilon$ from polynomial to logarithmic and simultaneously allows to choose a
step size that is independent of $\epsilon$. Furthermore, we show that the
dynamics can be initialized with a more general set of (infeasible) starting
points.

 <dc:description>  The problem of mapping human close-range proximity networks has been tackled
using a variety of technical approaches. Wearable electronic devices, in
particular, have proven to be particularly successful in a variety of settings
relevant for research in social science, complex networks and infectious
diseases dynamics. Each device and technology used for proximity sensing (e.g.,
RFIDs, Bluetooth, low-power radio or infrared communication, etc.) comes with
specific biases on the close-range relations it records. Hence it is important
to assess which statistical features of the empirical proximity networks are
robust across different measurement techniques, and which modeling frameworks
generalize well across empirical data. Here we compare time-resolved proximity
networks recorded in different experimental settings and show that some
important statistical features are robust across all settings considered. The
observed universality calls for a simplified modeling approach. We show that
one such simple model is indeed able to reproduce the main statistical
distributions characterizing the empirical temporal networks.

 <dc:description>  As autonomous service robots become more affordable and thus available also
for the general public, there is a growing need for user friendly interfaces to
control the robotic system. Currently available control modalities typically
expect users to be able to express their desire through either touch, speech or
gesture commands. While this requirement is fulfilled for the majority of
users, paralyzed users may not be able to use such systems. In this paper, we
present a novel framework, that allows these users to interact with a robotic
service assistant in a closed-loop fashion, using only thoughts. The
brain-computer interface (BCI) system is composed of several interacting
components, i.e., non-invasive neuronal signal recording and decoding,
high-level task planning, motion and manipulation planning as well as
environment perception. In various experiments, we demonstrate its
applicability and robustness in real world scenarios, considering
fetch-and-carry tasks and tasks involving human-robot interaction. As our
results demonstrate, our system is capable of adapting to frequent changes in
the environment and reliably completing given tasks within a reasonable amount
of time. Combined with high-level planning and autonomous robotic systems,
interesting new perspectives open up for non-invasive BCI-based human-robot
interactions.

 <dc:description>  Existing image classification datasets used in computer vision tend to have
an even number of images for each object category. In contrast, the natural
world is heavily imbalanced, as some species are more abundant and easier to
photograph than others. To encourage further progress in challenging real world
conditions we present the iNaturalist Challenge 2017 dataset - an image
classification benchmark consisting of 675,000 images with over 5,000 different
species of plants and animals. It features many visually similar species,
captured in a wide variety of situations, from all over the world. Images were
collected with different camera types, have varying image quality, have been
verified by multiple citizen scientists, and feature a large class imbalance.
  We discuss the collection of the dataset and present baseline results for
state-of-the-art computer vision classification models. Results show that
current non-ensemble based methods achieve only 64% top one classification
accuracy, illustrating the difficulty of the dataset. Finally, we report
results from a competition that was held with the data.

 <dc:description>  Psychological studies have shown that personality traits are associated with
book preferences. However, past findings are based on questionnaires focusing
on conventional book genres and are unrepresentative of niche content. For a
more comprehensive measure of book content, this study harnesses a massive
archive of content labels, also known as 'tags', created by users of an online
book catalogue, Goodreads.com. Combined with data on preferences and
personality scores collected from Facebook users, the tag labels achieve high
accuracy in personality prediction by psychological standards. We also group
tags into broader genres, to check their validity against past findings. Our
results are robust across both tag and genre levels of analyses, and consistent
with existing literature. Moreover, user-generated tag labels reveal unexpected
insights, such as cultural differences, book reading behaviors, and other
non-content factors affecting preferences. To our knowledge, this is currently
the largest study that explores the relationship between personality and book
content preferences.

 <dc:description>  Imitation learning algorithms learn viable policies by imitating an expert's
behavior when reward signals are not available. Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for learning policies
when the expert's behavior is available as a fixed set of trajectories. We
evaluate in terms of the expert's cost function and observe that the
distribution of trajectory-costs is often more heavy-tailed for GAIL-agents
than the expert at a number of benchmark continuous-control tasks. Thus,
high-cost trajectories, corresponding to tail-end events of catastrophic
failure, are more likely to be encountered by the GAIL-agents than the expert.
This makes the reliability of GAIL-agents questionable when it comes to
deployment in risk-sensitive applications like robotic surgery and autonomous
driving. In this work, we aim to minimize the occurrence of tail-end events by
minimizing tail risk within the GAIL framework. We quantify tail risk by the
Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of trajectories and develop the Risk-Averse
Imitation Learning (RAIL) algorithm. We observe that the policies learned with
RAIL show lower tail-end risk than those of vanilla GAIL. Thus the proposed
RAIL algorithm appears as a potent alternative to GAIL for improved reliability
in risk-sensitive applications.

 <dc:description>  We consider several related problems of estimating the 'sparsity' or number
of nonzero elements $d$ in a length $n$ vector $\mathbf{x}$ by observing only
$\mathbf{b} = M \odot \mathbf{x}$, where $M$ is a predesigned test matrix
independent of $\mathbf{x}$, and the operation $\odot$ varies between problems.
We aim to provide a $\Delta$-approximation of sparsity for some constant
$\Delta$ with a minimal number of measurements (rows of $M$). This framework
generalizes multiple problems, such as estimation of sparsity in group testing
and compressed sensing. We use techniques from coding theory as well as
probabilistic methods to show that $O(D \log D \log n)$ rows are sufficient
when the operation $\odot$ is logical OR (i.e., group testing), and nearly this
many are necessary, where $D$ is a known upper bound on $d$. When instead the
operation $\odot$ is multiplication over $\mathbb{R}$ or a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$, we show that respectively $\Theta(D)$ and $\Theta(D \log_q
\frac{n}{D})$ measurements are necessary and sufficient.

 <dc:description>  We design and implement a distributed algorithm for balanced $k$-way
hypergraph partitioning that minimizes fanout, a fundamental hypergraph
quantity also known as the communication volume and ($k-1$)-cut metric, by
optimizing a novel objective called probabilistic fanout. This choice allows a
simple local search heuristic to achieve comparable solution quality to the
best existing hypergraph partitioners.
  Our algorithm is arbitrarily scalable due to a careful design that controls
computational complexity, space complexity, and communication. In practice, we
commonly process hypergraphs with billions of vertices and hyperedges in a few
hours. We explain how the algorithm's scalability, both in terms of hypergraph
size and bucket count, is limited only by the number of machines available. We
perform an extensive comparison to existing distributed hypergraph partitioners
and find that our approach is able to optimize hypergraphs roughly $100$ times
bigger on the same set of machines.
  We call the resulting tool Social Hash Partitioner (SHP), and accompanying
this paper, we open-source the most scalable version based on recursive
bisection.

critically examine the contents and context that motivate the tweeting of
journal articles. We then focus on a specific aspect, the role played by
journals on self-promoting their contents and the effect this has on the total
number of tweets their papers produce. In a context where many are pushing to
the use of altmetrics as an alternative or complement to traditional
bibliometric indicators. We find a lack of evidence (and interest) on

to trace evidences of 'broader forms of impact'. Our first results are not

 <dc:description>  Machine learning techniques have become increasingly popular in the field of
resting state fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) network based
classification. However, the application of convolutional networks has been
proposed only very recently and has remained largely unexplored. In this paper
we describe a convolutional neural network architecture for functional
connectome classification called connectome-convolutional neural network
(CCNN). Our results on simulated datasets and a publicly available dataset for
amnestic mild cognitive impairment classification demonstrate that our CCNN
model can efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the
connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from diverse
functional connectivity metrics and that models using a combination of
different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform classifiers using
only one metric. From this flexibility follows that our proposed CCNN model can
be easily adapted to a wide range of connectome based classification or
regression tasks, by varying which connectivity descriptor combinations are
used to train the network.

 <dc:description>  Topological data analysis is an emerging area in exploratory data analysis
and data mining. Its main tool, persistent homology, has become a popular
technique to study the structure of complex, high-dimensional data. In this
paper, we propose a novel method using persistent homology to quantify
structural changes in time-varying graphs. Specifically, we transform each
instance of the time-varying graph into metric spaces, extract topological
features using persistent homology, and compare those features over time. We
provide a visualization that assists in time-varying graph exploration and
helps to identify patterns of behavior within the data. To validate our
approach, we conduct several case studies on real world data sets and show how
our method can find cyclic patterns, deviations from those patterns, and
one-time events in time-varying graphs. We also examine whether
persistence-based similarity measure as a graph metric satisfies a set of
well-established, desirable properties for graph metrics.

 <dc:title>A monadic solution to the Cartwright-Felleisen-Wadler conjecture</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a programming language, can we give a monadic denotational semantics
that is stable under language extension? Models containing only a single monad
are not stable. Models based on type-and-effect systems, in which there is a
monad for every set of operations in the language, are. Cartwright and
Felleisen, and Wadler, conjectured such monadic semantics can be generated. We
describe a new general method of constructing stable models from standard
monadic models, based on factorizations of monad morphisms. We show that under
certain conditions factorizations induce a monad for every set of operations,
and explain why the conditions usually hold. We also describe preliminary work
using fibrations for logical relations generated from these factorization
systems for proving the correctness of the resulting model.

 <dc:title>AWGN-Goodness is Enough: Capacity-Achieving Lattice Codes based on
  Dithered Probabilistic Shaping</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Campello, Antonio</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Dadush, Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we show that any sequence of infinite lattice constellations
which is good for the unconstrained Gaussian channel can be shaped into a
capacity-achieving sequence of codes for the power-constrained Gaussian channel
under lattice decoding and non-uniform signalling. Unlike previous results in
the literature, our scheme holds with no extra condition on the lattices (e.g.
quantization-goodness or vanishing flatness factor), thus establishing a direct
implication between AWGN-goodness, in the sense of Poltyrev, and
capacity-achieving codes. Our analysis uses properties of the discrete Gaussian
distribution in order to obtain precise bounds on the probability of error and
achievable rates. In particular, we obtain a simple characterization of the
finite-blocklength behavior of the scheme, showing that it approaches the
optimal dispersion coefficient for \textit{high} signal-to-noise ratio. We
further show that for \textit{low} signal-to-noise ratio the discrete Gaussian
over centered lattice constellations can not achieve capacity, and thus a shift
(or &quot;dither&quot;) is essentially necessary.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of learning to reason in large scale knowledge graphs
(KGs). More specifically, we describe a novel reinforcement learning framework
for learning multi-hop relational paths: we use a policy-based agent with
continuous states based on knowledge graph embeddings, which reasons in a KG
vector space by sampling the most promising relation to extend its path. In
contrast to prior work, our approach includes a reward function that takes the
accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration. Experimentally, we show
that our proposed method outperforms a path-ranking based algorithm and
knowledge graph embedding methods on Freebase and Never-Ending Language
Learning datasets.

 <dc:title>Real-Time Head Gesture Recognition on Head-Mounted Displays using

 <dc:description>  Head gesture is a natural means of face-to-face communication between people
but the recognition of head gestures in the context of virtual reality and use
of head gesture as an interface for interacting with virtual avatars and
virtual environments have been rarely investigated. In the current study, we
present an approach for real-time head gesture recognition on head-mounted
displays using Cascaded Hidden Markov Models. We conducted two experiments to
evaluate our proposed approach. In experiment 1, we trained the Cascaded Hidden
Markov Models and assessed the offline classification performance using
collected head motion data. In experiment 2, we characterized the real-time
performance of the approach by estimating the latency to recognize a head
gesture with recorded real-time classification data. Our results show that the
proposed approach is effective in recognizing head gestures. The method can be
integrated into a virtual reality system as a head gesture interface for
interacting with virtual worlds.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge of shape geometry plays a pivotal role in many shape analysis
applications. In this paper we introduce a local geometry-inclusive global
representation of 3D shapes based on computation of the shortest quasi-geodesic
paths between all possible pairs of points on the 3D shape manifold. In the
proposed representation, the normal curvature along the quasi-geodesic paths
between any two points on the shape surface is preserved. We employ the
eigenspectrum of the proposed global representation to address the problems of
determination of region-based correspondence between isometric shapes and
characterization of self-symmetry in the absence of prior knowledge in the form
of user-defined correspondence maps. We further utilize the commutative
property of the resulting shape descriptor to extract stable regions between
isometric shapes that differ from one another by a high degree of isometry
transformation. We also propose various shape characterization metrics in terms
of the eigenvector decomposition of the shape descriptor spectrum to quantify
the correspondence and self-symmetry of 3D shapes. The performance of the
proposed 3D shape descriptor is experimentally compared with the performance of
other relevant state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors.

 <dc:description>  Two different approaches have recently been proposed for boundary handling in
convolutional sparse representations, avoiding potential boundary artifacts
arising from the circular boundary conditions implied by the use of frequency
domain solution methods by introducing a spatial mask into the convolutional
sparse coding problem. In the present paper we show that, under certain
circumstances, these methods fail in their design goal of avoiding boundary
artifacts. The reasons for this failure are discussed, a solution is proposed,
and the practical implications are illustrated in an image deblurring problem.

 <dc:description>  The introduction of cheap RGB-D cameras, stereo cameras, and LIDAR devices
has given the computer vision community 3D information that conventional RGB
cameras cannot provide. This data is often stored as a point cloud. In this
paper, we present a novel method to apply the concept of convolutional neural
networks to this type of data. By creating a mapping of nearest neighbors in a
dataset, and individually applying weights to spatial relationships between
points, we achieve an architecture that works directly with point clouds, but
closely resembles a convolutional neural net in both design and behavior. Such
a method bypasses the need for extensive feature engineering, while proving to
be computationally efficient and requiring few parameters.

 <dc:description>  Consider a full-duplex (FD) multiuser system where an FD base station (BS) is
designed to simultaneously serve both downlink users and uplink users in the
presence of half-duplex eavesdroppers (Eves). Our problem is to maximize the
minimum secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users by proposing a novel user
grouping method, where information signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with
artificial noise to degrade the Eves' channel. The SR problem has a highly
nonconcave and nonsmooth objective, subject to nonconvex constraints due to
coupling between the optimization variables. Nevertheless, we develop a
path-following low-complexity algorithm, which invokes only a simple convex
program of moderate dimensions at each iteration. We show that our
path-following algorithm guarantees convergence at least to a local optima. The
numerical results demonstrate the merit of our proposed approach compared to
existing well-known ones, i.e., conventional FD and nonorthogonal multiple
access.

 <dc:description>  Following the recent adoption of deep neural networks (DNN) accross a wide
range of applications, adversarial attacks against these models have proven to
be an indisputable threat. Adversarial samples are crafted with a deliberate
intention of undermining a system. In the case of DNNs, the lack of better
understanding of their working has prevented the development of efficient
defenses. In this paper, we propose a new defense method based on practical
observations which is easy to integrate into models and performs better than
state-of-the-art defenses. Our proposed solution is meant to reinforce the
structure of a DNN, making its prediction more stable and less likely to be
fooled by adversarial samples. We conduct an extensive experimental study
proving the efficiency of our method against multiple attacks, comparing it to
numerous defenses, both in white-box and black-box setups. Additionally, the
implementation of our method brings almost no overhead to the training
procedure, while maintaining the prediction performance of the original model
on clean samples.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Successful programs are written to be maintained. One aspect to this is that
programmers order the components in the code files in a particular way. This is
part of programming style. While the conventions for ordering are sometimes
given as part of a style guideline, such guidelines are often incomplete and
programmers tend to have their own more comprehensive orderings in mind. This
paper defines a model for ordering program components and shows how this model
can be learned from sample code. Such a model is a useful tool for a
programming environment in that it can be used to find the proper location for
inserting new components or for reordering files to better meet the needs of
the programmer. The model is designed so that it can be fine- tuned by the
programmer. The learning framework is evaluated both by looking at code with
known style guidelines and by testing whether it inserts existing components
into a file correctly.

 <dc:description>  The recent concept of beamspace multiple input multiple output (MIMO) can
significantly reduce the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains in
millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive MIMO systems without obvious performance loss.
However, the fundamental limit of existing beamspace MIMO is that, the number
of supported users cannot be larger than the number of RF chains at the same
time-frequency resources. To break this fundamental limit, in this paper we
propose a new spectrum and energy efficient mmWave transmission scheme that
integrates the concept of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with beamspace
MIMO, i.e., beamspace MIMO-NOMA. By using NOMA in beamspace MIMO systems, the
number of supported users can be larger than the number of RF chains at the
same time-frequency resources. Particularly, the achievable sum rate of the
proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA in a typical mmWave channel model is analyzed,
which shows an obvious performance gain compared with the existing beamspace
MIMO. Then, a precoding scheme based on the principle of zero-forcing (ZF) is
designed to reduce the inter-beam interferences in the beamspace MIMO-NOMA
system. Furthermore, to maximize the achievable sum rate, a dynamic power
allocation is proposed by solving the joint power optimization problem, which
not only includes the intra-beam power optimization, but also considers the
inter-beam power optimization. Finally, an iterative optimization algorithm
with low complexity is developed to realize the dynamic power allocation.
Simulation results show that the proposed beamspace MIMO-NOMA can achieve
higher spectrum and energy efficiency compared with existing beamspace MIMO.

 <dc:description>  The current processes for building machine learning systems require
practitioners with deep knowledge of machine learning. This significantly
limits the number of machine learning systems that can be created and has led
to a mismatch between the demand for machine learning systems and the ability
for organizations to build them. We believe that in order to meet this growing
demand for machine learning systems we must significantly increase the number
of individuals that can teach machines. We postulate that we can achieve this
goal by making the process of teaching machines easy, fast and above all,
universally accessible.
  While machine learning focuses on creating new algorithms and improving the
accuracy of &quot;learners&quot;, the machine teaching discipline focuses on the efficacy
of the &quot;teachers&quot;. Machine teaching as a discipline is a paradigm shift that
follows and extends principles of software engineering and programming
languages. We put a strong emphasis on the teacher and the teacher's
interaction with data, as well as crucial components such as techniques and
design principles of interaction and visualization.
  In this paper, we present our position regarding the discipline of machine
teaching and articulate fundamental machine teaching principles. We also
describe how, by decoupling knowledge about machine learning algorithms from
the process of teaching, we can accelerate innovation and empower millions of

 <dc:description>  In this notebook paper, we describe our approach in the submission to the
temporal action proposal (task 3) and temporal action localization (task 4) of
ActivityNet Challenge hosted at CVPR 2017. Since the accuracy in action
classification task is already very high (nearly 90% in ActivityNet dataset),
we believe that the main bottleneck for temporal action localization is the
quality of action proposals. Therefore, we mainly focus on the temporal action
proposal task and propose a new proposal model based on temporal convolutional
network. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performances on both
temporal action proposal task and temporal action localization task.

 <dc:description>  We describe a generalization of the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden
Markov Model (HDP-HMM) which is able to encode prior information that state
transitions are more likely between &quot;nearby&quot; states. This is accomplished by
defining a similarity function on the state space and scaling transition
probabilities by pair-wise similarities, thereby inducing correlations among
the transition distributions. We present an augmented data representation of
the model as a Markov Jump Process in which: (1) some jump attempts fail, and
(2) the probability of success is proportional to the similarity between the
source and destination states. This augmentation restores conditional conjugacy
and admits a simple Gibbs sampler. We evaluate the model and inference method
on a speaker diarization task and a &quot;harmonic parsing&quot; task using four-part
chorale data, as well as on several synthetic datasets, achieving favorable
comparisons to existing models.

 <dc:description>  Existing dimensionality reduction methods are adept at revealing hidden
underlying manifolds arising from high-dimensional data and thereby producing a
low-dimensional representation. However, the smoothness of the manifolds
produced by classic techniques in the presence of noise is not guaranteed. In
fact, the embedding generated using such non-smooth, noisy measurements may
distort the geometry of the manifold and thereby produce an unfaithful
embedding. Herein, we propose a framework for nonlinear dimensionality
reduction that generates a manifold in terms of smooth geodesics that is
designed to treat problems in which manifold measurements have been corrupted
by noise. Our method generates a network structure for given high-dimensional
data using a neighborhood search and then produces piecewise linear shortest
paths that are defined as geodesics. Then, we fit points in each geodesic by a
smoothing spline to emphasize the smoothness. The robustness of this approach
for noisy and sparse datasets is demonstrated by the implementation of the
method on synthetic and real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  An orbit of $G$ is a subset $S$ of $V(G)$ such that $\phi(u)=v$ for any two
vertices $u,v\in S$, where $\phi$ is an isomorphism of $G$. The orbit number of
a graph $G$, denoted by $\text{Orb}(G)$, is the number of orbits of $G$. In [A
Note on Path Embedding in Crossed Cubes with Faulty Vertices, Information
Processing Letters 121 (2017) pp. 34--38], Chen et al. conjectured that
$\text{Orb}(\text{CQ}_n)=2^{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil-2}$ for $n\geqslant 3$,
where $\text{CQ}_n$ denotes an $n$-dimensional crossed cube. In this paper, we

 <dc:description>  Predictive business process monitoring refers to the act of making
predictions about the future state of ongoing cases of a business process,
based on their incomplete execution traces and logs of historical (completed)
traces. Motivated by the increasingly pervasive availability of fine-grained
event data about business process executions, the problem of predictive process
monitoring has received substantial attention in the past years. In particular,
a considerable number of methods have been put forward to address the problem
of outcome-oriented predictive process monitoring, which refers to classifying
each ongoing case of a process according to a given set of possible outcomes -
e.g. Will the customer complain or not? Will an order be delivered, cancelled
or withdrawn? Unfortunately, different authors have used different datasets,
experimental settings, evaluation measures and baselines to assess their
proposals, resulting in poor comparability and an unclear picture of the
relative merits and applicability of different methods. To address this gap,
this article presents a systematic review and taxonomy of outcome-oriented
predictive process monitoring methods, and a comparative experimental
evaluation of eleven representative methods using a benchmark covering twelve
predictive process monitoring tasks based on four real-life event logs.

 <dc:title>Improved Bilinear Pooling with CNNs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bilinear pooling of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) features [22, 23], and
their compact variants [10], have been shown to be effective at fine-grained
recognition, scene categorization, texture recognition, and visual
question-answering tasks among others. The resulting representation captures
second-order statistics of convolutional features in a translationally
invariant manner. In this paper we investigate various ways of normalizing
these statistics to improve their representation power. In particular we find
that the matrix square-root normalization offers significant improvements and
outperforms alternative schemes such as the matrix logarithm normalization when
combined with elementwise square-root and l2 normalization. This improves the
accuracy by 2-3% on a range of fine-grained recognition datasets leading to a
new state of the art. We also investigate how the accuracy of matrix function
computations effect network training and evaluation. In particular we compare
against a technique for estimating matrix square-root gradients via solving a
Lyapunov equation that is more numerically accurate than computing gradients
via a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). We find that while SVD gradients are
numerically inaccurate the overall effect on the final accuracy is negligible
once boundary cases are handled carefully. We present an alternative scheme for
computing gradients that is faster and yet it offers improvements over the
baseline model. Finally we show that the matrix square-root computed
approximately using a few Newton iterations is just as accurate for the
classification task but allows an order-of-magnitude faster GPU implementation
compared to SVD decomposition.

 <dc:title>Subcarrier-Chunk Assignment With Power Allocation and Multiple-Rate
  Constraints for Downlink OFDMA</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider downlink OFDMA in which users are imposed with different
proportional-rate constraints, and a base station would like to maximise user
rate over subcarrier assignment (SA) and power allocation (PA). To attain the
objective, we propose a chunk-based SA and low-complexity PA algorithms.
Numerical results show that the proposed SA and PA can provide higher average
minimum achievable rate than the existing schemes while keeping the deviation
from the rate constraint small for both single-cell and multi-cell systems with
fractional frequency reuse.

 <dc:title>Reconfiguration on nowhere dense graph classes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Siebertz, Sebastian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the token jumping problem for a vertex subset problem $Q$ on graphs we are
given a graph $G$ and two feasible solutions $S_s, S_t\subseteq V(G)$ of $Q$
with $|S_s|=|S_t|$, and imagine that a token is placed on each vertex of $S_s$.
The problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ of
feasible solutions, where $S_1=S_s$, $S_n=S_t$ and each $S_{i+1}$ results from
$S_i$, $1\leq i&lt;n$, by moving exactly one token to another vertex.
  We prove that for every nowhere dense class of graphs and for every $r\geq 1$
there exists a polynomial $p_r$ such that the token jumping problem for the
distance-$r$ independent set problem and for the distance-$r$ dominating set
problem admit kernels of size $p_r(k)$, where $k$ is the number of used tokens.
If $k$ is equal to the size of a minimum distance-$r$ dominating set, then we
even obtain a kernel of almost linear size $O(k^{1+\epsilon})$ for any fixed
$\epsilon&gt;0$.
  We then prove that if a class~$C$ is somewhere dense and closed under taking
subgraphs, then for some value of $r\geq 1$ the reconfiguration problem for the
above problems on $C$ is $W[1]$-hard (and in particular we cannot expect the
existence of kernelization algorithms). Hence our results show that the limit
of tractability for the reconfiguration variants of the distance-$r$
independent set problem and distance-$r$ dominating set problem on subgraph
closed graph classes lies exactly on the boundary between nowhere denseness and
somewhere denseness.

 <dc:description>  A set of mobile robots is placed at points of an infinite line. The robots
are equipped with GPS devices and they may communicate their positions on the
line to a central authority. The collection contains an unknown subset of
&quot;spies&quot;, i.e., byzantine robots, which are indistinguishable from the
non-faulty ones. The set of the non-faulty robots need to rendezvous in the
shortest possible time in order to perform some task, while the byzantine
robots may try to delay their rendezvous for as long as possible. The problem
facing a central authority is to determine trajectories for all robots so as to
minimize the time until the non-faulty robots have rendezvoused. The
trajectories must be determined without knowledge of which robots are faulty.
Our goal is to minimize the competitive ratio between the time required to
achieve the first rendezvous of the non-faulty robots and the time required for
such a rendezvous to occur under the assumption that the faulty robots are
known at the start. We provide a bounded competitive ratio algorithm, where the
central authority is informed only of the set of initial robot positions,
without knowing which ones or how many of them are faulty. When an upper bound
on the number of byzantine robots is known to the central authority, we provide
algorithms with better competitive ratios. In some instances we are able to
show these algorithms are optimal.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the problem of person search in the wild in this work. Instead
of comparing the query against all candidate regions generated in a query-blind
manner, we propose to recursively shrink the search area from the whole image
till achieving precise localization of the target person, by fully exploiting
information from the query and contextual cues in every recursive search step.
We develop the Neural Person Search Machines (NPSM) to implement such recursive
localization for person search. Benefiting from its neural search mechanism,
NPSM is able to selectively shrink its focus from a loose region to a tighter
one containing the target automatically. In this process, NPSM employs an
internal primitive memory component to memorize the query representation which
modulates the attention and augments its robustness to other distracting
regions. Evaluations on two benchmark datasets, CUHK-SYSU Person Search dataset
and PRW dataset, have demonstrated that our method can outperform current
state-of-the-arts in both mAP and top-1 evaluation protocols.

 <dc:description>  Monitoring tasks, such as anomaly and DDoS detection, require identifying
frequent flow aggregates based on common IP prefixes. These are known as
\emph{hierarchical heavy hitters} (HHH), where the hierarchy is determined
based on the type of prefixes of interest in a given application. The per
packet complexity of existing HHH algorithms is proportional to the size of the
hierarchy, imposing significant overheads.
  In this paper, we propose a randomized constant time algorithm for HHH. We
prove probabilistic precision bounds backed by an empirical evaluation. Using
four real Internet packet traces, we demonstrate that our algorithm indeed
obtains comparable accuracy and recall as previous works, while running up to
62 times faster. Finally, we extended Open vSwitch (OVS) with our algorithm and
showed it is able to handle 13.8 million packets per second. In contrast,
incorporating previous works in OVS only obtained 2.5 times lower throughput.

and an integer $k&gt;0$, the question is whether there are at most $k$ edges whose
deletion results in a graph without claws and diamonds as induced graphs. Based
on some refined observations, we propose a kernel of $O(k^3)$ vertices and
$O(k^4)$ edges, significantly improving the previous kernel of $O(k^{12})$
vertices and $O(k^{24})$ edges. In addition, we derive an $O^*(3.792^k)$-time
algorithm for the {claw, diamond}-free edge deletion problem.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of Android devices brings the fragmentation problem.
Selecting and prioritizing major device models are critical for mobile app
developers to select testbeds and optimize various issues such as
quality-assurance, release planning, revenues, and so on. PRADA, an approach
proposed in our previous work, was designed to help prioritizing Android
devices for apps. In this paper, we conduct a survey in two IT companies to
study the applicability of PRADA. Results from the survey show that PRADA has
attracted the interests of industrial Android developers.

 <dc:description>  Semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds is an important research
topic in computer vision and remote sensing fields. Most existing approaches
utilize hand-crafted features for each modality independently and combine them
in a heuristic manner. They often fail to consider the consistency and
complementary information among features adequately, which makes them difficult
to capture high-level semantic structures. The features learned by most of the
current deep learning methods can obtain high-quality image classification
results. However, these methods are hard to be applied to recognize 3D point
clouds due to unorganized distribution and various point density of data. In
this paper, we propose a 3DCNN-DQN-RNN method which fuses the 3D convolutional
neural network (CNN), Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Residual recurrent neural
network (RNN) for an efficient semantic parsing of large-scale 3D point clouds.
In our method, an eye window under control of the 3D CNN and DQN can localize
and segment the points of the object class efficiently. The 3D CNN and Residual
RNN further extract robust and discriminative features of the points in the eye
window, and thus greatly enhance the parsing accuracy of large-scale point
clouds. Our method provides an automatic process that maps the raw data to the
classification results. It also integrates object localization, segmentation
and classification into one framework. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud classification
methods.

 <dc:description>  Head detection and localization is a demanding task and a key element for
many computer vision applications, like video surveillance, Human Computer
Interaction and face analysis. The stunning amount of work done for detecting
faces on RGB images, together with the availability of huge face datasets,
allowed to setup very effective systems on that domain. However, due to
illumination issues, infrared or depth cameras may be required in real
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for head detection on
depth images that exploits the classification ability of deep learning
approaches. In addition to reduce the dependency on the external illumination,
depth images implicitly embed useful information to deal with the scale of the
target objects. Two public datasets have been exploited: the first one, called
Pandora, is used to train a deep binary classifier with face and non-face
images. The second one, collected by Cornell University, is used to perform a
cross-dataset test during daily activities in unconstrained environments.
Experimental results show that the proposed method overcomes the performance of
state-of-art methods working on depth images.

 <dc:description>  As bimanual robots become increasingly popular, learning and control
algorithms must take into account new constraints and challenges imposed by
this morphology. Most research on learning bimanual skills has focused on
learning coordination between end-effectors, exploiting operational space
formulations. However, motion patterns in bimanual scenarios are not exclusive
to operational space, also occurring at the joint level. Moreover, bimanual
operation offers the possibility to carry out more than one manipulation task
at the same time, which in turn introduces the problem of task prioritization
in bimanual settings. Here we address the aforementioned problems from a robot
learning perspective. We go beyond operational space and present a principled
approach to simultaneously learn operational and configuration space
constraints, as well as the evolution of task priorities from demonstrations.
Our method extends the Task-Parameterized Gaussian Mixture Model (TP-GMM) to
the use of projection operators which allow for tackling such problems. The
approach is validated in two different bimanual tasks with the COMAN and
WALK-MAN humanoids that either require the consideration of constraints in both
operational and configuration spaces, or the prioritization of tasks.

 <dc:description>  Selecting optimal parameters for a neural network architecture can often make
the difference between mediocre and state-of-the-art performance. However,
little is published which parameters and design choices should be evaluated or
selected making the correct hyperparameter optimization often a &quot;black art that
requires expert experiences&quot; (Snoek et al., 2012). In this paper, we evaluate
the importance of different network design choices and hyperparameters for five
common linguistic sequence tagging tasks (POS, Chunking, NER, Entity
Recognition, and Event Detection). We evaluated over 50.000 different setups
and found, that some parameters, like the pre-trained word embeddings or the
last layer of the network, have a large impact on the performance, while other
parameters, for example the number of LSTM layers or the number of recurrent
units, are of minor importance. We give a recommendation on a configuration
that performs well among different tasks.

 <dc:description>  With the ever decreasing attention span of contemporary Internet users, the
title of online content (such as a news article or video) can be a major factor
in determining its popularity. To take advantage of this phenomenon, we propose
a new method based on a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
network designed to predict the popularity of online content using only its
title. We evaluate the proposed architecture on two distinct datasets of news
articles and news videos distributed in social media that contain over 40,000
samples in total. On those datasets, our approach improves the performance over
traditional shallow approaches by a margin of 15%. Additionally, we show that
using pre-trained word vectors in the embedding layer improves the results of
LSTM models, especially when the training set is small. To our knowledge, this
is the first attempt of applying popularity prediction using only textual
information from the title.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of popularity prediction of online

the popularity prediction problem as a classification task and we aim to solve

method based on a Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) that
incorporates the sequentiality of the information in the model. Results
obtained on a dataset of over 37'000 videos published on Facebook show that
using our method leads to over 30% improvement in prediction performance over
the traditional shallow approaches and can provide valuable insights for
content creators.

 <dc:title>The Complexity Landscape of Fixed-Parameter Directed Steiner Network
  Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Feldmann, Andreas Emil</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a directed graph $G$ and a list $(s_1,t_1),\dots,(s_d,t_d)$ of terminal
pairs, the Directed Steiner Network problem asks for a minimum-cost subgraph of
$G$ that contains a directed $s_i\to t_i$ path for every $1\le i \le k$. The
special case Directed Steiner Tree (when we ask for paths from a root $r$ to
terminals $t_1,\dots,t_d$) is known to be fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by the number of terminals, while the special case Strongly
Connected Steiner Subgraph (when we ask for a path from every $t_i$ to every
other $t_j$) is known to be W[1]-hard. We systematically explore the complexity
landscape of directed Steiner problems to fully understand which other special
cases are FPT or W[1]-hard. Formally, if $\mathcal{H}$ is a class of directed
graphs, then we look at the special case of Directed Steiner Network where the
list $(s_1,t_1),\dots,(s_d,t_d)$ of requests form a directed graph that is a
member of $\mathcal{H}$. Our main result is a complete characterization of the
classes $\mathcal{H}$ resulting in fixed-parameter tractable special cases: we
show that if every pattern in $\mathcal{H}$ has the combinatorial property of
being &quot;transitively equivalent to a bounded-length caterpillar with a bounded
number of extra edges,&quot; then the problem is FPT, and it is W[1]-hard for every
recursively enumerable $\mathcal{H}$ not having this property. This complete
dichotomy unifies and generalizes the known results showing that Directed
Steiner Tree is FPT [Dreyfus and Wagner, Networks 1971], $q$-Root Steiner Tree
is FPT for constant $q$ [Such\'y, WG 2016], Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph
is W[1]-hard [Guo et al., SIAM J. Discrete Math. 2011], and Directed Steiner
Network is solvable in polynomial-time for constant number of terminals
[Feldman and Ruhl, SIAM J. Comput. 2006], and moreover reveals a large
continent of tractable cases that were not known before.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, recognition of text from natural scene image and video frame
has got increased attention among the researchers due to its various
complexities and challenges. Because of low resolution, blurring effect,
complex background, different fonts, color and variant alignment of text within
images and video frames, etc., text recognition in such scenario is difficult.
Most of the current approaches usually apply a binarization algorithm to
convert them into binary images and next OCR is applied to get the recognition
result. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on color channel
selection for text recognition from scene images and video frames. In the
approach, at first, a color channel is automatically selected and then selected
color channel is considered for text recognition. Our text recognition
framework is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which uses Pyramidal Histogram
of Oriented Gradient features extracted from selected color channel. From each
sliding window of a color channel our color-channel selection approach analyzes
the image properties from the sliding window and then a multi-label Support
Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is applied to select the color channel that
will provide the best recognition results in the sliding window. This color
channel selection for each sliding window has been found to be more fruitful
than considering a single color channel for the whole word image. Five
different features have been analyzed for multi-label SVM based color channel
selection where wavelet transform based feature outperforms others. Our
framework has been tested on different publicly available scene/video text
image datasets. For Devanagari script, we collected our own data dataset. The
performances obtained from experimental results are encouraging and show the
advantage of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established formalism for nonmonotonic
reasoning. An ASP program can have no answer set due to cyclic default
negation. In this case, it is not possible to draw any conclusion, even if this
is not intended. Recently, several paracoherent semantics have been proposed
that address this issue, and several potential applications for these semantics
have been identified. However, paracoherent semantics have essentially been
inapplicable in practice, due to the lack of efficient algorithms and
implementations. In this paper, this lack is addressed, and several different
algorithms to compute semi-stable and semi-equilibrium models are proposed and
implemented into an answer set solving framework. An empirical performance
comparison among the new algorithms on benchmarks from ASP competitions is
given as well.

 <dc:description>  Set similarity join is a fundamental and well-studied database operator. It
is usually studied in the exact setting where the goal is to compute all pairs
of sets that exceed a given similarity threshold (measured e.g. as Jaccard
similarity). But set similarity join is often used in settings where 100%
recall may not be important --- indeed, where the exact set similarity join is
itself only an approximation of the desired result set.
  We present a new randomized algorithm for set similarity join that can
achieve any desired recall up to 100%, and show theoretically and empirically
that it significantly improves on existing methods. The present
state-of-the-art exact methods are based on prefix-filtering, the performance
of which depends on the data set having many rare tokens. Our method is robust
against the absence of such structure in the data. At 90% recall our algorithm
is often more than an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art exact
methods, depending on how well a data set lends itself to prefix filtering. Our
experiments on benchmark data sets also show that the method is several times
faster than comparable approximate methods. Our algorithm makes use of recent
theoretical advances in high-dimensional sketching and indexing that we believe
to be of wider relevance to the data engineering community.

 <dc:description>  Bike sharing systems have rapidly developed around the world, and they are
served as a promising strategy to improve urban traffic congestion and to
decrease polluting gas emissions. So far performance analysis of bike sharing
systems always exists many difficulties and challenges under some more general
factors. In this paper, a more general large-scale bike sharing system is
discussed by means of heavy traffic approximation of multiclass closed queueing
networks with non-exponential factors. Based on this, the fluid scaled
equations and the diffusion scaled equations are established by means of the
numbers of bikes both at the stations and on the roads, respectively.
Furthermore, the scaling processes for the numbers of bikes both at the
stations and on the roads are proved to converge in distribution to a
semimartingale reflecting Brownian motion (SRBM) in a $N^{2}$-dimensional box,
and also the fluid and diffusion limit theorems are obtained. Furthermore,
performance analysis of the bike sharing system is provided. Thus the results
and methodology of this paper provide new highlight in the study of more
general large-scale bike sharing systems.

 <dc:title>Errors and secret data in the Italian research assessment exercise. A
  comment to a reply</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Italy adopted a performance-based system for funding universities that is
centered on the results of a national research assessment exercise, realized by
a governmental agency (ANVUR). ANVUR evaluated papers by using 'a dual system
of evaluation', that is by informed peer review or by bibliometrics. In view of
validating that system, ANVUR performed an experiment for estimating the
agreement between informed review and bibliometrics. Ancaiani et al. (2015)
presents the main results of the experiment. Baccini and De Nicolao (2017)
documented in a letter, among other critical issues, that the statistical
analysis was not realized on a random sample of articles. A reply to the letter
has been published by Research Evaluation (Benedetto et al. 2017). This note
highlights that in the reply there are (1) errors in data, (2) problems with
'representativeness' of the sample, (3) unverifiable claims about weights used
for calculating kappas, (4) undisclosed averaging procedures; (5) a statement
about 'same protocol in all areas' contradicted by official reports. Last but
not least: the data used by the authors continue to be undisclosed. A general
warning concludes: many recently published papers use data originating from
Italian research assessment exercise. These data are not accessible to the
scientific community and consequently these papers are not reproducible. They
can be hardly considered as containing sound evidence at least until authors or
ANVUR disclose the data necessary for replication.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  By year 2020, the number of smartphone users globally will reach 3 Billion
and the mobile data traffic (cellular + WiFi) will exceed PC internet traffic
the first time. As the number of smartphone users and the amount of data
transferred per smartphone grow exponentially, limited battery power is
becoming an increasingly critical problem for mobile devices which increasingly
depend on network I/O. Despite the growing body of research in power management
techniques for the mobile devices at the hardware layer as well as the lower
layers of the networking stack, there has been little work focusing on saving
energy at the application layer for the mobile systems during network I/O. In
this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are first to provide an in depth
analysis of the effects of application layer data transfer protocol parameters
on the energy consumption of mobile phones. We show that significant energy
savings can be achieved with application layer solutions at the mobile systems
during data transfer with no or minimal performance penalty. In many cases,
performance increase and energy savings can be achieved simultaneously.

 <dc:title>HMM-based Writer Identification in Music Score Documents without

 <dc:description>  Writer identification from musical score documents is a challenging task due
to its inherent problem of overlapping of musical symbols with staff lines.
Most of the existing works in the literature of writer identification in
musical score documents were performed after a preprocessing stage of staff
lines removal. In this paper we propose a novel writer identification framework
in musical documents without removing staff lines from documents. In our
approach, Hidden Markov Model has been used to model the writing style of the
writers without removing staff lines. The sliding window features are extracted
from musical score lines and they are used to build writer specific HMM models.
Given a query musical sheet, writer specific confidence for each musical line
is returned by each writer specific model using a loglikelihood score. Next, a
loglikelihood score in page level is computed by weighted combination of these
scores from the corresponding line images of the page. A novel Factor Analysis
based feature selection technique is applied in sliding window features to
reduce the noise appearing from staff lines which proves efficiency in writer
identification performance.In our framework we have also proposed a novel score
line detection approach in musical sheet using HMM. The experiment has been
performed in CVC-MUSCIMA dataset and the results obtained that the proposed
approach is efficient for score line detection and writer identification
without removing staff lines. To get the idea of computation time of our
method, detail analysis of execution time is also provided.

 <dc:title>Multichannel Attention Network for Analyzing Visual Behavior in Public

 <dc:description>  Public speaking is an important aspect of human communication and
interaction. The majority of computational work on public speaking concentrates
on analyzing the spoken content, and the verbal behavior of the speakers. While
the success of public speaking largely depends on the content of the talk, and
the verbal behavior, non-verbal (visual) cues, such as gestures and physical
appearance also play a significant role. This paper investigates the importance
of visual cues by estimating their contribution towards predicting the
popularity of a public lecture. For this purpose, we constructed a large
database of more than $1800$ TED talk videos. As a measure of popularity of the
TED talks, we leverage the corresponding (online) viewers' ratings from
YouTube. Visual cues related to facial and physical appearance, facial
expressions, and pose variations are extracted from the video frames using
convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Thereafter, an attention-based long
short-term memory (LSTM) network is proposed to predict the video popularity
from the sequence of visual features. The proposed network achieves
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy indicating that visual cues alone contain
highly predictive information about the popularity of a talk. Furthermore, our
network learns a human-like attention mechanism, which is particularly useful
for interpretability, i.e. how attention varies with time, and across different
visual cues by indicating their relative importance.

 <dc:title>Date-Field Retrieval in Scene Image and Video Frames using Text
  Enhancement and Shape Coding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Text recognition in scene image and video frames is difficult because of low
resolution, blur, background noise, etc. Since traditional OCRs do not perform
well in such images, information retrieval using keywords could be an
alternative way to index/retrieve such text information. Date is a useful piece
of information which has various applications including date-wise videos/scene
searching, indexing or retrieval. This paper presents a date spotting based
information retrieval system for natural scene image and video frames where
text appears with complex backgrounds. We propose a line based date spotting
approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) which is used to detect the date
information in a given text. Different date models are searched from a line
without segmenting characters or words. Given a text line image in RGB, we
apply an efficient gray image conversion to enhance the text information.
Wavelet decomposition and gradient sub-bands are used to enhance text
information in gray scale. Next, Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG)
feature has been extracted from gray image and binary images for date-spotting
framework. Binary and gray image features are combined by MLP based Tandem
approach. Finally, to boost the performance further, a shape coding based
scheme is used to combine the similar shape characters in same class during
word spotting. For our experiment, three different date models have been
constructed to search similar date information having numeric dates that
contains numeral values and punctuations and semi-numeric that contains dates
with numerals along with months in scene/video text. We have tested our system
on 1648 text lines and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed date
spotting approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an efficient and robust approach for reducing the size of
deep neural networks by pruning entire neurons. It exploits maxout units for
combining neurons into more complex convex functions and it makes use of a
local relevance measurement that ranks neurons according to their activation on
the training set for pruning them. Additionally, a parameter reduction
comparison between neuron and weight pruning is shown. It will be empirically
shown that the proposed neuron pruning reduces the number of parameters
dramatically. The evaluation is performed on two tasks, the MNIST handwritten
digit recognition and the LFW face verification, using a LeNet-5 and a VGG16
network architecture. The network size is reduced by up to $74\%$ and $61\%$,
respectively, without affecting the network's performance. The main advantage
of neuron pruning is its direct influence on the size of the network
architecture. Furthermore, it will be shown that neuron pruning can be combined
with subsequent weight pruning, reducing the size of the LeNet-5 and VGG16 up
to $92\%$ and $80\%$ respectively.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel word embedding pre-training approach that exploits writing
errors in learners' scripts. We compare our method to previous models that tune
the embeddings based on script scores and the discrimination between correct
and corrupt word contexts in addition to the generic commonly-used embeddings
pre-trained on large corpora. The comparison is achieved by using the
aforementioned models to bootstrap a neural network that learns to predict a
holistic score for scripts. Furthermore, we investigate augmenting our model
with error corrections and monitor the impact on performance. Our results show
that our error-oriented approach outperforms other comparable ones which is
further demonstrated when training on more data. Additionally, extending the
model with corrections provides further performance gains when data sparsity is
an issue.

{\em importance}, which may depend on the type of connections they represent or
on how recently they appeared in the scene, in a streaming setting. The goal is
to construct layouts of these graphs in which the readability of an edge is
proportional to its importance, that is, more important edges have fewer
crossings. We formalize this problem and study the case in which there exist
three different degrees of importance. We give a polynomial-time testing
algorithm when the graph induced by the two most important sets of edges is
biconnected. We also discuss interesting relationships with other
constrained-planarity problems.

 <dc:title>Load Thresholds for Cuckoo Hashing with Overlapping Blocks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Walzer, Stefan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dietzfelbinger and Weidling [DW07] proposed a natural variation of cuckoo
hashing where each of $cn$ objects is assigned $k = 2$ intervals of size $\ell$
in a linear (or cyclic) hash table of size $n$ and both start points are chosen
independently and uniformly at random. Each object must be placed into a table
cell within its intervals, but each cell can only hold one object. Experiments
suggested that this scheme outperforms the variant with blocks in which
intervals are aligned at multiples of $\ell$. In particular, the load threshold
is higher, i.e. the load $c$ that can be achieved with high probability. For
instance, Lehman and Panigrahy [LP09] empirically observed the threshold for
$\ell = 2$ to be around $96.5\%$ as compared to roughly $89.7\%$ using blocks.
They managed to pin down the asymptotics of the thresholds for large $\ell$,
but the precise values resisted rigorous analysis.
  We establish a method to determine these load thresholds for all $\ell \geq
2$, and, in fact, for general $k \geq 2$. For instance, for $k = \ell = 2$ we
get $\approx 96.4995\%$. The key tool we employ is an insightful and general
theorem due to Leconte, Lelarge, and Massouli\'e [LLM13], which adapts methods
from statistical physics to the world of hypergraph orientability. In effect,
the orientability thresholds for our graph families are determined by belief
propagation equations for certain graph limits. As a side note we provide
experimental evidence suggesting that placements can be constructed in linear
time with loads close to the threshold using an adapted version of an algorithm
by Khosla [Kho13].

 <dc:description>  We say that a finite set of red and blue points in the plane in general
position can be $K_{1,3}$-covered if the set can be partitioned into subsets of
size $4$, with $3$ points of one color and $1$ point of the other color, in
such a way that, if at each subset the fourth point is connected by
straight-line segments to the same-colored points, then the resulting set of
all segments has no crossings. We consider the following problem: Given a set
$R$ of $r$ red points and a set $B$ of $b$ blue points in the plane in general
position, how many points of $R\cup B$ can be $K_{1,3}$-covered? and we prove
the following results:
  (1) If $r=3g+h$ and $b=3h+g$, for some non-negative integers $g$ and $h$,
then there are point sets $R\cup B$, like $\{1,3\}$-equitable sets (i.e.,
$r=3b$ or $b=3r$) and linearly separable sets, that can be $K_{1,3}$-covered.
  (2) If $r=3g+h$, $b=3h+g$ and the points in $R\cup B$ are in convex position,
then at least $r+b-4$ points can be $K_{1,3}$-covered, and this bound is tight.
  (3) There are arbitrarily large point sets $R\cup B$ in general position,
with $|R|=|B|+1$, such that at most $r+b-5$ points can be $K_{1,3}$-covered.
  (4) If $b\le r\le 3b$, then at least $\frac{8}{9}(r+b-8)$ points of $R\cup B$
can be $K_{1,3}$-covered. For $r&gt;3b$, there are too many red points and at
least $r-3b$ of them will remain uncovered in any $K_{1,3}$-covering.
  Furthermore, in all the cases we provide efficient algorithms to compute the
corresponding coverings.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Heterogeneity is one important feature of complex systems, leading to the
complexity of their construction and analysis. Moving the heterogeneity at
model level helps in mastering the difficulty of composing heterogeneous models
which constitute a large system. We propose a method made of an algebra and
structure morphisms to deal with the interaction of behavioural models,
provided that they are compatible. We prove that heterogeneous models can
interact in a safe way, and therefore complex heterogeneous systems can be
built and analysed incrementally. The Uppaal tool is targeted for
experimentations.

 <dc:title>Retinal Microaneurysms Detection using Local Convergence Index Features</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Retinal microaneurysms are the earliest clinical sign of diabetic retinopathy
disease. Detection of microaneurysms is crucial for the early diagnosis of
diabetic retinopathy and prevention of blindness. In this paper, a novel and
reliable method for automatic detection of microaneurysms in retinal images is
proposed. In the first stage of the proposed method, several preliminary
microaneurysm candidates are extracted using a gradient weighting technique and
an iterative thresholding approach. In the next stage, in addition to intensity
and shape descriptors, a new set of features based on local convergence index
filters is extracted for each candidate. Finally, the collective set of
features is fed to a hybrid sampling/boosting classifier to discriminate the
MAs from non-MAs candidates. The method is evaluated on images with different
resolutions and modalities (RGB and SLO) using five publicly available datasets
including the Retinopathy Online Challenge's dataset. The proposed method
achieves an average sensitivity score of 0.471 on the ROC dataset outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in an extensive comparison. The experimental
results on the other four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed microaneurysms detection method regardless of different image
resolutions and modalities.

 <dc:title>Fast Nearest Neighbor Preserving Embeddings</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sivertsen, Johan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show an analog to the Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform for Nearest
Neighbor Preserving Embeddings in $\ell_2$. These are sparse, randomized
embeddings that preserve the (approximate) nearest neighbors. The
dimensionality of the embedding space is bounded not by the size of the
embedded set n, but by its doubling dimension {\lambda}. For most large
real-world datasets this will mean a considerably lower-dimensional embedding
space than possible when preserving all distances. The resulting embeddings can
be used with existing approximate nearest neighbor data structures to yield
speed improvements.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a way of synthesizing realistic images directly
with natural language description, which has many useful applications, e.g.
intelligent image manipulation. We attempt to accomplish such synthesis: given
a source image and a target text description, our model synthesizes images to
meet two requirements: 1) being realistic while matching the target text
description; 2) maintaining other image features that are irrelevant to the
text description. The model should be able to disentangle the semantic
information from the two modalities (image and text), and generate new images
from the combined semantics. To achieve this, we proposed an end-to-end neural
architecture that leverages adversarial learning to automatically learn
implicit loss functions, which are optimized to fulfill the aforementioned two
requirements. We have evaluated our model by conducting experiments on
Caltech-200 bird dataset and Oxford-102 flower dataset, and have demonstrated
that our model is capable of synthesizing realistic images that match the given
descriptions, while still maintain other features of original images.

 <dc:description>  The majority of NLG evaluation relies on automatic metrics, such as BLEU . In
this paper, we motivate the need for novel, system- and data-independent
automatic evaluation methods: We investigate a wide range of metrics, including
state-of-the-art word-based and novel grammar-based ones, and demonstrate that
they only weakly reflect human judgements of system outputs as generated by
data-driven, end-to-end NLG. We also show that metric performance is data- and
system-specific. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that automatic metrics
perform reliably at system-level and can support system development by finding
cases where a system performs poorly.

 <dc:description>  Interpretability of a predictive model is a powerful feature that gains the
trust of users in the correctness of the predictions. In word sense
disambiguation (WSD), knowledge-based systems tend to be much more
interpretable than knowledge-free counterparts as they rely on the wealth of
manually-encoded elements representing word senses, such as hypernyms, usage
examples, and images. We present a WSD system that bridges the gap between
these two so far disconnected groups of methods. Namely, our system, providing
access to several state-of-the-art WSD models, aims to be interpretable as a
knowledge-based system while it remains completely unsupervised and
knowledge-free. The presented tool features a Web interface for all-word
disambiguation of texts that makes the sense predictions human readable by
providing interpretable word sense inventories, sense representations, and
disambiguation results. We provide a public API, enabling seamless integration.

 <dc:description>  This study deals with semantic segmentation of high-resolution (aerial)
images where a semantic class label is assigned to each pixel via supervised
classification as a basis for automatic map generation. Recently, deep
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance and have
quickly become the de-facto standard for semantic segmentation, with the added
benefit that task-specific feature design is no longer necessary. However, a
major downside of deep learning methods is that they are extremely data-hungry,
thus aggravating the perennial bottleneck of supervised classification, to
obtain enough annotated training data. On the other hand, it has been observed
that they are rather robust against noise in the training labels. This opens up
the intriguing possibility to avoid annotating huge amounts of training data,
and instead train the classifier from existing legacy data or crowd-sourced
maps which can exhibit high levels of noise. The question addressed in this
paper is: can training with large-scale, publicly available labels replace a
substantial part of the manual labeling effort and still achieve sufficient
performance? Such data will inevitably contain a significant portion of errors,
but in return virtually unlimited quantities of it are available in larger
parts of the world. We adapt a state-of-the-art CNN architecture for semantic
segmentation of buildings and roads in aerial images, and compare its
performance when using different training data sets, ranging from manually
labeled, pixel-accurate ground truth of the same city to automatic training
data derived from OpenStreetMap data from distant locations. We report our
results that indicate that satisfying performance can be obtained with
significantly less manual annotation effort, by exploiting noisy large-scale
training data.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces SGNMT, our experimental platform for machine
translation research. SGNMT provides a generic interface to neural and symbolic
scoring modules (predictors) with left-to-right semantic such as translation
models like NMT, language models, translation lattices, $n$-best lists or other
kinds of scores and constraints. Predictors can be combined with other
predictors to form complex decoding tasks. SGNMT implements a number of search
strategies for traversing the space spanned by the predictors which are
appropriate for different predictor constellations. Adding new predictors or
decoding strategies is particularly easy, making it a very efficient tool for
prototyping new research ideas. SGNMT is actively being used by students in the
MPhil program in Machine Learning, Speech and Language Technology at the
University of Cambridge for course work and theses, as well as for most of the
research work in our group.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value
distribution: the distribution of the random return received by a reinforcement
learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement
learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there
is an established body of literature studying the value distribution, thus far
it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware
behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and
control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the
latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm
which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value
distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the
Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and
anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in
approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and
empirical evidence to highlight the ways in which the value distribution
impacts learning in the approximate setting.

 <dc:description>  In order to make Internet connections ubiquitous and autonomous in our daily
lives, maximizing the utilization of radio resources and social information is
one of the major research topics in future mobile communication technologies.
Fog radio access network (FRAN) is regarded as a promising paradigm for the
fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks. FRAN integrates fog computing with
RAN and makes full use of the edge of networks. FRAN would be different in
networking, computing, storage and control as compared with conventional radio
access networks (RAN) and the emerging cloud RAN. In this article, we provide a
description of the FRAN architecture, and discuss how the distinctive
characteristics of FRAN make it possible to efficiently alleviate the burden on
the fronthaul, backhaul and backbone networks, as well as reduce content
delivery latencies. We will focus on the mobility management, interference
mitigation, and resource optimization in FRAN. Our simulation results show that
the proposed FRAN architecture and the associated mobility and resource
management mechanisms can reduce the signaling cost and increase the net
utility for the RAN.

 <dc:description>  Automated planning remains one of the most general paradigms in Artificial
Intelligence, providing means of solving problems coming from a wide variety of
domains. One of the key factors restricting the applicability of planning is
its computational complexity resulting from exponentially large search spaces.
Heuristic approaches are necessary to solve all but the simplest problems. In
this work, we explore the possibility of obtaining domain-independent heuristic
functions using machine learning. This is a part of a wider research program
whose objective is to improve practical applicability of planning in systems
for which the planning domains evolve at run time. The challenge is therefore
the learning of (corrections of) domain-independent heuristics that can be
reused across different planning domains.

 <dc:description>  Community network (CN) initiatives have been around for roughly two decades,
evangelizing a distinctly different paradigm for building, maintaining, and
sharing network infrastructure but also defending the basic human right to
Internet access. Over this time they have evolved into a mosaic of systems that
vary widely with respect to their network technologies, their offered services,
their organizational structure, and the way they position themselves in the
overall telecommunications' ecosystem. Common to all these highly
differentiated initiatives is the sustainability challenge. We approach
sustainability as a broad term with an economical, political, and cultural
context. We first review the different perceptions of the term. These vary both
across and within the different types of stakeholders involved in CNs and are
reflected in their motivation to join such initiatives. Then, we study the
diverse ways that CN operators pursue the sustainability goal. Depending on the
actual context of the term, these range all the way from mechanisms to fund
their activities and synergistic approaches with commercial service providers,
to organizational structures and social activities that serve as incentives to
maximize the engagement of their members. Finally, we iterate and discuss
theoretical concepts of incentive mechanisms that have been proposed in the
literature for these networks as well as implemented tools and processes
designed to set the ground for CN participation. While, theoretical mechanisms
leverage game theory, reputation frameworks, and social mechanisms, implemented
mechanisms focus on organizational matters, education and services, all aiming
to motivate the active and sustained participation of users and other actors in
the CN.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of detecting a random walk on a graph, based on
observations of the graph nodes. When visited by the walk, each node of the
graph observes a signal of elevated mean, which we assume can be different
across different nodes. Outside of the path of the walk, and also in its
absence, nodes measure only noise. Assuming the Neyman-Pearson setting, our
goal then is to characterize detection performance by computing the error
exponent for the probability of a miss, under a constraint on the probability
of false alarm. Since exact computation of the error exponent is known to be
difficult, equivalent to computation of the Lyapunov exponent, we approximate
its value by finding a tractable lower bound. The bound reveals an interesting
detectability condition: the walk is detectable whenever the entropy of the
walk is smaller than one half of the expected signal-to-noise ratio. We derive
the bound by extending the notion of Markov types to Gauss-Markov types -
sequences of state-observation pairs with a given number of node-to-node
transition counts and the nodes` local sample means. The lower bound has an
intuitive interpretation: among all Gauss-Markov types that are asymptotically
feasible in the absence of the walk, the bound finds the most typical one under
the presence of the walk. Finally, we show by a sequence of judicious problem
reformulations that computing the bound reduces to solving a convex
optimization problem, which is a result in its own right.

 <dc:description>  Bhat et al. developed an inductive compiler that computes density functions
for probability spaces described by programs in a simple probabilistic
functional language. In this work, we implement such a compiler for a modified
version of this language within the theorem prover Isabelle and give a formal
proof of its soundness w.r.t. the semantics of the source and target language.
Together with Isabelle's code generation for inductive predicates, this yields
a fully verified, executable density compiler. The proof is done in two steps,
using a standard refinement approach: first, an abstract compiler working with
abstract functions modelled directly in the theorem prover's logic is defined
and proven sound. Then, this compiler is refined to a concrete version that
returns a target-language expression.

 <dc:title>A New Family of Near-metrics for Universal Similarity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a family of near-metrics based on local graph diffusion to capture
similarity for a wide class of data sets. These quasi-metametrics, as their
names suggest, dispense with one or two standard axioms of metric spaces,
specifically distinguishability and symmetry, so that similarity between data
points of arbitrary type and form could be measured broadly and effectively.
The proposed near-metric family includes the forward k-step diffusion and its
reverse, typically on the graph consisting of data objects and their features.
By construction, this family of near-metrics is particularly appropriate for
categorical data, continuous data, and vector representations of images and
text extracted via deep learning approaches. We conduct extensive experiments
to evaluate the performance of this family of similarity measures and compare
and contrast with traditional measures of similarity used for each specific
application and with the ground truth when available. We show that for
structured data including categorical and continuous data, the near-metrics
corresponding to normalized forward k-step diffusion (k small) work as one of
the best performing similarity measures; for vector representations of text and
images including those extracted from deep learning, the near-metrics derived
from normalized and reverse k-step graph diffusion (k very small) exhibit
outstanding ability to distinguish data points from different classes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a multi-modal search engine for interior design
that combines visual and textual queries. The goal of our engine is to retrieve
interior objects, e.g. furniture or wall clocks, that share visual and
aesthetic similarities with the query. Our search engine allows the user to
take a photo of a room and retrieve with a high recall a list of items
identical or visually similar to those present in the photo. Additionally, it
allows to return other items that aesthetically and stylistically fit well
together. To achieve this goal, our system blends the results obtained using
textual and visual modalities. Thanks to this blending strategy, we increase
the average style similarity score of the retrieved items by 11%. Our work is
implemented as a Web-based application and it is planned to be opened to the
public.

 <dc:title>Redundant Logic Insertion and Fault Tolerance Improvement in

 <dc:creator>Balasubramanian, P</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel method to identify and insert redundant logic
into a combinational circuit to improve its fault tolerance without having to
replicate the entire circuit as is the case with conventional redundancy
techniques. In this context, it is discussed how to estimate the fault masking
capability of a combinational circuit using the truth-cum-fault enumeration
table, and then it is shown how to identify the logic that can introduced to
add redundancy into the original circuit without affecting its native
functionality and with the aim of improving its fault tolerance though this
would involve some trade-off in the design metrics. However, care should be
taken while introducing redundant logic since redundant logic insertion may
give rise to new internal nodes and faults on those may impact the fault
tolerance of the resulting circuit. The combinational circuit that is
considered and its redundant counterparts are all implemented in semi-custom
design style using a 32/28nm CMOS digital cell library and their respective
design metrics and fault tolerances are compared.

 <dc:description>  Cross-technology communication (CTC) was proposed in recent literature as a
way to exploit the opportunities of collaboration between heterogeneous
wireless technologies. This paper presents LtFi, a system which enables to
set-up a CTC between nodes of co-located LTE-U and WiFi networks. LtFi follows
a two-step approach: using the air-interface LTE-U BSs are broadcasting
connection and identification data to adjacent WiFi nodes, which is used to
create a bi-directional control channel over the wired Internet. This way LtFi
enables the development of advanced cross-technology interference and radio
resource management schemes between heterogeneous WiFi and LTE-U networks.
  LtFi is of low complexity and fully compliant with LTE-U technology and works
on WiFi side with COTS hardware. It was prototypically implemented and
evaluated. Experimental results reveal that LtFi is able to reliably decoded
the data transmitted over the LtFi air-interface in a crowded wireless
environment at even very low LTE-U receive power levels of -92dBm. Moreover,
results from system-level simulations show that LtFi is able to accurately
estimate the set of interfering LTE-U BSs in a typical LTE-U multi-cell
environment.

 <dc:description>  In nanoelectronic circuit synthesis, the majority gate and the inverter form
the basic combinational logic primitives. This paper deduces the mathematical
formulae to estimate the logical masking capability of majority gates, which
are used extensively in nanoelectronic digital circuit synthesis. The
mathematical formulae derived to evaluate the logical masking capability of
majority gates holds well for minority gates, and a comparison with the logical
masking capability of conventional gates such as NOT, AND/NAND, OR/NOR, and
XOR/XNOR is provided. It is inferred from this research work that the logical
masking capability of majority/minority gates is similar to that of XOR/XNOR
gates, and with an increase of fan-in the logical masking capability of
majority/minority gates also increases.

 <dc:description>  We present insights and empirical results from an extensive numerical study
of the evolutionary dynamics of the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Fixation
probabilities for Moran processes are obtained for all pairs of 164 different
strategies including classics such as TitForTat, zero determinant strategies,
and many more sophisticated strategies. Players with long memories and
sophisticated behaviours outperform many strategies that perform well in a two
player setting. Moreover we introduce several strategies trained with
evolutionary algorithms to excel at the Moran process. These strategies are
excellent invaders and resistors of invasion and in some cases naturally evolve
handshaking mechanisms to resist invasion. The best invaders were those trained
to maximize total payoff while the best resistors invoke handshake mechanisms.
This suggests that while maximizing individual payoff can lead to the evolution
of cooperation through invasion, the relatively weak invasion resistance of
payoff maximizing strategies are not as evolutionarily stable as strategies
employing handshake mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Image understanding using deep convolutional network has reached human-level
performance, yet a closely related problem of video understanding especially,
action recognition has not reached the requisite level of maturity. We combine
multi-kernels based support-vector-machines (SVM) with a multi-stream deep
convolutional neural network to achieve close to state-of-the-art performance
on a 51-class activity recognition problem (HMDB-51 dataset); this specific
dataset has proved to be particularly challenging for deep neural networks due
to the heterogeneity in camera viewpoints, video quality, etc. The resulting
architecture is named pillar networks as each (very) deep neural network acts
as a pillar for the hierarchical classifiers. In addition, we illustrate that
hand-crafted features such as improved dense trajectories (iDT) and Multi-skip
Feature Stacking (MIFS), as additional pillars, can further supplement the
performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on online reviews and employ artificial intelligence
tools, taken from the cognitive computing field, to help understanding the
relationships between the textual part of the review and the assigned numerical
score. We move from the intuitions that 1) a set of textual reviews expressing
different sentiments may feature the same score (and vice-versa); and 2)
detecting and analyzing the mismatches between the review content and the
actual score may benefit both service providers and consumers, by highlighting
specific factors of satisfaction (and dissatisfaction) in texts.
  To prove the intuitions, we adopt sentiment analysis techniques and we
concentrate on hotel reviews, to find polarity mismatches therein. In
particular, we first train a text classifier with a set of annotated hotel
reviews, taken from the Booking website. Then, we analyze a large dataset, with
around 160k hotel reviews collected from Tripadvisor, with the aim of detecting
a polarity mismatch, indicating if the textual content of the review is in
line, or not, with the associated score.
  Using well established artificial intelligence techniques and analyzing in
depth the reviews featuring a mismatch between the text polarity and the score,
we find that -on a scale of five stars- those reviews ranked with middle scores
include a mixture of positive and negative aspects.
  The approach proposed here, beside acting as a polarity detector, provides an
effective selection of reviews -on an initial very large dataset- that may
allow both consumers and providers to focus directly on the review subset
featuring a text/score disagreement, which conveniently convey to the user a
summary of positive and negative features of the review target.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the rational synthesis problem for concurrent
game structure for a variety of objectives ranging from reachability to Muller
condition. We propose a new algorithm that establishes the decidability of the
non cooperative rational synthesis problem that relies solely on game theoretic
technique as opposed to previous approaches that are logic based. Thanks to
this approach, we construct a zero-sum turn-based game that can be adapted to
each one of the afore mentioned objectives thus obtain new complexity results.
In particular, we show that reachability, safety, B\&quot;uchi, and co-B\&quot;uchi
conditions are PSpace-complete, Parity, Muller, Street, and Rabin are
PSpace-hard and in ExpTime.

and evaluating data is surprisingly absent from the research data discussion.
This review explores the data retrieval literature to identify commonalities in
how users search for and evaluate observational research data. Two analytical
frameworks rooted in information retrieval and science technology studies are
used to identify key similarities in practices as a first step toward
developing a model describing data retrieval.

 <dc:description>  Creative tasks such as ideation or question proposal are powerful
applications of crowdsourcing, yet the quantity of workers available for
addressing practical problems is often insufficient. To enable scalable
crowdsourcing thus requires gaining all possible efficiency and information
from available workers. One option for text-focused tasks is to allow assistive
technology, such as an autocompletion user interface (AUI), to help workers
input text responses. But support for the efficacy of AUIs is mixed. Here we
designed and conducted a randomized experiment where workers were asked to
provide short text responses to given questions. Our experimental goal was to
determine if an AUI helps workers respond more quickly and with improved
consistency by mitigating typos and misspellings. Surprisingly, we found that
neither occurred: workers assigned to the AUI treatment were slower than those
assigned to the non-AUI control and their responses were more diverse, not
less, than those of the control. Both the lexical and semantic diversities of
responses were higher, with the latter measured using word2vec. A crowdsourcer
interested in worker speed may want to avoid using an AUI, but using an AUI to
boost response diversity may be valuable to crowdsourcers interested in
receiving as much novel information from workers as possible.

 <dc:title>Securing Visible Light Communication Systems by Beamforming in the

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers secrecy enhancement mechanisms in visible light
communication (VLC) systems with spatially distributed passive eavesdroppers
(EDs) under the assumption that there are multiple LED transmitters and one
legitimate receiver (UE). Based on certain amplitude constraints, we propose an
optimal beamforming scheme to optimize secrecy performance. Contrary to the
case where null-steering is made possible by using knowledge of the ED
locations, we show that the optimal solution when only statistical information
about ED locations is available directs the transmission along a particular
eigenmode related to the intensity of the ED process and the intended channel.
Then, a sub-optimal LED selection scheme is provided to reduce the secrecy
outage probability (SOP). An approximate closed-form for the SOP is derived by
using secrecy capacity bounds. All analysis is numerically verified by Monte
Carlo simulations. The analysis shows that the optimal beamformer yields
superior performance to LED selection. However, LED selection is still a highly
efficient suboptimal scheme due to the complexity associated with the use of
multiple transmitters in the full beamforming approach. These performance
trends and exact relations between system parameters can be used to develop a
secure VLC system in the presence of randomly distributed EDs.

 <dc:description>  Existing approaches to automatic VerbNet-style verb classification are
heavily dependent on feature engineering and therefore limited to languages
with mature NLP pipelines. In this work, we propose a novel cross-lingual
transfer method for inducing VerbNets for multiple languages. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study which demonstrates how the architectures
for learning word embeddings can be applied to this challenging
syntactic-semantic task. Our method uses cross-lingual translation pairs to tie
each of the six target languages into a bilingual vector space with English,
jointly specialising the representations to encode the relational information
from English VerbNet. A standard clustering algorithm is then run on top of the
VerbNet-specialised representations, using vector dimensions as features for
learning verb classes. Our results show that the proposed cross-lingual
transfer approach sets new state-of-the-art verb classification performance
across all six target languages explored in this work.

 <dc:description>  Pre-trained word embeddings improve the performance of a neural model at the
cost of increasing the model size. We propose to benefit from this resource
without paying the cost by operating strictly at the sub-lexical level. Our
approach is quite simple: before task-specific training, we first optimize
sub-word parameters to reconstruct pre-trained word embeddings using various
distance measures. We report interesting results on a variety of tasks: word
similarity, word analogy, and part-of-speech tagging.

 <dc:description>  Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established declarative problem
solving paradigm which became widely used in AI and recognized as a powerful
tool for knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR), especially for its high
expressiveness and the ability to deal also with incomplete knowledge.
  Recently, thanks to the availability of a number of robust and efficient
implementations, ASP has been increasingly employed in a number of different
domains, and used for the development of industrial-level and enterprise
applications. This made clear the need for proper development tools and
interoperability mechanisms for easing interaction and integration with
external systems in the widest range of real-world scenarios, including mobile
applications and educational contexts.
  In this work we present a framework for integrating the KRR capabilities of
ASP into generic applications. We show the use of the framework by illustrating
proper specializations for some relevant ASP systems over different platforms,
including the mobile setting; furthermore, the potential of the framework for
educational purposes is illustrated by means of the development of several
ASP-based applications.

 <dc:description>  Word embeddings improve generalization over lexical features by placing each
word in a lower-dimensional space, using distributional information obtained
from unlabeled data. However, the effectiveness of word embeddings for
downstream NLP tasks is limited by out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, for which
embeddings do not exist. In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to
generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from
spellings to distributional embeddings. Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not
require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning is
performed at the type level. Intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations demonstrate
the power of this simple approach. On 23 languages, MIMICK improves performance
over a word-based baseline for tagging part-of-speech and morphosyntactic
attributes. It is competitive with (and complementary to) a supervised
character-based model in low-resource settings.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel denoising framework for task functional Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (tfMRI) data to delineate the high-resolution spatial pattern of the
brain functional connectivity via dictionary learning and sparse coding (DLSC).
In order to address the limitations of the unsupervised DLSC-based fMRI
studies, we utilize the prior knowledge of task paradigm in the learning step
to train a data-driven dictionary and to model the sparse representation. We
apply the proposed DLSC-based method to Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor
tfMRI dataset. Studies on the functional connectivity of cerebrocerebellar
circuits in somatomotor networks show that the DLSC-based denoising framework
can significantly improve the prominent connectivity patterns, in comparison to
the temporal non-local means (tNLM)-based denoising method as well as the case
without denoising, which is consistent and neuroscientifically meaningful
within motor area. The promising results show that the proposed method can
provide an important foundation for the high-resolution functional connectivity
analysis, and provide a better approach for fMRI preprocessing.

 <dc:description>  Control systems are an integral part of almost every engineering and physical
system and thus their accurate analysis is of utmost importance. Traditionally,
control systems are analyzed using paper-and-pencil proof and computer
simulation methods, however, both of these methods cannot provide accurate
analysis due to their inherent limitations. Model checking has been widely used
to analyze control systems but the continuous nature of their environment and
physical components cannot be truly captured by a state-transition system in
this technique. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use
higher-order-logic theorem proving for analyzing linear control systems based
on a formalized theory of the Laplace transform method. For this purpose, we
have formalized the foundations of linear control system analysis in
higher-order logic so that a linear control system can be readily modeled and
analyzed. The paper presents a new formalization of the Laplace transform and
the formal verification of its properties that are frequently used in the
transfer function based analysis to judge the frequency response, gain margin
and phase margin, and stability of a linear control system. We also formalize
the active realizations of various controllers, like
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), Proportional-Integral (PI),
Proportional-Derivative (PD), and various active and passive compensators, like
lead, lag and lag-lead. For illustration, we present a formal analysis of an
unmanned free-swimming submersible vehicle using the HOL Light theorem prover.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new sentence simplification task (Split-and-Rephrase) where the
aim is to split a complex sentence into a meaning preserving sequence of
shorter sentences. Like sentence simplification, splitting-and-rephrasing has
the potential of benefiting both natural language processing and societal
applications. Because shorter sentences are generally better processed by NLP
systems, it could be used as a preprocessing step which facilitates and
improves the performance of parsers, semantic role labellers and machine
translation systems. It should also be of use for people with reading
disabilities because it allows the conversion of longer sentences into shorter
ones. This paper makes two contributions towards this new task. First, we
create and make available a benchmark consisting of 1,066,115 tuples mapping a
single complex sentence to a sequence of sentences expressing the same meaning.
Second, we propose five models (vanilla sequence-to-sequence to
semantically-motivated models) to understand the difficulty of the proposed
task.

 <dc:description>  Energy harvesting emerges as a potential solution for prolonging the lifetime
of the energy-constrained mobile wireless devices. In this paper, we focus on
Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting for multiuser multicarrier mobile
wireless networks. Specifically, we propose joint data and energy transfer
optimization frameworks for powering mobile wireless devices through RF energy
harvesting. We introduce a power utility that captures the power consumption
cost at the base station (BS) and the used power from the users' batteries, and
determine optimal power resource allocations that meet data rate requirements
of downlink and uplink communications. Two types of harvesting capabilities are
considered at each user: harvesting only from dedicated RF signals and hybrid
harvesting from both dedicated and ambient RF signals. The developed frameworks
increase the end users' battery lifetime at the cost of a slight increase in
the BS power consumption. Several evaluation studies are conducted in order to
validate our proposed frameworks.

 <dc:description>  Internet has become a foundation of our modern society. However, all regions
or countries do not have the same Internet access regarding quality especially
in the Indian Ocean Area (IOA). To improve this quality it is important to have
a deep knowledge of the Internet physical and logical topology and associated
performance. However, these knowledges are not shared by Internet service
providers. In this paper, we describe a large scale measurement study in which
we deploy probes in different IOA countries, we generate network traces,
develop a tool to extract useful information and analyze these information. We
show that most of the IOA traffic exits through one point even if there exists
multiple exit points.

 <dc:description>  In ontology-based data access (OBDA), users are provided with a conceptual
view of a (relational) data source that abstracts away details about data
storage. This conceptual view is realized through an ontology that is connected
to the data source through declarative mappings, and query answering is carried
out by translating the user queries over the conceptual view into SQL queries
over the data source. Standard translation techniques in OBDA try to transform
the user query into a union of conjunctive queries (UCQ), following the
heuristic argument that UCQs can be efficiently evaluated by modern relational
database engines. In this work, we show that translating to UCQs is not always
the best choice, and that, under certain conditions on the interplay between
the ontology, the map- pings, and the statistics of the data, alternative
translations can be evaluated much more efficiently. To find the best
translation, we devise a cost model together with a novel cardinality
estimation that takes into account all such OBDA components. Our experiments
confirm that (i) alternatives to the UCQ translation might produce queries that
are orders of magnitude more efficient, and (ii) the cost model we propose is
faithful to the actual query evaluation cost, and hence is well suited to
select the best translation.

 <dc:description>  Screening mammography is an important front-line tool for the early detection
of breast cancer, and some 39 million exams are conducted each year in the
United States alone. Here, we describe a multi-scale convolutional neural
network (CNN) trained with a curriculum learning strategy that achieves high
levels of accuracy in classifying mammograms. Specifically, we first train
CNN-based patch classifiers on segmentation masks of lesions in mammograms, and
then use the learned features to initialize a scanning-based model that renders
a decision on the whole image, trained end-to-end on outcome data. We
demonstrate that our approach effectively handles the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot;
nature of full-image mammogram classification, achieving 0.92 AUROC on the DDSM
dataset.

 <dc:description>  Gait recognition is an important biometric technique for video surveillance
tasks, due to the advantage of using it at distance. In this paper, we present
a persistent homology-based method to extract topological features (the
so-called {\it topological gait signature}) from the the body silhouettes of a
gait sequence. % It has been used before in several conference papers of the
same authors for human identification, gender classification, carried object
detection and monitoring human activities at distance. % The novelty of this
paper is the study of the stability of the topological gait signature under
small perturbations and the number of gait cycles contained in a gait sequence.
In other words, we show that the topological gait signature is robust to the
presence of noise in the body silhouettes and to the number of gait cycles
contained in a given gait sequence. % We also show that computing our
topological gait signature of only the lowest fourth part of the body
silhouette, we avoid the upper body movements that are unrelated to the natural
dynamic of the gait, caused for example by carrying a bag or wearing a coat.

 <dc:description>  Besides enabling an enhanced mobile broadband, next generation of mobile
networks (5G) are envisioned for the support of massive connectivity of
heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT)s. These IoTs are envisioned for a large
number of use-cases including smart cities, environment monitoring, smart
vehicles, etc. Unfortunately, most IoTs have very limited computing and storage
capabilities and need cloud services. Hence, connecting these devices through
5G systems requires huge spectrum resources in addition to handling the massive
connectivity and improved security. This article discusses the challenges
facing the support of IoTs through 5G systems. The focus is devoted to
discussing physical layer limitations in terms of spectrum resources and radio
access channel connectivity. We show how sparsity can be exploited for
addressing these challenges especially in terms of enabling wideband spectrum
management and handling the connectivity by exploiting device-to-device
communications and edge-cloud. Moreover, we identify major open problems and
research directions that need to be explored towards enabling the support of
massive heterogeneous IoTs through 5G systems.

 <dc:description>  We present a hybrid control framework for solving a motion planning problem
among a collection of heterogenous agents. The proposed approach utilizes a
finite set of low-level motion primitives, each based on a piecewise affine
feedback control, to generate complex motions in a gridded workspace. The
constraints on allowable sequences of successive motion primitives are
formalized through a maneuver automaton. At the higher level, a control policy
generated by a shortest path non-deterministic algorithm determines which
motion primitive is executed in each box of the gridded workspace. The overall
framework yields a highly robust control design on both the low and high
levels. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of this
framework for multiple quadrocopters maneuvering in a 2D or 3D workspace.

 <dc:description>  The DenseNet architecture is highly computationally efficient as a result of
feature reuse. However, a naive DenseNet implementation can require a
significant amount of GPU memory: If not properly managed, pre-activation batch
normalization and contiguous convolution operations can produce feature maps
that grow quadratically with network depth. In this technical report, we
introduce strategies to reduce the memory consumption of DenseNets during
training. By strategically using shared memory allocations, we reduce the
memory cost for storing feature maps from quadratic to linear. Without the GPU
memory bottleneck, it is now possible to train extremely deep DenseNets.
Networks with 14M parameters can be trained on a single GPU, up from 4M. A
264-layer DenseNet (73M parameters), which previously would have been
infeasible to train, can now be trained on a single workstation with 8 NVIDIA
Tesla M40 GPUs. On the ImageNet ILSVRC classification dataset, this large
DenseNet obtains a state-of-the-art single-crop top-1 error of 20.26%.

 <dc:title>Ideological Sublations: Resolution of Dialectic in Population-based

 <dc:description>  A population-based optimization algorithm was designed, inspired by two main
thinking modes in philosophy, both based on dialectic concept and
thesis-antithesis paradigm. They impose two different kinds of dialectics.
Idealistic and materialistic antitheses are formulated as optimization models.
Based on the models, the population is coordinated for dialectical
interactions. At the population-based context, the formulated optimization
models are reduced to a simple detection problem for each thinker (particle).
According to the assigned thinking mode to each thinker and her/his
measurements of corresponding dialectic with other candidate particles, they
deterministically decide to interact with a thinker in maximum dialectic with
their theses. The position of a thinker at maximum dialectic is known as an
available antithesis among the existing solutions. The dialectical interactions
at each ideological community are distinguished by meaningful distributions of
step-sizes for each thinking mode. In fact, the thinking modes are regarded as
exploration and exploitation elements of the proposed algorithm. The result is
a delicate balance without any requirement for adjustment of step-size
coefficients. Main parameter of the proposed algorithm is the number of
particles appointed to each thinking modes, or equivalently for each kind of
motions. An additional integer parameter is defined to boost the stability of
the final algorithm in some particular problems. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated by a testbed of 12 single-objective continuous benchmark functions.
Moreover, its performance and speed were highlighted in sparse reconstruction
and antenna selection problems, at the context of compressed sensing and
massive MIMO, respectively. The results indicate fast and efficient performance
in comparison with well-known evolutionary algorithms and dedicated
state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Emotions are physiological states generated in humans in reaction to internal
or external events. They are complex and studied across numerous fields
including computer science. As humans, on reading &quot;Why don't you ever text me!&quot;
we can either interpret it as a sad or angry emotion and the same ambiguity
exists for machines. Lack of facial expressions and voice modulations make
detecting emotions from text a challenging problem. However, as humans
increasingly communicate using text messaging applications, and digital agents
gain popularity in our society, it is essential that these digital agents are
emotion aware, and respond accordingly. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to detect emotions like happy, sad or angry in textual conversations
using an LSTM based Deep Learning model. Our approach consists of
semi-automated techniques to gather training data for our model. We exploit
advantages of semantic and sentiment based embeddings and propose a solution
combining both. Our work is evaluated on real world conversations and
significantly outperforms traditional Machine Learning baselines as well as
other off-the-shelf Deep Learning models.

 <dc:title>Machine Learning for Structured Clinical Data</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Beaulieu-Jones, Brett K.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Research is a tertiary priority in the EHR, where the priorities are patient
care and billing. Because of this, the data is not standardized or formatted in
a manner easily adapted to machine learning approaches. Data may be missing for
a large variety of reasons ranging from individual input styles to differences
in clinical decision making, for example, which lab tests to issue. Few
patients are annotated at a research quality, limiting sample size and
presenting a moving gold standard. Patient progression over time is key to
understanding many diseases but many machine learning algorithms require a
snapshot, at a single time point, to create a usable vector form. Furthermore,
algorithms that produce black box results do not provide the interpretability
required for clinical adoption. This chapter discusses these challenges and
others in applying machine learning techniques to the structured EHR (i.e.
Patient Demographics, Family History, Medication Information, Vital Signs,
Laboratory Tests, Genetic Testing). It does not cover feature extraction from
additional sources such as imaging data or free text patient notes but the
approaches discussed can include features extracted from these sources.

 <dc:description>  Developing neural network image classification models often requires
significant architecture engineering. In this paper, we attempt to automate
this engineering process by learning the model architectures directly on the
dataset of interest. As this approach is expensive when the dataset is large,
we propose to search for an architectural building block on a small dataset and
then transfer the block to a larger dataset. Our key contribution is the design
of a new search space which enables transferability. In our experiments, we
search for the best convolutional layer (or &quot;cell&quot;) on the CIFAR-10 dataset and
then apply this cell to the ImageNet dataset by stacking together more copies
of this cell, each with their own parameters. Although the cell is not searched
for directly on ImageNet, an architecture constructed from the best cell
achieves, among the published works, state-of-the-art accuracy of 82.7% top-1
and 96.2% top-5 on ImageNet. Our model is 1.2% better in top-1 accuracy than
the best human-invented architectures while having 9 billion fewer FLOPS -- a
reduction of 28% in computational demand from the previous state-of-the-art
model. When evaluated at different levels of computational cost, accuracies of
our models exceed those of the state-of-the-art human-designed models. For
instance, a smaller network constructed from the best cell also achieves 74%
top-1 accuracy, which is 3.1% better than equivalently-sized, state-of-the-art
models for mobile platforms. On CIFAR-10, an architecture constructed from the
best cell achieves 2.4% error rate, which is also state-of-the-art. Finally,
the image features learned from image classification can also be transferred to
other computer vision problems. On the task of object detection, the learned
features used with the Faster-RCNN framework surpass state-of-the-art by 4.0%
achieving 43.1% mAP on the COCO dataset.

simply need a better way to estimate confidence? In this paper we consider the
problem of accurately estimating predictive confidence. We formulate this
problem as that of density modelling, and show how traditional methods such as
softmax produce poor estimates. To address this issue, we propose a novel
confidence measure based on density modelling approaches. We test these
measures on images distorted by blur, JPEG compression, random noise and
adversarial noise. Experiments show that our confidence measure consistently
shows reduced confidence scores in the presence of such distortions - a
property which softmax often lacks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose novel channel-hoppingbased distributed rendezvous
algorithm based on grid-basedquorum techniques. The proposed algorithm
increases the probability of rendezvous (RDV) within a single cycle by allowing
CR nodes to meet more often according to intersection property of quorum
systems (QSs). Our proposed algorithm is called Adaptive quorum-based
channel-hopping distributed coordination scheme for cognitive radio networks.
The main idea of our algorithm is to dynamically adjust the selected QS by CR
users according to the varying traffic loads in the CRN. The proposed algorithm
decreases the average time to rendezvous (TTR) and increase the probability of
RDV. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm through simulations. The
performance of our algorithm is compared with two different schemes. The
results show that our algorithm can reduce TTR, increase the RDV, and decrease
the energy consumption per successful RDV.

 <dc:title>Coverage in Downlink Heterogeneous mmWave Cellular Networks with

 <dc:description>  A K-tier heterogeneous downlink millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular network
with user-centric small cell deployments is studied in this paper. In
particular, we consider a heterogeneous network model with user equipments
(UEs) being distributed according to a Poisson Cluster Process (PCP).
Specifically, we address two cluster processes, namely (i) Thomas cluster
process, where the UEs are clustered around the base stations (BSs) and the
distances between UEs and the BS are modeled as Gaussian distributed, and (ii)
Matern cluster process, where the UEs are scattered according to a uniform
distribution. In addition, distinguishing features of mmWave communications
including directional beamforming and a sophisticated path loss model
incorporating both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)
transmissions, are taken into account. Initially, the complementary cumulative
distribution function (CCDF) and probability density function (PDF) of path
loss are provided. Subsequently, using tools from stochastic geometry, we
derive a general expression for the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) coverage probability. Our results demonstrate that coverage probability
can be improved by decreasing the size of UE clusters around BSs, decreasing
the beamwidth of the main lobe, or increasing the main lobe directivity gain.
Moreover, interference has noticeable influence on the coverage performance of
our model. We also show that better coverage performance is achieved in the
presence of clustered users compared to the case in which the users are
distributed according to a Poisson Point Process (PPP).

 <dc:title>Non-Linear Far Field RF Harvesting in Wireless Communications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alevizos, Panos N.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A linear radio frequency (RF) harvesting model is commonly assumed in recent
simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) research, i.e., RF
harvested power is assumed a scaled version of the input (received) power.
However, rectifiers typically used in the microwave and radio frequency
identification (RFID) industry are non-linear devices; thus, RF harvesting
efficiency is not constant but depends on the input power. This work first
reviews far field RF harvesting and then models RF harvested power as an
arbitrary non-linear, continuous, and non-decreasing function of received
power, taking into account sensitivity and saturation effects. Given such
model, probability density and cumulative distribution functions of the
harvested RF power are offered, based on a piece-wise linear approximation, in
conjunction with accuracy analysis. Three example scenarios are considered,
including duty-cycled (non-continuous), as well as continuous SWIPT, comparing
linear with industry-level non- linear RF harvesting. It is demonstrated that
the proposed methodology, even though simple, offers exact performance for all
studied metrics. On the other hand, linear harvesting modeling results deviate
from reality, and in some cases are off by one order of magnitude. The proposed
modeling and methodology can be utilized in current and future SWIPT research.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the first end-to-end coreference resolution model and show that
it significantly outperforms all previous work without using a syntactic parser
or hand-engineered mention detector. The key idea is to directly consider all
spans in a document as potential mentions and learn distributions over possible
antecedents for each. The model computes span embeddings that combine
context-dependent boundary representations with a head-finding attention
mechanism. It is trained to maximize the marginal likelihood of gold antecedent
spans from coreference clusters and is factored to enable aggressive pruning of
potential mentions. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
a gain of 1.5 F1 on the OntoNotes benchmark and by 3.1 F1 using a 5-model
ensemble, despite the fact that this is the first approach to be successfully
trained with no external resources.

 <dc:description>  With the remarkable growth of the Internet and communication technologies
over the past few decades, Internet of Things (IoTs) is enabling the ubiquitous
connectivity of heterogeneous physical devices with software, sensors, and
actuators. IoT networks are naturally multi-layer with the cloud and cellular
networks coexisting with the underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communications.
The connectivity of IoTs plays an important role in information dissemination
for mission-critical and civilian applications. However, IoT communication
networks are vulnerable to cyber attacks including the denial-of-service (DoS)
and jamming attacks, resulting in link removals in IoT network. Therefore, it
is important to maintain the connectivity of IoT networks and make them secure
and resistant to malicious attacks. In this work, we present a heterogeneous
IoT network design problem in which a network designer can add links to provide
additional communication paths between two nodes or secure links against
failures by investing resources. We characterize the optimal strategy of the
secure network design problem by first providing a lower bound on the number of
links a secure network requires for a given budget of protected links, and then
developing a method to construct networks that satisfy the heterogeneous
network design specifications. Case studies on the Internet of Battlefield
Things (IoBT) are used to corroborate our results.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised single-channel overlapped speech recognition is one of the
hardest problems in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Permutation invariant
training (PIT) is a state of the art model-based approach, which applies a
single neural network to solve this single-input, multiple-output modeling
problem. We propose to advance the current state of the art by imposing a
modular structure on the neural network, applying a progressive pretraining
regimen, and improving the objective function with transfer learning and a
discriminative training criterion. The modular structure splits the problem
into three sub-tasks: frame-wise interpreting, utterance-level speaker tracing,
and speech recognition. The pretraining regimen uses these modules to solve
progressively harder tasks. Transfer learning leverages parallel clean speech
to improve the training targets for the network. Our discriminative training
formulation is a modification of standard formulations, that also penalizes
competing outputs of the system. Experiments are conducted on the artificial
overlapped Switchboard and hub5e-swb dataset. The proposed framework achieves
over 30% relative improvement of WER over both a strong jointly trained system,
PIT for ASR, and a separately optimized system, PIT for speech separation with
clean speech ASR model. The improvement comes from better model generalization,
training efficiency and the sequence level linguistic knowledge integration.

 <dc:description>  Infrastructure networks are vulnerable to both cyber and physical attacks.
Building a secure and resilient networked system is essential for providing
reliable and dependable services. To this end, we establish a two-player
three-stage game framework to capture the dynamics in the infrastructure
protection and recovery phases. Specifically, the goal of the infrastructure
network designer is to keep the network connected before and after the attack,
while the adversary aims to disconnect the network by compromising a set of
links. With costs for creating and removing links, the two players aim to
maximize their utilities while minimizing the costs. In this paper, we use the
concept of subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the optimal
strategies of the network defender and attacker. We derive the SPE explicitly
in terms of system parameters. Finally, we use a case study of UAV-enabled
communication networks for disaster recovery to corroborate the obtained
analytical results.

 <dc:description>  The bilinear assignment problem (BAP) is a generalization of the well-known
quadratic assignment problem (QAP). In this paper, we study the problem from
the computational analysis point of view. Several classes of neigborhood
structures are introduced for the problem along with some theoretical analysis.
These neighborhoods are then explored within a local search and a variable
neighborhood search frameworks with multistart to generate robust heuristic
algorithms. Results of systematic experimental analysis have been presented
which divulge the effectiveness of our algorithms. In addition, we present
several very fast construction heuristics. Our experimental results disclosed
some interesting properties of the BAP model, different from those of
comparable models. This is the first thorough experimental analysis of
algorithms on BAP. We have also introduced benchmark test instances that can be
used for future experiments on exact and heuristic algorithms for the problem.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of domain adaptation for neural abstractive
summarization. We make initial efforts in investigating what information can be
transferred to a new domain. Experimental results on news stories and opinion
articles indicate that neural summarization model benefits from pre-training
based on extractive summaries. We also find that the combination of in-domain
and out-of-domain setup yields better summaries when in-domain data is
insufficient. Further analysis shows that, the model is capable to select
salient content even trained on out-of-domain data, but requires in-domain data
to capture the style for a target domain.

 <dc:description>  What dynamics govern a time series representing the appearance of words in
social media data? In this paper, we investigate an elementary dynamics, from
which word-dependent special effects are segregated, such as breaking news,
increasing (or decreasing) concerns, or seasonality. To elucidate this problem,
we investigated approximately three billion Japanese blog articles over a
period of six years, and analysed some corresponding solvable mathematical
models. From the analysis, we found that a word appearance can be explained by
the random diffusion model based on the power-law forgetting process, which is
a type of long memory point process related to ARFIMA(0,0.5,0). In particular,
we confirmed that ultraslow diffusion (where the mean squared displacement
grows logarithmically), which the model predicts in an approximate manner,
reproduces the actual data. In addition, we also show that the model can
reproduce other statistical properties of a time series: (i) the fluctuation
scaling, (ii) spectrum density, and (iii) shapes of the probability density
functions.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel and simple orthogonal faster than Nyquist (OFTN)
data transmission and detection approach for a single input multiple output
(SIMO) system. It is assumed that the signal having a bandwidth $B$ is
transmitted through a wireless channel with $L$ multipath components. Under
this assumption, the current paper provides a novel and simple OFTN
transmission and symbol-by-symbol detection approach that exploits the
multiplexing gain obtained by the multipath characteristic of wideband wireless
channels. It is shown that the proposed design can achieve a higher
transmission rate than the existing one (i.e., orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM)). Furthermore, the achievable rate gap between the proposed
approach and that of the OFDM increases as the number of receiver antennas
increases for a fixed value of $L$. This implies that the performance gain of
the proposed approach can be very significant for a large-scale multi-antenna
wireless system. The superiority of the proposed approach is shown
theoretically and confirmed via numerical simulations. {Specifically, we have
found {upper-bound average} rates of 15 bps/Hz and 28 bps/Hz with the OFDM and
proposed approaches, respectively, in a Rayleigh fading channel with 32 receive
antennas and signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 15.3 dB. The extension of the
proposed approach for different system setups and associated research problems
is also discussed.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Channel Prediction, Beamforming and Scheduling Design for 5G
  V2I Network</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  One of the important use-cases of 5G network is the vehicle to infrastructure
(V2I) communication which requires accurate understanding about its dynamic
propagation environment. As 5G base stations (BSs) tend to have multiple
antennas, they will likely employ beamforming to steer their radiation pattern
to the desired vehicle equipment (VE). Furthermore, since most wireless
standards employ an OFDM system, each VE may use one or more sub-carriers. To
this end, this paper proposes a joint design of adaptive channel prediction,
beamforming and scheduling for 5G V2I communications. The channel prediction
algorithm is designed without the training signal and channel impulse response
(CIR) model. In this regard, first we utilize the well known adaptive recursive
least squares (RLS) technique for predicting the next block CIR from the past
and current block received signals (a block may have one or more OFDM symbols).
Then, we jointly design the beamforming and VE scheduling for each sub-carrier
to maximize the uplink channel average sum rate by utilizing the predicted CIR.
The beamforming problem is formulated as a Rayleigh quotient optimization where
its global optimal solution is guaranteed. And, the VE scheduling design is
formulated as an integer programming problem which is solved by employing a
greedy search. The superiority of the proposed channel prediction and
scheduling algorithms over those of the existing ones is demonstrated via
numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  We propose Steklov geometry processing, an extrinsic approach to spectral
geometry processing and shape analysis. Intrinsic approaches, usually based on
the Laplace-Beltrami operator, cannot capture the spatial embedding of a shape
up to rigid motion, while many previous extrinsic methods lack theoretical
justification. Instead, we propose a systematic approach by considering the
Steklov eigenvalue problem, computing the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
operator of a surface bounding a volume. A remarkable property of this operator
is that it encodes the volumetric geometry. We use the boundary element method
(BEM) to discretize the operator, accelerated by hierarchical numerical schemes
and preconditioning; this pipeline allows us to solve eigenvalue and linear
problems on large-scale meshes despite the density of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
discretization. We further demonstrate that our operators naturally fit into
existing frameworks for geometry processing, making a shift from intrinsic to
extrinsic geometry as simple as substituting the Laplace-Beltrami operator with
the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator.

 <dc:description>  Matching pedestrians across disjoint camera views, known as person
re-identification (re-id), is a challenging problem that is of importance to
visual recognition and surveillance. Most existing methods exploit local
regions within spatial manipulation to perform matching in local
correspondence. However, they essentially extract \emph{fixed} representations
from pre-divided regions for each image and perform matching based on the
extracted representation subsequently. For models in this pipeline, local finer
patterns that are crucial to distinguish positive pairs from negative ones
cannot be captured, and thus making them underperformed. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep multiplicative integration gating function, which answers
the question of \emph{what-and-where to match} for effective person re-id. To
address \emph{what} to match, our deep network emphasizes common local patterns
by learning joint representations in a multiplicative way. The network
comprises two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract convolutional
activations, and generates relevant descriptors for pedestrian matching. This
thus, leads to flexible representations for pair-wise images. To address
\emph{where} to match, we combat the spatial misalignment by performing
spatially recurrent pooling via a four-directional recurrent neural network to
impose spatial dependency over all positions with respect to the entire image.
The proposed network is designed to be end-to-end trainable to characterize
local pairwise feature interactions in a spatially aligned manner. To
demonstrate the superiority of our method, extensive experiments are conducted
over three benchmark data sets: VIPeR, CUHK03 and Market-1501.

 <dc:description>  The production of sports highlight packages summarizing a game's most
exciting moments is an essential task for broadcast media. Yet, it requires
labor-intensive video editing. We propose a novel approach for auto-curating
sports highlights, and use it to create a real-world system for the editorial
aid of golf highlight reels. Our method fuses information from the players'
reactions (action recognition such as high-fives and fist pumps), spectators
(crowd cheering), and commentator (tone of the voice and word analysis) to
determine the most interesting moments of a game. We accurately identify the
start and end frames of key shot highlights with additional metadata, such as
the player's name and the hole number, allowing personalized content
summarization and retrieval. In addition, we introduce new techniques for
learning our classifiers with reduced manual training data annotation by
exploiting the correlation of different modalities. Our work has been
demonstrated at a major golf tournament, successfully extracting highlights
from live video streams over four consecutive days.

 <dc:description>  We consider the economics of the interaction between Mobile Virtual Network
Operators (MVNOs) and Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). We investigate the
incentives of an MNO for offering some of her resources to an MVNO instead of
using the resources for her own End-Users (EUs). We consider a market with one
MNO and one MVNO, and a continuum of undecided EUs. Two cases for EUs are
considered: (i) when EUs need to choose either the MNO or the MVNO, and (ii)
when EUs have an outside option. In each of these cases, we consider a
non-cooperative framework of sequential game and a cooperative framework of
bargaining game. We characterize the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE) and
Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) of the sequential and bargaining games,
respectively. We show that in the non-cooperative framework, SPNE assumes two
forms: (i) the MNO invests minimally on her infrastructure and the MVNO leases
all the newly invested resources and (ii) the MNO invests more on her
infrastructure, the MVNO leases only part of these resources to the MVNO, and
the MNO uses the rest herself to attract EUs. Thus, in both, the MNO generates
revenue indirectly through the MVNO. In addition to that, in (ii), the MNO
generates revenue directly from the EUs. We also prove that in the bargaining
framework, the MVNO either reserves all the resources or no resources from the
MNO, and the MNO's investments are guided by whether EUs have an outside
option. If they don't, then the MNO invests as little as possible on her
infrastructure. If they do, then the MNO invests more.

 <dc:description>  Magnetometers, gyroscopes and accelerometers are commonly used sensors in a
variety of applications. The paper proposes a novel gyroscope calibration
method in the homogeneous magnetic field by the help of magnetometer. It is
shown that, with sufficient rotation excitation, the homogeneous magnetic field
vector can be exploited to serve as a good reference for calibrating low-cost
gyroscopes. The calibration parameters include the gyroscope scale factor,
non-orthogonal coefficient and bias for three axes, as well as its misalignment
to the magnetometer frame. Simulation and field test results demonstrate the
method's effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  We study an optimization problem that arises in the design of covering
strategies for multi-robot systems. Consider a team of $n$ cooperating robots
traveling along predetermined closed and disjoint trajectories. Each robot
needs to periodically communicate information to nearby robots. At places where
two trajectories are within range of each other, a communication link is
established, allowing two robots to exchange information, provided they are
&quot;synchronized&quot;, i.e., they visit the link at the same time. In this setting a
communication graph is defined and a system of robots is called
\emph{synchronized} if every pair of neighbors is synchronized.
  If one or more robots leave the system, then some trajectories are left
unattended. To handle such cases in a synchronized system, when a live robot
arrives to a communication link and detects the absence of the neighbor, it
shifts to the neighboring trajectory to assume the unattended task. If enough
robots leave, it may occur that a live robot enters a state of
\emph{starvation}, failing to permanently meet other robots during flight. To
measure the tolerance of the system under this phenomenon we define the
\emph{$k$-resilience} as the minimum number of robots whose removal may cause
$k$ surviving robots to enter a state of starvation. We show that the problem
of computing the $k$-resilience is NP-hard if $k$ is part of the input, even if
the communication graph is a tree. We propose algorithms to compute the
$k$-resilience for constant values of $k$ in general communication graphs and
show more efficient algorithms for systems whose communication graph is a tree.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel framework to jointly reconstruct the dynamic
magnetic resonance images (DMRI) and estimate the motion vectors from the
under-sampled measurements. Due to the inherent motion effects in DMRI
acquisition, reconstruction of DMRI using motion estimation/compensation has
been studied under a compressed sensing (CS) scheme. In this paper, by
embedding the intensity based optical flow (OF) constraint into the traditional
CS scheme, we are able to couple the DMRI reconstruction with vector motion
estimation. The resulting optimization problem is then solved by a primal-dual
algorithm with linesearch due to its efficiency when dealing with
non-differentiable problems. Moreover, the proposed framework is capable of
handling a wide class of prior information (regularizations) for DMRI
reconstruction, such as sparsity, low rank, total variation. In order to reduce
the computational cost, the OF constraint is employed in a specific coarse
scale. Experiments on various DMRI data, ranging from in vivo lung data to
simulated phantom, validate the reconstruction quality improvement using the
proposed scheme in comparison to several state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  To keep pace with Moore's law, chip designers have focused on increasing the
number of cores per chip rather than single core performance. In turn, modern
jobs are often designed to run on any number of cores. However, to effectively
leverage these multi-core chips, one must address the question of how many
cores to assign to each job. Given that jobs receive sublinear speedups from
additional cores, there is an obvious tradeoff: allocating more cores to an
individual job reduces the job's runtime, but in turn decreases the efficiency
of the overall system. We ask how the system should schedule jobs across cores
so as to minimize the mean response time over a stream of incoming jobs.
  To answer this question, we develop an analytical model of jobs running on a
multi-core machine. We prove that EQUI, a policy which continuously divides
cores evenly across jobs, is optimal when all jobs follow a single speedup
curve and have exponentially distributed sizes. EQUI requires jobs to change
their level of parallelization while they run. Since this is not possible for
all workloads, we consider a class of &quot;fixed-width&quot; policies, which choose a
single level of parallelization, k, to use for all jobs. We prove that,
surprisingly, it is possible to achieve EQUI's performance without requiring
jobs to change their levels of parallelization by using the optimal fixed level
of parallelization, k*. We also show how to analytically derive the optimal k*
as a function of the system load, the speedup curve, and the job size
distribution.
  In the case where jobs may follow different speedup curves, finding a good
scheduling policy is even more challenging. We find that policies like EQUI
which performed well in the case of a single speedup function now perform
poorly. We propose a very simple policy, GREEDY*, which performs near-optimally
when compared to the numerically-derived optimal policy.

 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technique for the fifth
generation (5G) wireless communications. As users with good channel conditions
can serve as relays to enhance the system performance by using successive
interference cancellation (SIC), the integration of NOMA and cooperative
relaying has recently attracted increasing interests. In this paper, a
NOMA-based cooperative relaying system is studied, and an analytical framework
is developed to evaluate its performance. Specifically, the performance of NOMA
over Rician fading channels is studied, and the exact expression of the average
achievable rate is derived. Moreover, we also propose an approximation method
to calculate the achievable rate by using the Gauss-Chebyshev Integration.
Numerical results confirm that our derived analytical results match well with
the Monte Carlo simulations.

 <dc:description>  Generating captions for images is a task that has recently received
considerable attention. In this work we focus on caption generation for
abstract scenes, or object layouts where the only information provided is a set
of objects and their locations. We propose OBJ2TEXT, a sequence-to-sequence
model that encodes a set of objects and their locations as an input sequence
using an LSTM network, and decodes this representation using an LSTM language
model. We show that our model, despite encoding object layouts as a sequence,
can represent spatial relationships between objects, and generate descriptions
that are globally coherent and semantically relevant. We test our approach in a
task of object-layout captioning by using only object annotations as inputs. We
additionally show that our model, combined with a state-of-the-art object
detector, improves an image captioning model from 0.863 to 0.950 (CIDEr score)
in the test benchmark of the standard MS-COCO Captioning task.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on regularizing the training of the convolutional neural
network (CNN). We propose a new regularization approach named ``PatchShuffle``
that can be adopted in any classification-oriented CNN models. It is easy to
implement: in each mini-batch, images or feature maps are randomly chosen to
undergo a transformation such that pixels within each local patch are shuffled.
Through generating images and feature maps with interior orderless patches,
PatchShuffle creates rich local variations, reduces the risk of network
overfitting, and can be viewed as a beneficial supplement to various kinds of
training regularization techniques, such as weight decay, model ensemble and
dropout. Experiments on four representative classification datasets show that
PatchShuffle improves the generalization ability of CNN especially when the
data is scarce. Moreover, we empirically illustrate that CNN models trained
with PatchShuffle are more robust to noise and local changes in an image.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of attack-resilient state estimation,
that is to reliably estimate the true system states despite two classes of
attacks: (i) attacks on the switching mechanisms and (ii) false data injection
attacks on actuator and sensor signals, in the presence of unbounded stochastic
process and measurement noise signals. We model the systems under attack as
hidden mode stochastic switched linear systems with unknown inputs and propose
the use of a multiple-model inference algorithm to tackle these security
issues. Moreover, we characterize fundamental limitations to resilient
estimation (e.g., upper bound on the number of tolerable signal attacks) and
discuss the topics of attack detection, identification and mitigation under
this framework. Simulation examples of switching and false data injection
attacks on a benchmark system and an IEEE 68-bus test system show the efficacy
of our approach to recover resilient (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) state
estimates as well as to identify and mitigate the attacks.

 <dc:description>  Complex computer simulators are increasingly used across fields of science as
generative models tying parameters of an underlying theory to experimental
observations. Inference in this setup is often difficult, as simulators rarely
admit a tractable density or likelihood function. We introduce Adversarial
Variational Optimization (AVO), a likelihood-free inference algorithm for
fitting a non-differentiable generative model incorporating ideas from
empirical Bayes and variational inference. We adapt the training procedure of
generative adversarial networks by replacing the differentiable generative
network with a domain-specific simulator. We solve the resulting
non-differentiable minimax problem by minimizing variational upper bounds of
the two adversarial objectives. Effectively, the procedure results in learning
a proposal distribution over simulator parameters, such that the corresponding
marginal distribution of the generated data matches the observations. We
present results of the method with simulators producing both discrete and
continuous data.

 <dc:description>  The compressed sensing (CS) theory has been successfully applied to image
compression in the past few years as most image signals are sparse in a certain
domain. Several CS reconstruction models have been recently proposed and
obtained superior performance. However, there still exist two important
challenges within the CS theory. The first one is how to design a sampling
mechanism to achieve an optimal sampling efficiency, and the second one is how
to perform the reconstruction to get the highest quality to achieve an optimal
signal recovery. In this paper, we try to deal with these two problems with a
deep network. First of all, we train a sampling matrix via the network training
instead of using a traditional manually designed one, which is much appropriate
for our deep network based reconstruct process. Then, we propose a deep network
to recover the image, which imitates traditional compressed sensing
reconstruction processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our deep
networks based CS reconstruction method offers a very significant quality
improvement compared against state of the art ones.

 <dc:title>Single Image Super-Resolution with Dilated Convolution based Multi-Scale

 <dc:description>  Traditional works have shown that patches in a natural image tend to
redundantly recur many times inside the image, both within the same scale, as
well as across different scales. Make full use of these multi-scale information
can improve the image restoration performance. However, the current proposed
deep learning based restoration methods do not take the multi-scale information
into account. In this paper, we propose a dilated convolution based inception
module to learn multi-scale information and design a deep network for single
image super-resolution. Different dilated convolution learns different scale
feature, then the inception module concatenates all these features to fuse
multi-scale information. In order to increase the reception field of our
network to catch more contextual information, we cascade multiple inception
modules to constitute a deep network to conduct single image super-resolution.
With the novel dilated convolution based inception module, the proposed
end-to-end single image super-resolution network can take advantage of
multi-scale information to improve image super-resolution performance.
Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms many
state-of-the-art single image super-resolution methods.

 <dc:title>Predicting the Gender of Indonesian Names</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigated a way to predict the gender of a name using character-level
Long-Short Term Memory (char-LSTM). We compared our method with some
conventional machine learning methods, namely Naive Bayes, logistic regression,
and XGBoost with n-grams as the features. We evaluated the models on a dataset
consisting of the names of Indonesian people. It is not common to use a family
name as the surname in Indonesian culture, except in some ethnicities.
Therefore, we inferred the gender from both full names and first names. The
results show that we can achieve 92.25% accuracy from full names, while using
first names only yields 90.65% accuracy. These results are better than the ones
from applying the classical machine learning algorithms to n-grams.

 <dc:description>  OpenMP is a cross-platform API that extends C, C++ and Fortran and provides
shared-memory parallelism platform for those languages. The use of many cores
and HPC technologies for scientific computing has been spread since the 1990s,
and now takes part in many fields of research. The relative ease of
implementing OpenMP, along with the development of multi-core shared memory
processors (such as Intel Xeon Phi) makes OpenMP a favorable method for
parallelization in the process of modernizing a legacy codes. Legacy scientific
codes are usually holding large number of physical arrays which being used and
updated by the code routines. In most of the cases the parallelization of such
code focuses on loop parallelization. A key step in this parallelization is
deciding which of the variables in the parallelized scope should be private (so
each thread will hold a copy of them), and which variables should be shared
across the threads. Other important step is finding which variables should be
synchronized after the loop execution. In this work we present an automatic
pre-processor that preforms these stages - AutOMP (Automatic OpenMP). AutOMP
recognize all the variables assignments inside a loop. These variables will be
private unless the assignment is of an array element which depend on the loop
index variable. Afterwards, AutOMP finds the places where threads
synchronization is needed, and which reduction operator is to be used. At last,
the program provides the parallelization command to be used for parallelizing
the loop.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a method to use RGB-D cameras to track the motions of a
human spinal cord injury patient undergoing spinal stimulation and physical
rehabilitation. Because clinicians must remain close to the patient during
training sessions, the patient is usually under permanent and transient
occlusions due to the training equipment and the movements of the attending
clinicians. These occlusions can significantly degrade the accuracy of existing
human tracking methods. To improve the data association problem in these
circumstances, we present a new global feature based on the geodesic distances
of surface mesh points to a set of anchor points. Transient occlusions are
handled via a multi-hypothesis tracking framework. To evaluate the method, we
simulated different occlusion sizes on a data set captured from a human in
varying movement patterns, and compared the proposed feature with other
tracking methods. The results show that the proposed method achieves robustness
to both surface deformations and transient occlusions.

 <dc:description>  The Descriptor System Tools (DSTOOLS) is a collection of MATLAB functions for
the operation on and manipulation of rational transfer function matrices via
their descriptor system realizations. The DSTOOLS collection relies on the
Control System Toolbox and several mex-functions based on the Systems and
Control Library SLICOT. Many of the implemented functions are based on the
computational procedures described in Chapter 10 of the book: &quot;A. Varga,
Solving Fault Diagnosis Problems - Linear Synthesis Techniques, Springer,
2017&quot;. This document is the User's Guide for the version V0.6 of DSTOOLS.
First, we present the mathematical background on rational matrices and
descriptor systems. Then, we give in-depth information on the command syntax of
the main computational functions. Several examples illustrate the use of the
main functions of DSTOOLS.

 <dc:description>  A centralized coded caching scheme has been proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen
to reduce the worst-case load of a network consisting of a server with access
to N files and connected through a shared link to K users, each equipped with a
cache of size M. However, this centralized coded caching scheme is not able to
take advantage of a non-uniform, possibly very skewed, file popularity
distribution. In this work, we consider the same network setting but aim to
reduce the average load under an arbitrary (known) file popularity
distribution. First, we consider a class of centralized coded caching schemes
utilizing general uncoded placement and a specific coded delivery strategy,
which are specified by a general file partition parameter. Then, we formulate
the coded caching design optimization problem over the considered class of
schemes with 2^K2^N variables to minimize the average load by optimizing the
file partition parameter under an arbitrary file popularity. Furthermore, we
show that the optimization problem is convex, and the resulting optimal
solution generally improves upon known schemes. Next, we analyze structural
properties of the optimization problem to obtain design insights and reduce the
complexity. Specifically, we obtain an equivalent linear optimization problem
with (K+1)N variables under an arbitrary file popularity and an equivalent
linear optimization problem with K+1 variables under the uniform file
popularity. Under the uniform file popularity, we also obtain the closed form
optimal solution, which corresponds to Maddah-Ali-Niesen's centralized coded
caching scheme. Finally, we present an information-theoretic converse bound on
the average load under an arbitrary file popularity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we bring forth a novel approach of video text detection using
Fourier-Laplacian filtering in the frequency domain that includes a
verification technique using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The proposed approach
deals with the text region appearing not only in horizontal or vertical
directions, but also in any other oblique or curved orientation in the image.
Until now only a few methods have been proposed that look into curved text
detection in video frames, wherein lies our novelty. In our approach, we first
apply Fourier-Laplacian transform on the image followed by an ideal
Laplacian-Gaussian filtering. Thereafter K-means clustering is employed to
obtain the asserted text areas depending on a maximum difference map. Next, the
obtained connected components (CC) are skeletonized to distinguish various text
strings. Complex components are disintegrated into simpler ones according to a
junction removal algorithm followed by a concatenation performed on possible
combination of the disjoint skeletons to obtain the corresponding text area.
Finally these text hypotheses are verified using HMM-based text/non-text
classification system. False positives are thus eliminated giving us a robust
text detection performance. We have tested our framework in multi-oriented text
lines in four scripts, namely, English, Chinese, Devanagari and Bengali, in
video frames and scene texts. The results obtained show that proposed approach
surpasses existing methods on text detection.

 <dc:title>Optimal Transmit Beamforming for Secure SWIPT in Heterogeneous Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This letter investigates the artificial noise aided beamforming design for
secure simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in a
two-tier downlink heterogeneous network, where one femtocell is overlaid with
one macrocell in co-channel deployment. Each energy receiver (ER) in femtocell
can be considered as a potential eaves- dropper for messages intended for
information receiver (IR). Our objective is to maximize the secrecy rate at IR
subject to the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) requirements of
macro users (MUs), transmit power constraint and energy harvesting constraint.
Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, it cannot be solved
directly. Thus, we propose a novel reformulation by using first-order Taylor
expansion and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Furthermore, an
SCA-based algorithm with low complexity is proposed to arrive at provably
convergent solution. Finally, numerical results evaluate the performance of the
proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a single-shot approach for recognising clothing
categories from 2.5D features. We propose two visual features, BSP (B-Spline
Patch) and TSD (Topology Spatial Distances) for this task. The local BSP
features are encoded by LLC (Locality-constrained Linear Coding) and fused with
three different global features. Our visual feature is robust to deformable
shapes and our approach is able to recognise the category of unknown clothing
in unconstrained and random configurations. We integrated the category
recognition pipeline with a stereo vision system, clothing instance detection,
and dual-arm manipulators to achieve an autonomous sorting system. To verify
the performance of our proposed method, we build a high-resolution RGBD
clothing dataset of 50 clothing items of 5 categories sampled in random
configurations (a total of 2,100 clothing samples). Experimental results show
that our approach is able to reach 83.2\% accuracy while classifying clothing
items which were previously unseen during training. This advances beyond the
previous state-of-the-art by 36.2\%. Finally, we evaluate the proposed approach
in an autonomous robot sorting system, in which the robot recognises a clothing
item from an unconstrained pile, grasps it, and sorts it into a box according
to its category. Our proposed sorting system achieves reasonable sorting
success rates with single-shot perception.

 <dc:title>Optimizations of Management Algorithms for Multi-Level Memory Hierarchy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Oren, Gal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Operating Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the near future the SCM is predicted to modify the form of new programs,
the access form to storage, and the way that storage devices themselves are
built. Therefore, a combination between the SCM and a designated Memory
Allocation Manager (MAM) that will allow the programmer to manually control the
different memories in the memory hierarchy will be likely to achieve a new
level of performance for memory-aware data structures. Although the manual MAM
seems to be the optimal approach for multi-level memory hierarchy management,
this technique is still very far from being realistic, and the chances that it
would be implemented in current codes using High Performance Computing (HPC)
platforms is quite low. This premise means that the most reasonable way to
introduce the SCM into any usable and popular memory system would be by
implementing an automated version of the MAM using the fundamentals of paging
algorithms, as used for two-level memory hierarchy. Our hypothesis is that
achieving appropriate transferability between memory levels may be possible
using ideas of algorithms employed in current virtual memory systems, and that
the adaptation of those algorithms from a two-level memory hierarchy to an
N-level memory hierarchy is possible. In order to reach the conclusion that our
hypothesis is correct, we investigated various paging algorithms, and found the
ones that could be adapted successfully from two-level memory hierarchy to an
N-level memory hierarchy. We discovered that using an adaptation of the Aging
paging algorithm to an N-level memory hierarchy results in the best
performances in terms of Hit/Miss ratio. In order to verify our hypothesis we
build a simulator called &quot;DeMemory simulator&quot; for analyzing our algorithms as
well as for other algorithms that will be devised in the future.

 <dc:description>  There is a vast body of theoretical research on lifted inference in
probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). However, few demonstrations exist where
lifting is applied in conjunction with top of the line applied algorithms. We
pursue the applicability of lifted inference for computer vision (CV), with the
insight that a globally optimal (MAP) labeling will likely have the same label
for two symmetric pixels. The success of our approach lies in efficiently
handling a distinct unary potential on every node (pixel), typical of CV
applications. This allows us to lift the large class of algorithms that model a
CV problem via PGM inference. We propose a generic template for coarse-to-fine
(C2F) inference in CV, which progressively refines an initial coarsely lifted
PGM for varying quality-time trade-offs. We demonstrate the performance of C2F
inference by developing lifted versions of two near state-of-the-art CV
algorithms for stereo vision and interactive image segmentation. We find that,
against flat algorithms, the lifted versions have a much superior anytime
performance, without any loss in final solution quality.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been an increasing interest in end-to-end speech
recognition that directly transcribes speech to text without any predefined
alignments. In this paper, we explore the use of attention-based
encoder-decoder model for Mandarin speech recognition on voice search. We
propose a smoothing method for attention mechanism and compare with content
attention and convolutional attention. Moreover, frame skipping is employed for
fast training and convergence. On the XiaoMi TV voice search dataset, we
achieve a character error rate (CER) of 3.58% and a sentence error rate (SER)
of 7.43% without using any lexicon or language model. While together with a
trigram language model, we reach 2.81% CER and 5.77% SER.

 <dc:description>  Person detection from vehicles has made rapid progress recently with the
advent of multiple highquality datasets of urban and highway driving, yet no
large-scale benchmark is available for the same problem in off-road or
agricultural environments. Here we present the NREC Agricultural
Person-Detection Dataset to spur research in these environments. It consists of
labeled stereo video of people in orange and apple orchards taken from two
perception platforms (a tractor and a pickup truck), along with vehicle
position data from RTK GPS. We define a benchmark on part of the dataset that
combines a total of 76k labeled person images and 19k sampled person-free
images. The dataset highlights several key challenges of the domain, including
varying environment, substantial occlusion by vegetation, people in motion and
in non-standard poses, and people seen from a variety of distances; meta-data
are included to allow targeted evaluation of each of these effects. Finally, we
present baseline detection performance results for three leading approaches
from urban pedestrian detection and our own convolutional neural network
approach that benefits from the incorporation of additional image context. We
show that the success of existing approaches on urban data does not transfer
directly to this domain.

 <dc:description>  A battery swapping and charging station (BSCS) is an energy refueling
station, where i) electric vehicles (EVs) with depleted batteries (DBs) can
swap their DBs for fully-charged ones, and ii) the swapped DBs are then charged
until they are fully-charged. Successful deployment of a BSCS system
necessitates a careful planning of swapping- and charging-related
infrastructures, and thus a comprehensive performance evaluation of the BSCS is
becoming crucial. This paper studies such a performance evaluation problem with
a novel mixed queueing network (MQN) model and validates this model with
extensive numerical simulation. We adopt the EVs' blocking probability as our
quality-of-service measure and focus on studying the impact of the key
parameters of the BSCS (e.g., the numbers of parking spaces, swapping islands,
chargers, and batteries) on the blocking probability. We prove a necessary and
sufficient condition for showing the ergodicity of the MQN when the number of
batteries approaches infinity, and further prove that the blocking probability
has two different types of asymptotic behaviors. Meanwhile, for each type of
asymptotic behavior, we analytically derive the asymptotic lower bound of the
blocking probability.

 <dc:description>  Emotion recognition is attracting great interest for its potential
application in a multitude of real-life situations. Much of the Computer Vision
research in this field has focused on relating emotions to facial expressions,
with investigations rarely including more than upper body. In this work, we
propose a new scenario, for which emotional states are related to 3D dynamics
of the whole body motion. To address the complexity of human body movement, we
used covariance descriptors of the sequence of the 3D skeleton joints, and
represented them in the non-linear Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive
Definite matrices. In doing so, we exploited geodesic distances and geometric
means on the manifold to perform emotion classification. Using sequences of
spontaneous walking under the five primary emotional states, we report a method
that succeeded in classifying the different emotions, with comparable
performance to those observed in a human-based force-choice classification
task.

 <dc:description>  Exemplar-based texture synthesis is the process of generating, from an input
sample, new texture images of arbitrary size and which are perceptually
equivalent to the sample. The two main approaches are statistics-based methods
and patch re-arrangement methods. In the first class, a texture is
characterized by a statistical signature; then, a random sampling conditioned
to this signature produces genuinely different texture images. The second class
boils down to a clever &quot;copy-paste&quot; procedure, which stitches together large
regions of the sample. Hybrid methods try to combine ideas from both approaches
to avoid their hurdles. The recent approaches using convolutional neural
networks fit to this classification, some being statistical and others
performing patch re-arrangement in the feature space. They produce impressive
synthesis on various kinds of textures. Nevertheless, we found that most real
textures are organized at multiple scales, with global structures revealed at
coarse scales and highly varying details at finer ones. Thus, when confronted
with large natural images of textures the results of state-of-the-art methods
degrade rapidly, and the problem of modeling them remains wide open.

 <dc:description>  The spread of opinions, memes, diseases, and &quot;alternative facts&quot; in a
population depends both on the details of the spreading process and on the
structure of the social and communication networks on which they spread. One
feature that can change spreading dynamics substantially is heterogeneous
behavior among different types of individuals in a social network. In this
paper, we explore how \textit{anti-establishment} nodes (e.g.,
\textit{hipsters}) influence spreading dynamics of two competing products. We
consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for updating
node states in which an adjustable fraction $p_{\rm Hip}$ of the nodes in a
network are hipsters, who always choose to adopt the product that they believe
is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose
which product to adopt by considering only which products their immediate
neighbors have adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real
networks, and we show that the hipsters have a major effect on the final
fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the two
products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a very small fraction of
hipsters in a network can still cause the other product to eventually become
more popular. Our simulations also demonstrate that a time delay $\tau$ in the
knowledge of the product distribution in a population has a large effect on the
final distribution of product adoptions. Our simple model and analysis may help
shed light on the road to success for anti-establishment choices in elections,
as such success --- and qualitative differences in final outcomes between
competing products, political candidates, and so on --- can arise rather
generically from a small number of anti-establishment individuals and ordinary
processes of social influence on normal individuals.

 <dc:description>  This work develops a tracking system based on an event-based camera. A
bioinspired filtering algorithm to reduce noise and transmitted data while
keeping the main features at the scene is implemented in FPGA which also serves
as a network node. POWERLINK IEEE 61158 industrial network is used to
communicate the FPGA with a controller connected to a self-developed two axis
servo-controlled robot. The FPGA includes the network protocol to integrate the
event-based camera as any other existing network node. The inverse kinematics
for the robot is included in the controller. In addition, another network node
is used to control pneumatic valves blowing the ball at different speed and
trajectories. To complete the system and provide a comparison, a traditional
frame-based camera is also connected to the controller. The imaging data for
the tracking system are obtained either from the event-based or frame-based
camera. Results show that the robot can accurately follow the ball using fast
image recognition, with the intrinsic advantages of the event-based system
(size, price, power). This works shows how the development of new equipment and
algorithms can be efficiently integrated in an industrial system, merging
commercial industrial equipment with the new devices so that new technologies
can rapidly enter into the industrial field.

 <dc:description>  Large volume of Genomics data is produced on daily basis due to the
advancement in sequencing technology. This data is of no value if it is not
properly analysed. Different kinds of analytics are required to extract useful
information from this raw data. Classification, Prediction, Clustering and
Pattern Extraction are useful techniques of data mining. These techniques
require appropriate selection of attributes of data for getting accurate
results. However, Bioinformatics data is high dimensional, usually having
hundreds of attributes. Such large a number of attributes affect the
performance of machine learning algorithms used for classification/prediction.
So, dimensionality reduction techniques are required to reduce the number of
attributes that can be further used for analysis. In this paper, Principal
Component Analysis and Factor Analysis are used for dimensionality reduction of
Bioinformatics data. These techniques were applied on Leukaemia data set and
the number of attributes was reduced from to.

 <dc:description>  We present MoodSwipe, a soft keyboard that suggests text messages given the
user-specified emotions utilizing the real dialog data. The aim of MoodSwipe is
to create a convenient user interface to enjoy the technology of emotion
classification and text suggestion, and at the same time to collect labeled
data automatically for developing more advanced technologies. While users
select the MoodSwipe keyboard, they can type as usual but sense the emotion
conveyed by their text and receive suggestions for their message as a benefit.
In MoodSwipe, the detected emotions serve as the medium for suggested texts,
where viewing the latter is the incentive to correcting the former. We conduct
several experiments to show the superiority of the emotion classification
models trained on the dialog data, and further to verify good emotion cues are
important context for text suggestion.

 <dc:description>  The immense amount of daily generated and communicated data presents unique
challenges in their processing. Clustering, the grouping of data without the
presence of ground-truth labels, is an important tool for drawing inferences
from data. Subspace clustering (SC) is a relatively recent method that is able
to successfully classify nonlinearly separable data in a multitude of settings.
In spite of their high clustering accuracy, SC methods incur prohibitively high
computational complexity when processing large volumes of high-dimensional
data. Inspired by random sketching approaches for dimensionality reduction, the
present paper introduces a randomized scheme for SC, termed Sketch-SC, tailored
for large volumes of high-dimensional data. Sketch-SC accelerates the
computationally heavy parts of state-of-the-art SC approaches by compressing
the data matrix across both dimensions using random projections, thus enabling
fast and accurate large-scale SC. Performance analysis as well as extensive
numerical tests on real data corroborate the potential of Sketch-SC and its
competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art scalable SC approaches.

 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges of social interaction in virtual reality settings
is that head-mounted displays occlude a large portion of the face, blocking
facial expressions and thereby restricting social engagement cues among users.
Hence, auxiliary means of sensing and conveying these expressions are needed.
We present an algorithm to automatically infer expressions by analyzing only a
partially occluded face while the user is engaged in a virtual reality
experience. Specifically, we show that images of the user's eyes captured from
an IR gaze-tracking camera within a VR headset are sufficient to infer a select
subset of facial expressions without the use of any fixed external camera.
Using these inferences, we can generate dynamic avatars in real-time which
function as an expressive surrogate for the user. We propose a novel data
collection pipeline as well as a novel approach for increasing CNN accuracy via
personalization. Our results show a mean accuracy of 74% ($F1$ of 0.73) among 5
`emotive' expressions and a mean accuracy of 70% ($F1$ of 0.68) among 10
distinct facial action units, outperforming human raters.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;digital Michelangelo project&quot; was a seminal computer vision project in
the early 2000's that pushed the capabilities of acquisition systems and
involved multiple people from diverse fields, many of whom are now leaders in
industry and academia. Reviewing this project with modern eyes provides us with
the opportunity to reflect on several issues, relevant now as then to the field
of computer vision and research in general, that go beyond the technical
aspects of the work.
  This article was written in the context of a reading group competition at the
week-long International Computer Vision Summer School 2017 (ICVSS) on Sicily,
Italy. To deepen the participants understanding of computer vision and to
foster a sense of community, various reading groups were tasked to highlight
important lessons which may be learned from provided literature, going beyond
the contents of the paper. This report is the winning entry of this guided
discourse (Fig. 1). The authors closely examined the origins, fruits and most
importantly lessons about research in general which may be distilled from the
&quot;digital Michelangelo project&quot;. Discussions leading to this report were held
within the group as well as with Hao Li, the group mentor.

 <dc:description>  Social media users often make explicit predictions about upcoming events.
Such statements vary in the degree of certainty the author expresses toward the
outcome:&quot;Leonardo DiCaprio will win Best Actor&quot; vs. &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio may win&quot;
or &quot;No way Leonardo wins!&quot;. Can popular beliefs on social media predict who
will win? To answer this question, we build a corpus of tweets annotated for
veridicality on which we train a log-linear classifier that detects positive
veridicality with high precision. We then forecast uncertain outcomes using the
wisdom of crowds, by aggregating users' explicit predictions. Our method for
forecasting winners is fully automated, relying only on a set of contenders as
input. It requires no training data of past outcomes and outperforms sentiment
and tweet volume baselines on a broad range of contest prediction tasks. We
further demonstrate how our approach can be used to measure the reliability of
individual accounts' predictions and retrospectively identify surprise
outcomes.

 <dc:description>  Current state-of-the-art human action recognition is focused on the
classification of temporally trimmed videos in which only one action occurs per
frame. In this work we address the problem of action localisation and instance
segmentation in which multiple concurrent actions of the same class may be
segmented out of an image sequence. We cast the action tube extraction as an
energy maximisation problem in which configurations of region proposals in each
frame are assigned a cost and the best action tubes are selected via two passes
of dynamic programming. One pass associates region proposals in space and time
for each action category, and another pass is used to solve for the tube's
temporal extent and to enforce a smooth label sequence through the video. In
addition, by taking advantage of recent work on action foreground-background
segmentation, we are able to associate each tube with class-specific
segmentations. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on the
challenging LIRIS-HARL dataset and achieve a new state-of-the-art result which
is 14.3 times better than previous methods.

 <dc:description>  Advances in deep learning over the last decade have led to a flurry of
research in the application of deep artificial neural networks to robotic
systems, with at least thirty papers published on the subject between 2014 and
the present. This review discusses the applications, benefits, and limitations
of deep learning vis-\`a-vis physical robotic systems, using contemporary
research as exemplars. It is intended to communicate recent advances to the
wider robotics community and inspire additional interest in and application of

 <dc:description>  In Future Internet it is possible to change elements of congestion control in
order to eliminate jitter and batch loss caused by the current control
mechanisms based on packet loss events. We investigate the fundamental problem
of adjusting sending rates to achieve optimal utilization of highly variable
bandwidth of a network path using accurate packet rate information. This is
done by continuously controlling the sending rate with a function of the
measured packet rate at the receiver. We propose the relative loss of packet
rate between the sender and the receiver (Relative Rate Reduction, RRR) as a
new accurate and continuous measure of congestion of a network path, replacing
the erratically fluctuating packet loss. We demonstrate that with choosing
various RRR based feedback functions the optimum is reached with adjustable
congestion level. The proposed method guarantees fair bandwidth sharing of
competitive flows. Finally, we present testbed experiments to demonstrate the
performance of the algorithm.

 <dc:title>Packing Topological Minors Half-Integrally</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Chun-Hung</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A family ${\mathcal F}$ of graphs has the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property if for
every graph $G$, the maximum number of pairwise disjoint subgraphs isomorphic
to members of ${\mathcal F}$ contained in $G$ and the minimum size of a set of
vertices of $G$ hitting all such subgraphs are bounded by functions of each
other. Robertson and Seymour proved that if ${\mathcal F}$ consists of
$H$-minors for some fixed graph $H$, then the planarity of $H$ is equivalent
with the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. Thomas conjectured that the planarity is no
longer required if the requirement for those $H$-minors being pairwise disjoint
is replaced with being half-integrally disjoint.
  In this paper, we prove that this half-integral version of Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa
property holds with respect to the topological minor containment, which easily
implies Thomas' conjecture. Indeed, we prove an even stronger statement in
which those subdivisions are rooted at any choice of prescribed subsets of
vertices. Precisely, we prove that for every graph $H$, there exists a function
$f$ such that for every graph $G$, every sequence $(R_v: v \in V(H))$ of
subsets of $V(G)$ and every integer $k$, either there exist $k$ subgraphs
$G_1,G_2,...,G_k$ of $G$ such that every vertex of $G$ belongs to at most two
of $G_1,...,G_k$ and each $G_i$ is isomorphic to a subdivision of $H$ whose
branch vertex corresponding to $v$ belongs to $R_v$ for each $v \in V(H)$, or
there exists a set $Z \subseteq V(G)$ with size at most $f(k)$ intersecting all
subgraphs of $G$ isomorphic to a subdivision of $H$ whose branch vertex
corresponding to $v$ belongs to $R_v$ for each $v \in V(H)$.
  Applications of this theorem include generalizations of algorithmic
meta-theorems and structure theorems for $H$-topological minor free (or
$H$-minor free) graphs to graphs that do not half-integrally pack many
$H$-topological minors (or $H$-minors).

 <dc:description>  To combine and query ordered data from multiple sources, one needs to handle
uncertainty about the possible orderings. Examples of such &quot;order-incomplete&quot;
data include integrated event sequences such as log entries; lists of
properties (e.g., hotels and restaurants) ranked by an unknown function
reflecting relevance or customer ratings; and documents edited concurrently
with an uncertain order on edits. This paper introduces a query language for
order-incomplete data, based on the positive relational algebra with
order-aware accumulation. We use partial orders to represent order-incomplete
data, and study possible and certain answers for queries in this context. We
show that these problems are respectively NP-complete and coNP-complete, but
identify many tractable cases depending on the query operators or input partial
orders.

 <dc:description>  A deep neural networks based method is proposed to convert single
polarization grayscale SAR image to fully polarimetric. It consists of two
components: a feature extractor network to extract hierarchical multi-scale
spatial features of grayscale SAR image, followed by a feature translator
network to map spatial feature to polarimetric feature with which the
polarimetric covariance matrix of each pixel can be reconstructed. Both
qualitative and quantitative experiments with real fully polarimetric data are
conducted to show the efficacy of the proposed method. The reconstructed
full-pol SAR image agrees well with the true full-pol image. Existing PolSAR
applications such as model-based decomposition and unsupervised classification
can be applied directly to the reconstructed full-pol SAR images. This
framework can be easily extended to reconstruction of full-pol data from
compact-pol data. The experiment results also show that the proposed method
could be potentially used for interference removal on the cross-polarization
channel.

 <dc:description>  The human body has a very effective Immune system used to protect the body
from dangerous foreign pathogens. This paper aims at studying the immunology
and understanding how it works, it also shaded light on the usage of the
immunology principles in the computer network security. It also suggested a new
network security model which detects attacks that invades the LANs. This study
based on human immune system (IS). This model help protecting the datalink
layer by suggesting solution to detect the foreign frames in computer network
traffic. In this model, the frame format is changed in a way that prevents the
sender from sending his MAC address, and he send a unique identifier (ID)
instead. Moreover, a special network switch will replace the sender ID with the
corresponding MAC address and forward the packets to their right destination.

 <dc:description>  Recent rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
have raised many questions about the regulatory and governance mechanisms for
autonomous machines. Many commentators, scholars, and policy-makers now call
for ensuring that algorithms governing our lives are transparent, fair, and
accountable. Here, I propose a conceptual framework for the regulation of AI
and algorithmic systems. I argue that we need tools to program, debug and
maintain an algorithmic social contract, a pact between various human
stakeholders, mediated by machines. To achieve this, we can adapt the concept
of human-in-the-loop (HITL) from the fields of modeling and simulation, and
interactive machine learning. In particular, I propose an agenda I call
society-in-the-loop (SITL), which combines the HITL control paradigm with
mechanisms for negotiating the values of various stakeholders affected by AI
systems, and monitoring compliance with the agreement. In short, `SITL = HITL +
Social Contract.'

 <dc:description>  Brain computer interface (BCI) provides promising applications in
neuroprosthesis and neurorehabilitation by controlling computers and robotic
devices based on the patient's intentions. Here, we have developed a novel BCI
platform that controls a personalized social robot using noninvasively acquired
brain signals. Scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are collected from a
user in real-time during tasks of imaginary movements. The imagined body
kinematics are decoded using a regression model to calculate the user-intended
velocity. Then, the decoded kinematic information is mapped to control the
gestures of a social robot. The platform here may be utilized as a
human-robot-interaction framework by combining with neurofeedback mechanisms to
enhance the cognitive capability of persons with dementia.

 <dc:title>A Covert Queueing Channel in FCFS Schedulers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study covert queueing channels (CQCs), which are a kind of covert timing
channel that may be exploited in shared queues across supposedly isolated
users. In our system model, a user modulates messages to another user via his
pattern of access to the shared resource scheduled in a first-come-first-served
(FCFS) manner. One example of such a channel is the cross-virtual network
covert channel in data center networks resulting from the queueing effects of
the shared resource. First, we study a system comprising a transmitter and a
receiver that share a deterministic and work-conserving FCFS scheduler, and we
compute the capacity of this channel. We also consider the effect of the
presence of other users on the information transmission rate of this channel.
The achievable information transmission rates obtained in this study
demonstrate the possibility of significant information leakage and great
privacy threats brought by CQCs in FCFS schedulers.

 <dc:title>A New Approach to Time-Optimal Path Parameterization based on
  Reachability Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Pham, Quang-Cuong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) is a well-studied problem in
robotics and has a wide range of applications. There are two main families of
methods to address TOPP: Numerical Integration (NI) and Convex Optimization
(CO). NI-based methods are fast but difficult to implement and suffer from
robustness issues, while CO-based approaches are more robust but at the same
time significantly slower. Here we propose a new approach to TOPP based on
Reachability Analysis (RA). The key insight is to recursively compute reachable
and controllable sets at discretized positions on the path by solving small
Linear Programs (LPs). The resulting algorithm is faster than NI-based methods
and as robust as CO-based ones (100% success rate), as confirmed by extensive
numerical evaluations. Moreover, the proposed approach offers unique additional
benefits: Admissible Velocity Propagation and robustness to parametric
uncertainty can be derived from it in a simple and natural way.

 <dc:description>  Trans-dimensional random field language models (TRF LMs) have recently been
introduced, where sentences are modeled as a collection of random fields. The
TRF approach has been shown to have the advantages of being computationally
more efficient in inference than LSTM LMs with close performance and being able
to flexibly integrating rich features. In this paper we propose neural TRFs,
beyond of the previous discrete TRFs that only use linear potentials with
discrete features. The idea is to use nonlinear potentials with continuous
features, implemented by neural networks (NNs), in the TRF framework. Neural
TRFs combine the advantages of both NNs and TRFs. The benefits of word
embedding, nonlinear feature learning and larger context modeling are inherited
from the use of NNs. At the same time, the strength of efficient inference by
avoiding expensive softmax is preserved. A number of technical contributions,
including employing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to define the
potentials and incorporating the joint stochastic approximation (JSA) strategy
in the training algorithm, are developed in this work, which enable us to
successfully train neural TRF LMs. Various LMs are evaluated in terms of speech
recognition WERs by rescoring the 1000-best lists of WSJ'92 test data. The
results show that neural TRF LMs not only improve over discrete TRF LMs, but
also perform slightly better than LSTM LMs with only one fifth of parameters
and 16x faster inference efficiency.

 <dc:description>  3D hand pose estimation from single depth image is an important and
challenging problem for human-computer interaction. Recently deep convolutional
networks (ConvNet) with sophisticated design have been employed to address it,
but the improvement over traditional random forest based methods is not so
apparent. To exploit the good practice and promote the performance for hand
pose estimation, we propose a tree-structured Region Ensemble Network (REN) for
directly 3D coordinate regression. It first partitions the last convolution
outputs of ConvNet into several grid regions. The results from separate
fully-connected (FC) regressors on each regions are then integrated by another
FC layer to perform the estimation. By exploitation of several training
strategies including data augmentation and smooth $L_1$ loss, proposed REN can
significantly improve the performance of ConvNet to localize hand joints. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves the best
performance among state-of-the-art algorithms on three public hand pose
datasets. We also experiment our methods on fingertip detection and human pose
datasets and obtain state-of-the-art accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Multimodal sentiment analysis is an increasingly popular research area, which
extends the conventional language-based definition of sentiment analysis to a
multimodal setup where other relevant modalities accompany language. In this
paper, we pose the problem of multimodal sentiment analysis as modeling
intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics. We introduce a novel model, termed
Tensor Fusion Network, which learns both such dynamics end-to-end. The proposed
approach is tailored for the volatile nature of spoken language in online
videos as well as accompanying gestures and voice. In the experiments, our
model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for both multimodal and unimodal
sentiment analysis.

 <dc:description>  Often multiple instances of an object occur in the same scene, for example in
a warehouse. Unsupervised multi-instance object discovery algorithms are able
to detect and identify such objects. We use such an algorithm to provide object
proposals to a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classifier. This
results in fewer regions to evaluate, compared to traditional region proposal
algorithms. Additionally, it enables using the joint probability of multiple
instances of an object, resulting in improved classification accuracy. The
proposed technique can also split a single class into multiple sub-classes
corresponding to the different object types, enabling hierarchical
classification.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of person re-identification, which
refers to associating the persons captured from different cameras. We propose a
simple yet effective human part-aligned representation for handling the body
part misalignment problem. Our approach decomposes the human body into regions
(parts) which are discriminative for person matching, accordingly computes the
representations over the regions, and aggregates the similarities computed
between the corresponding regions of a pair of probe and gallery images as the
overall matching score. Our formulation, inspired by attention models, is a
deep neural network modeling the three steps together, which is learnt through
minimizing the triplet loss function without requiring body part labeling
information. Unlike most existing deep learning algorithms that learn a global
or spatial partition-based local representation, our approach performs human
body partition, and thus is more robust to pose changes and various human
spatial distributions in the person bounding box. Our approach shows
state-of-the-art results over standard datasets, Market-$1501$, CUHK$03$,
CUHK$01$ and VIPeR.

 <dc:description>  FFT (fast Fourier transform) plays a very important role in many fields, such
as digital signal processing, digital image processing and so on. However, in
application, FFT becomes a factor of affecting the processing efficiency,
especially in remote sensing, which large amounts of data need to be processed
with FFT. So shortening the FFT computation time is particularly important. GPU
(Graphics Processing Unit) has been used in many common areas and its
acceleration effect is very obvious compared with CPU (Central Processing Unit)
platform. In this paper, we present a new parallel method to execute FFT on
GPU. Based on GPU storage system and hardware processing pipeline, we improve
the way of data storage. We divided the data into parts reasonably according
the size of data to make full use of the characteristics of the GPU. We propose
the memory optimized method based on share memory and texture memory to reduce
the number of global memory access to achieve better efficiency. The results
show that the GPU-based memory optimized FFT implementation not only can
increase over 100% than FFTW library in CPU platform, but also can improve over
30% than CUFFT library in GPU platform.

 <dc:description>  Learning distributed representations for relation instances is a central
technique in downstream NLP applications. In order to address semantic modeling
of relational patterns, this paper constructs a new dataset that provides
multiple similarity ratings for every pair of relational patterns on the
existing dataset. In addition, we conduct a comparative study of different
encoders including additive composition, RNN, LSTM, and GRU for composing
distributed representations of relational patterns. We also present Gated
Additive Composition, which is an enhancement of additive composition with the
gating mechanism. Experiments show that the new dataset does not only enable
detailed analyses of the different encoders, but also provides a gauge to
predict successes of distributed representations of relational patterns in the
relation classification task.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, deep neural models have been widely adopted for text
matching tasks, such as question answering and information retrieval, showing
improved performance as compared with previous methods. In this paper, we
introduce the MatchZoo toolkit that aims to facilitate the designing, comparing
and sharing of deep text matching models. Specifically, the toolkit provides a
unified data preparation module for different text matching problems, a
flexible layer-based model construction process, and a variety of training
objectives and evaluation metrics. In addition, the toolkit has implemented two
schools of representative deep text matching models, namely
representation-focused models and interaction-focused models. Finally, users
can easily modify existing models, create and share their own models for text
matching in MatchZoo.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Automatic Neighbor Relations for 5G Wireless Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gorcin, Ali</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  5G wireless networks aim to achieve seamless mobile broadband services,
machine to machine and ultra-reliable low latency communications. These goals
require massive improvements in terms of capacity, reliability, latency
reduction, and scalability. Besides software defined networks and network
function virtualization, self organizing networks (SON) is another enabling
technology which makes 5G feasible. Automatic neighbor relations (ANR) is a
prominent component of SON which has direct impact on reliability, scalability,
and capacity of the wireless networks. When the current state of
standardization and implementation of ANR functionality is considered, it is
seen that a new approach is needed for ANR to comply with 5G requirements.
Thus, in this paper a comprehensive hybrid ANR (H-ANR) architecture which leads
to the management of relations utilizing an extensive set of universal
performance criteria, configuration metrics, and measurements is proposed. The
H-ANR functionality ranks the neighbors not based on instantaneous information
but on historic values of the performance criteria and other metrics. The
attributes of distributed ANR (D-ANR) module is also managed by H-ANR to
prevent the repetitive addition of unwanted neighbors via D-ANR or X2
interface. Performance of the proposed H-ANR functionality is also compared
with the case when only D-ANR is available on a Long Term Evolution Advanced
network.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel neural model HyperVec to learn hierarchical embeddings for
hypernymy detection and directionality. While previous embeddings have shown
limitations on prototypical hypernyms, HyperVec represents an unsupervised
measure where embeddings are learned in a specific order and capture the
hypernym$-$hyponym distributional hierarchy. Moreover, our model is able to
generalize over unseen hypernymy pairs, when using only small sets of training
data, and by mapping to other languages. Results on benchmark datasets show
that HyperVec outperforms both state$-$of$-$the$-$art unsupervised measures and
embedding models on hypernymy detection and directionality, and on predicting
graded lexical entailment.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the notion of &quot;seminar users&quot;, who are social media users
engaged in propaganda in support of a political entity. We develop a framework
that can identify such users with 84.4% precision and 76.1% recall. While our
dataset is from the Arab region, omitting language-specific features has only a
minor impact on classification performance, and thus, our approach could work
for detecting seminar users in other parts of the world and in other languages.
We further explored a controversial political topic to observe the prevalence
and potential potency of such users. In our case study, we found that 25% of
the users engaged in the topic are in fact seminar users and their tweets make
nearly a third of the on-topic tweets. Moreover, they are often successful in
affecting mainstream discourse with coordinated hashtag campaigns.

 <dc:title>Optimal Universal Controllers for Rudder Roll Stabilization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Roll stabilization (damping) is an important problem of ship motion control
since excessive roll motion may cause motion sickness of human occupants and
damage fragile cargo. This problem becomes especially non-trivial in situations
where the same actuators are used for the vessel's roll and yaw stabilization.
To keep the &quot;trade-off&quot; between the concurrent goals of accurate course
steering and roll stabilization, an optimization problem is usually solved
where the cost functional penalizes the roll angle, the steering error and the
control effort. Since the vessel's motion is influenced by the uncertain wave
disturbance, the optimal value of this functional and the optimal process are
also uncertain. A standard approach, prevailing in the literature, is to
approximate the wave disturbance by the &quot;colored noise&quot; with a known spectral
density, reducing the optimization problem to conventional LQG control. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach to optimal roll damping, approximating the
disturbance by the polyharmonic signal with known frequencies yet uncertain
amplitudes and phase shifts. For this class of external disturbances, an
optimal universal controller (OUC) can be found. Unlike the LQG controller,
minimizing only the expected value of the cost function, the OUC delivers the
optimal solution for any uncertain parameters of the signal. The practical
applicability of our algorithms is illustrated by numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  \emph{Verifiability} is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia,
editors being encouraged to provide citations for the added content. For a
Wikipedia article, determining the \emph{citation span} of a citation, i.e.
what content is covered by a citation, is important as it helps decide for
which content citations are still missing.
  We are the first to address the problem of determining the \emph{citation
span} in Wikipedia articles. We approach this problem by classifying which
textual fragments in an article are covered by a citation. We propose a
sequence classification approach where for a paragraph and a citation, we
determine the citation span at a fine-grained level.
  We provide a thorough experimental evaluation and compare our approach
against baselines adopted from the scientific domain, where we show improvement
for all evaluation metrics.

observe that the evidence-conclusion discourse relations, also known as
arguments, often appear in product reviews, and we hypothesise that some
argument-based features, e.g. the percentage of argumentative sentences, the
evidences-conclusions ratios, are good indicators of helpful reviews. To
validate this hypothesis, we manually annotate arguments in 110 hotel reviews,
and investigate the effectiveness of several combinations of argument-based
features. Experiments suggest that, when being used together with the
argument-based features, the state-of-the-art baseline features can enjoy a
performance boost (in terms of F1) of 11.01\% in average.

 <dc:description>  We suggest a general approach to quantification of different forms of
uncertainty in regression tasks performed by artificial neural networks. It is
based on the simultaneous training of two neural networks with a joint loss
function. One of the networks performs predictions and the other simultaneously
quantifies the uncertainty of predictions by estimating the locally averaged
loss of the first one. Unlike in many classical uncertainty quantification
methods, the targets are not assumed to be sampled from a probability
distribution of an a priori given form. We analyze how the hyperparameters
affect the learning process and, additionally, show that our method even allows
for better predictions compared to standard neural networks without uncertainty
counterparts. Finally, we show that particular cases of our approach include
maximization of log-likelihood, assuming Gaussian or Laplace noise.

 <dc:description>  Because preferences naturally arise and play an important role in many
real-life decisions, they are at the backbone of various fields. In particular
preferences are increasingly used in almost all matching procedures-based
applications. In this work we highlight the benefit of using AI insights on
preferences in a large scale application, namely the French Admission
Post-Baccalaureat Platform (APB). Each year APB allocates hundreds of thousands
first year applicants to universities. This is done automatically by matching
applicants preferences to university seats. In practice, APB can be unable to
distinguish between applicants which leads to the introduction of random
selection. This has created frustration in the French public since randomness,
even used as a last mean does not fare well with the republican egalitarian
principle. In this work, we provide a solution to this problem. We take
advantage of recent AI Preferences Theory results to show how to enhance APB in
order to improve expressiveness of applicants preferences and reduce their
exposure to random decisions.

 <dc:description>  This letter proposes a multiple parametric dictionary learning algorithm for
direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in presence of array gain-phase error and
mutual coupling. It jointly solves both the DOA estimation and array
imperfection problems to yield a robust DOA estimation in presence of array
imperfection errors and off-grid. In the proposed method, a multiple parametric
dictionary learning-based algorithm with an steepest-descent iteration is used
for learning the parametric perturbation matrices and the steering matrix
simultaneously. It also exploits the multiple snapshots information to enhance
the performance of DOA estimation. Simulation results show the efficiency of
the proposed algorithm when both off-grid problem and array imperfection exist.

 <dc:description>  As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, learning based
optical flow estimation aims to discover the intrinsic correspondence structure
between two adjacent video frames through statistical learning. Therefore, a
key issue to solve in this area is how to effectively model the multi-scale
correspondence structure properties in an adaptive end-to-end learning fashion.
Motivated by this observation, we propose an end-to-end multi-scale
correspondence structure learning (MSCSL) approach for optical flow estimation.
In principle, the proposed MSCSL approach is capable of effectively capturing
the multi-scale inter-image-correlation correspondence structures within a
multi-level feature space from deep learning. Moreover, the proposed MSCSL
approach builds a spatial Conv-GRU neural network model to adaptively model the
intrinsic dependency relationships among these multi-scale correspondence
structures. Finally, the above procedures for correspondence structure learning
and multi-scale dependency modeling are implemented in a unified end-to-end
deep learning framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel computational method to extract information about
interactions among individuals with different behavioral states in a biological
collective from ordinary video recordings. Assuming that individuals are acting
as finite state machines, our method first detects discrete behavioral states
of those individuals and then constructs a model of their state transitions,
taking into account the positions and states of other individuals in the
vicinity. We have tested the proposed method through applications to two
real-world biological collectives: termites in an experimental setting and
human pedestrians in a university campus. For each application, a robust
tracking system was developed in-house, utilizing interactive human
intervention (for termite tracking) or online agent-based simulation (for
pedestrian tracking). In both cases, significant interactions were detected
between nearby individuals with different states, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Dysphagia affects 590 million people worldwide and increases risk for
malnutrition. Pureed food may reduce choking, however preparation differences
impact nutrient density making quality assurance necessary. This paper is the
first study to investigate the feasibility of computational pureed food
nutritional density analysis using an imaging system. Motivated by a
theoretical optical dilution model, a novel deep neural network (DNN) was
evaluated using 390 samples from thirteen types of commercially prepared purees
at five dilutions. The DNN predicted relative concentration of the puree sample
(20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% initial concentration). Data were captured using
same-side reflectance of multispectral imaging data at different polarizations
at three exposures. Experimental results yielded an average top-1 prediction
accuracy of 92.2+/-0.41% with sensitivity and specificity of 83.0+/-15.0% and
95.0+/-4.8%, respectively. This DNN imaging system for nutrient density
analysis of pureed food shows promise as a novel tool for nutrient quality
assurance.

 <dc:description>  Remote sensing (RS) image retrieval based on visual content is of great
significance for geological information mining. Over the past two decades, a
large amount of research on this task has been carried out, which mainly
focuses on the following three core issues of image retrieval: visual feature,
similarity metric and relevance feedback. Along with the advance of these
issues, the technology of RS image retrieval has been developed comparatively
mature. However, due to the complexity and multiformity of high-resolution
remote sensing (HRRS) images, there is still room for improvement in the
current methods on HRRS data retrieval. In this paper, we analyze the three key
aspects of retrieval and provide a comprehensive review on content-based RS
image retrieval methods. Furthermore, for the goal to advance the
state-of-the-art in HRRS image retrieval, we focus on the visual feature aspect
and delve how to use powerful deep representations in this task. We conduct
systematic investigation on evaluating factors that may affect the performance
of deep features. By optimizing each factor, we acquire remarkable retrieval
results on publicly available HRRS datasets. Finally, we explain the
experimental phenomenon in detail and draw instructive conclusions according to
our analysis. Our work can serve as a guiding role for the research of
content-based RS image retrieval.

 <dc:title>A nonuniform popularity-similarity optimization (nPSO) model to

 <dc:description>  The hidden metric space behind complex network topologies is a fervid topic
in current network science and the hyperbolic space is one of the most studied,
because it seems associated to the structural organization of many real complex
systems. The Popularity-Similarity-Optimization (PSO) model simulates how
random geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, reproducing strong
clustering and scale-free degree distribution, however it misses to reproduce
an important feature of real complex networks, which is the community
organization. The Geometrical-Preferential-Attachment (GPA) model was recently
developed to confer to the PSO also a community structure, which is obtained by
forcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to have variable level
of attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be
explicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real
applications. Here, we introduce the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model that,
differently from GPA, forces heterogeneous angular node attractiveness by
sampling the angular coordinates from a tailored nonuniform probability
distribution, for instance a mixture of Gaussians. The nPSO differs from GPA in
other three aspects: it allows to explicitly fix the number and size of
communities; it allows to tune their mixing property through the network
temperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. After
several tests we propose the nPSO as a valid and efficient model to generate
networks with communities in the hyperbolic space, which can be adopted as a
realistic benchmark for different tasks such as community detection and link
prediction.

 <dc:description>  Standard accuracy metrics indicate that reading comprehension systems are
making rapid progress, but the extent to which these systems truly understand
language remains unclear. To reward systems with real language understanding
abilities, we propose an adversarial evaluation scheme for the Stanford
Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). Our method tests whether systems can answer
questions about paragraphs that contain adversarially inserted sentences, which
are automatically generated to distract computer systems without changing the
correct answer or misleading humans. In this adversarial setting, the accuracy
of sixteen published models drops from an average of $75\%$ F1 score to $36\%$;
when the adversary is allowed to add ungrammatical sequences of words, average
accuracy on four models decreases further to $7\%$. We hope our insights will
motivate the development of new models that understand language more precisely.

 <dc:title>Rule-Based Spanish Morphological Analyzer Built From Spell Checking
  Lexicon</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ahn, Natalie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Preprocessing tools for automated text analysis have become more widely
available in major languages, but non-English tools are often still limited in
their functionality. When working with Spanish-language text, researchers can
easily find tools for tokenization and stemming, but may not have the means to
extract more complex word features like verb tense or mood. Yet Spanish is a
morphologically rich language in which such features are often identifiable
from word form. Conjugation rules are consistent, but many special verbs and
nouns take on different rules. While building a complete dictionary of known
words and their morphological rules would be labor intensive, resources to do
so already exist, in spell checkers designed to generate valid forms of known
words. This paper introduces a set of tools for Spanish-language morphological
analysis, built using the COES spell checking tools, to label person, mood,
tense, gender and number, derive a word's root noun or verb infinitive, and
convert verbs to their nominal form.

 <dc:description>  We study which property testing and sublinear time algorithms can be
transformed into graph streaming algorithms for random order streams. Our main
result is that for bounded degree graphs, any property that is constant-query
testable in the adjacency list model can be tested with constant space in a
single-pass in random order streams. Our result is obtained by estimating the
distribution of local neighborhoods of the vertices on a random order graph
stream using constant space.
  We then show that our approach can also be applied to constant time
approximation algorithms for bounded degree graphs in the adjacency list model:
As an example, we obtain a constant-space single-pass random order streaming
algorithms for approximating the size of a maximum matching with additive error
$\epsilon n$ ($n$ is the number of nodes).
  Our result establishes for the first time that a large class of sublinear
algorithms can be simulated in random order streams, while $\Omega(n)$ space is
needed for many graph streaming problems for adversarial orders.

 <dc:description>  Despite recent attempts for solving the person re-identification problem, it
remains a challenging task since a person's appearance can vary significantly
when large variations in view angle, human pose and illumination are involved.
The concept of attention is one of the most interesting recent architectural
innovations in neural networks. Inspired by that, in this paper we propose a
novel approach based on using a gradient-based attention mechanism in deep
convolution neural network for solving the person re-identification problem.
Our model learns to focus selectively on parts of the input image for which the
networks' output is most sensitive to. Extensive comparative evaluations
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
including both traditional and deep neural network-based methods on the
challenging CUHK01 and CUHK03 datasets.

 <dc:description>  Supervisory signals have the potential to make low-dimensional data
representations, like those learned by mixture and topic models, more
interpretable and useful. We propose a framework for training latent variable
models that explicitly balances two goals: recovery of faithful generative
explanations of high-dimensional data, and accurate prediction of associated
semantic labels. Existing approaches fail to achieve these goals due to an
incomplete treatment of a fundamental asymmetry: the intended application is
always predicting labels from data, not data from labels. Our
prediction-constrained objective for training generative models coherently
integrates loss-based supervisory signals while enabling effective
semi-supervised learning from partially labeled data. We derive learning
algorithms for semi-supervised mixture and topic models using stochastic
gradient descent with automatic differentiation. We demonstrate improved
prediction quality compared to several previous supervised topic models,
achieving predictions competitive with high-dimensional logistic regression on
text sentiment analysis and electronic health records tasks while
simultaneously learning interpretable topics.

 <dc:description>  We adopt the perspective of an aggregator, which seeks to coordinate its
purchase of demand reductions from a fixed group of residential electricity
customers, with its sale of the aggregate demand reduction in a two-settlement
wholesale energy market. The aggregator procures reductions in demand by
offering its customers a uniform price for reductions in consumption relative
to their predetermined baselines. Prior to its realization of the aggregate
demand reduction, the aggregator must also determine how much energy to sell
into the two-settlement energy market. In the day-ahead market, the aggregator
commits to a forward contract, which calls for the delivery of energy in the
real-time market. The underlying aggregate demand curve, which relates the
aggregate demand reduction to the aggregator's offered price, is assumed to be
affine and subject to unobservable, random shocks. Assuming that both the
parameters of the demand curve and the distribution of the random shocks are
initially unknown to the aggregator, we investigate the extent to which the
aggregator might dynamically adapt its offered prices and forward contracts to
maximize its expected profit over a time window of $T$ days. Specifically, we
design a dynamic pricing and contract offering policy that resolves the
aggregator's need to learn the unknown demand model with its desire to maximize
its cumulative expected profit over time. In particular, the proposed pricing
policy is proven to incur a regret over $T$ days that is no greater than

 <dc:title>A Sequential Model for Classifying Temporal Relations between

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a sequential model for temporal relation classification between
intra-sentence events. The key observation is that the overall syntactic
structure and compositional meanings of the multi-word context between events
are important for distinguishing among fine-grained temporal relations.
Specifically, our approach first extracts a sequence of context words that
indicates the temporal relation between two events, which well align with the
dependency path between two event mentions. The context word sequence, together
with a parts-of-speech tag sequence and a dependency relation sequence that are
generated corresponding to the word sequence, are then provided as input to
bidirectional recurrent neural network (LSTM) models. The neural nets learn
compositional syntactic and semantic representations of contexts surrounding
the two events and predict the temporal relation between them. Evaluation of
the proposed approach on TimeBank corpus shows that sequential modeling is
capable of accurately recognizing temporal relations between events, which
outperforms a neural net model using various discrete features as input that
imitates previous feature based models.

 <dc:title>Event Coreference Resolution by Iteratively Unfolding Inter-dependencies
  among Events</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Choubey, Prafulla Kumar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Ruihong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel iterative approach for event coreference resolution that
gradually builds event clusters by exploiting inter-dependencies among event
mentions within the same chain as well as across event chains. Among event
mentions in the same chain, we distinguish within- and cross-document event
coreference links by using two distinct pairwise classifiers, trained
separately to capture differences in feature distributions of within- and
cross-document event clusters. Our event coreference approach alternates
between WD and CD clustering and combines arguments from both event clusters
after every merge, continuing till no more merge can be made. And then it
performs further merging between event chains that are both closely related to
a set of other chains of events. Experiments on the ECB+ corpus show that our
model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in joint task of WD and CD event
coreference resolution.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of convergence to a saddle point of a concave-convex
function via gradient dynamics. Since first introduced by Arrow, Hurwicz and
Uzawa in [1] such dynamics have been extensively used in diverse areas, there
are, however, features that render their analysis non trivial. These include
the lack of convergence guarantees when the function considered is not strictly
concave-convex and also the non-smoothness of subgradient dynamics. Our aim in
this two part paper is to provide an explicit characterization to the
asymptotic behaviour of general gradient and subgradient dynamics applied to a
general concave-convex function. We show that despite the nonlinearity and
non-smoothness of these dynamics their $\omega$-limit set is comprised of
trajectories that solve only explicit linear ODEs that are characterized within
the paper.
  More precisely, in Part I an exact characterization is provided to the
asymptotic behaviour of unconstrained gradient dynamics. We also show that when
convergence to a saddle point is not guaranteed then the system behaviour can
be problematic, with arbitrarily small noise leading to an unbounded variance.
In Part II we consider a general class of subgradient dynamics that restrict
trajectories in an arbitrary convex domain, and show that their limiting
trajectories are solutions of subgradient dynamics on only affine subspaces.
The latter is a smooth class of dynamics with an asymptotic behaviour exactly
characterized in Part I, as solutions to explicit linear ODEs. These results
are used to formulate corresponding convergence criteria and are demonstrated
with several examples and applications presented in Part II.

 <dc:description>  3D reconstruction from 2D images is a central problem in computer vision.
Recent works have been focusing on reconstruction directly from a single image.
It is well known however that only one image cannot provide enough information
for such a reconstruction. A prior knowledge that has been entertained are 3D
CAD models due to its online ubiquity. A fundamental question is how to
compactly represent millions of CAD models while allowing generalization to new
unseen objects with fine-scaled geometry. We introduce an approach to compactly
represent a 3D mesh. Our method first selects a 3D model from a graph structure
by using a novel free-form deformation FFD 3D-2D registration, and then the
selected 3D model is refined to best fit the image silhouette. We perform a
comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis that demonstrates
impressive dense and realistic 3D reconstruction from single images.

 <dc:description>  The study of time-varying (dynamic) networks (graphs) is of fundamental
importance for computer network analytics. Several methods have been proposed
to detect the effect of significant structural changes in a time series of
graphs. The main contribution of this work is a detailed analysis of a dynamic
community graph model. This model is formed by adding new vertices, and
randomly attaching them to the existing nodes. It is a dynamic extension of the
well-known stochastic blockmodel. The goal of the work is to detect the time at
which the graph dynamics switches from a normal evolution -- where balanced
communities grow at the same rate -- to an abnormal behavior -- where
communities start merging. In order to circumvent the problem of decomposing
each graph into communities, we use a metric to quantify changes in the graph
topology as a function of time. The detection of anomalies becomes one of
testing the hypothesis that the graph is undergoing a significant structural
change. In addition the the theoretical analysis of the test statistic, we
perform Monte Carlo simulations of our dynamic graph model to demonstrate that
our test can detect changes in graph topology.

 <dc:description>  Over the last decade, the rise of the mobile internet and the usage of mobile
devices has enabled ubiquitous traffic information. With the increased adoption
of specific smartphone applications, the number of users of routing
applications has become large enough to disrupt traffic flow patterns in a
significant manner. Similarly, but at a slightly slower pace, novel services
for freight transportation and city logistics improve the efficiency of goods
transportation and change the use of road infrastructure. The present article
provides a general four-layer framework for modeling these new trends. The main
motivation behind the development is to provide a unifying formal system
description that can at the same time encompass system physics (flow and motion
of vehicles) as well as coordination strategies under various information and
cooperation structures. To showcase the framework, we apply it to the specific
challenge of modeling and analyzing the integration of routing applications in
today's transportation systems. In this framework, at the lowest layer (flow
dynamics) we distinguish app users from non-app users. A distributed parameter
model based on a non-local partial differential equation is introduced and
analyzed. The second layer incorporates connected services (e.g., routing) and
other applications used to optimize the local performance of the system. As
inputs to those applications, we propose a third layer introducing the
incentive design and global objectives, which are typically varying over the
day depending on road and weather conditions, external events etc. The
high-level planning is handled on the fourth layer taking social long-term
objectives into account.

 <dc:title>Speeding up finite-time consensus via minimal polynomial of a weighted

 <dc:creator>Wang, Zheming</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reaching consensus among states of a multi-agent system is a key requirement
for many distributed control/optimization problems. Such a consensus is often
achieved using the standard Laplacian matrix (for continuous system) or Perron
matrix (for discrete-time system). Recent interest in speeding up consensus
sees the development of finite-time consensus algorithms. This work proposes an
approach to speed up finite-time consensus algorithm using the weights of a
weighted Laplacian matrix. The approach is an iterative procedure that finds a
low-order minimal polynomial that is consistent with the topology of the
underlying graph. In general, the lowest-order minimal polynomial achievable
for a network system is an open research problem. This work proposes a
numerical approach that searches for the lowest order minimal polynomial via a
rank minimization problem using a two-step approach: the first being an
optimization problem involving the nuclear norm and the second a correction
step. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the
approach.

approach to address the co-salient object discovery problem based on the fully
convolutional network (FCN) with group input and group output. The proposed
approach captures the group-wise interaction information for group images by
learning a semantics-aware image representation based on a convolutional neural
network, which adaptively learns the group-wise features for co-saliency
detection. Furthermore, the proposed approach discovers the collaborative and
interactive relationships between group-wise feature representation and
single-image individual feature representation, and model this in a
collaborative learning framework. Finally, we set up a unified end-to-end deep
learning scheme to jointly optimize the process of group-wise feature
representation learning and the collaborative learning, leading to more
reliable and robust co-saliency detection results. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with the
state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel formulation of motion planning, for continuous-time
trajectories, as probabilistic inference. We first show how smooth
continuous-time trajectories can be represented by a small number of states
using sparse Gaussian process (GP) models. We next develop an efficient
gradient-based optimization algorithm that exploits this sparsity and Gaussian
process interpolation. We call this algorithm the Gaussian Process Motion
Planner (GPMP). We then detail how motion planning problems can be formulated
as probabilistic inference on a factor graph. This forms the basis for GPMP2, a
very efficient algorithm that combines GP representations of trajectories with
fast, structure-exploiting inference via numerical optimization. Finally, we
extend GPMP2 to an incremental algorithm, iGPMP2, that can efficiently replan
when conditions change. We benchmark our algorithms against several
sampling-based and trajectory optimization-based motion planning algorithms on
planning problems in multiple environments. Our evaluation reveals that GPMP2
is several times faster than previous algorithms while retaining robustness. We
also benchmark iGPMP2 on replanning problems, and show that it can find
successful solutions in a fraction of the time required by GPMP2 to replan from
scratch.

 <dc:description>  We investigate how a neural network can learn perception actions loops for
navigation in unknown environments. Specifically, we consider how to learn to
navigate in environments populated with cul-de-sacs that represent convex local
minima that the robot could fall into instead of finding a set of feasible
actions that take it to the goal. Traditional methods rely on maintaining a
global map to solve the problem of over coming a long cul-de-sac. However, due
to errors induced from local and global drift, it is highly challenging to
maintain such a map for long periods of time. One way to mitigate this problem
is by using learning techniques that do not rely on hand engineered map
representations and instead output appropriate control policies directly from
their sensory input. We first demonstrate that such a problem cannot be solved
directly by deep reinforcement learning due to the sparse reward structure of
the environment. Further, we demonstrate that deep supervised learning also
cannot be used directly to solve this problem. We then investigate network
models that offer a combination of reinforcement learning and supervised
learning and highlight the significance of adding fully differentiable memory
units to such networks. We evaluate our networks on their ability to generalize
to new environments and show that adding memory to such networks offers huge
jumps in performance

 <dc:description>  Semantic 3D mapping can be used for many applications such as robot
navigation and virtual interaction. In recent years, there has been great
progress in semantic segmentation and geometric 3D mapping. However, it is
still challenging to combine these two tasks for accurate and large-scale
semantic mapping from images. In the paper, we propose an incremental and
(near) real-time semantic mapping system. A 3D scrolling occupancy grid map is
built to represent the world, which is memory and computationally efficient and
bounded for large scale environments. We utilize the CNN segmentation as prior
prediction and further optimize 3D grid labels through a novel CRF model.
Superpixels are utilized to enforce smoothness and form robust P N high order
potential. An efficient mean field inference is developed for the graph
optimization. We evaluate our system on the KITTI dataset and improve the
segmentation accuracy by 10% over existing systems.

 <dc:description>  The deep convolutional neural network(CNN) has significantly raised the
performance of image classification and face recognition. Softmax is usually
used as supervision, but it only penalizes the classification loss. In this
paper, we propose a novel auxiliary supervision signal called contrastivecenter
loss, which can further enhance the discriminative power of the features, for
it learns a class center for each class. The proposed contrastive-center loss
simultaneously considers intra-class compactness and inter-class separability,
by penalizing the contrastive values between: (1)the distances of training
samples to their corresponding class centers, and (2)the sum of the distances
of training samples to their non-corresponding class centers. Experiments on
different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of contrastive-center loss.

 <dc:description>  Texture classification is an important and challenging problem in many image
processing applications. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved
significant successes for image classification, texture classification remains
a difficult problem since textures usually do not contain enough information
regarding the shape of object. In image processing, texture classification has
been traditionally studied well with spectral analyses which exploit repeated
structures in many textures. Since CNNs process images as-is in the spatial
domain whereas spectral analyses process images in the frequency domain, these
models have different characteristics in terms of performance. We propose a
novel CNN architecture, wavelet CNNs, which integrates a spectral analysis into
CNNs. Our insight is that the pooling layer and the convolution layer can be
viewed as a limited form of a spectral analysis. Based on this insight, we
generalize both layers to perform a spectral analysis with wavelet transform.
Wavelet CNNs allow us to utilize spectral information which is lost in
conventional CNNs but useful in texture classification. The experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves better accuracy in texture classification
than existing models. We also show that our model has significantly fewer
parameters than CNNs, making our model easier to train with less memory.

 <dc:description>  Neural network-based classifiers parallel or exceed human-level accuracy on
many common tasks and are used in practical systems. Yet, neural networks are
susceptible to adversarial examples, carefully perturbed inputs that cause
networks to misbehave in arbitrarily chosen ways. When generated with standard
methods, these examples do not consistently fool a classifier in the physical
world due to viewpoint shifts, camera noise, and other natural transformations.
Adversarial examples generated using standard techniques require complete
control over direct input to the classifier, which is impossible in many
real-world systems.
  We introduce the first method for constructing real-world 3D objects that
consistently fool a neural network across a wide distribution of angles and
viewpoints. We present a general-purpose algorithm for generating adversarial
examples that are robust across any chosen distribution of transformations. We
demonstrate its application in two dimensions, producing adversarial images
that are robust to noise, distortion, and affine transformation. Finally, we
apply the algorithm to produce arbitrary physical 3D-printed adversarial
objects, demonstrating that our approach works end-to-end in the real world.
Our results show that adversarial examples are a practical concern for
real-world systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a data-driven approach for multi-robot coordination in
partially-observable domains based on Decentralized Partially Observable Markov
Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) and macro-actions (MAs). Dec-POMDPs provide a
general framework for cooperative sequential decision making under uncertainty
and MAs allow temporally extended and asynchronous action execution. To date,
most methods assume the underlying Dec-POMDP model is known a priori or a full
simulator is available during planning time. Previous methods which aim to
address these issues suffer from local optimality and sensitivity to initial
conditions. Additionally, few hardware demonstrations involving a large team of
heterogeneous robots and with long planning horizons exist. This work addresses
these gaps by proposing an iterative sampling based Expectation-Maximization
algorithm (iSEM) to learn polices using only trajectory data containing
observations, MAs, and rewards. Our experiments show the algorithm is able to
achieve better solution quality than the state-of-the-art learning-based
methods. We implement two variants of multi-robot Search and Rescue (SAR)
domains (with and without obstacles) on hardware to demonstrate the learned
policies can effectively control a team of distributed robots to cooperate in a
partially observable stochastic environment.

 <dc:description>  In this work, spatial diversity techniques in the area of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) diffusion-based molecular communications (DBMC) are
investigated. For transmitter-side spatial coding, Alamouti-type coding and
repetition MIMO coding are proposed and analyzed. At the receiver-side,
selection diversity, equal-gain combining, and maximum-ratio combining are
studied as combining strategies. Throughout the numerical analysis, a
symmetrical $2\times 2$ MIMO-DBMC system is assumed. Furthermore, a trained
artificial neural network is utilized to acquire the channel impulse responses.
The numerical analysis demonstrates that it is possible to achieve a diversity
gain in molecular communications. In addition, it is shown that for MIMO-DBMC
systems repetition MIMO coding is superior to Alamouti-type coding.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a massive uncoordinated non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA) scheme where devices have strict latency requirements and no
retransmission opportunities are available. Each device chooses a pilot
sequence from a predetermined set as its signature and transmits its selected
pilot and data simultaneously. A collision occurs when two or more devices
choose the same pilot sequence. Collisions are treated as interference to the
remaining received signals. We consider successive joint decoding (SJD) and
successive interference cancellation (SIC) under a Rayleigh fading and path
loss channel model. We first derive the expression for the outage probability
for the case where devices transmit at the same fixed rate. Then, we derive the
expression for the maximum achievable throughput for the case where devices
transmit with rateless codes. Thus, their code rate is adaptive to the system
conditions, i.e., load, received powers, and interference. Numerical results
verify the accuracy of our analytical expressions. For low data rate
transmissions, results show that SIC performs close to that of SJD in terms of
outage probability for packet arrival rates up to 10 packets per slot. However,
SJD can achieve almost double the throughput of SIC and is, thus, far more
superior.

 <dc:description>  Machine translation is a natural candidate problem for reinforcement learning
from human feedback: users provide quick, dirty ratings on candidate
translations to guide a system to improve. Yet, current neural machine
translation training focuses on expensive human-generated reference
translations. We describe a reinforcement learning algorithm that improves
neural machine translation systems from simulated human feedback. Our algorithm
combines the advantage actor-critic algorithm (Mnih et al., 2016) with the
attention-based neural encoder-decoder architecture (Luong et al., 2015). This
algorithm (a) is well-designed for problems with a large action space and
delayed rewards, (b) effectively optimizes traditional corpus-level machine
translation metrics, and (c) is robust to skewed, high-variance, granular
feedback modeled after actual human behaviors.

 <dc:description>  Scaling regression to large datasets is a common problem in many application
areas. We propose a two step approach to scaling regression to large datasets.
Using a regression tree (CART) to segment the large dataset constitutes the
first step of this approach. The second step of this approach is to develop a
suitable regression model for each segment. Since segment sizes are not very
large, we have the ability to apply sophisticated regression techniques if
required. A nice feature of this two step approach is that it can yield models
that have good explanatory power as well as good predictive performance.
Ensemble methods like Gradient Boosted Trees can offer excellent predictive
performance but may not provide interpretable models. In the experiments
reported in this study, we found that the predictive performance of the
proposed approach matched the predictive performance of Gradient Boosted Trees.

 <dc:description>  We present a point tracking system powered by two deep convolutional neural
networks. The first network, MagicPoint, operates on single images and extracts
salient 2D points. The extracted points are &quot;SLAM-ready&quot; because they are by
design isolated and well-distributed throughout the image. We compare this
network against classical point detectors and discover a significant
performance gap in the presence of image noise. As transformation estimation is
more simple when the detected points are geometrically stable, we designed a
second network, MagicWarp, which operates on pairs of point images (outputs of
MagicPoint), and estimates the homography that relates the inputs. This
transformation engine differs from traditional approaches because it does not
use local point descriptors, only point locations. Both networks are trained
with simple synthetic data, alleviating the requirement of expensive external
camera ground truthing and advanced graphics rendering pipelines. The system is
fast and lean, easily running 30+ FPS on a single CPU.

 <dc:description>  Traffic scene recognition is an important and challenging issue in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Recently, Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) models have achieved great success in many applications,
including scene classification. The remarkable representational learning
capability of CNN remains to be further explored for solving real-world
problems. Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) encoding has also
proved to be a powerful method in catching global contextual information. In
this paper, we attempted to solve the traffic scene recognition problem by
combining the features representational capabilities of CNN with the VLAD
encoding scheme. More specifically, the CNN features of image patches generated
by a region proposal algorithm are encoded by applying VLAD, which subsequently
represent an image in a compact representation. To catch the spatial
information, spatial pyramids are exploited to encode CNN features. We
experimented with a dataset of 10 categories of traffic scenes, with
satisfactory categorization performances.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the secrecy communication in an orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a source sends confidential
information to a destination in the presence of a potential eavesdropper. We
employ wireless powered cooperative jamming to improve the secrecy rate of this
system with the assistance of a cooperative jammer, which works in the
harvest-then-jam protocol over two time-slots. In the first slot, the source
sends dedicated energy signals to power the jammer; in the second slot, the
jammer uses the harvested energy to jam the eavesdropper, in order to protect
the simultaneous secrecy communication from the source to the destination. In
particular, we consider two types of receivers at the destination, namely
Type-I and Type-II receivers, which do not have and have the capability of
canceling the (a-priori known) jamming signals, respectively. For both types of
receivers, we maximize the secrecy rate at the destination by jointly
optimizing the transmit power allocation at the source and the jammer over
sub-carriers, as well as the time allocation between the two time-slots. First,
we present the globally optimal solution to this problem via the Lagrange dual
method, which, however, is of high implementation complexity. Next, to balance
tradeoff between the algorithm complexity and performance, we propose
alternative low-complexity solutions based on minorization maximization and
heuristic successive optimization, respectively. Simulation results show that
the proposed approaches significantly improve the secrecy rate, as compared to
benchmark schemes without joint power and time allocation.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we perform an empirical comparison among the CTC,
RNN-Transducer, and attention-based Seq2Seq models for end-to-end speech
recognition. We show that, without any language model, Seq2Seq and
RNN-Transducer models both outperform the best reported CTC models with a
language model, on the popular Hub5'00 benchmark. On our internal diverse
dataset, these trends continue - RNNTransducer models rescored with a language
model after beam search outperform our best CTC models. These results simplify
the speech recognition pipeline so that decoding can now be expressed purely as
neural network operations. We also study how the choice of encoder architecture
affects the performance of the three models - when all encoder layers are
forward only, and when encoders downsample the input representation

 <dc:description>  We present a conceptually new and flexible method for multi-class open set
classification. Unlike previous methods where unknown classes are inferred with
respect to the feature or decision distance to the known classes, our approach
is able to provide explicit modelling and decision score for unknown classes.
The proposed method, called Gener- ative OpenMax (G-OpenMax), extends OpenMax
by employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) for novel category image
synthesis. We validate the proposed method on two datasets of handwritten
digits and characters, resulting in superior results over previous deep
learning based method OpenMax Moreover, G-OpenMax provides a way to visualize
samples representing the unknown classes from open space. Our simple and
effective approach could serve as a new direction to tackle the challenging
multi-class open set classification problem.

 <dc:description>  Today's search engines process billions of online user queries a day over
huge collections of data. In order to scale, they distribute query processing
among many nodes, where each node holds and searches over a subset of the index
called shard. Responses from some nodes occasionally fail to arrive within a
reasonable time-interval due to various reasons, such as high server load and
network congestion. Search engines typically need to respond in a timely
manner, and therefore skip such tail latency responses, which causes
degradation in search quality. In this paper, we tackle response misses due to
high tail latencies with the goal of maximizing search quality.
  Search providers today use redundancy in the form of Replication for
mitigating response misses, by constructing multiple copies of each shard and
searching all replicas. This approach is not ideal, as it wastes resources on
searching duplicate data. We propose two strategies to reduce this waste.
First, we propose rSmartRed, an optimal shard selection scheme for replicated
indexes. Second, when feasible, we propose to replace Replication with
Repartition, which constructs independent index instances instead of exact
copies. We analytically prove that rSmartRed's selection is optimal for
Replication, and that Repartition achieves better search quality compared to
Replication. We confirm our results with an empirical study using two
real-world datasets, showing that rSmartRed improves recall compared to
currently used approaches. We additionally show that Repartition improves over
Replication in typical scenarios.

 <dc:title>Cooperative Prediction-and-Sensing Based Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes prediction-and-sensing based spectrum sharing, a new
spectrum-sharing model for cognitive radio networks, with a time structure for
each resource block divided into a spectrum prediction-and-sensing phase and a
data transmission phase. Cooperative spectrum prediction is incorporated as a
sub-phase of spectrum sensing in the first phase. We investigate a joint design
of transmit beamforming at the secondary base station (BS) and sensing time.
The primary design goal is to maximize the sum rate of all secondary users
(SUs) subject to the minimum rate requirement for all SUs, the transmit power
constraint at the secondary BS, and the interference power constraints at all
primary users. The original problem is difficult to solve since it is highly
nonconvex. We first convert the problem into a more tractable form, then arrive
at a convex program based on an inner approximation framework, and finally
propose a new algorithm to successively solve this convex program. We prove
that the proposed algorithm iteratively improves the objective while
guaranteeing convergence at least to local optima. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reaches a stationary point after only a
few iterations with a substantial performance improvement over existing
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Offline handwritten text line recognition is a hard task that requires both
an efficient optical character recognizer and language model. Handwriting
recognition state of the art methods are based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
recurrent neural networks (RNN) coupled with the use of linguistic knowledge.
Most of the proposed approaches in the literature focus on improving one of the
two components and use constraint, dedicated to a database lexicon. However,
state of the art performance is achieved by combining multiple optical models,
and possibly multiple language models with the Recognizer Output Voting Error
Reduction (ROVER) framework. Though handwritten line recognition with ROVER has
been implemented by combining only few recognizers because training multiple
complete recognizers is hard. In this paper we propose a Lexicon Verified
ROVER: LV-ROVER, that has a reduce complexity compare to the original one and
that can combine hundreds of recognizers without language models. We achieve
state of the art for handwritten line text on the RIMES dataset.

 <dc:description>  With the ever-growing volume, complexity and dynamicity of online
information, recommender system has been an effective key solution to overcome
such information overload. In recent years, deep learning's revolutionary
advances in speech recognition, image analysis and natural language processing
have gained significant attention. Meanwhile, recent studies also demonstrate
its effectiveness in coping with information retrieval and recommendation
tasks. Applying deep learning techniques into recommender system has been
gaining momentum due to its state-of-the-art performances and high-quality
recommendations. In contrast to traditional recommendation models, deep
learning provides a better understanding of user's demands, item's
characteristics and historical interactions between them.
  This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of recent research
efforts on deep learning based recommender systems towards fostering
innovations of recommender system research. A taxonomy of deep learning based
recommendation models is presented and used to categorize the surveyed
articles. Open problems are identified based on the analytics of the reviewed
works and potential solutions discussed.

 <dc:description>  A graph $G=(V,E)$ is a pairwise compatibility graph (PCG) if there exists an
edge-weighted tree $T$ and two non-negative real numbers $d_{min}$ and
$d_{max}$, $d_{min} \leq d_{max}$, such that each node $u \in V$ is uniquely
associated to a leaf of $T$ and there is an edge $(u,v) \in E$ if and only if
$d_{min} \leq d_{T} (u, v) \leq d_{max}$, where $d_{T} (u, v)$ is the sum of
the weights of the edges on the unique path $P_{T}(u,v)$ from $u$ to $v$ in
$T$. Understanding which graph classes lie inside and which ones outside the
PCG class is an important issue. In this paper we propose a new proof technique
that allows us to show that some interesting classes of graphs have empty
intersection with PCG. As an example, we use this technique to show that wheels
and graphs obtained as strong product between a cycle and $P_2$ are not PCGs.

 <dc:title>Delineation of line patterns in images using B-COSFIRE filters</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Delineation of line patterns in images is a basic step required in various
applications such as blood vessel detection in medical images, segmentation of
rivers or roads in aerial images, detection of cracks in walls or pavements,
etc. In this paper we present trainable B-COSFIRE filters, which are a model of
some neurons in area V1 of the primary visual cortex, and apply it to the
delineation of line patterns in different kinds of images. B-COSFIRE filters
are trainable as their selectivity is determined in an automatic configuration
process given a prototype pattern of interest. They are configurable to detect
any preferred line structure (e.g. segments, corners, cross-overs, etc.), so
usable for automatic data representation learning. We carried out experiments
on two data sets, namely a line-network data set from INRIA and a data set of
retinal fundus images named IOSTAR. The results that we achieved confirm the
robustness of the proposed approach and its effectiveness in the delineation of
line structures in different kinds of images.

 <dc:title>Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point: Reward based Intelligent Vehicle
  Communication using Blockchain</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Singh, Madhusudan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Intelligent vehicle (IV) is experiencing revolutionary growth in research
and industry, but it still suffers from many security vulnerabilities.
Traditional security methods are incapable to provide secure IV communication.
The major issues in IV communication, are trust, data accuracy and reliability
of communication data in the communication channel. Blockchain technology works
for the crypto currency, Bit-coin, which is recently used to build trust and
reliability in peer-to-peer networks having similar topologies as IV
Communication. In this paper, we are proposing, Intelligent Vehicle-Trust Point
(IV-TP) mechanism for IV communication among IVs using Blockchain technology.
The IVs communicated data provides security and reliability using our proposed
IV-TP. Our IV-TP mechanism provides trustworthiness for vehicles behavior, and
vehicles legal and illegal action. Our proposal presents a reward based system,
an exchange of some IV-TP among IVs, during successful communication. For the
data management of the IV-TP, we are using blockchain technology in the
intelligent transportation system (ITS), which stores all IV-TP details of
every vehicle and is accessed ubiquitously by IVs. In this paper, we evaluate
our proposal with the help of intersection use case scenario for intelligent
vehicles communication.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem (CMAB)
with probabilistically triggered arms (PTAs). Under the assumption that the arm
triggering probabilities (ATPs) are positive for all arms, we prove that a
class of upper confidence bound (UCB) policies, named Combinatorial UCB with
exploration rate $\kappa$ (CUCB-$\kappa$), and Combinatorial Thompson Sampling
(CTS), which estimates the expected states of the arms via Thompson sampling,
achieve bounded regret. In addition, we prove that CUCB-$0$ and CTS incur
$O(\sqrt{T})$ gap-independent regret. These results improve the results in
previous works, which show $O(\log T)$ gap-dependent and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$
gap-independent regrets, respectively, under no assumptions on the ATPs. Then,
we numerically evaluate the performance of CUCB-$\kappa$ and CTS in a
real-world movie recommendation problem, where the actions correspond to
recommending a set of movies, the arms correspond to the edges between the
movies and the users, and the goal is to maximize the total number of users
that are attracted by at least one movie. Our numerical results complement our
theoretical findings on bounded regret. Apart from this problem, our results
also directly apply to the online influence maximization (OIM) problem studied
in numerous prior works.

 <dc:description>  Radio-frequency (RF) signals enabled wireless information and power transfer
(WIPT) is a cost-effective technique to achieve two-way communications and at
the same time provide energy supplies for low-power wireless devices. However,
the information transmission in WIPT is vulnerable to the eavesdropping by the
energy receivers (ERs). To achieve secrecy communications with information
nodes (INs) while satisfying the energy transfer requirement of ERs, an
efficient solution is to exploit a dual use of the energy signals also as
useful interference or artificial noise (AN) to interfere with the ERs, thus
preventing against their potential information eavesdropping. Towards this end,
this article provides an overview on the joint design of energy and information
signals to achieve energy-efficient and secure WIPT under various practical
setups, including simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT),
wireless powered cooperative relaying and jamming, and wireless powered
communication networks (WPCN). We also present some research directions that
are worth pursuing in the future.

 <dc:description>  The landscape of cloud computing has significantly changed over the last
decade. Not only have more providers and service offerings crowded the space,
but also cloud infrastructure that was traditionally limited to single provider
data centers is now evolving. In this paper, we firstly discuss the changing
cloud infrastructure and consider the use of infrastructure from multiple
providers and the benefit of decentralising computing away from data centers.
These trends have resulted in the need for a variety of new computing
architectures that will be offered by future cloud infrastructure. These
architectures are anticipated to impact areas, such as connecting people and
devices, data-intensive computing, the service space and self-learning systems.
Finally, we lay out a roadmap of challenges that will need to be addressed for
realising the potential of next generation cloud systems.

 <dc:description>  Patterns stored within pre-trained deep neural networks compose large and
powerful descriptive languages that can be used for many different purposes.
Typically, deep network representations are implemented within vector embedding
spaces, which enables the use of traditional machine learning algorithms on top
of them. In this short paper we propose the construction of a graph embedding
space instead, introducing a methodology to transform the knowledge coded
within a deep convolutional network into a topological space (i.e. a network).
We outline how such graph can hold data instances, data features, relations
between instances and features, and relations among features. Finally, we
introduce some preliminary experiments to illustrate how the resultant graph
embedding space can be exploited through graph analytics algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This study discusses choice behavior using a voting model in which voters can
obtain information from a finite number of previous $r$ voters. Voters vote for
a candidate with a probability proportional to the previous vote ratio, which
is visible to the voters. We obtain the Pitman sampling formula as the
equilibrium distribution of $r$ votes. We present the model as a process of
posting on a bulletin board system, 2ch.net, where users can choose one of many
threads to create a post. We explore how this choice depends on the last $r$
posts and the distribution of these last $r$ posts across threads. We conclude
that the posting process is described by our voting model with analog herders
for a small $r$, which might correspond to the time horizon of users'
responses.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a packet-based dual-rate control strategy to face
time-varying network-induced delays, packet dropouts and packet disorder in a
Networked Control System. Slow-rate sensing enables to achieve energy saving by
reducing network load. In addition, choosing a slower sensing period than the
longest round-trip time delay can avoid packet disorder. On the other hand, a
slow-rate sensing usually degrades control performance in a conventional
control framework. Therefore, including dual-rate control techniques can be
useful to maintain the desired performance, since the controller is able to
generate a fast-rate control signal from a slow-rate sensing signal. A
dual-rate PID controller is used, which can be split into two parts: a
slow-rate PI controller is located at the remote side (with no permanent
communication to the plant) and a fast-rate PD controller, at the local side
(close to the plant, sensor, and inside the actuator, which can offer a low
computation power). In addition, at the remote side, where a powerful
computation device is located, a prediction stage is included in order to
generate the packet of future, estimated slow-rate control actions to be sent
to the local side. At this side, these actions are converted to fast-rate ones
and used when a packet does not arrive due to the network-induced delay or due
to occurring dropouts. The control proposal is able to reach the nominal
(no-dropout, no-delay) performance despite the existence of time-varying delays
and packet dropouts. Via real-time control for a Cartesian robot, results
clearly reveal the superiority of the control approach compared to a previous
authors\' proposal, where the time-varying delays are faced by means of a gain
scheduling control strategy.

 <dc:description>  Natural language inference (NLI) is a central problem in language
understanding. End-to-end artificial neural networks have reached
state-of-the-art performance in NLI field recently.
  In this paper, we propose Character-level Intra Attention Network (CIAN) for
the NLI task. In our model, we use the character-level convolutional network to
replace the standard word embedding layer, and we use the intra attention to
capture the intra-sentence semantics. The proposed CIAN model provides improved
results based on a newly published MNLI corpus.

 <dc:description>  Policy enforcers are sophisticated runtime components that can prevent
failures by enforcing the correct behavior of the software. While a single
enforcer can be easily designed focusing only on the behavior of the
application that must be monitored, the effect of multiple enforcers that
enforce different policies might be hard to predict. So far, mechanisms to
resolve interferences between enforcers have been based on priority mechanisms
and heuristics. Although these methods provide a mechanism to take decisions
when multiple enforcers try to affect the execution at a same time, they do not
guarantee the lack of interference on the global behavior of the system. In
this paper we present a verification strategy that can be exploited to discover
interferences between sets of enforcers and thus safely identify a-priori the
enforcers that can co-exist at run-time. In our evaluation, we experimented our
verification method with several policy enforcers for Android and discovered
some incompatibilities.

 <dc:description>  We present a multi-word atomic (1,N) register for multi-core machines
exploiting Read-Modify-Write (RMW) instructions to coordinate the writer and
the readers in a wait-free manner. Our proposal, called Anonymous Readers
Counting (ARC), enables large-scale data sharing by admitting up to $2^{32}-2$
concurrent readers on off-the-shelf 64-bits machines, as opposed to the most
advanced RMW-based approach which is limited to 58 readers. Further, ARC avoids
multiple copies of the register content when accessing it---this affects
classical register's algorithms based on atomic read/write operations on single
words. Thus it allows for higher scalability with respect to the register size.
Moreover, ARC explicitly reduces improves performance via a proper limitation
of RMW instructions in case of read operations, and by supporting constant time
for read operations and amortized constant time for write operations. A proof
of correctness of our register algorithm is also provided, together with
experimental data for a comparison with literature proposals. Beyond assessing
ARC on physical platforms, we carry out as well an experimentation on
virtualized infrastructures, which shows the resilience of wait-free
synchronization as provided by ARC with respect to CPU-steal times, proper of
more modern paradigms such as cloud computing.

 <dc:description>  List-wise learning to rank methods are considered to be the state-of-the-art.
One of the major problems with these methods is that the ambiguous nature of
relevance labels in learning to rank data is ignored. Ambiguity of relevance
labels refers to the phenomenon that multiple documents may be assigned the
same relevance label for a given query, so that no preference order should be
learned for those documents. In this paper we propose a novel sampling
technique for computing a list-wise loss that can take into account this
ambiguity. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by training a
3-layer deep neural network. We compare our new loss function to two strong
baselines: ListNet and ListMLE. We show that our method generalizes better and
significantly outperforms other methods on the validation and test sets.

 <dc:description>  It has been shown that community detection algorithms work better for
clustering tasks than other, more popular methods, such as k-means. In fact,
network analysis based methods often outperform more widely used methods and do
not suffer from some of the drawbacks we notice elsewhere e.g. the number of
clusters k usually has to be known in advance. However, stochastic block models
which are known to perform well for community detection, have not yet been
tested for this task. We discuss why these models cannot be directly applied to
this problem and test the performance of a generalization of stochastic block
models which work on weighted graphs and compare them to other clustering
techniques.

using RelVis, a toolkit for benchmarking Open Information Extraction systems.
Our comprehensive benchmark contains three data sets from the news domain and
one data set from Wikipedia with overall 4522 labeled sentences and 11243
binary or n-ary OIE relations. In our analysis on these data sets we compared
the performance of four popular OIE systems, ClausIE, OpenIE 4.2, Stanford
OpenIE and PredPatt. In addition, we evaluated the impact of five common error
classes on a subset of 749 n-ary tuples. From our deep analysis we unreveal
important research directions for a next generation of OIE systems.

 <dc:description>  Device-free localization plays an important role in many ubiquitous
applications. Among the different technologies proposed, Wi-Fi based technology
using commercial devices has attracted much attention due to its low cost, ease
of deployment, and high potential for accurate localization. Existing solutions
use either fingerprints that require labor-intensive radio-map survey and
updates, or models constructed from empirical studies with dense deployment of
Wi-Fi transceivers. In this work, we explore the Fresnel Zone Theory in physics
and propose a generic Fresnel Penetration Model (FPM), which reveals the linear
relationship between specific Fresnel zones and multicarrier Fresnel phase
difference, along with the Fresnel phase offset caused by static multipath
environments. We validate FPM in both outdoor and complex indoor environments.
Furthermore, we design a multicarrier FPM based device-free localization system
(MFDL), which overcomes a number of practical challenges, particularly the
Fresnel phase difference estimation and phase offset calibration in
multipath-rich indoor environments. Extensive experimental results show that
compared with the state-of-the-art work (LiFS), our MFDL system achieves better
localization accuracy with much fewer number of Wi-Fi transceivers.
Specifically, using only three transceivers, the median localization error of
MFDL is as low as 45$cm$ in an outdoor environment of 36$m^2$, and 55$cm$ in
indoor settings of 25$m^2$. Increasing the number of transceivers to four
allows us to achieve 75$cm$ median localization error in a 72$m^2$ indoor area,
compared with the 1.1$m$ median localization error achieved by LiFS using 11
transceivers in a 70$m^2$ area.

 <dc:description>  In monocular vision systems, lack of knowledge about metric distances caused
by the inherent scale ambiguity can be a strong limitation for some
applications. We offer a method for fusing inertial measurements with monocular
odometry or tracking to estimate metric distances in inertial-monocular systems
and to increase the rate of pose estimates. As we performed the fusion in a
loosely-coupled manner, each input block can be easily replaced with one's
preference, which makes our method quite flexible. We experimented our method
using the ORB-SLAM algorithm for the monocular tracking input and Euler forward
integration to process the inertial measurements. We chose sets of data
recorded on UAVs to design a suitable system for flying robots.

 <dc:description>  We present a simple method for assessing the quality of generated images in
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The method can be applied in any kind
of GAN without interfering with the learning procedure or affecting the
learning objective. The central idea is to define a likelihood function that
correlates with the quality of the generated images. In particular, we derive a
Gaussian likelihood function from the distribution of the embeddings (hidden
activations) of the real images in the discriminator, and based on this, define
two simple measures of how likely it is that the embeddings of generated images
are from the distribution of the embeddings of the real images. This yields a
simple measure of fitness for generated images, for all varieties of GANs.
Empirical results on CIFAR-10 demonstrate a strong correlation between the
proposed measures and the perceived quality of the generated images.

 <dc:description>  Many use cases of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) require beyond visual
line-of-sight (LOS) communications. Mobile networks offer wide area, high
speed, and secure wireless connectivity, which can enhance control and safety
of UAV operations and enable beyond visual LOS use cases. In this article, we
share some of our experience in Long-Term Evolution (LTE) connectivity for low
altitude small UAVs. We first identify the typical airborne connectivity
requirements and characteristics, highlight the different propagation
conditions for UAVs and mobiles on the ground with measurement and ray tracing
results, and present simulation results to shed light on the feasibility of
providing LTE connectivity for UAVs. We also present several ideas on potential
enhancements for improving LTE connectivity performance and identify fruitful
avenues for future research.

 <dc:description>  Feature selection is playing an increasingly significant role with respect to
many computer vision applications spanning from object recognition to visual
object tracking. However, most of the recent solutions in feature selection are
not robust across different and heterogeneous set of data. In this paper, we
address this issue proposing a robust probabilistic latent graph-based feature
selection algorithm that performs the ranking step while considering all the
possible subsets of features, as paths on a graph, bypassing the combinatorial
problem analytically. An appealing characteristic of the approach is that it
aims to discover an abstraction behind low-level sensory data, that is,
relevancy. Relevancy is modelled as a latent variable in a PLSA-inspired
generative process that allows the investigation of the importance of a feature
when injected into an arbitrary set of cues. The proposed method has been
tested on ten diverse benchmarks, and compared against eleven state of the art
feature selection methods. Results show that the proposed approach attains the
highest performance levels across many different scenarios and difficulties,
thereby confirming its strong robustness while setting a new state of the art
in feature selection domain.

 <dc:description>  Outlier detection is a crucial part of robust evaluation for crowdsourceable
assessment of Quality of Experience (QoE) and has attracted much attention in
recent years. In this paper, we propose some simple and fast algorithms for
outlier detection and robust QoE evaluation based on the nonconvex optimization
principle. Several iterative procedures are designed with or without knowing
the number of outliers in samples. Theoretical analysis is given to show that
such procedures can reach statistically good estimates under mild conditions.
Finally, experimental results with simulated and real-world crowdsourcing
datasets show that the proposed algorithms could produce similar performance to
Huber-LASSO approach in robust ranking, yet with nearly 8 or 90 times speed-up,
without or with a prior knowledge on the sparsity size of outliers,
respectively. Therefore the proposed methodology provides us a set of helpful
tools for robust QoE evaluation with crowdsourcing data.

 <dc:title>Pound: A ROS node for Reducing Delay and Jitter in Wireless Multi-Robot

 <dc:description>  The Robot Operating System (ROS) is rapidly becoming the de facto framework
for building robotics systems, thanks to its flexibility and the large
acceptance that it has received in the robotics community. With the growth of
its popularity, it has started to be used in multi-robot systems as well.
However, the TCP connections that the platform relies on for connecting the
so-called ROS nodes, presents several issues in terms of limited-bandwidth,
delays and jitter, when used in wireless ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we
present a thorough analysis of the problem and propose a new ROS node called
Pound to improve the wireless communication performance. Pound allows the use
of multiple ROS cores and introduces a priority scheme favoring more important
flows over less important ones, thus reducing delay and jitter over single-hop
and multihop networks. We compare Pound to the state-of-the-art solutions and
show that it performs equally well, or better in all the test cases, including
a control-over-network example.

consistency of $\shdlssx$-knowledge bases (KBs) represented in set-theoretic

in the OWL/XML format. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt

 <dc:title>Simple Countermeasures to Mitigate the Effect of Pollution Attack in
  Network Coding Based Peer-to-Peer Live Streaming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Network coding based peer-to-peer streaming represents an effective solution
to aggregate user capacities and to increase system throughput in live
multimedia streaming. Nonetheless, such systems are vulnerable to pollution
attacks where a handful of malicious peers can disrupt the communication by
transmitting just a few bogus packets which are then recombined and relayed by
unaware honest nodes, further spreading the pollution over the network. Whereas
previous research focused on malicious nodes identification schemes and
pollution-resilient coding, in this paper we show pollution countermeasures
which make a standard network coding scheme resilient to pollution attacks.
Thanks to a simple yet effective analytical model of a reference node
collecting packets by malicious and honest neighbors, we demonstrate that i)
packets received earlier are less likely to be polluted and ii) short
generations increase the likelihood to recover a clean generation. Therefore,
we propose a recombination scheme where nodes draw packets to be recombined
according to their age in the input queue, paired with a decoding scheme able
to detect the reception of polluted packets early in the decoding process and
short generations. The effectiveness of our approach is experimentally
evaluated in a real system we developed and deployed on hundreds to thousands
peers. Experimental evidence shows that, thanks to our simple countermeasures,
the effect of a pollution attack is almost canceled and the video quality
experienced by the peers is comparable to pre-attack levels.

 <dc:description>  Existing marker-less motion capture methods often assume known backgrounds,
static cameras, and sequence specific motion priors, which narrows its
application scenarios. Here we propose a fully automatic method that given
multi-view video, estimates 3D human motion and body shape. We take recent
SMPLify \cite{bogo2016keep} as the base method, and extend it in several ways.
First we fit the body to 2D features detected in multi-view images. Second, we
use a CNN method to segment the person in each image and fit the 3D body model
to the contours to further improves accuracy. Third we utilize a generic and
robust DCT temporal prior to handle the left and right side swapping issue
sometimes introduced by the 2D pose estimator. Validation on standard
benchmarks shows our results are comparable to the state of the art and also
provide a realistic 3D shape avatar. We also demonstrate accurate results on
HumanEva and on challenging dance sequences from YouTube in monocular case.

 <dc:description>  As a favorite urban public transport mode, the bike sharing system is a
large-scale and complicated system, and there exists a key requirement that a
user and a bike should be matched sufficiently in time. Such matched behavior
makes analysis of the bike sharing systems more difficult and challenging. This
paper considers a more general large-scale bike sharing system from two
important views: (a) Bikes move in an irreducible path graph, which is related
to geographical structure of the bike sharing system; and (b) Markovian arrival
processes (MAPs) are applied to describe the non-Poisson and burst behavior of
bike-user (abbreviated as user) arrivals, while the burstiness demonstrates
that the user arrivals are time-inhomogeneous and space-heterogeneous in
practice. For such a complicated bike sharing system, this paper establishes a
multiclass closed queueing network by means of some virtual ideas, for example,
bikes are abstracted as virtual customers; stations and roads are regarded as
virtual nodes. Thus user arrivals are related to service times at station
nodes; and users riding bikes on roads are viewed as service times at road
nodes. Further, to deal with this multiclass closed queueing network, we
provide a detailed observation practically on physical behavior of the bike
sharing system in order to establish the routing matrix, which gives a
nonlinear solution to compute the relative arrival rates in terms of the
product-form solution to the steady-state probabilities of joint queue lengths
at the virtual nodes. Based on this, we can compute the steady-state
probability of problematic stations, and also deal with other interesting
performance measures of the bike sharing system. We hope that the methodology
and results of this paper can be applicable in the study of more general bike
sharing systems through multiclass closed queueing networks.

apply this to the task of enhancing the coverage of an existing word

 <dc:description>  The progression of breast cancer can be quantified in lymph node whole-slide
images (WSIs). We describe a novel method for effectively performing
classification of whole-slide images and patient level breast cancer grading.
Our method utilises a deep neural network. The method performs classification
on small patches and uses model averaging for boosting. In the first step,
region of interest patches are determined and cropped automatically by color
thresholding and then classified by the deep neural network. The classification
results are used to determine a slide level class and for further aggregation
to predict a patient level grade. Fast processing speed of our method enables
high throughput image analysis.

 <dc:description>  The paper describes the CAp 2017 challenge. The challenge concerns the
problem of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for tweets written in French. We
first present the data preparation steps we followed for constructing the
dataset released in the framework of the challenge. We begin by demonstrating
why NER for tweets is a challenging problem especially when the number of
entities increases. We detail the annotation process and the necessary
decisions we made. We provide statistics on the inter-annotator agreement, and
we conclude the data description part with examples and statistics for the
data. We, then, describe the participation in the challenge, where 8 teams
participated, with a focus on the methods employed by the challenge
participants and the scores achieved in terms of F$_1$ measure. Importantly,
the constructed dataset comprising $\sim$6,000 tweets annotated for 13 types of
entities, which to the best of our knowledge is the first such dataset in
French, is publicly available at \url{http://cap2017.imag.fr/competition.html} .

 <dc:description>  In this work we present the novel ASTRID method for investigating which
attribute interactions classifiers exploit when making predictions. Attribute
interactions in classification tasks mean that two or more attributes together
provide stronger evidence for a particular class label. Knowledge of such
interactions makes models more interpretable by revealing associations between
attributes. This has applications, e.g., in pharmacovigilance to identify
interactions between drugs or in bioinformatics to investigate associations
between single nucleotide polymorphisms. We also show how the found attribute
partitioning is related to a factorisation of the data generating distribution
and empirically demonstrate the utility of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  A graph with chromatic number $k$ is called $k$-chromatic. Using
computational methods, we show that the smallest triangle-free 6-chromatic
graphs have at least 32 and at most 40 vertices.
  We also determine the complete set of all triangle-free 5-chromatic graphs up
to 23 vertices and all triangle-free 5-chromatic graphs on 24 vertices with
maximum degree at most 7. This implies that Reed's conjecture holds for
triangle-free graphs up to at least 24 vertices. Next to that, we determine
that the smallest regular triangle-free 5-chromatic graphs have 24 vertices.
Finally, we show that the smallest 5-chromatic graphs of girth at least 5 have
at least 29 vertices and that the smallest 4-chromatic graphs of girth at least
6 have at least 25 vertices.

 <dc:description>  Foreground segmentation in video sequences is a classic topic in computer
vision. Due to the lack of semantic and prior knowledge, it is difficult for
existing methods to deal with sophisticated scenes well. Therefore, in this
paper, we propose an end-to-end two-stage deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) framework for foreground segmentation in video sequences. In the first
stage, a convolutional encoder-decoder sub-network is employed to reconstruct
the background images and encode rich prior knowledge of background scenes. In
the second stage, the reconstructed background and current frame are input into
a multi-channel fully-convolutional sub-network (MCFCN) for accurate foreground
segmentation. In the two-stage CNN, the reconstruction loss and segmentation
loss are jointly optimized. The background images and foreground objects are
output simultaneously in an end-to-end way. Moreover, by incorporating the
prior semantic knowledge of foreground and background in the pre-training
process, our method could restrain the background noise and keep the integrity
of foreground objects at the same time. Experiments on CDNet 2014 show that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art by 4.9%.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposed a method for stock prediction. In terms of feature
extraction, we extract the features of stock-related news besides stock prices.
We first select some seed words based on experience which are the symbols of
good news and bad news. Then we propose an optimization method and calculate
the positive polar of all words. After that, we construct the features of news
based on the positive polar of their words. In consideration of sequential
stock prices and continuous news effects, we propose a recurrent neural network
model to help predict stock prices. Compared to SVM classifier with price
features, we find our proposed method has an over 5% improvement on stock
prediction accuracy in experiments.

 <dc:title>Transition-Based Generation from Abstract Meaning Representations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schick, Timo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work addresses the task of generating English sentences from Abstract
Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. To cope with this task, we transform each
input AMR graph into a structure similar to a dependency tree and annotate it
with syntactic information by applying various predefined actions to it.
Subsequently, a sentence is obtained from this tree structure by visiting its
nodes in a specific order. We train maximum entropy models to estimate the
probability of each individual action and devise an algorithm that efficiently
approximates the best sequence of actions to be applied. Using a substandard
language model, our generator achieves a Bleu score of 27.4 on the LDC2014T12
test set, the best result reported so far without using silver standard
annotations from another corpus as additional training data.

 <dc:description>  The massive spread of digital misinformation has been identified as a major
global risk and has been alleged to influence elections and threaten
democracies. Communication, cognitive, social, and computer scientists are
engaged in efforts to study the complex causes for the viral diffusion of
misinformation online and to develop solutions, while search and social media
platforms are beginning to deploy countermeasures. However, to date, these
efforts have been mainly informed by anecdotal evidence rather than systematic
data. Here we analyze 14 million messages spreading 400 thousand claims on
Twitter during and following the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and election.
We find evidence that social bots play a disproportionate role in spreading and
repeating misinformation. Automated accounts are particularly active in
amplifying misinformation in the very early spreading moments, before a claim
goes viral. Bots target users with many followers through replies and mentions,
and may disguise their geographic locations. Humans are vulnerable to this
manipulation, retweeting bots who post misinformation. Successful sources of
false and misleading claims are heavily supported by social bots. These results
suggest that curbing social bots may be an effective strategy for mitigating
the spread of online misinformation.

 <dc:title>'Dark Germany': Hidden Patterns of Participation in Online Far-Right
  Protests Against Refugee Housing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schelter, Sebastian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kunegis, J&#xe9;r&#xf4;me</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The political discourse in Western European countries such as Germany has
recently seen a resurgence of the topic of refugees, fueled by an influx of
refugees from various Middle Eastern and African countries. Even though the
topic of refugees evidently plays a large role in online and offline politics
of the affected countries, the fact that protests against refugees stem from
the right-wight political spectrum has lead to corresponding media to be shared
in a decentralized fashion, making an analysis of the underlying social and
mediatic networks difficult. In order to contribute to the analysis of these
processes, we present a quantitative study of the social media activities of a
contemporary nationwide protest movement against local refugee housing in
Germany, which organizes itself via dedicated Facebook pages per city. We
analyse data from 136 such protest pages in 2015, containing more than 46,000
posts and more than one million interactions by more than 200,000 users. In
order to learn about the patterns of communication and interaction among users
of far-right social media sites and pages, we investigate the temporal
characteristics of the social media activities of this protest movement, as
well as the connectedness of the interactions of its participants. We find
several activity metrics such as the number of posts issued, discussion volume
about crime and housing costs, negative polarity in comments, and user
engagement to peak in late 2015, coinciding with chancellor Angela Merkel's
much criticized decision of September 2015 to temporarily admit the entry of
Syrian refugees to Germany. Furthermore, our evidence suggests a low degree of
direct connectedness of participants in this movement, (i.a., indicated by a
lack of geographical collaboration patterns), yet we encounter a strong
affiliation of the pages' user base with far-right political parties.

 <dc:description>  In adversarial training, a set of models learn together by pursuing competing
goals, usually defined on single data instances. However, in relational
learning and other non-i.i.d domains, goals can also be defined over sets of
instances. For example, a link predictor for the is-a relation needs to be
consistent with the transitivity property: if is-a(x_1, x_2) and is-a(x_2, x_3)
hold, is-a(x_1, x_3) needs to hold as well. Here we use such assumptions for
deriving an inconsistency loss, measuring the degree to which the model
violates the assumptions on an adversarially-generated set of examples. The
training objective is defined as a minimax problem, where an adversary finds
the most offending adversarial examples by maximising the inconsistency loss,
and the model is trained by jointly minimising a supervised loss and the
inconsistency loss on the adversarial examples. This yields the first method
that can use function-free Horn clauses (as in Datalog) to regularise any
neural link predictor, with complexity independent of the domain size. We show
that for several link prediction models, the optimisation problem faced by the
adversary has efficient closed-form solutions. Experiments on link prediction
benchmarks indicate that given suitable prior knowledge, our method can
significantly improve neural link predictors on all relevant metrics.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a model to learn multimodal multilingual
representations for matching images and sentences in different languages, with
the aim of advancing multilingual versions of image search and image
understanding. Our model learns a common representation for images and their
descriptions in two different languages (which need not be parallel) by
considering the image as a pivot between two languages. We introduce a new
pairwise ranking loss function which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric
similarity between the two modalities. We evaluate our models on
image-description ranking for German and English, and on semantic textual
similarity of image descriptions in English. In both cases we achieve
state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have become a primary tool for solving problems in many
fields. They are also used for addressing information retrieval problems and
show strong performance in several tasks. Training these models requires large,
representative datasets and for most IR tasks, such data contains sensitive
information from users. Privacy and confidentiality concerns prevent many data
owners from sharing the data, thus today the research community can only
benefit from research on large-scale datasets in a limited manner. In this
paper, we discuss privacy preserving mimic learning, i.e., using predictions
from a privacy preserving trained model instead of labels from the original
sensitive training data as a supervision signal. We present the results of
preliminary experiments in which we apply the idea of mimic learning and
privacy preserving mimic learning for the task of document re-ranking as one of
the core IR tasks. This research is a step toward laying the ground for
enabling researchers from data-rich environments to share knowledge learned
from actual users' data, which should facilitate research collaborations.

 <dc:title>Vision-Based Fallen Person Detection for the Elderly</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Falls are serious and costly for elderly people. The Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention of the US reports that millions of older people, 65 and
older, fall each year at least once. Serious injuries such as; hip fractures,
broken bones or head injury, are caused by 20% of the falls. The time it takes
to respond and treat a fallen person is crucial. With this paper we present a
new , non-invasive system for fallen people detection. Our approach uses only
stereo camera data for passively sensing the environment. The key novelty is a
human fall detector which uses a CNN based human pose estimator in combination
with stereo data to reconstruct the human pose in 3D and estimate the ground
plane in 3D. Furthermore, our system consists of a reasoning module which
formulates a number of measures to reason whether a person is fallen. We have
tested our approach in different scenarios covering most activities elderly
people might encounter living at home. Based on our extensive evaluations, our
systems shows high accuracy and almost no miss-classification. To reproduce our
results, the implementation is publicly available to the scientific community.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: To develop a deep learning approach to digitally-stain optical
coherence tomography (OCT) images of the optic nerve head (ONH).
  Methods: A horizontal B-scan was acquired through the center of the ONH using
OCT (Spectralis) for 1 eye of each of 100 subjects (40 normal &amp; 60 glaucoma).
All images were enhanced using adaptive compensation. A custom deep learning
network was then designed and trained with the compensated images to digitally
stain (i.e. highlight) 6 tissue layers of the ONH. The accuracy of our
algorithm was assessed (against manual segmentations) using the Dice
coefficient, sensitivity, and specificity. We further studied how compensation
and the number of training images affected the performance of our algorithm.
  Results: For images it had not yet assessed, our algorithm was able to
digitally stain the retinal nerve fiber layer + prelamina, the retinal pigment
epithelium, all other retinal layers, the choroid, and the peripapillary sclera
and lamina cribrosa. For all tissues, the mean dice coefficient was $0.84 \pm
0.03$, the mean sensitivity $0.92 \pm 0.03$, and the mean specificity $0.99 \pm
0.00$. Our algorithm performed significantly better when compensated images
were used for training. Increasing the number of images (from 10 to 40) to
train our algorithm did not significantly improve performance, except for the
RPE.
  Conclusion. Our deep learning algorithm can simultaneously stain neural and
connective tissues in ONH images. Our approach offers a framework to
automatically measure multiple key structural parameters of the ONH that may be
critical to improve glaucoma management.

 <dc:description>  Plants monitor their surrounding environment and control their physiological
functions by producing an electrical response. We recorded electrical signals
from different plants by exposing them to Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Ozone (O3)
and Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) under laboratory conditions. After applying
pre-processing techniques such as filtering and drift removal, we extracted few
statistical features from the acquired plant electrical signals. Using these
features, combined with different classification algorithms, we used a decision
tree based multi-class classification strategy to identify the three different
external chemical stimuli. We here present our exploration to obtain the
optimum set of ranked feature and classifier combination that can separate a
particular chemical stimulus from the incoming stream of plant electrical
signals. The paper also reports an exhaustive comparison of similar feature
based classification using the filtered and the raw plant signals, containing
the high frequency stochastic part and also the low frequency trends present in
it, as two different cases for feature extraction. The work, presented in this
paper opens up new possibilities for using plant electrical signals to monitor
and detect other environmental stimuli apart from NaCl, O3 and H2SO4 in future.

 <dc:description>  To realize the premise of the Semantic Web towards knowledgeable machines,
one might often integrate an application with emerging RDF graphs.
Nevertheless, capturing the content of a rich and open RDF graph by existing
tools requires both time and expertise. We demonstrate eLinda - an explorer for
Linked Data. The challenge addressed by eLinda is that of understanding the
rich content of a given RDF graph. The core functionality is an exploration
path, where each step produces a bar chart (histogram) that visualizes the
distribution of classes in a set of nodes (URIs). In turn, each bar represents
a set of nodes that can be further expanded through the bar chart in the path.
We allow three types of explorations: subclass distribution, property
distribution, and object distribution for a property of choice.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave massive MIMO with lens antenna array can considerably reduce
the number of required radio-frequency (RF) chains by beam selection. However,
beam selection requires the base station to acquire the accurate information of
beamspace channel. This is a challenging task, as the size of beamspace channel
is large while the number of RF chains is limited. In this paper, we
investigate the beamspace channel estimation problem in mmWave massive MIMO
systems with lens antenna array. Specifically, we first design an adaptive
selecting network for mmWave massive MIMO systems with lens antenna array, and
based on this network, we further formulate the beamspace channel estimation
problem as a sparse signal recovery problem. Then, by fully utilizing the
structural characteristics of mmWave beamspace channel, we propose a support
detection (SD)-based channel estimation scheme with reliable performance and
low pilot overhead. Finally, the performance and complexity analyses are
provided to prove that the proposed SD-based channel estimation scheme can
estimate the support of sparse beamspace channel with comparable or higher
accuracy than conventional schemes. Simulation results verify that the proposed
SD-based channel estimation scheme outperforms conventional schemes and enjoys
satisfying accuracy, even in the low SNR region as the structural
characteristics of beamspace channel can be exploited.

 <dc:title>Improve Lexicon-based Word Embeddings By Word Sense Disambiguation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There have been some works that learn a lexicon together with the corpus to
improve the word embeddings. However, they either model the lexicon separately
but update the neural networks for both the corpus and the lexicon by the same
likelihood, or minimize the distance between all of the synonym pairs in the
lexicon. Such methods do not consider the relatedness and difference of the
corpus and the lexicon, and may not be the best optimized. In this paper, we
propose a novel method that considers the relatedness and difference of the
corpus and the lexicon. It trains word embeddings by learning the corpus to
predicate a word and its corresponding synonym under the context at the same
time. For polysemous words, we use a word sense disambiguation filter to
eliminate the synonyms that have different meanings for the context. To
evaluate the proposed method, we compare the performance of the word embeddings
trained by our proposed model, the control groups without the filter or the
lexicon, and the prior works in the word similarity tasks and text
classification task. The experimental results show that the proposed model
provides better embeddings for polysemous words and improves the performance
for text classification.

 <dc:description>  It has been shown that increasing model depth improves the quality of neural
machine translation. However, different architectural variants to increase
model depth have been proposed, and so far, there has been no thorough
comparative study.
  In this work, we describe and evaluate several existing approaches to
introduce depth in neural machine translation. Additionally, we explore novel
architectural variants, including deep transition RNNs, and we vary how
attention is used in the deep decoder. We introduce a novel &quot;BiDeep&quot; RNN
architecture that combines deep transition RNNs and stacked RNNs.
  Our evaluation is carried out on the English to German WMT news translation
dataset, using a single-GPU machine for both training and inference. We find
that several of our proposed architectures improve upon existing approaches in
terms of speed and translation quality. We obtain best improvements with a
BiDeep RNN of combined depth 8, obtaining an average improvement of 1.5 BLEU
over a strong shallow baseline.
  We release our code for ease of adoption.

 <dc:description>  Sensing in complex systems requires large-scale information exchange and
on-the-go communications over heterogeneous networks and integrated processing
platforms. Many networked cyber-physical systems exhibit hierarchical
infrastructures of information flows, which naturally leads to a multi-level
tree-like information structure in which each level corresponds to a particular
scale of representation. This work focuses on the multiscale fusion of data
collected at multiple levels of the system. We propose a multiscale state-space
model to represent multi-resolution data over the hierarchical information
system and formulate a multi-stage dynamic zero-sum game to design a
multi-scale $H_{\infty}$ robust filter. We present numerical experiments for
one and two-dimensional signals and provide a comparative analysis of the
minimax filter with the standard Kalman filter to show the improvement in
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

 <dc:title>Partial Field Coverage Based on Two Path Planning Patterns</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Plessen, Mogens Graf</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a path planning method for partial field coverage. We
therefore propose to use a specific path planning pattern. Guiding notion is
that lighter machinery with smaller storage tanks can alleviate soil
compaction, but does not permit to cover a given field in a single run, for
example, during a spraying application. Instead, multiple returns to a mobile
or stationary depot located outside of the field are required for storage tank
refilling. We therefore suggest a suitable path planning method that accounts
for the limited turning radii of agricultural vehicles, satisfies repressed
area minimisation constraints, and aims at overall path length minimisation.
The benefits of the proposed method are illustrated by means of a comparison to
a method that is based on a S-shaped planning motif. It is illustrated how the
proposed path planning pattern can also be employed efficiently for single-run
field coverage.

 <dc:description>  The computational complexity of solving nonlinear support vector machine
(SVM) is prohibitive on large-scale data. In particular, this issue becomes
very sensitive when the data represents additional difficulties such as highly
imbalanced class sizes. Typically, nonlinear kernels produce significantly
higher classification quality to linear kernels but introduce extra kernel and
model parameters. Thus, the parameter fitting is required to increase the
quality but it reduces the performance dramatically. We introduce a generalized
fast multilevel framework for SVM and discuss several versions of its
algorithmic components that lead to a good trade-off between quality and time.
Our framework is implemented using PETSc which allows integration with
scientific computing tasks. The experimental results demonstrate significant
speed up compared to the state-of-the-art SVM libraries.

 <dc:title>An Improved Approximate Consensus Algorithm in the Presence of Mobile
  Faults</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tseng, Lewis</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper explores the problem of reaching approximate consensus in
synchronous point-to-point networks, where each pair of nodes is able to
communicate with each other directly and reliably. We consider the mobile
Byzantine fault model proposed by Garay '94 -- in the model, an omniscient
adversary can corrupt up to $f$ nodes in each round, and at the beginning of
each round, faults may &quot;move&quot; in the system (i.e., different sets of nodes may
become faulty in different rounds). Recent work by Bonomi et al. '16 proposed a
simple iterative approximate consensus algorithm which requires at least $4f+1$
nodes. This paper proposes a novel technique of using &quot;confession&quot; (a mechanism
to allow others to ignore past behavior) and a variant of reliable broadcast to
improve the fault-tolerance level. In particular, we present an approximate
consensus algorithm that requires only $\lceil 7f/2\rceil + 1$ nodes, an
$\lfloor f/2 \rfloor$ improvement over the state-of-the-art algorithms.
Moreover, we also show that the proposed algorithm is optimal within a family
of round-based algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Discussion forums are an important source of information. They are often used
to answer specific questions a user might have and to discover more about a
topic of interest. Discussions in these forums may evolve in intricate ways,
making it difficult for users to follow the flow of ideas. We propose a novel
approach for automatically identifying the underlying thread structure of a
forum discussion. Our approach is based on a neural model that computes
coherence scores of possible reconstructions and then selects the highest
scoring, i.e., the most coherent one. Preliminary experiments demonstrate
promising results outperforming a number of strong baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  We address the challenge of computing search paths in real-time for subsea
applications where the goal is to locate an unknown number of targets on the
seafloor. Our approach maximizes a formal definition of search effectiveness
given finite search effort. We account for false positive measurements and
variation in the performance of the search sensor due to geographic variation
of the seafloor. We compare near-optimal search paths that can be computed in
real-time with optimal search paths for which real-time computation is
infeasible. We show how sonar data acquired for locating targets at a specific
location can also be used to characterize the performance of the search sonar
at that location. Our approach is illustrated with numerical experiments where
search paths are planned using sonar data previously acquired from Boston
Harbor.

 <dc:title>E-QED: Electrical Bug Localization During Post-Silicon Validation
  Enabled by Quick Error Detection and Formal Methods</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  During post-silicon validation, manufactured integrated circuits are
extensively tested in actual system environments to detect design bugs. Bug
localization involves identification of a bug trace (a sequence of inputs that
activates and detects the bug) and a hardware design block where the bug is
located. Existing bug localization practices during post-silicon validation are
mostly manual and ad hoc, and, hence, extremely expensive and time consuming.
This is particularly true for subtle electrical bugs caused by unexpected
interactions between a design and its electrical state. We present E-QED, a new
approach that automatically localizes electrical bugs during post-silicon
validation. Our results on the OpenSPARC T2, an open-source
500-million-transistor multicore chip design, demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of E-QED: starting with a failed post-silicon test, in a few hours
(9 hours on average) we can automatically narrow the location of the bug to
(the fan-in logic cone of) a handful of candidate flip-flops (18 flip-flops on
average for a design with ~ 1 Million flip-flops) and also obtain the
corresponding bug trace. The area impact of E-QED is ~2.5%. In contrast,
deter-mining this same information might take weeks (or even months) of mostly
manual work using traditional approaches.

 <dc:description>  Telepresence is a necessity for present time as we can't reach everywhere and
also it is useful in saving human life at dangerous places. A robot, which
could be controlled from a distant location, can solve these problems. This
could be via communication waves or networking methods. Also controlling should
be in real time and smooth so that it can actuate on every minor signal in an
effective way. This paper discusses a method to control a robot over the
network from a distant location. The robot was controlled by hand gestures
which were captured by the live camera. A DSP board TMS320DM642EVM was used to
implement image pre-processing and fastening the whole system. PCA was used for
gesture classification and robot actuation was done according to predefined
procedures. Classification information was sent over the network in the
experiment. This method is robust and could be used to control any kind of
robot over distance.

 <dc:description>  Electronic Health Records are electronic data generated during or as a
byproduct of routine patient care. Structured, semi-structured and unstructured
EHR offer researchers unprecedented phenotypic breadth and depth and have the
potential to accelerate the development of precision medicine approaches at
scale. A main EHR use-case is defining phenotyping algorithms that identify
disease status, onset and severity. Phenotyping algorithms utilize diagnoses,
prescriptions, laboratory tests, symptoms and other elements in order to
identify patients with or without a specific trait. No common standardized,
structured, computable format exists for storing phenotyping algorithms. The
majority of algorithms are stored as human-readable descriptive text documents
making their translation to code challenging due to their inherent complexity
and hinders their sharing and re-use across the community. In this paper, we
evaluate the two key Semantic Web Technologies, the Web Ontology Language and
the Resource Description Framework, for enabling computable representations of
EHR-driven phenotyping algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Rural areas in the developing countries are predominantly devoid of Internet
access as it is not viable for operators to provide broadband service in these
areas. To solve this problem, we propose a middle mile Long erm Evolution
Advanced (LTE-A) network operating in TV white space to connect villages to an
optical Point of Presence (PoP) located in the vicinity of a rural area. We
study the problem of spectrum sharing for the middle mile networks deployed by
multiple operators. A graph theory based Fairness Constrained Channel
Allocation (FCCA) algorithm is proposed, employing Carrier Aggregation (CA) and
Listen Before Talk (LBT) features of LTE-A. We perform extensive system level
simulations to demonstrate that FCCA not only increases spectral efficiency but
also improves system fairness.

 <dc:description>  The number of scientific articles has grown rapidly over the years and there
are no signs that this growth will slow down in the near future. Because of
this, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep up with the latest developments
in a scientific field. To address this problem, we present here an approach to
help researchers learn about the latest developments and findings by extracting
in a normalized form core claims from scientific articles. This normalized
representation is a controlled natural language of English sentences called
AIDA, which has been proposed in previous work as a method to formally
structure and organize scientific findings and discourse. We show how such AIDA
sentences can be automatically extracted by detecting the core claim of an
article, checking for AIDA compliance, and - if necessary - transforming it
into a compliant sentence. While our algorithm is still far from perfect, our
results indicate that the different steps are feasible and they support the
claim that AIDA sentences might be a promising approach to improve scientific
communication in the future.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss the feasibility of monitoring partially synchronous
distributed systems to detect latent bugs, i.e., errors caused by concurrency
and race conditions among concurrent processes. We present a monitoring
framework where we model both system constraints and latent bugs as
Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) formulas, and we detect the presence of
latent bugs using an SMT solver. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework using both synthetic applications where latent bugs occur at any time
with random probability and an application involving exclusive access to a
shared resource with a subtle timing bug. We illustrate how the time required
for verification is affected by parameters such as communication frequency,
latency, and clock skew. Our results show that our framework can be used for
real-life applications, and because our framework uses SMT solvers, the range
of appropriate applications will increase as these solvers become more
efficient over time.

 <dc:description>  The effective of information retrieval (IR) systems have become more
important than ever. Deep IR models have gained increasing attention for its
ability to automatically learning features from raw text; thus, many deep IR
models have been proposed recently. However, the learning process of these deep
IR models resemble a black box. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the
difference between automatically learned features by deep IR models and
hand-crafted features used in traditional learning to rank approaches.
Furthermore, it is valuable to investigate the differences between these deep
IR models. This paper aims to conduct a deep investigation on deep IR models.
Specifically, we conduct an extensive empirical study on two different
datasets, including Robust and LETOR4.0. We first compared the automatically
learned features and hand-crafted features on the respects of query term
coverage, document length, embeddings and robustness. It reveals a number of
disadvantages compared with hand-crafted features. Therefore, we establish
guidelines for improving existing deep IR models. Furthermore, we compare two
different categories of deep IR models, i.e. representation-focused models and
interaction-focused models. It is shown that two types of deep IR models focus
on different categories of words, including topic-related words and
query-related words.

 <dc:title>Per-instance Differential Privacy and the Adaptivity of Posterior
  Sampling in Linear and Ridge regression</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Yu-Xiang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Differential privacy (DP), ever since its advent, has been a controversial
object. On the one hand, it provides strong provable protection of individuals
in a data set, on the other hand, it has been heavily criticized for being not
practical, partially due to its complete independence to the actual data set it
tries to protect. In this paper, we address this issue by a new and more
fine-grained notion of differential privacy --- per instance differential
privacy (pDP), which captures the privacy of a specific individual with respect
to a fixed data set. We show that this is a strict generalization of the
standard DP and inherits all its desirable properties, e.g., composition,
invariance to side information and closedness to postprocessing, except that
they all hold for every instance separately. When the data is drawn from a
distribution, we show that per-instance DP implies generalization. Moreover, we
provide explicit calculations of the per-instance DP for the output
perturbation on a class of smooth learning problems. The result reveals an
interesting and intuitive fact that an individual has stronger privacy if
he/she has small &quot;leverage score&quot; with respect to the data set and if he/she
can be predicted more accurately using the leave-one-out data set. Using the
developed techniques, we provide a novel analysis of the One-Posterior-Sample
(OPS) estimator and show that when the data set is well-conditioned it provides
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-pDP for any target individuals and matches the exact lower
bound up to a $1+\tilde{O}(n^{-1}\epsilon^{-2})$ multiplicative factor. We also
propose AdaOPS which uses adaptive regularization to achieve the same results
with $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. Simulation shows several orders-of-magnitude more
favorable privacy and utility trade-off when we consider the privacy of only
the users in the data set.

 <dc:description>  Research in statistical relational learning has produced a number of methods
for learning relational models from large-scale network data. While these
methods have been successfully applied in various domains, they have been
developed under the unrealistic assumption of full data access. In practice,
however, the data are often collected by crawling the network, due to
proprietary access, limited resources, and privacy concerns. Recently, we
showed that the parameter estimates for relational Bayes classifiers computed
from network samples collected by existing network crawlers can be quite
inaccurate, and developed a crawl-aware estimation method for such models
(Yang, Ribeiro, and Neville, 2017). In this work, we extend the methodology to
learning relational logistic regression models via stochastic gradient descent
from partial network crawls, and show that the proposed method yields accurate
parameter estimates and confidence intervals.

 <dc:title>Amortized entanglement of a quantum channel and approximately

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper defines the amortized entanglement of a quantum channel as the
largest difference in entanglement between the output and the input of the
channel, where entanglement is quantified by an arbitrary entanglement measure.
We prove that the amortized entanglement of a channel obeys several desirable
properties, and we also consider special cases such as the amortized relative
entropy of entanglement and the amortized Rains relative entropy. These latter
quantities are shown to be single-letter upper bounds on the
secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of a quantum channel,
respectively. Of especial interest is a uniform continuity bound for these
latter two special cases of amortized entanglement, in which the deviation
between the amortized entanglement of two channels is bounded from above by a
simple function of the diamond norm of their difference and the output
dimension of the channels. We then define approximately teleportation- and
positive-partial-transpose-simulable (PPT-simulable) channels as those that are
close in diamond norm to a channel which is either exactly teleportation- or
PPT-simulable, respectively. These results then lead to single-letter upper
bounds on the secret-key-agreement and PPT-assisted quantum capacities of
channels that are approximately teleportation- or PPT-simulable, respectively.
Finally, we generalize many of the concepts in the paper to the setting of
general resource theories, defining the amortized resourcefulness of a channel
and the notion of $\nu$-freely-simulable channels, connecting these concepts in
an operational way as well.

 <dc:description>  Given a set of strings, the shortest common superstring problem is to find
the shortest possible string that contains all the input strings. The problem
is NP-hard, but a lot of work has gone into designing approximation algorithms
for solving the problem. We present the first time and space efficient
implementation of the classic greedy heuristic which merges strings in
decreasing order of overlap length. Our implementation works in $O(n \log
\sigma)$ time and bits of space, where $n$ is the total length of the input
strings in characters, and $\sigma$ is the size of the alphabet. After index
construction, a practical implementation of our algorithm uses roughly $5 n
\log \sigma$ bits of space and reasonable time for a real dataset that consists
of DNA fragments.

 <dc:description>  We propose a model for the joint segmentation of the liver and liver lesions
in computed tomography (CT) volumes. We build the model from two fully
convolutional networks, connected in tandem and trained together end-to-end. We
evaluate our approach on the 2017 MICCAI Liver Tumour Segmentation Challenge,
attaining competitive liver and liver lesion detection and segmentation scores
across a wide range of metrics. Unlike other top performing methods, we do not
post-process model outputs, we do not use data external to the challenge, and
we propose a simple single-stage model that is trained end-to-end. However, our
method nearly matches the top lesion segmentation performance and achieves the
second highest precision for lesion detection while maintaining high recall.

 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency is a crucial performance metric in sensor networks,
directly determining the network lifetime. Consequently, a key factor in WSN is
to improve overall energy efficiency to extend the network lifetime. Although
many algorithms have been presented to optimize the energy factor, energy
efficiency is still one of the major problems of WSNs, especially when there is
a need to sample an area with different types of loads. Unlike other
energy-efficient schemes for hierarchical sampling, our hypothesis is that it
is achievable, in terms of prolonging the network lifetime, to adaptively
re-modify CHs sensing rates (the processing and transmitting stages in
particular) in some specific regions that are triggered significantly less than
other regions. In order to do so we introduce the Adaptive Distributed
Hierarchical Sensing (ADHS) algorithm. This algorithm employs a homogenous
sensor network in a distributed fashion and changes the sampling rates of the
CHs based on the variance of the sampled data without damaging significantly
the accuracy of the sensed area.

 <dc:title>Detection of curved lines with B-COSFIRE filters: A case study on crack

 <dc:description>  The detection of curvilinear structures is an important step for various
computer vision applications, ranging from medical image analysis for
segmentation of blood vessels, to remote sensing for the identification of
roads and rivers, and to biometrics and robotics, among others. %The visual
system of the brain has remarkable abilities to detect curvilinear structures
in noisy images. This is a nontrivial task especially for the detection of thin
or incomplete curvilinear structures surrounded with noise. We propose a
general purpose curvilinear structure detector that uses the brain-inspired
trainable B-COSFIRE filters. It consists of four main steps, namely nonlinear
filtering with B-COSFIRE, thinning with non-maximum suppression, hysteresis
thresholding and morphological closing. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a
data set of noisy images with cracked pavements, where we achieve
state-of-the-art results (F-measure=0.865). The proposed method can be employed
in any computer vision methodology that requires the delineation of curvilinear
and elongated structures.

extends the single-device cellular analytics via crowdsourcing: It collects the
fine-grained cellular network data from massive mobile devices, aggregates them
in a cloud-based database, and provides interfaces for end users to run an
SQL-like query over the cellular data. It offers efficient and responsive
processing by optimizing the database storage and adopting the domain-specific
optimizations. Our preliminary deployments and experiments validate its
feasibility in performing crowdsourced analytics.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Coalitional Games for Cooperative Random Access in M2M

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of random access contention between machine type
devices (MTDs) in the uplink of a wireless cellular network is studied. In
particular, the possibility of forming cooperative groups to coordinate the
MTDs' requests for the random access channel (RACH) is analyzed. The problem is
formulated as a stochastic coalition formation game in which the MTDs are the
players that seek to form cooperative coalitions to optimize a utility function
that captures each MTD's energy consumption and time-varying queue length.
Within each coalition, an MTD acts as a coalition head that sends the access
requests of the coalition members over the RACH. One key feature of this game
is its ability to cope with stochastic environments in which the arrival
requests of MTDs and the packet success rate over RACH are dynamically
time-varying. The proposed stochastic coalitional is composed of multiple
stages, each of which corresponds to a coalitional game in stochastic
characteristic form that is played by the MTDs at each time step. To solve this
game, a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm is proposed and shown
to converge to a stable MTD partition. Simulation results show that, on the
average, the proposed stochastic coalition formation algorithm can reduce the
average fail ratio and energy consumption of up to 36% and 31% for a
cluster-based distribution of MTDs, respectively, compared with a
noncooperative case. Moreover, when the MTDs are more sensitive to the energy
consumption (queue length), the coalitions' size will increase (decrease).

 <dc:title>Domain Recursion for Lifted Inference with Existential Quantifiers</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent work, we proved that the domain recursion inference rule makes
domain-lifted inference possible on several relational probability models
(RPMs) for which the best known time complexity used to be exponential. We also
identified two classes of RPMs for which inference becomes domain lifted when
using domain recursion. These two classes subsume the largest lifted classes
that were previously known. In this paper, we show that domain recursion can
also be applied to models with existential quantifiers. Currently, all lifted
inference algorithms assume that existential quantifiers have been removed in
pre-processing by Skolemization. We show that besides introducing potentially
inconvenient negative weights, Skolemization may increase the time complexity
of inference. We give two example models where domain recursion can replace
Skolemization, avoids the need for dealing with negative numbers, and reduces
the time complexity of inference. These two examples may be interesting from
three theoretical aspects: 1- they provide a better and deeper understanding of
domain recursion and, in general, (lifted) inference, 2- they may serve as
evidence that there are larger classes of models for which domain recursion can
satisfyingly replace Skolemization, and 3- they may serve as evidence that
better Skolemization techniques exist.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm aimed at
recovering a reward function from the observed actions of an agent. We
introduce a strategy to flexibly handle different types of actions with two
approximations of the Bellman Optimality Equation, and a Bellman Gradient
Iteration method to compute the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the
reward function. These methods allow us to build a differentiable relation
between the Q-value and the reward function and learn an approximately optimal
reward function with gradient methods. We test the proposed method in two
simulated environments by evaluating the accuracy of different approximations
and comparing the proposed method with existing solutions. The results show
that even with a linear reward function, the proposed method has a comparable
accuracy with the state-of-the-art method adopting a non-linear reward
function, and the proposed method is more flexible because it is defined on
observed actions instead of trajectories.

 <dc:description>  The detection of change points is a pivotal task in statistical analysis. In
the quantum realm, it is a new primitive where one aims at identifying the
point where a source that supposedly prepares a sequence of particles in
identical quantum states starts preparing a mutated one. We obtain the optimal
procedure to identify the change point with certainty---naturally at the price
of having a certain probability of getting an inconclusive answer. We obtain
the analytical form of the optimal probability of successful identification for
any length of the particle sequence. We show that the conditional success
probabilities of identifying each possible change point show an unexpected
oscillatory behaviour. We also discuss local (online) protocols and compare
them with the optimal procedure.

 <dc:description>  The quest for better data analysis and artificial intelligence has lead to
more and more data being collected and stored. As a consequence, more data are
exposed to malicious entities. This paper examines the problem of privacy in
machine learning for classification. We utilize the Ridge Discriminant
Component Analysis (RDCA) to desensitize data with respect to a privacy label.
Based on five experiments, we show that desensitization by RDCA can effectively
protect privacy (i.e. low accuracy on the privacy label) with small loss in
utility. On HAR and CMU Faces datasets, the use of desensitized data results in
random guess level accuracies for privacy at a cost of 5.14% and 0.04%, on
average, drop in the utility accuracies. For Semeion Handwritten Digit dataset,
accuracies of the privacy-sensitive digits are almost zero, while the
accuracies for the utility-relevant digits drop by 7.53% on average. This
presents a promising solution to the problem of privacy in machine learning for
classification.

has begun to explore memory disaggregation, but suffers limitations including
lack of consideration of the complexity of cloud-based deployment, including
heterogeneous hardware and APIs for cloud users and operators. In this paper,
we present FluidMem, a complete system to realize disaggregated memory in the
datacenter. Going beyond simply demonstrating remote memory is possible, we
create an entire Memory as a Service. We define the requirements of Memory as a
Service and build its implementation in Linux as FluidMem. We present a
performance analysis of FluidMem and demonstrate that it transparently supports
remote memory for standard applications such as MongoDB and genome sequencing
applications.

 <dc:description>  Relational probabilistic models have the challenge of aggregation, where one
variable depends on a population of other variables. Consider the problem of
predicting gender from movie ratings; this is challenging because the number of
movies per user and users per movie can vary greatly. Surprisingly, aggregation
is not well understood. In this paper, we show that existing relational models
(implicitly or explicitly) either use simple numerical aggregators that lose
great amounts of information, or correspond to naive Bayes, logistic
regression, or noisy-OR that suffer from overconfidence. We propose new simple
aggregators and simple modifications of existing models that empirically
outperform the existing ones. The intuition we provide on different (existing
or new) models and their shortcomings plus our empirical findings promise to

 <dc:title>Space Efficient Breadth-First and Level Traversals of Consistent Global
  States of Parallel Programs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Enumerating consistent global states of a computation is a fundamental
problem in parallel computing with applications to debug- ging, testing and
runtime verification of parallel programs. Breadth-first search (BFS)
enumeration is especially useful for these applications as it finds an
erroneous consistent global state with the least number of events possible. The
total number of executed events in a global state is called its rank. BFS also
allows enumeration of all global states of a given rank or within a range of
ranks. If a computation on n processes has m events per process on average,
then the traditional BFS (Cooper-Marzullo and its variants) requires
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{m^{n-1}}{n})$ space in the worst case, whereas ou r
algorithm performs the BFS requires $\mathcal{O}(m^2n^2)$ space. Thus, we
reduce the space complexity for BFS enumeration of consistent global states
exponentially. and give the first polynomial space algorithm for this task. In
our experimental evaluation of seven benchmarks, traditional BFS fails in many
cases by exhausting the 2 GB heap space allowed to the JVM. In contrast, our
implementation uses less than 60 MB memory and is also faster in many cases.

 <dc:description>  Learning the distance metric between pairs of examples is of great importance
for visual recognition, especially for person re-identification (Re-Id).
Recently, the contrastive and triplet loss are proposed to enhance the
discriminative power of the deeply learned features, and have achieved
remarkable success. As can be seen, either the contrastive or triplet loss is
just one special case of the Euclidean distance relationships among these
training samples. Therefore, we propose a structured graph Laplacian embedding
algorithm, which can formulate all these structured distance relationships into
the graph Laplacian form. The proposed method can take full advantages of the
structured distance relationships among these training samples, with the
constructed complete graph. Besides, this formulation makes our method
easy-to-implement and super-effective. When embedding the proposed algorithm
with the softmax loss for the CNN training, our method can obtain much more
robust and discriminative deep features with inter-personal dispersion and
intra-personal compactness, which is essential to person Re-Id. We illustrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method on top of three popular networks,
namely AlexNet, DGDNet and ResNet50, on recent four widely used Re-Id benchmark
datasets. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances.

 <dc:description>  Time is an important relevance signal when searching streams of social media
posts. The distribution of document timestamps from the results of an initial
query can be leveraged to infer the distribution of relevant documents, which
can then be used to rerank the initial results. Previous experiments have shown
that kernel density estimation is a simple yet effective implementation of this
idea. This paper explores an alternative approach to mining temporal signals
with recurrent neural networks. Our intuition is that neural networks provide a
more expressive framework to capture the temporal coherence of neighboring
documents in time. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate lexical and
temporal signals in an end-to-end neural network architecture, in which
existing neural ranking models are used to generate query-document similarity
vectors that feed into a bidirectional LSTM layer for temporal modeling. Our
results are mixed: existing neural models for document ranking alone yield
limited improvements over simple baselines, but the integration of lexical and
temporal signals yield significant improvements over competitive temporal
baselines.

 <dc:description>  Many real world systems need to operate on heterogeneous information networks
that consist of numerous interacting components of different types. Examples
include systems that perform data analysis on biological information networks;
social networks; and information extraction systems processing unstructured
data to convert raw text to knowledge graphs. Many previous works describe
specialized approaches to perform specific types of analysis, mining and
learning on such networks. In this work, we propose a unified framework
consisting of a data model -a graph with a first order schema along with a
declarative language for constructing, querying and manipulating such networks
in ways that facilitate relational and structured machine learning. In
particular, we provide an initial prototype for a relational and graph
traversal query language where queries are directly used as relational features
for structured machine learning models. Feature extraction is performed by
making declarative graph traversal queries. Learning and inference models can
directly operate on this relational representation and augment it with new data
and knowledge that, in turn, is integrated seamlessly into the relational
structure to support new predictions. We demonstrate this system's capabilities
by showcasing tasks in natural language processing and computational biology
domains.

 <dc:title>Anti-Forensics of Camera Identification and the Triangle Test by
  Improved Fingerprint-Copy Attack</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The fingerprint-copy attack aims to confuse camera identification based on
sensor pattern noise. However, the triangle test shows that the forged images
undergone fingerprint-copy attack would share a non-PRNU (Photo-response
nonuniformity) component with every stolen image, and thus can detect
fingerprint-copy attack. In this paper, we propose an improved fingerprint-copy
attack scheme. Our main idea is to superimpose the estimated fingerprint into
the target image dispersedly, via employing a block-wise method and using the
stolen images randomly and partly. We also develop a practical method to
determine the strength of the superimposed fingerprint based on objective image
quality. In such a way, the impact of non-PRNU component on the triangle test
is reduced, and our improved fingerprint-copy attack is difficultly detected.
The experiments evaluated on 2,900 images from 4 cameras show that our scheme
can effectively fool camera identification, and significantly degrade the
performance of the triangle test simultaneously.

 <dc:description>  In several critical military missions, more than one decision level are
involved. These decision levels are often independent and distributed, and
sensitive pieces of information making up the military mission must be kept
hidden from one level to another even if all of the decision levels cooperate
to accomplish the same task. Usually, a mission is negotiated through insecure
networks such as the Internet using cryptographic protocols. In such protocols,
few security properties have to be ensured. However, designing a secure
cryptographic protocol that ensures several properties at once is a very
challenging task. In this paper, we propose a new secure protocol for multipart
military missions that involve two independent and distributed decision levels
having different security levels. We show that it ensures the secrecy,
authentication, and non-repudiation properties. In addition, we show that it
resists against man-in-the-middle attacks.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new algorithm for the computation of a singular value
decomposition (SVD) low-rank approximation of a matrix in the Matrix Product
Operator (MPO) format, also called the Tensor Train Matrix format. Our tensor
network randomized SVD (TNrSVD) algorithm is an MPO implementation of the
randomized SVD algorithm that is able to compute dominant singular values and
their corresponding singular vectors. In contrast to the state-of-the-art
tensor-based alternating least squares SVD (ALS-SVD) and modified alternating
least squares SVD (MALS-SVD) matrix approximation methods, TNrSVD can be up to
17 times faster while achieving the same accuracy. In addition, our TNrSVD
algorithm also produces accurate approximations in particular cases where both
ALS-SVD and MALS-SVD fail to converge. We also propose a new algorithm for the
fast conversion of a sparse matrix into its corresponding MPO form, which is up
to 509 times faster than the standard Tensor Train SVD (TT-SVD) method while
achieving machine precision accuracy. The efficiency and accuracy of both
algorithms are demonstrated in numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  Most work on natural language question answering today focuses on answer
selection: given a candidate list of sentences, determine which contains the
answer. Although important, answer selection is only one stage in a standard
end-to-end question answering pipeline. This paper explores the effectiveness
of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for answer selection in an end-to-end
context using the standard TrecQA dataset. We observe that a simple
idf-weighted word overlap algorithm forms a very strong baseline, and that
despite substantial efforts by the community in applying deep learning to
tackle answer selection, the gains are modest at best on this dataset.
Furthermore, it is unclear if a CNN is more effective than the baseline in an
end-to-end context based on standard retrieval metrics. To further explore this
finding, we conducted a manual user evaluation, which confirms that answers
from the CNN are detectably better than those from idf-weighted word overlap.
This result suggests that users are sensitive to relatively small differences
in answer selection quality.

 <dc:description>  To learn a semantic parser from denotations, a learning algorithm must search
over a combinatorially large space of logical forms for ones consistent with
the annotated denotations. We propose a new online learning algorithm that
searches faster as training progresses. The two key ideas are using macro
grammars to cache the abstract patterns of useful logical forms found thus far,
and holistic triggering to efficiently retrieve the most relevant patterns
based on sentence similarity. On the WikiTableQuestions dataset, we first
expand the search space of an existing model to improve the state-of-the-art
accuracy from 38.7% to 42.7%, and then use macro grammars and holistic
triggering to achieve an 11x speedup and an accuracy of 43.7%.
