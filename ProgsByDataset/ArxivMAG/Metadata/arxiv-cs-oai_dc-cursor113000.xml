 <dc:description>  Connections between relations in relation extraction, which we call class
ties, are common. In distantly supervised scenario, one entity tuple may have
multiple relation facts. Exploiting class ties between relations of one entity
tuple will be promising for distantly supervised relation extraction. However,
previous models are not effective or ignore to model this property. In this
work, to effectively leverage class ties, we propose to make joint relation
extraction with a unified model that integrates convolutional neural network
(CNN) with a general pairwise ranking framework, in which three novel ranking
loss functions are introduced. Additionally, an effective method is presented
to relieve the severe class imbalance problem from NR (not relation) for model
training. Experiments on a widely used dataset show that leveraging class ties
will enhance extraction and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model to learn
class ties. Our model outperforms the baselines significantly, achieving
state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have achieved great progress
in recent decades, but most of them are designed to solve unconstrained
multi-objective optimization problems. In fact, many real-world multi-objective
problems usually contain a number of constraints. To promote the research of
constrained multi-objective optimization, we first propose three primary types
of difficulty, which reflect the challenges in the real-world optimization
problems, to characterize the constraint functions in CMOPs, including
feasibility-hardness, convergence-hardness and diversity-hardness. We then
develop a general toolkit to construct difficulty adjustable and scalable
constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) with three types of
parameterized constraint functions according to the proposed three primary
types of difficulty. In fact, combination of the three primary constraint
functions with different parameters can lead to construct a large variety of
CMOPs, whose difficulty can be uniquely defined by a triplet with each of its
parameter specifying the level of each primary difficulty type respectively.
Furthermore, the number of objectives in this toolkit are able to scale to more
than two. Based on this toolkit, we suggest nine difficulty adjustable and
scalable CMOPs named DAS-CMOP1-9. To evaluate the proposed test problems, two
popular CMOEAs - MOEA/D-CDP and NSGA-II-CDP are adopted to test their
performances on DAS-CMOP1-9 with different difficulty triplets. The experiment
results demonstrate that none of them can solve these problems efficiently,
which stimulate us to develop new constrained MOEAs to solve the suggested
DAS-CMOPs.

 <dc:description>  About 90 percent of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience decreased
functional communication due to the presence of voice and speech disorders
associated with dysarthria that can be characterized by monotony of pitch (or
fundamental frequency), reduced loudness, irregular rate of speech, imprecise
consonants, and changes in voice quality. Speech-language pathologists (SLPs)
work with patients with PD to improve speech intelligibility using various
intensive in-clinic speech treatments. SLPs also prescribe home exercises to
enhance generalization of speech strategies outside of the treatment room. Even
though speech therapies are found to be highly effective in improving vocal
loudness and speech quality, patients with PD find it difficult to follow the
prescribed exercise regimes outside the clinic and to continue exercises once
the treatment is completed. SLPs need techniques to monitor compliance and
accuracy of their patients exercises at home and in ecologically valid
communication situations. We have designed EchoWear, a smartwatch-based system,
to remotely monitor speech and voice exercises as prescribed by SLPs. We
conducted a study of 6 individuals; three with PD and three healthy controls.
To assess the performance of EchoWear technology compared with high quality
audio equipment obtained in a speech laboratory. Our preliminary analysis shows
promising outcomes for using EchoWear in speech therapies for people with PD.

 <dc:description>  Sequential traces of user data are frequently observed online and offline,
e.g., as sequences of visited websites or as sequences of locations captured by
GPS. However, understanding factors explaining the production of sequence data
is a challenging task, especially since the data generation is often not
homogeneous. For example, navigation behavior might change in different phases
of browsing a website, or movement behavior may vary between groups of users.
In this work, we tackle this task and propose MixedTrails, a Bayesian approach
for comparing the plausibility of hypotheses regarding the generative processes
of heterogeneous sequence data. Each hypothesis is derived from existing
literature, theory or intuition and represents a belief about transition
probabilities between a set of states that can vary between groups of observed
transitions. For example, when trying to understand human movement in a city
and given some observed data, a hypothesis assuming tourists to be more likely
to move towards points of interests than locals, can be shown to be more
plausible than a hypothesis assuming the opposite. Our approach incorporates
such hypotheses as Bayesian priors in a generative mixed transition Markov
chain model, and compares their plausibility utilizing Bayes factors. We
discuss analytical and approximate inference methods for calculating the
marginal likelihoods for Bayes factors, give guidance on interpreting the
results, and illustrate our approach with several experiments on synthetic and
empirical data from Wikipedia and Flickr. Thus, this work enables a novel kind
of analysis for studying sequential data in many application areas.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning plays a critical role in extracting meaningful information
out of the zetabytes of sensor data collected every day. For some applications,
the goal is to analyze and understand the data to identify trends (e.g.,
surveillance, portable/wearable electronics); in other applications, the goal
is to take immediate action based the data (e.g., robotics/drones, self-driving
cars, smart Internet of Things). For many of these applications, local embedded
processing near the sensor is preferred over the cloud due to privacy or
latency concerns, or limitations in the communication bandwidth. However, at
the sensor there are often stringent constraints on energy consumption and cost
in addition to throughput and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, flexibility
is often required such that the processing can be adapted for different
applications or environments (e.g., update the weights and model in the
classifier). In many applications, machine learning often involves transforming
the input data into a higher dimensional space, which, along with programmable
weights, increases data movement and consequently energy consumption. In this
paper, we will discuss how these challenges can be addressed at various levels
of hardware design ranging from architecture, hardware-friendly algorithms,
mixed-signal circuits, and advanced technologies (including memories and
sensors).

 <dc:description>  Recent studies have shown that information mined from Craigslist can be used
for informing public health policy or monitoring risk behavior. This paper
presents a text-mining method for conducting public health surveillance of
marijuana use concerns in the U.S. using online classified ads in Craigslist.
We collected more than 200 thousands of rental ads in the housing categories in
Craigslist and devised text-mining methods for efficiently and accurately
extract rental ads associated with concerns about the uses of marijuana in
different states across the U.S. We linked the extracted ads to their
geographic locations and computed summary statistics of the ads having
marijuana use concerns. Our data is then compared with the State Marijuana Laws
Map published by the U.S. government and marijuana related keywords search in
Google to verify our collected data with respect to the demographics of
marijuana use concerns. Our data not only indicates strong correlations between
Craigslist ads, Google search and the State Marijuana Laws Map in states where
marijuana uses are legal, but also reveals some hidden world of marijuana use
concerns in other states where marijuana use is illegal. Our approach can be
utilized as a marijuana surveillance tool for policy makers to develop public
health policy and regulations.

 <dc:description>  We provide an up-to-date view on the knowledge management system ScienceWISE
(SW) and address issues related to the automatic assignment of articles to
research topics. So far, SW has been proven to be an effective platform for
managing large volumes of technical articles by means of ontological
concept-based browsing. However, as the publication of research articles
accelerates, the expressivity and the richness of the SW ontology turns into a
double-edged sword: a more fine-grained characterization of articles is
possible, but at the cost of introducing more spurious relations among them. In
this context, the challenge of continuously recommending relevant articles to
users lies in tackling a network partitioning problem, where nodes represent
articles and co-occurring concepts create edges between them. In this paper, we
discuss the three research directions we have taken for solving this issue: i)
the identification of generic concepts to reinforce inter-article similarities;
ii) the adoption of a bipartite network representation to improve scalability;
iii) the design of a clustering algorithm to identify concepts for
cross-disciplinary articles and obtain fine-grained topics for all articles.

 <dc:description>  Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research
direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas
such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine
translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health
monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of
low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning
provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data.
The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research
work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief
introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in
machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following
aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and
its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines
(DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  Flow visualisations are essential to better understand the unsteady
aerodynamics of flapping wing flight. The issues inherent to animal
experiments, such as poor controllability and unnatural flapping when tethered,
can be avoided by using robotic flyers. Such an approach holds a promise for a
more systematic and repeatable methodology for flow visualisation, through a
better controlled flight. Such experiments require high precision position
control, however, and until now this was not possible due to the challenging
flight dynamics and payload restrictions of flapping wing Micro Air Vehicles
(FWMAV). Here, we present a new FWMAV-specific control approach that, by
employing an external motion tracking system, achieved autonomous wind tunnel
flight with a maximum root-mean-square position error of 28 mm at low speeds
(0.8 - 1.2 m/s) and 75 mm at high speeds (2 - 2.4 m/s). This allowed the first
free-flight flow visualisation experiments to be conducted with an FWMAV.
Time-resolved stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to
reconstruct the 3D flow patterns of the FWMAV wake. A good qualitative match
was found in comparison to a tethered configuration at similar conditions,
suggesting that the obtained free-flight measurements are reliable and
meaningful.

 <dc:description>  When comparing measurements to numerical simulations of moisture transfer
through porous materials a rush of the experimental moisture front is commonly
observed in several works shown in the literature, with transient models that
consider only the diffusion process. Thus, to overcome the discrepancies
between the experimental and the numerical models, this paper proposes to
include the moisture advection transfer in the governing equation. To solve the
advection-diffusion differential equation, it is first proposed two efficient
numerical schemes and their efficiencies are investigated for both linear and
nonlinear cases. The first scheme, Scharfetter-Gummel (SG), presents a
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition but is more accurate and faster than
the second scheme, the well-known Crank-Nicolson approach. Furthermore, the SG
scheme has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically preserved.
Then, to conclude, results of the convective moisture transfer problem obtained
with the SG numerical scheme are compared to experimental data from the
literature. The inclusion of an advective term in the model may clearly lead to
better results than purely diffusive models.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep
learning model able to predict structured sequences of data. Precisely, GCRN is
a generalization of classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) to data
structured by an arbitrary graph. Such structured sequences can represent
series of frames in videos, spatio-temporal measurements on a network of
sensors, or random walks on a vocabulary graph for natural language modeling.
The proposed model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) on graphs to
identify spatial structures and RNN to find dynamic patterns. We study two
possible architectures of GCRN, and apply the models to two practical problems:
predicting moving MNIST data, and modeling natural language with the Penn
Treebank dataset. Experiments show that exploiting simultaneously graph spatial
and dynamic information about data can improve both precision and learning
speed.

 <dc:title>A short review and primer on cardiovascular signals in human computer
  interaction applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Henelius, Andreas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The use of psychophysiologic signals in human-computer interaction is a
growing field with significant potential for future smart personalised systems.
Working in this emerging field requires comprehension of different
physiological signals and analysis techniques.
  Cardiovascular signals such as heart rate variability and blood pressure
variability are commonly used in psychophysiology in order to investigate
phenomena such as mental workload. In this paper we present a short review of
different cardiovascular metrics useful in the context of human-computer
interaction.
  This paper aims to serve as a primer for the novice, enabling rapid
familiarisation with the latest core concepts. We emphasise everyday
human-computer interface applications to distinguish from the more common
clinical or sports uses of psychophysiology.

ambulatory psychophysiology, with 12 similar chapters, plus application
guidelines and systematic review. Any citation to this paper should be made

 <dc:description>  A natural approach to software quality assurance consists in writing unit
tests securing programmer-declared code invariants. Throughout the literature a
great body of work has been devoted to tools and techniques automating this
labour-intensive process. A prominent example is the successful use of
randomness, in particular random typeable $\lambda$-terms, in testing
functional programming compilers such as the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.
Unfortunately, due to the intrinsically difficult combinatorial structure of
typeable $\lambda$-terms no effective uniform sampling method is known, setting
it as a fundamental open problem in the random software testing approach. In
this paper we combine the framework of Boltzmann samplers, a powerful technique
of random combinatorial structure generation, with today's Prolog systems
offering a synergy between logic variables, unification with occurs check and
efficient backtracking. This allows us to develop a novel sampling mechanism
able to construct uniformly random closed simply-typed $\lambda$-terms of up
size 120. We apply our techniques to the generation of uniformly random closed
simply-typed normal forms and design a parallel execution mechanism pushing
forward the achievable term size to 140. Under consideration in Theory and
Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).

 <dc:description>  The motivation behind this paper is to dissecting the secure network for
Business to Business (B2B) application by Implementing Access Control List
(ACL) and Service Level Agreement (SLA). This data provides the nature of
attacks reported as external or internal attacks. This paper presents the
initial finding of attacks, types of attacks and their ratio within specific
time. It demonstrates the advance technique and methodology to reduce the
attacks and vulnerabilities and minimize the ratio of attacks to the networks
and application and keep the network secure and runs application smoothly
regarding that. It also identifies the location of attacks, the reason behind
the attack and the technique used in attacking. The whole field of system
security is limitless and in an evolutionary stage. To comprehend the
exploration being performed today, foundation learning of the web and assaults,
the security is vital and in this way they are investigated. It provides the
statistical analytics about various attacks and nature of attacks for acquiring
the results through simulation to prove the hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  In this fast developing world of information, the amount of medical knowledge
is rising at an exponential level. The UMLS (Unified Medical Language Systems),
is rich knowledge base consisting files and software that provides many health
and biomedical vocabularies and standards. A Web service is a web solution to
facilitate machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Few UMLS web services
are currently available for portable devices, but most of them lack in
efficiency and performance. It is proposed to develop Android-based web
services for healthcare systems underlying rich knowledge source of UMLS. The
experimental evaluation was made to analyse the efficiency and performance
effect with and without using the designed prototype. The understand-ability
and interaction with the prototype were greater than those who used the
alternate sources to obtain the answers to their questions. The overall
performance indicates that the system is convenient and easy to use. The result
of the evaluation clearly proved that designed system retrieves all the
pertinent information better than syntactic searches.

 <dc:description>  While most approaches to semantic reasoning have focused on improving
performance, in this paper we argue that computational times are very important
in order to enable real time applications such as autonomous driving. Towards
this goal, we present an approach to joint classification, detection and
semantic segmentation via a unified architecture where the encoder is shared
amongst the three tasks. Our approach is very simple, can be trained end-to-end
and performs extremely well in the challenging KITTI dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art in the road segmentation task. Our approach is also very
efficient, taking less than 100 ms to perform all tasks.

 <dc:title>Set2Model Networks: Learning Discriminatively To Learn Generative Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vakhitov, A.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new &quot;learning-to-learn&quot;-type approach that enables rapid
learning of concepts from small-to-medium sized training sets and is primarily
designed for web-initialized image retrieval. At the core of our approach is a
deep architecture (a Set2Model network) that maps sets of examples to simple
generative probabilistic models such as Gaussians or mixtures of Gaussians in
the space of high-dimensional descriptors. The parameters of the embedding into
the descriptor space are trained in the end-to-end fashion in the meta-learning
stage using a set of training learning problems. The main technical novelty of
our approach is the derivation of the backprop process through the mixture
model fitting, which makes the likelihood of the resulting models
differentiable with respect to the positions of the input descriptors.
  While the meta-learning process for a Set2Model network is discriminative, a
trained Set2Model network performs generative learning of generative models in
the descriptor space, which facilitates learning in the cases when no negative
examples are available, and whenever the concept being learned is polysemous or
represented by noisy training sets. Among other experiments, we demonstrate
that these properties allow Set2Model networks to pick visual concepts from the
raw outputs of Internet image search engines better than a set of strong
baselines.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents Pot, a system that leverages the concept of preordered
transactions to achieve deterministic multithreaded execution of programs that
use Transactional Memory. Preordered transactions eliminate the root cause of
nondeterminism in transactional execution: they provide the illusion of
executing in a deterministic serial order, unlike traditional transactions
which appear to execute in a nondeterministic order that can change from
execution to execution. Pot uses a new concurrency control protocol that
exploits the serialization order to distinguish between fast and speculative
transaction execution modes in order to mitigate the overhead of imposing a
deterministic order. We build two Pot prototypes: one using STM and another
using off-the-shelf HTM. To the best of our knowledge, Pot enables
deterministic execution of programs using off-the-shelf HTM for the first time.
An experimental evaluation shows that Pot achieves deterministic execution of
TM programs with low overhead, sometimes even outperforming nondeterministic
executions, and clearly outperforming the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  Featuring low heat dissipation, devices based on spin-wave logic gates
promise to comply with increasing future requirements in information
processing. In this work, we present the experimental realization of a majority
gate based on the interference of spin waves in an Yttrium-Iron-Garnet-based
waveguiding structure. This logic device features a three-input combiner with
the logic information encoded in the phase of the spin waves. We show that the
phase of the output signal represents the majority of the phase of the input
signals. A switching time of about 10 ns in the prototype device provides
evidence for the ability of sub-nanosecond data processing in future
down-scaled devices.

 <dc:title>Set Similarity Search Beyond MinHash</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Christiani, Tobias</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pagh, Rasmus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of approximate set similarity search under
Braun-Blanquet similarity $B(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}) = |\mathbf{x} \cap
\mathbf{y}| / \max(|\mathbf{x}|, |\mathbf{y}|)$. The $(b_2, b_2)$-approximate
Braun-Blanquet similarity search problem is to preprocess a collection of sets
$P$ such that, given a query set $\mathbf{q}$, if there exists $\mathbf{x} \in
P$ with $B(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{x}) \geq b_1$, then we can efficiently return
$\mathbf{x}' \in P$ with $B(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{x}') &gt; b_2$.
  We present a simple data structure that solves this problem with space usage
$O(n^{1+\rho}\log n + \sum_{\mathbf{x} \in P}|\mathbf{x}|)$ and query time
$O(|\mathbf{q}|n^{\rho} \log n)$ where $n = |P|$ and $\rho =
\log(1/b_1)/\log(1/b_2)$. Making use of existing lower bounds for
locality-sensitive hashing by O'Donnell et al. (TOCT 2014) we show that this
value of $\rho$ is tight across the parameter space, i.e., for every choice of
constants $0 &lt; b_2 &lt; b_1 &lt; 1$.
  In the case where all sets have the same size our solution strictly improves
upon the value of $\rho$ that can be obtained through the use of
state-of-the-art data-independent techniques in the Indyk-Motwani
locality-sensitive hashing framework (STOC 1998) such as Broder's MinHash (CCS
1997) for Jaccard similarity and Andoni et al.'s cross-polytope LSH (NIPS 2015)
for cosine similarity. Surprisingly, even though our solution is
data-independent, for a large part of the parameter space we outperform the
currently best data-dependent method by Andoni and Razenshteyn (STOC 2015).
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: The first arXiv version of this paper introduced an upper bound for
  Jaccard similarity search that was based on a miscalculation which led the
  authors to believe that the &quot;hardest instances&quot; for Jaccard similarity search
  using Chosen Path occurs when all sets have the same size. The question of
  which existing technique is better depends on set sizes and similarity
  thresholds (details in paper)</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  People learn whenever and wherever possible, and whatever they like or
encounter--Mathematics, Drama, Art, Languages, Physics, Philosophy, and so on.
With the bursting of knowledge, evaluation of one's possession of knowledge
becomes increasingly difficult. There are a lot of demands to evaluate one's
understanding of a piece of knowledge. Assessment of understanding of knowledge
is conventionally through tests or interviews, but they have some limitations
such as low-efficiency and not-comprehensive. This paper proposes a method
called Understanding Tree to estimate one's understanding of knowledge, by
keeping track of his/her learning activities. It overcomes some limitations of
traditional methods, hence complements traditional methods.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been employed in the problem of
classifying signal and background events with high accuracy in particle
physics. In this paper, we compare the performance of a widespread ML
technique, namely, \emph{stacked generalization}, against the results of two
state-of-art algorithms: (1) a deep neural network (DNN) in the task of
discovering a new neutral Higgs boson and (2) a scalable machine learning
system for tree boosting, in the Standard Model Higgs to tau leptons channel,
both at the 8 TeV LHC. In a cut-and-count analysis, \emph{stacking} three
algorithms performed around 16\% worse than DNN but demanding far less
computation efforts, however, the same \emph{stacking} outperforms boosted
decision trees. Using the stacked classifiers in a multivariate statistical
analysis (MVA), on the other hand, significantly enhances the statistical
significance compared to cut-and-count in both Higgs processes, suggesting that
combining an ensemble of simpler and faster ML algorithms with MVA tools is a
better approach than building a complex state-of-art algorithm for
cut-and-count.

 <dc:description>  We study the statistical limits of both detecting and estimating a rank-one
deformation of a symmetric random Gaussian tensor. We establish upper and lower
bounds on the critical signal-to-noise ratio, under a variety of priors for the
planted vector: (i) a uniformly sampled unit vector, (ii) i.i.d. $\pm 1$
entries, and (iii) a sparse vector where a constant fraction $\rho$ of entries
are i.i.d. $\pm 1$ and the rest are zero. For each of these cases, our upper
and lower bounds match up to a $1+o(1)$ factor as the order $d$ of the tensor
becomes large. For sparse signals (iii), our bounds are also asymptotically
tight in the sparse limit $\rho \to 0$ for any fixed $d$ (including the $d=2$
case of sparse PCA). Our upper bounds for (i) demonstrate a phenomenon
reminiscent of the work of Baik, Ben Arous and P\'ech\'e: an `eigenvalue' of a
perturbed tensor emerges from the bulk at a strictly lower signal-to-noise
ratio than when the perturbation itself exceeds the bulk; we quantify the size
of this effect. We also provide some general results for larger classes of
priors. In particular, the large $d$ asymptotics of the threshold location
differs between problems with discrete priors versus continuous priors.
Finally, for priors (i) and (ii) we carry out the replica prediction from
statistical physics, which is conjectured to give the exact
information-theoretic threshold for any fixed $d$.
  Of independent interest, we introduce a new improvement to the second moment
method for contiguity, on which our lower bounds are based. Our technique
conditions away from rare `bad' events that depend on interactions between the
signal and noise. This enables us to close $\sqrt{2}$-factor gaps present in
several previous works.

 <dc:description>  Given a large number of low-level heterogeneous categorical alerts from an
anomaly detection system, how to characterize complex relationships between
different alerts, filter out false positives, and deliver trustworthy rankings
and suggestions to end users? This problem is motivated by and generalized from
applications in enterprise security and attack scenario reconstruction. While
existing techniques focus on either reconstructing abnormal scenarios or
filtering out false positive alerts, it can be more advantageous to consider
the two perspectives simultaneously in order to improve detection accuracy and
better understand anomaly behaviors. In this paper, we propose CAR, a
collaborative alerts ranking framework that exploits both temporal and content
correlations from heterogeneous categorical alerts. CAR first builds a
tree-based model to capture both short-term correlations and long-term
dependencies in each alert sequence, which identifies abnormal action
sequences. Then, an embedding-based model is employed to learn the content
correlations between alerts via their heterogeneous categorical attributes.
Finally, by incorporating both temporal and content dependencies into one
optimization framework, CAR ranks both alerts and their corresponding alert
patterns. Our experiments, using real-world enterprise monitoring data and real
attacks launched by professional hackers, show that CAR can accurately identify
true positive alerts and successfully reconstruct attack scenarios at the same
time.

 <dc:description>  Radio channels are typically sparse in the delay domain, and ideal for
compressed sensing. A new compressed sensing algorithm called eX-OMP is
developed that yields performance similar to that of the optimal MMSE
estimator. The new algorithm relies on a small amount additional data. Both
eX-OMP and the MMSE estimator adaptively balance channel tracking and noise
reduction. They perform better than simple estimators such as the
linear-interpolator which fix this trade-off a priori. Some wideband
measurements are examined, and the channels are found to be represented by a
few delays.

 <dc:description>  Blockchain protocols are inherently limited in transaction throughput and
latency. Recent efforts to address performance and scale blockchains have
focused on off-chain payment channels. While such channels can achieve low
latency and high throughput, deploying them securely on top of the Bitcoin
blockchain has been difficult, partly because building a secure implementation
requires changes to the underlying protocol and the ecosystem.
  We present Teechan, a full-duplex payment channel framework that exploits
trusted execution environments. Teechan can be deployed securely on the
existing Bitcoin blockchain without having to modify the protocol. It: (i)
achieves a higher transaction throughput and lower transaction latency than
prior solutions; (ii) enables unlimited full-duplex payments as long as the
balance does not exceed the channel's credit; (iii) requires only a single
message to be sent per payment in any direction; and (iv) places at most two
transactions on the blockchain under any execution scenario.
  We have built and deployed the Teechan framework using Intel SGX on the
Bitcoin network. Our experiments show that, not counting network latencies,
Teechan can achieve 2,480 transactions per second on a single channel, with
sub-millisecond latencies.

 <dc:title>Adversarial Examples Detection in Deep Networks with Convolutional

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep learning has greatly improved visual recognition in recent years.
However, recent research has shown that there exist many adversarial examples
that can negatively impact the performance of such an architecture. This paper
focuses on detecting those adversarial examples by analyzing whether they come
from the same distribution as the normal examples. Instead of directly training
a deep neural network to detect adversarials, a much simpler approach was
proposed based on statistics on outputs from convolutional layers. A cascade
classifier was designed to efficiently detect adversarials. Furthermore,
trained from one particular adversarial generating mechanism, the resulting
classifier can successfully detect adversarials from a completely different
mechanism as well. The resulting classifier is non-subdifferentiable, hence
creates a difficulty for adversaries to attack by using the gradient of the
classifier. After detecting adversarial examples, we show that many of them can
be recovered by simply performing a small average filter on the image. Those
findings should lead to more insights about the classification mechanisms in
deep convolutional neural networks.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Rainbow Vertex Connectivity Problems for Restricted Graph
  Classes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lauri, Juho</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A path in a vertex-colored graph $G$ is \emph{vertex rainbow} if all of its
internal vertices have a distinct color. The graph $G$ is said to be
\emph{rainbow vertex connected} if there is a vertex rainbow path between every
pair of its vertices. Similarly, the graph $G$ is \emph{strongly rainbow vertex
connected} if there is a shortest path which is vertex rainbow between every
pair of its vertices. We consider the complexity of deciding if a given
vertex-colored graph is rainbow or strongly rainbow vertex connected. We call
these problems \probRvc and \probSrvc, respectively. We prove both problems
remain NP-complete on very restricted graph classes including bipartite planar
graphs of maximum degree 3, interval graphs, and $k$-regular graphs for $k \geq
3$. We settle precisely the complexity of both problems from the viewpoint of
two width parameters: pathwidth and tree-depth. More precisely, we show both
problems remain NP-complete for bounded pathwidth graphs, while being
fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by tree-depth. Moreover, we show both
problems are solvable in polynomial time for block graphs, while \probSrvc is
tractable for cactus graphs and split graphs.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the problem of verifying the correctness of arrhythmia-detection
algorithms, we present a formalization of these algorithms in the language of
Quantitative Regular Expressions. QREs are a flexible formal language for
specifying complex numerical queries over data streams, with provable runtime
and memory consumption guarantees. The medical-device algorithms of interest
include peak detection (where a peak in a cardiac signal indicates a heartbeat)
and various discriminators, each of which uses a feature of the cardiac signal
to distinguish fatal from non-fatal arrhythmias. Expressing these algorithms'
desired output in current temporal logics, and implementing them via monitor
synthesis, is cumbersome, error-prone, computationally expensive, and sometimes
infeasible.
  In contrast, we show that a range of peak detectors (in both the time and
wavelet domains) and various discriminators at the heart of today's
arrhythmia-detection devices are easily expressible in QREs. The fact that one
formalism (QREs) is used to describe the desired end-to-end operation of an
arrhythmia detector opens the way to formal analysis and rigorous testing of
these detectors' correctness and performance. Such analysis could alleviate the
regulatory burden on device developers when modifying their algorithms. The
performance of the peak-detection QREs is demonstrated by running them on real
patient data, on which they yield results on par with those provided by a
cardiologist.

 <dc:description>  The past year saw the introduction of new architectures such as Highway
networks and Residual networks which, for the first time, enabled the training
of feedforward networks with dozens to hundreds of layers using simple gradient
descent. While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for
their success, there are indications that these architectures defy a popular
view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract
features at each layer.
  In this report, we argue that this view is incomplete and does not adequately
explain several recent findings. We propose an alternative viewpoint based on
unrolled iterative estimation -- a group of successive layers iteratively
refine their estimates of the same features instead of computing an entirely
new representation. We demonstrate that this viewpoint directly leads to the
construction of Highway and Residual networks. Finally we provide preliminary
experiments to discuss the similarities and differences between the two
architectures.

 <dc:description>  We consider a directed acyclic network with multiple sources and multiple
terminals where each terminal is interested in decoding the sum of independent
sources generated at the source nodes. We describe a procedure whereby a simple
undirected graph can be used to construct such a sum-network and demonstrate an
upper bound on its computation rate. Furthermore, we show sufficient conditions
for the construction of a linear network code that achieves this upper bound.
Our procedure allows us to construct sum-networks that have any arbitrary
computation rate $\frac{p}{q}$ (where $p,q$ are non-negative integers). Our
work significantly generalizes a previous approach for constructing
sum-networks with arbitrary capacities. Specifically, we answer an open
question in prior work by demonstrating sum-networks with significantly fewer
number of sources and terminals.

 <dc:title>Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for Emotion Classification from Noisy Speech</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rana, Rajib</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Despite the enormous interest in emotion classification from speech, the
impact of noise on emotion classification is not well understood. This is
important because, due to the tremendous advancement of the smartphone
technology, it can be a powerful medium for speech emotion recognition in the
outside laboratory natural environment, which is likely to incorporate
background noise in the speech. We capitalize on the current breakthrough of
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and seek to investigate its performance for
emotion classification from noisy speech. We particularly focus on the recently
proposed Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which is yet to be explored for emotion
recognition from speech. Experiments conducted with speech compounded with
eight different types of noises reveal that GRU incurs an 18.16% smaller
run-time while performing quite comparably to the Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM), which is the most popular Recurrent Neural Network proposed to date.
This result is promising for any embedded platform in general and will initiate
further studies to utilize GRU to its full potential for emotion recognition on
smartphones.

go, and what goal they seek. In contrast to prior work in trajectory
forecasting, our algorithm, DARKO, goes further to reason about semantic states

both space and time. DARKO learns and forecasts from first-person visual
observations of the user's daily behaviors via an Online Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) approach. Classical IRL discovers only the rewards in a batch
setting, whereas DARKO discovers the states, transitions, rewards, and goals of
a user from streaming data. Among other results, we show DARKO forecasts goals
better than competing methods in both noisy and ideal settings, and our
approach is theoretically and empirically no-regret.

 <dc:description>  The objective of this paper is to evaluate the potential of Gaofen-2 (GF-2)
high resolution multispectral sensor (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) imagery on
water mapping. Difficulties of water mapping on high resolution data includes:
1) misclassification between water and shadows or other low-reflectance ground
objects, which is mostly caused by the spectral similarity within the given
band range; 2) small water bodies with size smaller than the spatial resolution
of MS image. To solve the confusion between water and low-reflectance objects,
the Landsat 8 time series with two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands is added
because water has extremely strong absorption in SWIR. In order to integrate
the three multi-sensor, multi-resolution data sets, the probabilistic graphical
model (PGM) is utilized here with conditional probability distribution defined
mainly based on the size of each object. For comparison, results from the SVM
classifier on the PCA fused and MS data, thresholding method on the PAN image,
and water index method on the Landsat data are computed. The confusion matrices
are calculated for all the methods. The results demonstrate that the PGM method
can achieve the best performance with the highest overall accuracy. Moreover,
small rivers can also be extracted by adding weight on the PAN result in PGM.
Finally, the post-classification procedure is applied on the PGM result to
further exclude misclassification in shadow and water-land boundary regions.
Accordingly, the producer's, user's and overall accuracy are all increased,
indicating the effectiveness of our method.

 <dc:description>  We examine and propose a solution to the problem of recovering a block sparse
signal with sparse blocks from linear measurements. Such problems naturally
emerge in the context of mobile communication, in settings motivated by
desiderata of a 5G framework. We introduce a new variant of the Hard
Thresholding Pursuit (HTP) algorithm referred to as HiHTP. For the specific
class of sparsity structures, HiHTP performs significantly better in numerical
experiments compared to HTP. We provide both a proof of convergence and a
recovery guarantee for noisy Gaussian measurements that exhibit an improved
asymptotic scaling in terms of the sampling complexity in comparison with the
usual HTP algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The increasing use of middleboxes (e.g., NATs, firewalls) in the Internet has
made it harder and harder to deploy new transport or higher layer protocols, or
even extensions to existing ones. Current work to address this Internet
transport ossification has led to renewed interest in UDP as an encapsulation
for making novel transport protocols deployable in the Internet. Examples
include Google's QUIC and the WebRTC data channel. The common assumption made
by these approaches is that encapsulation over UDP works in the present
Internet. This paper presents a measurement study to examine this assumption,
and provides guidance for protocol design based on our measurements.
  The key question is &quot;can we run new transport protocols for the Internet over
UDP?&quot; We find that the answer is largely &quot;yes&quot;: UDP works on most networks, and
impairments are generally confined to access networks. This allows relatively
simple fallback strategies to work around it. Our answer is based on a twofold
methodology. First, we use the RIPE Atlas platform to basically check UDP
connectivity and first-packet latency. Second, we deploy copycat, a new tool
for comparing TCP loss, latency, and throughput with UDP by generating
TCP-shaped traffic with UDP headers.

 <dc:description>  To effectively analyze and design cyberphysical systems (CPS), designers
today have to combat the data deluge problem, i.e., the burden of processing
intractably large amounts of data produced by complex models and experiments.
In this work, we utilize monotonic Parametric Signal Temporal Logic (PSTL) to
design features for unsupervised classification of time series data. This
enables using off-the-shelf machine learning tools to automatically cluster
similar traces with respect to a given PSTL formula. We demonstrate how this
technique produces interpretable formulas that are amenable to analysis and
understanding using a few representative examples. We illustrate this with case
studies related to automotive engine testing, highway traffic analysis, and
auto-grading massively open online courses.

 <dc:description>  With recent progress in graphics, it has become more tractable to train
models on synthetic images, potentially avoiding the need for expensive
annotations. However, learning from synthetic images may not achieve the
desired performance due to a gap between synthetic and real image
distributions. To reduce this gap, we propose Simulated+Unsupervised (S+U)
learning, where the task is to learn a model to improve the realism of a
simulator's output using unlabeled real data, while preserving the annotation
information from the simulator. We develop a method for S+U learning that uses
an adversarial network similar to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), but
with synthetic images as inputs instead of random vectors. We make several key
modifications to the standard GAN algorithm to preserve annotations, avoid
artifacts, and stabilize training: (i) a 'self-regularization' term, (ii) a
local adversarial loss, and (iii) updating the discriminator using a history of
refined images. We show that this enables generation of highly realistic
images, which we demonstrate both qualitatively and with a user study. We
quantitatively evaluate the generated images by training models for gaze
estimation and hand pose estimation. We show a significant improvement over
using synthetic images, and achieve state-of-the-art results on the MPIIGaze
dataset without any labeled real data.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new multi-modal task for computer systems, posed as a combined
vision-language comprehension challenge: identifying the most suitable text
describing a scene, given several similar options. Accomplishing the task
entails demonstrating comprehension beyond just recognizing &quot;keywords&quot; (or
key-phrases) and their corresponding visual concepts. Instead, it requires an
alignment between the representations of the two modalities that achieves a
visually-grounded &quot;understanding&quot; of various linguistic elements and their
dependencies. This new task also admits an easy-to-compute and well-studied
metric: the accuracy in detecting the true target among the decoys.
  The paper makes several contributions: an effective and extensible mechanism
for generating decoys from (human-created) image captions; an instance of
applying this mechanism, yielding a large-scale machine comprehension dataset
(based on the COCO images and captions) that we make publicly available; human
evaluation results on this dataset, informing a performance upper-bound; and
several baseline and competitive learning approaches that illustrate the
utility of the proposed task and dataset in advancing both image and language
comprehension. We also show that, in a multi-task learning setting, the
performance on the proposed task is positively correlated with the end-to-end
task of image captioning.

based on generating one audio sample at a time. We show that our model, which
profits from combining memory-less modules, namely autoregressive multilayer
perceptrons, and stateful recurrent neural networks in a hierarchical structure
is able to capture underlying sources of variations in the temporal sequences
over very long time spans, on three datasets of different nature. Human
evaluation on the generated samples indicate that our model is preferred over
competing models. We also show how each component of the model contributes to
the exhibited performance.

 <dc:description>  The Kaczmarz method is an iterative algorithm for solving systems of linear
equalities and inequalities, that iteratively projects onto these constraints.
Recently, Strohmer and Vershynin [J. Fourier Anal. Appl., 15(2):262-278, 2009]
gave a non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis for this algorithm, spurring
numerous extensions and generalizations of the Kaczmarz method. Rather than the
randomized selection rule analyzed in that work, in this paper we instead
discuss greedy and approximate greedy selection rules. We show that in some
applications the computational costs of greedy and random selection are
comparable, and that in many cases greedy selection rules give faster
convergence rates than random selection rules. Further, we give the first
multi-step analysis of Kaczmarz methods for a particular greedy rule, and
propose a provably-faster randomized selection rule for matrices with many
pairwise-orthogonal rows.

 <dc:description>  We develop a framework to uncover and analyze dynamical anomalies from
massive, nonlinear and non-stationary time series data. The framework consists
of three steps: preprocessing of massive data sets to eliminate erroneous data
segments, application of the empirical mode decomposition and Hilbert transform
paradigm to obtain the fundamental components embedded in the time series at
distinct time scales, and statistical/scaling analysis of the components. As a
case study, we apply our framework to detecting and characterizing high
frequency oscillations (HFOs) from a big database of rat EEG recordings. We
find a striking phenomenon: HFOs exhibit on-off intermittency that can be
quantified by algebraic scaling laws. Our framework can be generalized to big
data-related problems in other fields such as large-scale sensor data and
seismic data analysis.

 <dc:description>  Atom is an anonymous messaging system that protects against traffic-analysis
attacks. Unlike many prior systems, each Atom server touches only a small
fraction of the total messages routed through the network. As a result, the
system's capacity scales near-linearly with the number of servers. At the same
time, each Atom user benefits from &quot;best possible&quot; anonymity: a user is
anonymous among all honest users of the system, against an active adversary who
controls the entire network, a portion of the system's servers, and any number
of malicious users. The architectural ideas behind Atom have been known in
theory, but putting them into practice requires new techniques for (1) avoiding
the reliance on heavy general-purpose multi-party computation protocols, (2)
defeating active attacks by malicious servers at minimal performance cost, and
(3) handling server failure and churn.
  Atom is most suitable for sending a large number of short messages, as in a
microblogging application or a high-security communication bootstrapping
(&quot;dialing&quot;) for private messaging systems. We show that, on a heterogeneous
network of 1,024 servers, Atom can transit a million Tweet-length messages in
28 minutes. This is over 23x faster than prior systems with similar privacy
guarantees.

 <dc:description>  Text documents can be described by a number of abstract concepts such as
semantic category, writing style, or sentiment. Machine learning (ML) models
have been trained to automatically map documents to these abstract concepts,
allowing to annotate very large text collections, more than could be processed
by a human in a lifetime. Besides predicting the text's category very
accurately, it is also highly desirable to understand how and why the
categorization process takes place. In this paper, we demonstrate that such
understanding can be achieved by tracing the classification decision back to
individual words using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a recently
developed technique for explaining predictions of complex non-linear
classifiers. We train two word-based ML models, a convolutional neural network
(CNN) and a bag-of-words SVM classifier, on a topic categorization task and
adapt the LRP method to decompose the predictions of these models onto words.
Resulting scores indicate how much individual words contribute to the overall
classification decision. This enables one to distill relevant information from
text documents without an explicit semantic information extraction step. We
further use the word-wise relevance scores for generating novel vector-based
document representations which capture semantic information. Based on these
document vectors, we introduce a measure of model explanatory power and show
that, although the SVM and CNN models perform similarly in terms of
classification accuracy, the latter exhibits a higher level of explainability
which makes it more comprehensible for humans and potentially more useful for

 <dc:title>A Coalgebraic Approach to Quantitative Linear Time Logics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cirstea, Corina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We define quantitative fixpoint logics for reasoning about linear time
properties of states in systems with branching behaviour. We model such systems
as coalgebras whose type arises as the composition of a branching monad with
one or more polynomial endofunctors on the category of sets. The domain of
truth values for our logics is determined by the choice of branching monad, as
is the special modality used to abstract away branching in the semantics of the
logics. To justify our choice of syntax and semantics for the logics, we prove
the equivalence between their step-wise semantics and an alternative path-based
semantics for the fixpoint-free fragments of the logics. Instances of these
logics support reasoning about the possibility, probability or minimal cost of
exhibiting a given linear time property. We conclude with two examples of
logics that have a linear time flavour but do not admit a path-based semantics,
namely a logic for reasoning about resource usage in infinitely-running
computations, and a quantitative logic for reasoning about component
interaction.

 <dc:title>A State Space Approach for Piecewise-Linear Recurrent Neural Networks
  for Reconstructing Nonlinear Dynamics from Neural Measurements</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The computational properties of neural systems are often thought to be
implemented in terms of their network dynamics. Hence, recovering the system
dynamics from experimentally observed neuronal time series, like multiple
single-unit (MSU) recordings or neuroimaging data, is an important step toward
understanding its computations. Ideally, one would not only seek a state space
representation of the dynamics, but would wish to have access to its governing
equations for in-depth analysis. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a
computationally powerful and dynamically universal formal framework which has
been extensively studied from both the computational and the dynamical systems
perspective. Here we develop a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood estimation
scheme for piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) within the statistical framework of
state space models, which accounts for noise in both the underlying latent
dynamics and the observation process. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is
used to infer the latent state distribution, through a global Laplace
approximation, and the PLRNN parameters iteratively. After validating the
procedure on toy examples, the approach is applied to MSU recordings from the
rodent anterior cingulate cortex obtained during performance of a classical
working memory task, delayed alternation. A model with 5 states turned out to
be sufficient to capture the essential computational dynamics underlying task
performance, including stimulus-selective delay activity. The estimated models
were rarely multi-stable, but rather were tuned to exhibit slow dynamics in the
vicinity of a bifurcation point. In summary, the present work advances a
semi-analytical (thus reasonably fast) maximum-likelihood estimation framework
for PLRNNs that may enable to recover the relevant dynamics underlying observed
neuronal time series, and directly link them to computational properties.

 <dc:description>  The objective of this work is to develop a data processing system that can
automatically generate waypoints for navigation of an unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) to inspect surfaces of structures like buildings and bridges. The input
includes data recorded by two 2D laser scanners, orthogonally mounted on the
UAV, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To achieve the goal, algorithms
are developed to process the data collected. They are separated into three
major groups: (i) the data registration and filtering to generate a 3D model of
the structure and control the density of point clouds for data completeness
enhancement; (ii) the surface and obstacle detection to assist the UAV in
monitoring tasks; and (iii) the waypoint generation to set the flight path.
Experiments on different data sets show that the developed system is able to
reconstruct a 3D point cloud of the structure, extract its surfaces and
objects, and generate waypoints for the UAV to accomplish inspection tasks.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces the simultaneous partial-inverse problem for
polynomials and develops its application to decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon
codes and subfield-evaluation codes beyond half the minimum distance. The
simultaneous partial-inverse problem has a unique solution (up to a scale
factor), which can be computed by an efficient new algorithm, for which we also
offer some variations. Decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes and
subfield-evaluation codes (beyond half the minimum distance) can be reduced to
the simultaneous partial-inverse problem, and pertinent decoding algorithms are
obtained by easy adaptions of the simultaneous partial-inverse algorithms. The
resulting unique-decoding algorithms are new and efficient, and they have
state-of-the-art decoding capability.

 <dc:description>  Representation of human actions as a sequence of human body movements or
action attributes enables the development of models for human activity
recognition and summarization. We present an extension of the low-rank
representation (LRR) model, termed the clustering-aware structure-constrained
low-rank representation (CS-LRR) model, for unsupervised learning of human
action attributes from video data. Our model is based on the union-of-subspaces
(UoS) framework, and integrates spectral clustering into the LRR optimization
problem for better subspace clustering results. We lay out an efficient linear
alternating direction method to solve the CS-LRR optimization problem. We also
introduce a hierarchical subspace clustering approach, termed hierarchical
CS-LRR, to learn the attributes without the need for a priori specification of
their number. By visualizing and labeling these action attributes, the
hierarchical model can be used to semantically summarize long video sequences
of human actions at multiple resolutions. A human action or activity can also
be uniquely represented as a sequence of transitions from one action attribute
to another, which can then be used for human action recognition. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed model for semantic summarization and action
recognition through comprehensive experiments on five real-world human action
datasets.

 <dc:description>  Conventional wireless security assumes wireless communications are rightful
and aims to protect them against malicious eavesdropping and jamming attacks.
However, emerging infrastructure-free mobile communication networks are likely
to be illegally used (e.g., by criminals or terrorists) but difficult to be
monitored, thus imposing new challenges on the public security. To tackle this
issue, this article presents a paradigm shift of wireless security to the
surveillance and intervention of infrastructure-free suspicious and malicious
wireless communications, by exploiting legitimate eavesdropping and jamming
jointly. In particular, {\emph{proactive eavesdropping}} (via jamming) is
proposed to intercept and decode information from suspicious communication
links for the purpose of inferring their intentions and deciding further
measures against them. {\emph{Cognitive jamming}} (via eavesdropping) is also
proposed so as to disrupt, disable, and even spoof the targeted malicious
wireless communications to achieve various intervention tasks.

 <dc:description>  As more scholarly content is being born digital or digitized, digital
libraries are becoming increasingly vital to researchers leveraging scholarly
big data for scientific discovery. Given the abundance of scholarly
products-especially in environments created by the advent of social networking
services-little is known about international scholarly information needs,
information-seeking behavior, or information use. This paper aims to address
these gaps by conducting an in-depth analysis of researchers in the United
States and Qatar; learn about their research attitudes, practices, tactics,
strategies, and expectations; and address the obstacles faced during research
endeavors. Based on this analysis, the study identifies and describes new
behavior patterns on the part of researchers as they engage in the
information-seeking process. The analysis reveals that the use of academic
social networks has remarkable effects on various scholarly activities.
Further, this study identifies differences between students and faculty members
in regard to their use of academic social networks, and it identifies
differences between researchers according to discipline. The researchers who
participated in the present study represent a range of disciplinary and
cultural backgrounds. However, the study reports a number of similarities in
terms of the researchers' scholarly activities. Finally, the study illuminates
some of the implications for the design of research platforms.

 <dc:description>  In the tensor completion problem, one seeks to estimate a low-rank tensor
based on a random sample of revealed entries. In terms of the required sample
size, earlier work revealed a large gap between estimation with unbounded
computational resources (using, for instance, tensor nuclear norm minimization)
and polynomial-time algorithms. Among the latter, the best statistical
guarantees have been proved, for third-order tensors, using the sixth level of
the sum-of-squares (SOS) semidefinite programming hierarchy (Barak and Moitra,
2014). However, the SOS approach does not scale well to large problem
instances. By contrast, spectral methods --- based on unfolding or matricizing
the tensor --- are attractive for their low complexity, but have been believed
to require a much larger sample size.
  This paper presents two main contributions. First, we propose a new
unfolding-based method, which outperforms naive ones for symmetric $k$-th order
tensors of rank $r$. For this result we make a study of singular space
estimation for partially revealed matrices of large aspect ratio, which may be
of independent interest. For third-order tensors, our algorithm matches the SOS
method in terms of sample size (requiring about $rd^{3/2}$ revealed entries),
subject to a worse rank condition ($r\ll d^{3/4}$ rather than $r\ll d^{3/2}$).
We complement this result with a different spectral algorithm for third-order
tensors in the overcomplete ($r\ge d$) regime. Under a random model, this
second approach succeeds in estimating tensors of rank $d\le r \ll d^{3/2}$
from about $rd^{3/2}$ revealed entries.

 <dc:description>  A depth image provides partial geometric information of a 3D scene, namely
the shapes of physical objects as observed from a particular viewpoint. This
information is important when synthesizing images of different virtual camera
viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). It has been shown that depth
images can be efficiently coded using contour-adaptive codecs that preserve
edge sharpness, resulting in visually pleasing DIBR-synthesized images.
However, contours are typically losslessly coded as side information (SI),
which is expensive if the object shapes are complex.
  In this paper, we pursue a new paradigm in depth image coding for
color-plus-depth representation of a 3D scene: we pro-actively simplify object
shapes in a depth and color image pair to reduce depth coding cost, at a
penalty of a slight increase in synthesized view distortion. Specifically, we
first mathematically derive a distortion upper-bound proxy for 3DSwIM---a
quality metric tailored for DIBR-synthesized images. This proxy reduces
interdependency among pixel rows in a block to ease optimization. We then
approximate object contours via a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to
optimally trade off coding cost of contours using arithmetic edge coding (AEC)
with our proposed view synthesis distortion proxy. We modify the depth and
color images according to the approximated object contours in an inter-view
consistent manner. These are then coded respectively using a contour-adaptive
image codec based on graph Fourier transform (GFT) for edge preservation and
HEVC intra. Experimental results show that by maintaining sharp but simplified
object contours during contour-adaptive coding, for the same visual quality of
DIBR-synthesized virtual views, our proposal can reduce depth image coding rate
by up to 22% compared to alternative coding strategies such as HEVC intra.

 <dc:description>  This work develops a parallelized algorithm to compute the dynamic mode
decomposition (DMD) on a graphics processing unit using the streaming method of
snapshots singular value decomposition. This allows the algorithm to operate
efficiently on streaming data by avoiding redundant inner-products as new data
becomes available. In addition, it is possible to leverage the native
compressed format of many data streams, such as HD video and computational
physics codes that are represented sparsely in the Fourier domain, to massively
reduce data transfer from CPU to GPU and to enable sparse matrix
multiplications. Taken together, these algorithms facilitate real-time
streaming DMD on high-dimensional data streams. We demonstrate the proposed
method on numerous high-dimensional data sets ranging from video background
modeling to scientific computing applications, where DMD is becoming a mainstay
algorithm. The computational framework is developed as an open-source library
written in C++ with CUDA, and the algorithms may be generalized to include
other DMD advances, such as compressed sensing DMD, multi resolution DMD, or
DMD with control. Keywords: Singular value decomposition, dynamic mode
decomposition, streaming computations, graphics processing unit, video

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider discrete-time dynamic games of the mean-field type
with a finite number $N$ of agents subject to an infinite-horizon
discounted-cost optimality criterion. The state space of each agent is a
locally compact Polish space. At each time, the agents are coupled through the
empirical distribution of their states, which affects both the agents'
individual costs and their state transition probabilities. We introduce a new
solution concept of the Markov-Nash equilibrium, under which a policy is
player-by-player optimal in the class of all Markov policies. Under mild
assumptions, we demonstrate the existence of a mean-field equilibrium in the
infinite-population limit $N \to \infty$, and then show that the policy
obtained from the mean-field equilibrium is approximately Markov-Nash when the
number of agents $N$ is sufficiently large.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An improved version of stream arbitration based on multiband RF interconnect
(MRFI) is proposed. Thanks to the simultaneous multiple channel
transmitting/receiving feature of MRFI, dynamic bandwidth allocation is
achieved in the proposed arbitration algorithm. With dynamic bandwidth
allocation, MRFI based arbitration can guarantee 100% channel bandwidth
utilization, which is a significant improvement compared with original RF-I
based stream arbitration whose channel bandwidth utilization is only around
30%~50%.

 <dc:description>  This paper situates itself in the theory of variable length codes and of
finite automata where the concepts of completeness and synchronization play a
central role. In this theoretical setting, we investigate the problem of
finding upper bounds to the minimal length of synchronizing words and
incompletable words of a finite language X in terms of the length of the words
of X. This problem is related to two well-known conjectures formulated by Cerny
and Restivo, respectively. In particular, if Restivo's conjecture is true, our
main result provides a quadratic bound for the minimal length of a
synchronizing pair of any finite synchronizing complete code with respect to
the maximal length of its words.

 <dc:description>  We study a novel communication mechanism, ambient backscatter, that utilizes
radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted from an ambient source as both energy
supply and information carrier to enable communications between low-power
devices. Different from existing non-coherent schemes, we here design the
semi-coherent detection, where channel parameters can be obtained from unknown
data symbols and a few pilot symbols. We first derive the optimal detector for
the complex Gaussian ambient RF signal from likelihood ratio test and compute
the corresponding closed-form bit error rate (BER). To release the requirement
for prior knowledge of the ambient RF signal, we next design a suboptimal
energy detector with ambient RF signals being either the complex Gaussian or
the phase shift keying (PSK). The corresponding detection thresholds, the
analytical BER, and the outage probability are also obtained in closed-form.
Interestingly, the complex Gaussian source would cause an error floor while the
PSK source does not, which brings nontrivial indication of constellation design
as opposed to the popular Gaussian-embedded literatures. Simulations are
provided to corroborate the theoretical studies.

 <dc:description>  Wireless network virtualization and information-centric networking (ICN) are
two promising technologies for next generation wireless networks. Although some
excellent works have focused on these two technologies, device-to-device (D2D)
communications have not beeen investigated in information-centric virtualized
cellular networks. Meanwhile, content caching in mobile devices has attracted
great attentions due to the saved backhaul consumption or reduced transmission
latency in D2D-assisted cellular networks. However, when it comes to the
multi-operator scenario, the direct content sharing between different operators
via D2D communications is typically infeasible. In this article, we propose a
novel information-centric virtualized cellular network framework with D2D
communications, enabling not only content caching in the air, but also
inter-operator content sharing between mobile devices. Moreover, we describe
the key components in the proposed framework, and present the interactions
among them. In addition, we incorporate and formulate the content caching
strategies in resource allocation optimization, to maximize the total utility
of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) through caching popular contents in
mobile devices. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework and scheme with different system parameters.

 <dc:description>  HEVC includes a Coding Unit (CU) level luminance-based perceptual
quantization technique known as AdaptiveQP. AdaptiveQP perceptually adjusts the
Quantization Parameter (QP) at the CU level based on the spatial activity of
raw input video data in a luma Coding Block (CB). In this paper, we propose a
novel cross-color channel adaptive quantization scheme which perceptually
adjusts the CU level QP according to the spatial activity of raw input video
data in the constituent luma and chroma CBs; i.e., the combined spatial
activity across all three color channels (the Y, Cb and Cr channels). Our
technique is evaluated in HM 16 with 4:4:4, 4:2:2 and 4:2:0 YCbCr JCT-VC test
sequences. Both subjective and objective visual quality evaluations are
undertaken during which we compare our method with AdaptiveQP. Our technique
achieves considerable coding efficiency improvements, with maximum BD-Rate
reductions of 15.9% (Y), 13.1% (Cr) and 16.1% (Cb) in addition to a maximum
decoding time reduction of 11.0%.

 <dc:description>  Modern statistical machine learning (SML) methods share a major limitation
with the early approaches to AI: there is no scalable way to adapt them to new
domains. Human learning solves this in part by leveraging a rich, shared,
updateable world model. Such scalability requires modularity: updating part of
the world model should not impact unrelated parts. We have argued that such
modularity will require both &quot;correctability&quot; (so that errors can be corrected
without introducing new errors) and &quot;interpretability&quot; (so that we can
understand what components need correcting).
  To achieve this, one could attempt to adapt state of the art SML systems to
be interpretable and correctable; or one could see how far the simplest
possible interpretable, correctable learning methods can take us, and try to
control the limitations of SML methods by applying them only where needed. Here
we focus on the latter approach and we investigate two main ideas: &quot;Teacher
Assisted Learning&quot;, which leverages crowd sourcing to learn language; and
&quot;Factored Dialog Learning&quot;, which factors the process of application
development into roles where the language competencies needed are isolated,
enabling non-experts to quickly create new applications.
  We test these ideas in an &quot;Automated Personal Assistant&quot; (APA) setting, with
two scenarios: that of detecting user intent from a user-APA dialog; and that
of creating a class of event reminder applications, where a non-expert
&quot;teacher&quot; can then create specific apps. For the intent detection task, we use
a dataset of a thousand labeled utterances from user dialogs with Cortana, and
we show that our approach matches state of the art SML methods, but in addition
provides full transparency: the whole (editable) model can be summarized on one
human-readable page. For the reminder app task, we ran small user studies to
verify the efficacy of the approach.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new deep supervised learning method for intrinsic decomposition
of a single image into its albedo and shading components. Our contributions are
based on a new fully convolutional neural network that estimates absolute
albedo and shading jointly. As opposed to classical intrinsic image
decomposition work, it is fully data-driven, hence does not require any
physical priors like shading smoothness or albedo sparsity, nor does it rely on
geometric information such as depth. Compared to recent deep learning
techniques, we simplify the architecture, making it easier to build and train.
It relies on a single end-to-end deep sequence of residual blocks and a
perceptually-motivated metric formed by two discriminator networks. We train
and demonstrate our architecture on the publicly available MPI Sintel dataset
and its intrinsic image decomposition augmentation. We additionally discuss and
augment the set of quantitative metrics so as to account for the more
challenging recovery of non scale-invariant quantities. Results show that our
work outperforms the state of the art algorithms both on the qualitative and
quantitative aspect, while training convergence time is reduced.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the nonlinear Least Square Error (LSE) precoders for
multiuser MIMO broadcast channels. The output signals of LSE Precoders are
limited to be chosen from a predefined set which let these precoders address
several constraints such as peak power limitation, constant envelope
transmission and discrete constellations. We study the large-system performance
of these precoders via the replica method from statistical physics, and derive
a closed-form expression for the asymptotic distortion. Our results demonstrate
that an LSE precoder with the output peak-to-average power ratio of $3~{\rm
dB}$ can track the performance of the Regularized Zero Forcing (RZF) precoder
closely. As the peak-to-average power ratio reduces to one, the constant
envelope precoder is recovered. The investigations depict that the performance
of the RZF precoder is achieved by the constant envelope precoder with $20\%$
of more transmit antennas. For $M$-PSK constellations, our analysis gives a
lower-bound on the asymptotic distortion which is tight for moderate
antenna-to-user ratios and deviates as the ratio grows. We improve this bound
by deriving the replica solution under one-step of replica symmetry breaking.
Our numerical investigations for this case show that the bound is tight for
antenna-to-user ratios less than $5$.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces negotiations, a model of concurrency close to Petri
nets, with multi-party negotiations as concurrency primitive. We study two
fundamental analysis problems. The soundness problem consists in deciding if it
is always possible for a negotiation to terminate successfully, whatever the
current state is. Given a sound negotiation, the summarization problem aims at
computing an equivalent one-step negotiation with the same input/output
behavior. The soundness and summarization problems can be solved by means of
simple algorithms acting on the state space of the negotiation, which however
face the well-known state explosion problem. We study alternative algorithms
that avoid the construction of the state space. In particular, we define
reduction rules that simplify a negotiation while preserving the
sound/non-sound character of the negotiation and its summary. In a first result
we show that our rules are complete for the class of weakly deterministic
acyclic negotiations, meaning that they reduce all sound negotiations in this
class, and only them, to equivalent one-step negotiations. This provides
algorithms for both the soundness and summarization problems that avoid the
construction of the state space. We then study the class of deterministic
negotiations. Our second main result shows that the rules are also complete for
this class, even if the negotiation contains cycles. Moreover, we present an
algorithm that completely reduces all sound deterministic negotiations, and
only them, in polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  Single image super-resolution is the task of inferring a high-resolution
image from a single low-resolution input. Traditionally, the performance of
algorithms for this task is measured using pixel-wise reconstruction measures
such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which have been shown to correlate
poorly with the human perception of image quality. As a result, algorithms
minimizing these metrics tend to produce over-smoothed images that lack
high-frequency textures and do not look natural despite yielding high PSNR
values.
  We propose a novel application of automated texture synthesis in combination
with a perceptual loss focusing on creating realistic textures rather than
optimizing for a pixel-accurate reproduction of ground truth images during
training. By using feed-forward fully convolutional neural networks in an
adversarial training setting, we achieve a significant boost in image quality
at high magnification ratios. Extensive experiments on a number of datasets
show the effectiveness of our approach, yielding state-of-the-art results in
both quantitative and qualitative benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Geopolitics focuses on political power in relation to geographic space.
Interactions among world countries have been widely studied at various scales,
observing economic exchanges, world history or international politics among
others. This work exhibits the potential of Wikipedia mining for such studies.
Indeed, Wikipedia stores valuable fine-grained dependencies among countries by
linking webpages together for diverse types of interactions (not only related
to economical, political or historical facts). We mine herein the Wikipedia
networks of several language editions using the recently proposed method of
reduced Google matrix analysis. This approach allows to establish direct and
hidden links between a subset of nodes that belong to a much larger directed
network. Our study concentrates on 40 major countries chosen worldwide. Our aim
is to offer a multicultural perspective on their interactions by comparing
networks extracted from five different Wikipedia language editions, emphasizing
English, Russian and Arabic ones. We demonstrate that this approach allows to
recover meaningful direct and hidden links among the 40 countries of interest.

 <dc:title>Understanding Non-optical Remote-sensed Images: Needs, Challenges and
  Ways Forward</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mishra, Amit Kumar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Non-optical remote-sensed images are going to be used more often in man-
aging disaster, crime and precision agriculture. With more small satellites and
unmanned air vehicles planning to carry radar and hyperspectral image sensors
there is going to be an abundance of such data in the recent future.
Understanding these data in real-time will be crucial in attaining some of the
important sustain- able development goals. Processing non-optical images is, in
many ways, different from that of optical images. Most of the recent advances
in the domain of image understanding has been using optical images. In this
article we shall explain the needs for image understanding in non-optical
domain and the typical challenges. Then we shall describe the existing
approaches and how we can move from there to the desired goal of a reliable
real-time image understanding system.

 <dc:description>  Clustering is a classic topic in optimization with $k$-means being one of the
most fundamental such problems. In the absence of any restrictions on the
input, the best known algorithm for $k$-means with a provable guarantee is a
simple local search heuristic yielding an approximation guarantee of
$9+\epsilon$, a ratio that is known to be tight with respect to such methods.
  We overcome this barrier by presenting a new primal-dual approach that allows
us to (1) exploit the geometric structure of $k$-means and (2) to satisfy the
hard constraint that at most $k$ clusters are selected without deteriorating
the approximation guarantee. Our main result is a $6.357$-approximation
algorithm with respect to the standard LP relaxation. Our techniques are quite
general and we also show improved guarantees for the general version of
$k$-means where the underlying metric is not required to be Euclidean and for
$k$-median in Euclidean metrics.

nuclear norm (also known as trace norm) are explicitly known. This note
provides a simple characterization of all operators saturating the upper and

 <dc:description>  One of the key tasks of sentiment analysis of product reviews is to extract
product aspects or features that users have expressed opinions on. In this
work, we focus on using supervised sequence labeling as the base approach to
performing the task. Although several extraction methods using sequence
labeling methods such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and Hidden Markov
Models (HMM) have been proposed, we show that this supervised approach can be
significantly improved by exploiting the idea of concept sharing across
multiple domains. For example, &quot;screen&quot; is an aspect in iPhone, but not only
iPhone has a screen, many electronic devices have screens too. When &quot;screen&quot;
appears in a review of a new domain (or product), it is likely to be an aspect
too. Knowing this information enables us to do much better extraction in the
new domain. This paper proposes a novel extraction method exploiting this idea
in the context of supervised sequence labeling. Experimental results show that
it produces markedly better results than without using the past information.

 <dc:title>TCP SIAD: Congestion Control supporting High Speed and Low Latency</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kuehlewind, Mirja</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Congestion control has been an open research issue for more than two decades.
More and more applications with narrow latency requirements are emerging which
are not well addressed by existing proposals. In this paper we present TCP
Scalable Increase Adaptive Decrease (SIAD), a new congestion control scheme
supporting both high speed and low latency. More precisely, our algorithm aims
to provide high utilization under various networking conditions, and therefore
would allow operators to configure small buffers for low latency support. To
provide full scalability with high speed networks, we designed TCP SIAD based
on a new approach that aims for a fixed feedback rate independent of the
available bandwidth. Further, our approach provides a configuration knob for
the feedback rate. This can be used by a higher layer control loop to impact
the capacity share, potentially at the cost of higher congestion, e.g. for
applications that need a minimum rate.
  We evaluated TCP SIAD against well-known high-speed congestion control
schemes, such as Scalable TCP and High Speed TCP, as well as H-TCP that among
other goals targets small buffers. We show that only SIAD is able to utilize
the bottleneck with arbitrary buffer sizes while avoiding a standing queue.
Moreover, we demonstrate the capacity sharing of SIAD depending on the
configured feedback rate and a high robustness of TCP SIAD to non-congestion
related loss.

 <dc:description>  In order to cope with the severe path loss, millimeter-wave (mm-wave) systems
exploit highly directional communication. As a consequence, even a slight beam
misalignment between two communicating devices (for example, due to mobility)
can generate a significant signal drop. This leads to frequent invocations of
time-consuming mechanisms for beam re-alignment, which deteriorate system
performance. In this paper, we propose smart beam training and tracking
strategies for fast mm-wave link establishment and maintenance under node
mobility. We leverage the ability of hybrid analog-digital transceivers to
collect channel information from multiple spatial directions simultaneously and
formulate a probabilistic optimization problem to model the temporal evolution
of the mm-wave channel under mobility. In addition, we present for the first
time a beam tracking algorithm that extracts information needed to update the
steering directions directly from data packets, without the need for spatial
scanning during the ongoing data transmission. Simulation results, obtained by
a custom simulator based on ray tracing, demonstrate the ability of our beam
training/tracking strategies to keep the communication rate only 10% below the
optimal bound. Compared to the state of the art, our approach provides a 40% to
150% rate increase, yet requires lower complexity hardware.

 <dc:description>  Obtaining common representations from different modalities is important in
that they are interchangeable with each other in a classification problem. For
example, we can train a classifier on image features in the common
representations and apply it to the testing of the text features in the
representations. Existing multi-modal representation learning methods mainly
aim to extract rich information from paired samples and train a classifier by
the corresponding labels; however, collecting paired samples and their labels
simultaneously involves high labor costs. Addressing paired modal samples
without their labels and single modal data with their labels independently is
much easier than addressing labeled multi-modal data. To obtain the common
representations under such a situation, we propose to make the distributions
over different modalities similar in the learned representations, namely
modality-invariant representations. In particular, we propose a novel algorithm
for modality-invariant representation learning, named Deep Modality Invariant
Adversarial Network (DeMIAN), which utilizes the idea of Domain Adaptation
(DA). Using the modality-invariant representations learned by DeMIAN, we
achieved better classification accuracy than with the state-of-the-art methods,
especially for some benchmark datasets of zero-shot learning.

image is extracted from raw depth image using random forest. Then the edge
information is combined with depth information in our CNN structure. We study
several fusion approaches and suggest a slow fusion strategy as a promising way
of fingertip detection. As shown in our experiments, our real-time algorithm
outperforms state-of-the-art fingertip detection methods on the public dataset
HandNet with an average 3D error of 9.9mm, and shows comparable accuracy of
fingertip estimation on NYU hand dataset.

 <dc:description>  Delivery of broadcast messages among vehicles for safety purposes, which is
known as one of the key ingredients of Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS), requires an efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) that provides low
average delay and high reliability. To this end, a Geo-Location Based Access
(GLOC) for vehicles has been proposed for Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
communications, aiming at maximizing the distance of co-channel transmitters
while preserving a low latency when accessing the resources. In this paper we
analyze, with the aid of stochastic geometry, the delivery of periodic and
non-periodic broadcast messages with GLOC, taking into account path loss and
fading as well as the random locations of transmitting vehicles. Analytical
results include the average interference, average Binary Rate (BR), capture
probability, i.e., the probability of successful message transmission, and
Energy Efficiency (EE). Mathematical analysis reveals interesting insights
about the system performance, which are validated thought extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. In particular, it is shown that the capture probability is an
increasing function with exponential dependence with respect to the transmit
power and it is demonstrated that an arbitrary high capture probability can be
achieved, as long as the number of access resources is high enough. Finally, to
facilitate the system-level design of GLOC, the optimum transmit power is
derived, which leads to a maximal EE subject to a given constraint in the
capture probability.

 <dc:description>  Automatic detection of pulmonary nodules in thoracic computed tomography (CT)
scans has been an active area of research for the last two decades. However,
there have only been few studies that provide a comparative performance
evaluation of different systems on a common database. We have therefore set up
the LUNA16 challenge, an objective evaluation framework for automatic nodule
detection algorithms using the largest publicly available reference database of
chest CT scans, the LIDC-IDRI data set. In LUNA16, participants develop their
algorithm and upload their predictions on 888 CT scans in one of the two
tracks: 1) the complete nodule detection track where a complete CAD system
should be developed, or 2) the false positive reduction track where a provided
set of nodule candidates should be classified. This paper describes the setup
of LUNA16 and presents the results of the challenge so far. Moreover, the
impact of combining individual systems on the detection performance was also
investigated. It was observed that the leading solutions employed convolutional
networks and used the provided set of nodule candidates. The combination of
these solutions achieved an excellent sensitivity of over 95% at fewer than 1.0
false positives per scan. This highlights the potential of combining algorithms
to improve the detection performance. Our observer study with four expert
readers has shown that the best system detects nodules that were missed by
expert readers who originally annotated the LIDC-IDRI data. We released this
set of additional nodules for further development of CAD systems.

 <dc:title>A discrete-time Pontryagin maximum principle on matrix Lie groups</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this article we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) for
discrete-time optimal control problems on matrix Lie groups. The PMP provides
first order necessary conditions for optimality; these necessary conditions
typically yield two point boundary value problems, and these boundary value
problems can then solved to extract optimal control trajectories. Constrained
optimal control problems for mechanical systems, in general, can only be solved
numerically, and this motivates the need to derive discrete-time models that
are accurate and preserve the non-flat manifold structures of the underlying
continuous-time controlled systems. The PMPs for discrete-time systems evolving
on Euclidean spaces are not readily applicable to discrete-time models evolving
on non-flat manifolds. In this article we bridge this lacuna and establish a
discrete-time PMP on matrix Lie groups. Our discrete-time models are derived
via discrete mechanics, (a structure preserving discretization scheme,) leading
to the preservation of the underlying manifold over time, thereby resulting in
greater numerical accuracy of our technique. This PMP caters to a class of
constrained optimal control problems that includes point-wise state and control
action constraints, and encompasses a large class of control problems that
arise in various field of engineering and the applied sciences.

 <dc:description>  This paper will design non-linear frequency modulation (NLFM) signal for
Chebyshev, Kaiser, Taylor, and raised-cosine power spectral densities (PSDs).
Then, the variation of peak sidelobe level with regard to mainlobe width for
these four different window functions are analyzed. It has been demonstrated
that reduction of sidelobe level in NLFM signal can lead to increase in
mainlobe width of autocorrelation function. Furthermore, the results of power
spectral density obtained from the simulation and the desired PSD are compared.
Finally, error percentage between simulated PSD and desired PSD for different
peak sidelobe level are illustrated. The stationary phase concept is the
possible source for this error.

 <dc:description>  In the age of cloud computing, cloud users with a limited amount of storage
can outsource their data to remote servers. The cloud servers, in lieu of
monetary benefits, offer retrievability of their clients' data at any point of
time. A client's data can be dynamic (or static) in nature depending on whether
the client can (or cannot) update the uploaded data as needed. Secure cloud
storage protocols enable a client to check the integrity of her outsourced data
by auditing the data. In this work, we explore the possibility of constructing
a secure cloud storage for dynamic data by leveraging the idea of secure
network coding. Specifically, we fail to provide a general construction of an
efficient secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data from an arbitrary
secure network coding protocol. However, we show that some of the secure
network coding schemes can be used to construct secure cloud storage protocols
for dynamic data, and we construct such a secure cloud storage protocol based
on a secure network coding protocol. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme
is the first secure cloud storage protocol for dynamic data that is based on a
secure network coding protocol and that is secure in the standard model.
  In a publicly verifiable setting, auditing task is often delegated to a third
party auditor that audits the outsourced data on behalf of a client. We extend
our scheme in order to provide privacy-preserving and to offer anonymity (from
the server) of a user updating shared data in an enterprise setting. We compare
the performance of our secure cloud storage protocol with that of other secure
cloud storage schemes and discuss some limitations of our scheme. Finally, we
provide another construction of a secure cloud storage protocol specific to
append-only data --- that overcomes some of the limitations of our earlier
scheme.

 <dc:description>  The three bio-inspired strategies that have been used for balance recovery of
biped robots are the ankle, hip and stepping Strategies. However, there are
several cases for a biped robot where stepping is not possible, e. g. when the
available contact surfaces are limited. In this situation, the balance recovery
by modulating the angular momentum of the upper body (Hip-strategy) or the Zero
Moment Point (ZMP) (Ankle strategy) is essential. In this paper, a single Model
Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is employed for controlling the Capture Point
(CP) to a desired position by modulating both the ZMP and the Centroidal Moment
Pivot (CMP). The goal of the proposed controller is to control the CP,
employing the CMP when the CP is out of the support polygon, and/or the ZMP
when the CP is inside the support polygon. The proposed algorithm is
implemented on an abstract model of the SURENA III humanoid robot. Obtained
results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the presence of
severe pushes, even when the support polygon is shrunken to a point or a line.

 <dc:description>  Many state-of-the-art delineation methods rely on supervised machine learning
algorithms. As a result, they require manually annotated training data, which
is tedious to obtain. Furthermore, even minor classification errors may
significantly affect the topology of the final result. In this paper we propose
a generic approach to addressing both of these problems by taking into account
the influence of a potential misclassification on the resulting delineation. In
an Active Learning context, we identify parts of linear structures that should
be annotated first in order to train a classifier effectively. In a
proofreading context, we similarly find regions of the resulting reconstruction
that should be verified in priority to obtain a nearly-perfect result. In both
cases, by focusing the attention of the human expert on potential
classification mistakes which are the most critical parts of the delineation,
we reduce the amount of required supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on microscopy images depicting blood vessels and neurons.

 <dc:description>  Aerial images are often degraded by space-varying motion blur and
simultaneous uneven illumination. To recover high-quality aerial image from its
non-uniform version, we propose a novel patch-wise restoration approach based
on a key observation that the degree of blurring is inevitably affected by the
illuminated conditions. A non-local Retinex model is developed to accurately
estimate the reflectance component from the degraded aerial image. Thereafter
the uneven illumination is corrected well. And then non-uniform coupled
blurring in the enhanced reflectance image is alleviated and transformed
towards uniform distribution, which will facilitate the subsequent deblurring.
For constructing the multi-scale sparsified regularizer, the discrete shearlet
transform is improved to better represent anisotropic image features in term of
directional sensitivity and selectivity. In addition, a new adaptive variant of
total generalized variation is proposed for the structure-preserving
regularizer. These complementary regularizers are elegantly integrated into an
objective function. The final deblurred image with uniform illumination can be
extracted by applying the fast alternating direction scheme to solve the
derived function. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can
not only remove both the space-varying illumination and motion blur in the
aerial image effectively but also recover the abundant details of aerial scenes
with top-level objective and subjective quality, and outperforms other
state-of-the-art restoration methods.

 <dc:description>  Descriptions of quantum algorithms, communication etc. protocols assume the
existence of closed quantum system. However, real life quantum systems are open
and are highly sensitive to errors. Hence error correction is of utmost
importance if quantum computation is to be carried out in reality. Ideally, an
error correction block should be placed after every gate operation in a quantum
circuit. This increases the overhead and reduced the speedup of the quantum
circuit. Moreover, the error correction blocks themselves may induce errors as
the gates used for error correction may be noisy. In this paper, we have
proposed a procedure to trace error probability due to noisy gates and
decoherence in quantum circuit and place an error correcting block only when
the error probability exceeds a certain threshold. This procedure shows a
drastic reduction in the required number of error correcting blocks.
Furthermore, we have considered concatenated codes with tile structure layout
lattice architecture[25][21],[24] and SWAP gate based qubit transport
mechanism. Tracing errors in higher levels of concatenation shows that, in most
cases, after 1 or 2 levels of concatenation, the number of QECC blocks required
become static. However, since the gate count increases with increasing
concatenation, the percentage saving in gate count is considerably high.

 <dc:description>  The paper proposes an analysis of liquid democracy (or, delegable proxy
voting) from the perspective of binary aggregation and of binary diffusion
models. We show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be embedded into the
framework of binary aggregation with abstentions, enabling the transfer of
known results about the latter---such as impossibility theorems---to the
former. This embedding also sheds light on the relation between delegation
cycles in liquid democracy and the probability of collective abstentions, as
well as the issue of individual rationality in a delegable proxy voting
setting. We then show how liquid democracy on binary issues can be modeled and
analyzed also as a specific process of dynamics of binary opinions on networks.
These processes---called Boolean DeGroot processes---are a special case of the
DeGroot stochastic model of opinion diffusion. We establish the convergence
conditions of such processes and show they provide some novel insights on how
the effects of delegation cycles and individual rationality could be mitigated
within liquid democracy.
  The study is a first attempt to provide theoretical foundations to the
delgable proxy features of the liquid democracy voting system. Our analysis
suggests recommendations on how the system may be modified to make it more
resilient with respect to the handling of delegation cycles and of inconsistent
majorities.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we propose a novel image denoising method based on
correlation preserving sparse coding. Because the instable and unreliable
correlations among basis set can limit the performance of the dictionary-driven
denoising methods, two effective regularized strategies are employed in the
coding process. Specifically, a graph-based regularizer is built for preserving
the global similarity correlations, which can adaptively capture both the
geometrical structures and discriminative features of textured patches. In
particular, edge weights in the graph are obtained by seeking a nonnegative
low-rank construction. Besides, a robust locality-constrained coding can
automatically preserve not only spatial neighborhood information but also
internal consistency present in noisy patches while learning overcomplete
dictionary. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both PSNR and subjective
visual quality.

 <dc:description>  A traditional database systems is organized around a single data model that
determines how data can be organized, stored and manipulated. But the vision of
this paper is to develop new principles and techniques to manage multiple data
models against a single, integrated backend. For example, semi-structured,
graph and relational models are examples of data models that may be supported
by a new system. Having a single data platform for managing both
well-structured data and NoSQL data is beneficial to users; this approach
significantly reduces integration, migration, development, maintenance and
operational issues. The problem is challenging: the existing database
principles mainly work for a single model and the research on multi-model data
management is still at an early stage. In this paper, we envision a UDBMS
(Unified Database Management System) for multi-model data management in one
platform. UDBMS will provide several new features such as unified data model
and flexible schema, unified query processing, unified index structure and
cross-model transaction guarantees. We discuss our vision as well as present
multiple research challenges that we need to address.

 <dc:title>On the complete width and edge clique cover problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A complete graph is the graph in which every two vertices are adjacent. For a
graph $G=(V,E)$, the complete width of $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that there
exist $k$ independent sets $\mathtt{N}_i\subseteq V$, $1\le i\le k$, such that
the graph $G'$ obtained from $G$ by adding some new edges between certain
vertices inside the sets $\mathtt{N}_i$, $1\le i\le k$, is a complete graph.
The complete width problem is to decide whether the complete width of a given
graph is at most $k$ or not. In this paper we study the complete width problem.
We show that the complete width problem is NP-complete on $3K_2$-free bipartite
graphs and polynomially solvable on $2K_2$-free bipartite graphs and on
$(2K_2,C_4)$-free graphs. As a by-product, we obtain the following new results:
the edge clique cover problem is NP-complete on $\overline{3K_2}$-free
co-bipartite graphs and polynomially solvable on $C_4$-free co-bipartite graphs
and on $(2K_2, C_4)$-free graphs. We also give a characterization for $k$-probe
complete graphs which implies that the complete width problem admits a kernel
of at most $2^k$ vertices. This provides another proof for the known fact that
the edge clique cover problem admits a kernel of at most $2^k$ vertices.
Finally we determine all graphs of small complete width $k\le 3$.

 <dc:description>  The sparse matrix-vector multiply (SpMV) operation is a key computational
kernel in many simulations and linear solvers. The large communication
requirements associated with a reference implementation of a parallel SpMV
result in poor parallel scalability. The cost of communication depends on the
physical locations of the send and receive processes: messages injected into
the network are more costly than messages sent between processes on the same
node. In this paper, a node aware parallel SpMV (NAPSpMV) is introduced to
exploit knowledge of the system topology, specifically the node-processor
layout, to reduce costs associated with communication. The values of the input
vector are redistributed to minimize both the number and the size of messages
that are injected into the network during a SpMV, leading to a reduction in
communication costs. A variety of computational experiments that highlight the
efficiency of this approach are presented.

 <dc:title>A Secure Multiple-Access Scheme for Rechargeable Wireless Sensors in the

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a simple yet efficient scheme for a set of energy-harvesting
sensors to establish secure communication with a common destination (a master
node). An eavesdropper attempts to decode the data sent from the sensors to
their common destination. We assume a single modulation scheme that can be
implemented efficiently for energy-limited applications. We design a
multiple-access scheme for the sensors under secrecy and limited-energy
constraints. In a given time slot, each energy-harvesting sensor chooses
between sending its packet or remaining idle. The destination assigns a set of
data time slots to each sensor. The optimization problem is formulated to
maximize the secrecy sum-throughput.

 <dc:title>Secure Transmissions Using Artificial Noise in MIMO Wiretap Interference
  Channel: A Game Theoretic Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider joint optimization of artificial noise (AN) and information
signals in a MIMO wiretap interference network, wherein the transmission of
each link may be overheard by several MIMO-capable eavesdroppers. Each
information signal is accompanied with AN, generated by the same user to
confuse nearby eavesdroppers. Using a noncooperative game, a distributed
optimization mechanism is proposed to maximize the secrecy rate of each link.
The decision variables here are the covariance matrices for the information
signals and ANs. However, the nonconvexity of each link's optimization problem
(i.e., best response) makes conventional convex games inapplicable, even to
find whether a Nash Equilibrium (NE) exists. To tackle this issue, we analyze
the proposed game using a relaxed equilibrium concept, called quasi-Nash
equilibrium (QNE). Under a constraint qualification condition for each player's
problem, the set of QNEs includes the NE of the proposed game. We also derive
the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the resulting QNE. It turns
out that the uniqueness conditions are too restrictive, and do not always hold
in typical network scenarios. Thus, the proposed game often has multiple QNEs,
and convergence to a QNE is not always guaranteed. To overcome these issues, we
modify the utility functions of the players by adding several specific terms to
each utility function. The modified game converges to a QNE even when multiple
QNEs exist. Furthermore, players have the ability to select a desired QNE that
optimizes a given social objective (e.g., sum-rate or secrecy sum-rate).
Depending on the chosen objective, the amount of signaling overhead as well as
the performance of resulting QNE can be controlled. Simulations show that due
to the QNE selection mechanism, we can achieve a significant improvement in
terms of secrecy sum-rate and power efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Understanding computational speed-up is fundamental for the development of
efficient quantum algorithms. In this paper, we study such problem under the
framework of the Quantum Query Model, which represents the probability of
output $x \in \{0,1\}^n$ as a function $\pi(x)$, and denotes by $L(\pi)$ the
spectral norm for $\pi$ defined over the Fourier basis of the linear space of
functions $f: \left\{0,1\right\}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. We then present a
classical simulation for output probabilities $\pi$, whose error depends on
$L(\pi)$. Such dependence implies upper-bounds for the quotient between the
number of queries of an optimal classical algorithm and our quantum algorithm,
respectively. These upper-bounds show a strong relation between spectral norm
and quantum parallelism. This result also implies that there is no asymptotic
quantum speed-up for a sequence of boolean functions of constant degree.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), the percentage of global
emissions attributable to Information Systems is expected to further increase
in the coming years, due to a proliferation of Internet-connected devices
omnipresent in our daily lives (e.g., electric meters, wearable devices, etc.).
Although software systems do not directly consume energy, they strongly affect
the energy consumption of the hardware. So, developers should be more aware of
the energy consumed by these systems during their lifetime, and think about the
long-term consequences in the sustainability of our planet Earth. Indeed, once
deployed, the energy consumed by a system depends on several factors determined
mainly by the usage context. This means that the area of energy-efficient
software development needs green development lifecycles that provide
appropriate methodologies and tools to identify and analyze the energy hotspots
of applications early at design time, and see how they can be self-adapted to
the runtime context usage. Regrettably, there is a narrow view of developers
and users and their responsibility in the energy consumed during application
execution. Developers rarely address energy efficiency as some recent studies
show, mostly because they lack appropriate methodologies and tools that help
them to produce green software at runtime. So, although software energy
efficiency is becoming increasingly important in an ever more
technology-dependent world, development processes of self-greening systems
supported by tools are still in their infancy. On the other hand, considering
that many of current applications are normally deployed in smartphones or in
any kind of smart objects (e.g., sensors, watches, etc.), optimizing the energy
consumption during the execution will also have a strong impact in battery
saving, enhancing the quality of experience of final users.

 <dc:description>  In the $2$-reachability problem we are given a directed graph $G$ and we wish
to determine if there are two (edge or vertex) disjoint paths from $u$ to $v$,
for a given pair of vertices $u$ and $v$. In this paper, we present an
algorithm that computes $2$-reachability information for all pairs of vertices
in $\mathcal{O}(n^{\omega}\log n)$ time, where $n$ is the number of vertices
and $\omega$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. Hence, we show that the
running time of all-pairs $2$-reachability is only within a $\log$ factor of
transitive closure.
  Moreover, our algorithm produces a witness (i.e., a separating edge or a
separating vertex) for all pair of vertices where $2$-reachability does not
hold. By processing these witnesses, we can compute all the edge- and
vertex-dominator trees of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ additional time, which in
turn enables us to answer various connectivity queries in $\mathcal{O}(1)$
time. For instance, we can test in constant time if there is a path from $u$ to
$v$ avoiding an edge $e$, for any pair of query vertices $u$ and $v$, and any
query edge $e$, or if there is a path from $u$ to $v$ avoiding a vertex $w$,
for any query vertices $u$, $v$, and $w$.

 <dc:description>  We investigate joint information and energy cooperative schemes in a
slotted-time cognitive radio network with a primary transmitter-receiver pair
and a set of secondary transmitter-receiver pairs. The primary transmitter is
assumed to be an energy-harvesting node. We propose a three-stage cooperative
transmission protocol. During the first stage, the primary user releases a
portion of its time slot to the secondary nodes to send their data and to power
the energy-harvesting primary transmitter from the secondary radio-frequency
signals. During the second stage, the primary transmitter sends its data to its
destination and to the secondary nodes. During the third stage, the secondary
nodes amplify and forward the primary data. We propose five different schemes
for secondary access and powering the primary transmitter. We derive
closed-form expressions for the primary and secondary rates for all the
proposed schemes. Two of the proposed schemes use distributed beamforming to
power the primary transmitter. We design a sparsity-aware relay-selection
scheme based on the compressive sensing principles. Our numerical results
demonstrate the gains of our proposed schemes for both the primary and
secondary systems.

 <dc:title>Constructing Effective Personalized Policies Using Counterfactual

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel approach for constructing effective personalized
policies when the observed data lacks counter-factual information, is biased
and possesses many features. The approach is applicable in a wide variety of
settings from healthcare to advertising to education to finance. These settings
have in common that the decision maker can observe, for each previous instance,
an array of features of the instance, the action taken in that instance, and
the reward realized -- but not the rewards of actions that were not taken: the
counterfactual information. Learning in such settings is made even more
difficult because the observed data is typically biased by the existing policy
(that generated the data) and because the array of features that might affect
the reward in a particular instance -- and hence should be taken into account
in deciding on an action in each particular instance -- is often vast. The
approach presented here estimates propensity scores for the observed data,
infers counterfactuals, identifies a (relatively small) number of features that
are (most) relevant for each possible action and instance, and prescribes a
policy to be followed. Comparison of the proposed algorithm against the
state-of-art algorithm on actual datasets demonstrates that the proposed
algorithm achieves a significant improvement in performance.

 <dc:description>  The pre-dominant approach to language modeling to date is based on recurrent
neural networks. Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to
capture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach
through stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow
parallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating
mechanism that outperforms Oord et al (2016) and investigate the impact of key
architectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the
WikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well
as competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark. Our model reduces
the latency to score a sentence by an order of magnitude compared to a
recurrent baseline. To our knowledge, this is the first time a non-recurrent
approach is competitive with strong recurrent models on these large scale
language tasks.

 <dc:description>  We introduce ProjectQ, an open source software effort for quantum computing.
The first release features a compiler framework capable of targeting various
types of hardware, a high-performance simulator with emulation capabilities,
and compiler plug-ins for circuit drawing and resource estimation. We introduce
our Python-embedded domain-specific language, present the features, and provide
example implementations for quantum algorithms. The framework allows testing of
quantum algorithms through simulation and enables running them on actual
quantum hardware using a back-end connecting to the IBM Quantum Experience
cloud service. Through extension mechanisms, users can provide back-ends to
further quantum hardware, and scientists working on quantum compilation can
provide plug-ins for additional compilation, optimization, gate synthesis, and
layout strategies.

 <dc:description>  The number of works addressing the role of energy efficiency in the software
development has been increasing recently. But, designers and programmers still
complain about the lack of tools that help them to make energy-efficiency
decisions. Some works show that energy-aware design decisions tend to have a
larger impact in the power consumed by applications, than code optimizations.
In this paper we present the HADAS green assistant, which helps developers to
identify the energy-consuming concerns of their applications (i.e., points in
the application that consume more energy, like storing or transferring data),
and also to model, analyse and reason about different architectural solutions
for each of these concerns. This tool models the variability of more or less
green architectural practices and the dependencies between different
energy-consuming concerns using variabilty models. Finally, this tool will
automatically generate the architectural configuration derived from the
selections made by the developer from an energy consumption point of view.

 <dc:title>New Results for Adaptive and Approximate Counting of Inversions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rahul, Saladi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Counting inversions is a classic and important problem in databases. The
number of inversions, $K^*$, in a list $L=(L(1),L(2),\ldots,L(n))$ is defined
as the number of pairs $i &lt; j$ with $L(i) &gt; L(j)$. In this paper, new results
for this problem are presented:
  (1) In the I/O-model, an adaptive algorithm is presented for calculating
$K^{*}$. The algorithm performs $O(\frac{N}{B}+
\frac{N}{B}\log_{M/B}(\frac{K^*}{NB}))$ I/Os. When $K^{*}=O(NM)$, then the
algorithm takes only $O(\frac{N}{B})$ I/Os. This algorithm can be modified to
match the state of the art for the comparison based model and the RAM model.
  (2) In the RAM model, a linear-time algorithm is presented to obtain a tight
estimate of $K^*$; specifically, a value which lies with high probability in
the range $[(1-\frac{\log N}{N^{1/4}})K^*,(1+\frac{\log N}{N^{1/4}})K^*]$. The
state of the art linear-time algorithm works for the special case where $L$ is
a permutation, i.e., each $L(i)$ is a distinct integer in the range $[1,N]$. In
this paper, we handle a general case where each $L(i)$ is a real number.

 <dc:description>  It has been shown that the adjacency eigenspace of a network contains key
information of its underlying structure. However, there has been no study on
spectral analysis of the adjacency matrices of directed signed graphs. In this
paper, we derive theoretical approximations of spectral projections from such
directed signed networks using matrix perturbation theory. We use the derived
theoretical results to study the influences of negative intra cluster and inter
cluster directed edges on node spectral projections. We then develop a spectral
clustering based graph partition algorithm, SC-DSG, and conduct evaluations on
both synthetic and real datasets. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:title>Solving Combinatorial Optimization problems with Quantum inspired
  Evolutionary Algorithm Tuned using a Novel Heuristic Method</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Quantum inspired Evolutionary Algorithms were proposed more than a decade ago
and have been employed for solving a wide range of difficult search and
optimization problems. A number of changes have been proposed to improve
performance of canonical QEA. However, canonical QEA is one of the few
evolutionary algorithms, which uses a search operator with relatively large
number of parameters. It is well known that performance of evolutionary
algorithms is dependent on specific value of parameters for a given problem.
The advantage of having large number of parameters in an operator is that the
search process can be made more powerful even with a single operator without
requiring a combination of other operators for exploration and exploitation.
However, the tuning of operators with large number of parameters is complex and
computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel heuristic method for
tuning parameters of canonical QEA. The tuned QEA outperforms canonical QEA on
a class of discrete combinatorial optimization problems which, validates the
design of the proposed parameter tuning framework. The proposed framework can
be used for tuning other algorithms with both large and small number of tunable
parameters.

 <dc:title>Improving Human-Machine Cooperative Visual Search With Soft Highlighting</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Advances in machine learning have produced systems that attain human-level
performance on certain visual tasks, e.g., object identification. Nonetheless,
other tasks requiring visual expertise are unlikely to be entrusted to machines
for some time, e.g., satellite and medical imagery analysis. We describe a
human-machine cooperative approach to visual search, the aim of which is to
outperform either human or machine acting alone. The traditional route to
augmenting human performance with automatic classifiers is to draw boxes around
regions of an image deemed likely to contain a target. Human experts typically
reject this type of hard highlighting. We propose instead a soft highlighting
technique in which the saliency of regions of the visual field is modulated in
a graded fashion based on classifier confidence level. We report on experiments
with both synthetic and natural images showing that soft highlighting achieves
a performance synergy surpassing that attained by hard highlighting.

 <dc:description>  A well known result states that stability criterion for matchings in
two-sided markets doesn't ensure uniqueness. This opens the door for a moral
question with regard to the optimal stable matching from a social point of
view. Here, a new notion of social optimality is proposed. Its novelty is its
ability to take into account the possibility of agents to leave the matching
after it has already been established. To formalize this real-life scenario,
this work includes a well-defined probability model and a social cost function
that maintain the general guidelines of leaving-agents situations. Finally,
efficient algorithms to optimize this function are developed either under
stability constraint or without it.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a novel marriage of Swarm Robotics and Brain Computer
Interface technology to produce an interface which connects a user to a swarm
of robots. The proposed interface enables the user to control the swarm's size
and motion employing just thoughts and eye movements. The thoughts and eye
movements are recorded as electrical signals from the scalp by an off-the-shelf
Electroencephalogram (EEG) headset. Signal processing techniques are used to
filter out noise and decode the user's eye movements from raw signals, while a
Hidden Markov Model technique is employed to decipher the user's thoughts from
filtered signals. The dynamics of the robots are controlled using a swarm
controller based on potential fields. The shape and motion parameters of the
potential fields are modulated by the human user through the brain-swarm
interface to move the robots. The method is demonstrated experimentally with a
human controlling a swarm of three M3pi robots in a laboratory environment, as
well as controlling a swarm of 128 robots in a computer simulation.

 <dc:description>  This letter studies an emerging wireless communication intervention problem
at the physical layer, where a legitimate spoofer aims to spoof a malicious
link from Alice to Bob, by replacing Alice's transmitted source message with
its target message at Bob side. From an information-theoretic perspective, we
are interested in characterizing the maximum achievable spoofing rate of this
new spoofing channel, which is equivalent to the maximum achievable rate of the
target message at Bob, under the condition that Bob cannot decode the source
message from Alice. We propose a novel combined spoofing approach, where the
spoofer sends its own target message, combined with a processed version of the
source message to cancel the source message at Bob. For both cases when Bob
treats interference as noise (TIN) or applies successive interference
cancelation (SIC), we obtain the maximum achievable spoofing rates by
optimizing the power allocation between the target and source messages at the
spoofer.

 <dc:title>A Very Low Complexity Successive Symbol-by-Symbol Sequence Estimator for
  Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the sequence estimation problem of binary and
quadrature phase shift keying faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling and propose
two novel low-complexity sequence estimation techniques based on concepts of
successive interference cancellation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first approach in the literature to detect FTN signaling on a symbol-by-symbol
basis. In particular, based on the structure of the self-interference inherited
in FTN signaling, we first find the operating region boundary---defined by the
root-raised cosine (rRC) pulse shape, its roll-off factor, and the time
acceleration parameter of the FTN signaling---where perfect estimation of the
transmit data symbols on a symbol-by-symbol basis is guaranteed, assuming
noise-free transmission. For noisy transmission, we then propose a novel
low-complexity technique that works within the operating region and is capable
of estimating the transmit data symbols on a symbol-by-symbol basis. To reduce
the error propagation of the proposed successive symbol-by-symbol sequence
estimator (SSSSE), we propose a successive symbol-by-symbol with go-back-$K$
sequence estimator (SSSgb$K$SE) that goes back to re-estimate up to $K$
symbols, and subsequently improves the estimation accuracy of the current data
symbol. Simulation results show that the proposed sequence estimation
techniques perform well for low intersymbol interference (ISI) scenarios and
can significantly increase the data rate and spectral efficiency. Additionally,
results reveal that choosing the value of $K$ as low as $2$ or $3$ data symbols
is sufficient to significantly improve the bit-error-rate performance. Results
also show that the performance of the proposed SSSgb$K$SE, with $K = 1$ or $2$,
surpasses the performance of the lowest complexity equalizers reported in the
literature, with reduced computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  Human identification remains to be one of the challenging tasks in computer
vision community due to drastic changes in visual features across different
viewpoints, lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. Most of the literature has
been focused on exploring human re-identification across viewpoints that are
not too drastically different in nature. Cameras usually capture oblique or
side views of humans, leaving room for a lot of geometric and visual reasoning.
Given the recent popularity of egocentric and top-view vision,
re-identification across these two drastically different views can now be
explored. Having an egocentric and a top view video, our goal is to identify
the cameraman in the content of the top-view video, and also re-identify the
people visible in the egocentric video, by matching them to the identities
present in the top-view video. We propose a CRF-based method to address the two
problems. Our experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed
approach over a variety of video recorded from two views.

correlation between the automaton states and right congruence relations, in a
manner similar to the Myhill-Nerode theorem for regular languages. This
correlation is beneficial for learning algorithms, and indeed it was recently
shown that $\omega$-regular languages can be learned from membership and
equivalence queries, using FDFAs as the acceptors.
  In this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for
defining omega-regular languages. Specifically, we look into the complexity of
performing Boolean operations, such as complementation and intersection, on
FDFAs, the complexity of solving decision problems, such as emptiness and
language containment, and the succinctness of FDFAs compared to standard
deterministic and nondeterministic $\omega$-automata.
  We show that FDFAs enjoy the benefits of deterministic automata with respect
to Boolean operations and decision problems. Namely, they can all be performed
in nondeterministic logarithmic space. We provide polynomial translations of
deterministic B\&quot;uchi and co-B\&quot;uchi automata to FDFAs and of FDFAs to
nondeterministic B\&quot;uchi automata (NBAs). We show that translation of an NBA to
an FDFA may involve an exponential blowup. Last, we show that FDFAs are more
succinct than deterministic parity automata (DPAs) in the sense that
translating a DPA to an FDFA can always be done with only a polynomial
increase, yet the other direction involves an inevitable exponential blowup in
the worst case.

 <dc:description>  The structure of a social network is fundamentally related to the interests
of its members. People assort spontaneously based on the topics that are
relevant to them, forming social groups that revolve around different subjects.
Online social media are also favorable ecosystems for the formation of topical
communities centered on matters that are not commonly taken up by the general
public because of the embarrassment, discomfort, or shock they may cause. Those
are communities that depict or discuss what are usually referred to as deviant
behaviors, conducts that are commonly considered inappropriate because they are
somehow violative of society's norms or moral standards that are shared among
the majority of the members of society. Pornography consumption, drug use,
excessive drinking, illegal hunting, eating disorders, or any self-harming or
addictive practice are all examples of deviant behaviors.

 <dc:description>  Flexibility at hardware level is the main driving force behind adaptive
systems whose aim is to realise microarhitecture deconfiguration 'online'. This
feature allows the software/hardware stack to tolerate drastic changes of the
workload in data centres. With emerge of FPGA reconfigurablity this technology
is becoming a mainstream computing paradigm. Adaptivity is usually accompanied
by the high-level tools to facilitate multi-dimensional space exploration. An
essential aspect in this space is memory orchestration where on-chip and
off-chip memory distribution significantly influences the architecture in
coping with the critical spatial and timing constraints, e.g. Place and Route.
This paper proposes a memory smart technique for a particular class of adaptive
systems: Elastic Circuits which enjoy slack elasticity at fine level of
granularity. We explore retiming of a set of popular benchmarks via
investigating the memory distribution within and among accelerators. The area,
performance and power patterns are adopted by our high-level synthesis
framework, with respect to the behaviour of the input descriptions, to improve
the quality of the synthesised elastic circuits.

 <dc:description>  Video object segmentation is challenging due to the factors like rapidly fast
motion, cluttered backgrounds, arbitrary object appearance variation and shape
deformation. Most existing methods only explore appearance information between
two consecutive frames, which do not make full use of the usefully long-term
nonlocal information that is helpful to make the learned appearance stable, and
hence they tend to fail when the targets suffer from large viewpoint changes
and significant non-rigid deformations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective approach to mine the long-term sptatio-temporally nonlocal appearance
information for unsupervised video segmentation. The motivation of our
algorithm comes from the spatio-temporal nonlocality of the region appearance
reoccurrence in a video. Specifically, we first generate a set of superpixels
to represent the foreground and background, and then update the appearance of
each superpixel with its long-term sptatio-temporally nonlocal counterparts
generated by the approximate nearest neighbor search method with the efficient
KD-tree algorithm. Then, with the updated appearances, we formulate a
spatio-temporal graphical model comprised of the superpixel label consistency
potentials. Finally, we generate the segmentation by optimizing the graphical
model via iteratively updating the appearance model and estimating the labels.
Extensive evaluations on the SegTrack and Youtube-Objects datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method, which performs favorably against some
state-of-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, modern electron microscopes deliver images at atomic scale. The
precise atomic structure encodes information about material properties. Thus,
an important ingredient in the image analysis is to locate the centers of the
atoms shown in micrographs as precisely as possible. Here, we consider scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM), which acquires data in a rastering
pattern, pixel by pixel. Due to this rastering combined with the magnification
to atomic scale, movements of the specimen even at the nanometer scale lead to
random image distortions that make precise atom localization difficult. Given a
series of STEM images, we derive a Bayesian method that jointly estimates the
distortion in each image and reconstructs the underlying atomic grid of the
material by fitting the atom bumps with suitable bump functions. The resulting
highly non-convex minimization problems are solved numerically with a trust
region approach. Well-posedness of the reconstruction method and the model
behavior for faster and faster rastering are investigated using variational
techniques. The performance of the method is finally evaluated on both
synthetic and real experimental data.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we describe a system that detects paraphrases in Indian
Languages as part of our participation in the shared Task on detecting
paraphrases in Indian Languages (DPIL) organized by Forum for Information
Retrieval Evaluation (FIRE) in 2016. Our paraphrase detection method uses a
multinomial logistic regression model trained with a variety of features which
are basically lexical and semantic level similarities between two sentences in
a pair. The performance of the system has been evaluated against the test set
released for the FIRE 2016 shared task on DPIL. Our system achieves the highest
f-measure of 0.95 on task1 in Punjabi language.The performance of our system on
task1 in Hindi language is f-measure of 0.90. Out of 11 teams participated in
the shared task, only four teams participated in all four languages, Hindi,
Punjabi, Malayalam and Tamil, but the remaining 7 teams participated in one of
the four languages. We also participated in task1 and task2 both for all four
Indian Languages. The overall average performance of our system including task1
and task2 overall four languages is F1-score of 0.81 which is the second
highest score among the four systems that participated in all four languages.

 <dc:description>  We consider a continuous-time bandlimited additive white Gaussian noise
channel with 1-bit output quantization. On such a channel the information is
carried by the temporal distances of the zero-crossings of the transmit signal.
The set of input signals is constrained by the bandwidth of the channel and an
average power constraint. We derive a lower bound on the capacity by
lower-bounding the mutual information rate for a given set of waveforms with
exponentially distributed zero-crossing distances, where we focus on the
behavior in the mid to high signal-to-noise ratio regime. We find that in case
the input randomness scales appropriately with the available bandwidth, the
mutual information rate grows linearly with the channel bandwidth for constant
signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, for a given bandwidth the lower bound
saturates with the signal-to-noise ratio growing to infinity. The ratio between
the lower bound on the mutual information rate and the capacity of the additive
white Gaussian noise channel without quantization is a constant independent of
the channel bandwidth for an appropriately chosen randomness of the channel
input and a given signal-to-noise ratio. We complement those findings with an
upper bound on the mutual information rate for the specific signaling scheme.
We show that both bounds are close in the mid to high SNR domain.

us for completing the tasks given under the shared task on Consumer Health
Information Search (CHIS) collocated with the Forum for Information Retrieval
Evaluation (FIRE) 2016, ISI Kolkata. The shared task consists of two sub-tasks
- (1) task1: given a query and a document/set of documents associated with that
query, the task is to classify the sentences in the document as relevant to the
query or not and (2) task 2: the relevant sentences need to be further
classified as supporting the claim made in the query, or opposing the claim
made in the query. We have participated in both the sub-tasks. The percentage
accuracy obtained by our developed system for task1 was 73.39 which is third
highest among the 9 teams participated in the shared task.

 <dc:description>  We study probabilistic models of natural images and extend the autoregressive
family of PixelCNN architectures by incorporating auxiliary variables.
Subsequently, we describe two new generative image models that exploit
different image transformations as auxiliary variables: a quantized grayscale
view of the image or a multi-resolution image pyramid. The proposed models
tackle two known shortcomings of existing PixelCNN models: 1) their tendency to
focus on low-level image details, while largely ignoring high-level image
information, such as object shapes, and 2) their computationally costly
procedure for image sampling. We experimentally demonstrate benefits of the
proposed models, in particular showing that they produce much more
realistically looking image samples than previous state-of-the-art
probabilistic models.

 <dc:title>An Improved Homomorphism Preservation Theorem From Lower Bounds in
  Circuit Complexity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rossman, Benjamin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Previous work of the author [39] showed that the Homomorphism Preservation
Theorem of classical model theory remains valid when its statement is
restricted to finite structures. In this paper, we give a new proof of this
result via a reduction to lower bounds in circuit complexity, specifically on
the AC$^0$ formula size of the colored subgraph isomorphism problem. Formally,
we show the following: if a first-order sentence $\Phi$ of quantifier-rank $k$
is preserved under homomorphisms on finite structures, then it is equivalent on
finite structures to an existential-positive sentence $\Psi$ of quantifier-rank
$k^{O(1)}$. Quantitatively, this improves the result of [39], where the upper
bound on the quantifier-rank of $\Psi$ is a non-elementary function of $k$.

 <dc:description>  We prove that whenever $G$ is a graph from a nowhere dense graph class
$\mathcal{C}$, and $A$ is a subset of vertices of $G$, then the number of
subsets of $A$ that are realized as intersections of $A$ with $r$-neighborhoods
of vertices of $G$ is at most $f(r,\epsilon)\cdot |A|^{1+\epsilon}$, where $r$
is any positive integer, $\epsilon$ is any positive real, and $f$ is a function
that depends only on the class $\mathcal{C}$. This yields a characterization of
nowhere dense classes of graphs in terms of neighborhood complexity, which
answers a question posed by Reidl et al. As an algorithmic application of the
above result, we show that for every fixed $r$, the parameterized Distance-$r$
Dominating Set problem admits an almost linear kernel on any nowhere dense
graph class. This proves a conjecture posed by Drange et al., and shows that
the limit of parameterized tractability of Distance-$r$ Dominating Set on
subgraph-closed graph classes lies exactly on the boundary between nowhere
denseness and somewhere denseness.

 <dc:title>A Simple Semantics for Haskell Overloading</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>D.3.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.3.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As originally proposed, type classes provide overloading and ad-hoc
definition, but can still be understood (and implemented) in terms of strictly
parametric calculi. This is not true of subsequent extensions of type classes.
Functional dependencies and equality constraints allow the satisfiability of
predicates to refine typing; this means that the interpretations of equivalent
qualified types may not be interconvertible. Overlapping instances and instance
chains allow predicates to be satisfied without determining the implementations
of their associated class methods, introducing truly non-parametric behavior.
We propose a new approach to the semantics of type classes, interpreting
polymorphic expressions by the behavior of each of their ground instances, but
without requiring that those behaviors be parametrically determined. We argue
that this approach both matches the intuitive meanings of qualified types and
accurately models the behavior of programs

 <dc:description>  In numerous physical models on networks, dynamics are based on interactions
that exclusively involve properties of a node's nearest neighbors. However, a
node's local view of its neighbors may systematically bias perceptions of
network connectivity or the prevalence of certain traits. We investigate the
strong friendship paradox, which occurs when the majority of a node's neighbors
have more neighbors than does the node itself. We develop a model to predict
the magnitude of the paradox, showing that it is enhanced by negative
correlations between degrees of neighboring nodes. We then show that by
including neighbor-neighbor correlations, which are degree correlations one
step beyond those of neighboring nodes, we accurately predict the impact of the
strong friendship paradox in real-world networks. Understanding how the paradox
biases local observations can inform better measurements of network structure
and our understanding of collective phenomena.

 <dc:title>Can Modular Finger Control for In-Hand Object Stabilization be
  accomplished by Independent Tactile Feedback Control Laws?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Currently grip control during in-hand manipulation is usually modeled as part
of a monolithic task, yielding complex controllers based on force control
specialized for their situations. Such non-modular and specialized control
approaches render the generalization of these controllers to new in-hand
manipulation tasks difficult. Clearly, a grip control approach that generalizes
well between several tasks would be preferable. We propose a modular approach
where each finger is controlled by an independent tactile grip controller.
Using signals from the human-inspired biotac sensor, we can predict future slip
- and prevent it by appropriate motor actions. This slip-preventing grip
controller is first developed and trained during a single-finger stabilization
task. Subsequently, we show that several independent slip-preventing grip
controllers can be employed together without any form of central communication.
The resulting approach works for two, three, four and five finger grip
stabilization control. Such a modular grip control approach has the potential
to generalize across a large variety of inhand manipulation tasks, including
grip change, finger gaiting, between-hands object transfer, and across multiple
objects.

 <dc:title>Variations on Variants</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Morris, J. Garrett</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.3.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Extensible variants improve the modularity and expressiveness of programming
languages: they allow program functionality to be decomposed into independent
blocks, and allow seamless extension of existing code with both new cases of
existing data types and new operations over those data types.
  This paper considers three approaches to providing extensible variants in
Haskell. Row typing is a long understood mechanism for typing extensible
records and variants, but its adoption would require extension of Haskell's
core type system. Alternatively, we might hope to encode extensible variants in
terms of existing mechanisms, such as type classes. We describe an encoding of
extensible variants using instance chains, a proposed extension of the class
system. Unlike many previous encodings of extensible variants, ours does not
require the definition of a new type class for each function that consumes
variants. Finally, we translate our encoding to use closed type families, an
existing feature of GHC. Doing so demonstrates the interpretation of instances
chains and functional dependencies in closed type families.
  One concern with encodings like ours is how completely they match the encoded
system. We compare the expressiveness of our encodings with each other and with
systems based on row types. We find that, while equivalent terms are typable in
each system, both encodings require explicit type annotations to resolve
ambiguities in typing not present in row type systems, and the type family
implementation retains more constraints in principal types than does the
instance chain implementation. We propose a general mechanism to guide the
instantiation of ambiguous type variables, show that it eliminates the need for
type annotations in our encodings, and discuss conditions under which it
preserves coherence.

 <dc:description>  Automatic profiling of social media users is an important task for supporting
a multitude of downstream applications. While a number of studies have used
social media content to extract and study collective social attributes, there
is a lack of substantial research that addresses the detection of a user's
industry. We frame this task as classification using both feature engineering
and ensemble learning. Our industry-detection system uses both posted content
and profile information to detect a user's industry with 64.3% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the majority baseline in a taxonomy of fourteen
industry classes. Our qualitative analysis suggests that a person's industry
not only affects the words used and their perceived meanings, but also the
number and type of emotions being expressed.

 <dc:title>Ideology Detection for Twitter Users with Heterogeneous Types of Links</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of ideology detection is to study the latent (political)
placement for people, which is traditionally studied on politicians according
to their voting behaviors. Recently, more and more studies begin to address the
ideology detection problem for ordinary users based on their online behaviors
that can be captured by social media, e.g., Twitter. As far as we are
concerned, however, the vast majority of the existing methods on ideology
detection on social media have oversimplified the problem as a binary
classification problem (i.e., liberal vs. conservative). Moreover, though
social links can play a critical role in deciding one's ideology, most of the
existing work ignores the heterogeneous types of links in social media. In this
paper we propose to detect \emph{numerical} ideology positions for Twitter
users, according to their \emph{follow}, \emph{mention}, and \emph{retweet}
links to a selected set of politicians. A unified probabilistic model is
proposed that can (1) explain the reasons why links are built among people in
terms of their ideology, (2) integrate heterogeneous types of links together in
determining people's ideology, and (3) automatically learn the quality of each
type of links in deciding one's ideology. Experiments have demonstrated the
advantages of our model in terms of both ranking and political leaning
classification accuracy. It is shown that (1) using multiple types of links is
better than using any single type of links alone to determine one's ideology,
and (2) our model is even more superior than baselines when dealing with people
that are sparsely linked in one type of links. We also show that the detected
ideology for Twitter users aligns with our intuition quite well.

 <dc:description>  While neural networks have been successfully applied to many natural language
processing tasks, they come at the cost of interpretability. In this paper, we
propose a general methodology to analyze and interpret decisions from a neural
model by observing the effects on the model of erasing various parts of the
representation, such as input word-vector dimensions, intermediate hidden
units, or input words. We present several approaches to analyzing the effects
of such erasure, from computing the relative difference in evaluation metrics,
to using reinforcement learning to erase the minimum set of input words in
order to flip a neural model's decision. In a comprehensive analysis of
multiple NLP tasks, including linguistic feature classification, sentence-level
sentiment analysis, and document level sentiment aspect prediction, we show
that the proposed methodology not only offers clear explanations about neural
model decisions, but also provides a way to conduct error analysis on neural
models.

 <dc:description>  Touch sensing, as a major human/machine interface, is widely used in various
commercial products such as smart watches, mobile phones, tablets and TVs.
State-of-the-art touch detections are mainly based on mutual capacitive
sensing, which requires necessary contact-touch, limiting the mobile user
experience. Recently, remote gesture sensing is widely reported in both academy
and industry as it can provide additional user-experience for mobile interface.
The capacitive remote gesture sensing is mainly based on detecting
self-capacitance, achieving high resolution through eliminating the parasitic
mutual capacitance. In this work, we overview the different generations of
touchscreen technology, comparing the touch and remote gesture sensing
technologies difference. In addition, different remote gesture sensing
technologies are also compared. The limitations and potentials of different
topologies are discussed and a final conclusion about the technology trends is
summarized in the end.

 <dc:description>  A scientist may publish tens or hundreds of papers over a career, but these
contributions are not evenly spaced in time. Sixty years of studies on career
productivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal
pattern: productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually
declines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by
analyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series,
constructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for
2453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 Ph.D-granting computer science departments
in the U.S. and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some
faculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we
combine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career
transitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional
narrative confidently describes only one fifth of faculty, regardless of
department prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four fifths of
faculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this
diversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories, and
explore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing
that departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the
timing of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results
demonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time, and open the door
for new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape
scientific productivity.

 <dc:description>  Given an abstract simplicial complex G, the connection graph G' of G has as
vertex set the faces of the complex and connects two if they intersect. If A is
the adjacency matrix of that connection graph, we prove that the Fredholm
characteristic det(1+A) takes values in {-1,1} and is equal to the Fermi
characteristic, which is the product of the w(x), where w(x)=(-1)^dim(x). The
Fredholm characteristic is a special value of the Bowen-Lanford zeta function
and has various combinatorial interpretations. The unimodularity theorem proven
here shows that it is a cousin of the Euler characteristic as the later is the
sum of the w(x). Unimodularity implies that the matrix 1+A has an inverse which
takes integer values. Experiments suggest the conjecture that the range of the
Green function values, the union of the entries of the inverse of 1+A form a
combinatorial invariant of the simplicial complex and do not change under
Barycentric or edge refinements.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have been widely adopted for automatic organ
segmentation from abdominal CT scans. However, the segmentation accuracy of
some small organs (e.g., the pancreas) is sometimes below satisfaction,
arguably because deep networks are easily disrupted by the complex and variable
background regions which occupies a large fraction of the input volume. In this
paper, we formulate this problem into a fixed-point model which uses a
predicted segmentation mask to shrink the input region. This is motivated by
the fact that a smaller input region often leads to more accurate segmentation.
In the training process, we use the ground-truth annotation to generate
accurate input regions and optimize network weights. On the testing stage, we
fix the network parameters and update the segmentation results in an iterative
manner. We evaluate our approach on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset, and
outperform the state-of-the-art by more than 4%, measured by the average
Dice-S{\o}rensen Coefficient (DSC). In addition, we report 62.43% DSC in the
worst case, which guarantees the reliability of our approach in clinical
applications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is an important index for wireless
communications. In CDMA systems, spreading sequences are utilized. This series
of papers show the method to derive spreading sequences as the solutions of the
non-linear programming: maximize SNR. In this paper, we consider a
frequency-selective wide-sense-stationary uncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS)
channel and evaluate the worst case of SNR. Then, we derive the new expression
of SNR whose main term consists of the periodic correlation terms and the
aperiodic correlation terms. In general, there is a relation between SNR and
mean-square correlations, which are indices for performance of spreading
sequences. Then, we show the relation between our expression and them. With
this expression, we can maximize SNR with the Lagrange multiplier method. In
Part II, with this expression, we construct two types optimization problems and
evaluate them.

 <dc:description>  A mixed dominating set for a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a set $S\subseteq V \cup E$
such that every element $x \in (V \cup E) \backslash S$ is either adjacent or
incident to an element of $S$. The mixed domination number of a graph $G$,
denoted by $\gamma_m(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of mixed dominating sets
of $G$ and any mixed dominating set with cardinality of $\gamma_m(G)$ is called
a minimum mixed dominating set. The mixed domination problem is to find a
minimum mixed dominating set for graph $G$ and is known to be an NP-complete
problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the mixed
domination problem. Our new technique of assigning power to edges and vertices,
and charging vertices for edges combined with with dynamic programming leads to
a fixed-parameter algorithm of time $O(3^{tw^{2}}\times tw^2 \times |V|)$,
which proves our next result, which is the mixed domination problem is
fixed-parameter tractable with respect to tree-width.

 <dc:title>Neutron induced strike: On the likelihood of multiple bit-flips in logic
  circuits</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  High energy particles from cosmic rays or packaging materials can generate a
glitch or a current transient (single event transient or SET) in a logic
circuit. This SET can eventually get captured in a register resulting in a flip
of the register content, which is known as soft error or single-event upset
(SEU). A soft error is typically modeled as a probabilistic single bit-flip
model. In developing such abstract fault models, an important issue to consider
is the likelihood of multiple bit errors caused by particle strikes. The fact
that an SET causes multiple flips is noted in the literature. We perform a
characterization study of the impact of an SET on a logic circuit to quantify
the extent to which an SET can cause multiple bit flips. We use post-layout
circuit simulations and Monte Carlo sampling scheme to get accurate bit-flip
statistics. We perform our simulations on ISCAS'85, ISCAS'89 and ITC'99
benchmarks in 180nm and 65nm technologies. We find that a substantial fraction
of SEU outcomes had multiple register flips. We futher analyse the individual
contributions of the strike on a register and the strike on a logic gate, to
multiple flips. We find that, amongst the erroneous outcomes, the probability
of multiple bit-flips for 'gate-strike' cases was substantial and went up to
50%, where as those for 'register-strike' cases was just about 2%. This implies
that, in principle, we can eliminate the flips due to register strikes using
hardened flip-flop designs. However, in such designs, out of the remaining
flips which will be due to gate strikes, a large fraction is likely to be
multiple flips.

 <dc:title>YOLO9000: Better, Faster, Stronger</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Redmon, Joseph</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Farhadi, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system
that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various
improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior
work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection
tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At
40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like
Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster.
Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and
classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO
detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training
allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have
labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection
task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite
only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in
COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes;
it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it
still runs in real-time.

 <dc:description>  Within this paper, the problem of 3D structural inspection path planning for
distributed infrastructure using aerial robots that are subject to time
constraints is addressed. The proposed algorithm handles varying spatial
properties of the infrastructure facilities, accounts for their different
importance and exploration function and computes an overall inspection path of
high inspection reward while respecting the robot endurance or mission time
constraints as well as the vehicle dynamics and sensor limitations. To achieve
its goal, it employs an iterative, 3-step optimization strategy at each
iteration of which it first randomly samples a set of possible structures to
visit, subsequently solves the derived traveling salesman problem and computes
the travel costs, while finally it samples and assigns inspection times to each
structure and evaluates the total inspection reward. For the derivation of the
inspection paths per each independent facility, it interfaces a path planner
dedicated to the 3D coverage of single structures. The resulting algorithm
properties, computational performance and path quality are evaluated using
simulation studies as well as experimental test-cases employing a multirotor
micro aerial vehicle.

 <dc:title>Fredkin and Toffoli gates implemented in Oregonator model of
  Belousov-Zhabotinsky medium</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Adamatzky, Andrew</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A thin-layer Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) medium is a powerful computing device
capable for implementing logical circuits, memory, image processors, robot
controllers, and neuromorphic architectures. We design the reversible logical
gates --- Fredkin gate and Toffoli gate --- in a BZ medium network of excitable
channels with sub-excitable junctions. Local control of the BZ medium
excitability is an important feature of the gates' design. A excitable
thin-layer BZ medium responds to a localised perturbation with omnidirectional
target or spiral excitation waves. A sub-excitable BZ medium responds to an
asymmetric perturbation by producing travelling localised excitation
wave-fragments similar to dissipative solitons. We employ interactions between
excitation wave-fragments to perform computation. We interpret the
wave-fragments as values of Boolean variables. A presence of a wave-fragment at
a given site of a circuit represents logical truth, absence of the
wave-fragment --- logical false. Fredkin gate consists of ten excitable
channels intersecting at eleven junctions eight of which are sub-excitable.
Toffoli gate consists of six excitable channels intersecting at six junctions
four of which are sub-excitable. The designs of the gates are verified using
numerical integration of two-variable Oregonator equations.

 <dc:description>  Quality of Experience (QoE) provisioning in heterogeneous access networks
(HANs) can be achieved via handoffs. The current approaches for QoE-aware
handoffs either lack the availability of a network path probing method or lack
the availability of efficient methods for QoE prediction. Further, the current
approaches do not explore the benefits of proactive QoE-aware handoffs such
that user's QoE is maximized by learning from past network conditions and by
actions taken by the mobile device regarding handoffs. In this paper, our
contributions are two-fold. First, we propose, develop and validate a novel
method for QoE prediction based on passive probing. Our method is based on
hidden Markov models and Multi-homed Mobility Management Protocol which
eliminates the need for additional probe packets for QoE prediction. It
achieves the average QoE prediction accuracy of 97%. Second, we propose,
develop and validate a novel reinforcement learning based method for proactive
QoE-aware handoffs. We show that our method outperforms existing approaches by
reducing the number of vertical handoffs by 60.65% while maintaining high QoE
levels and by extending crucial functionality such as passive probing
mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  The $k$-th symmetric product of a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ with edge set
$E$ is a graph with vertices as $k$-sets of $V$, where two $k$-sets are
connected by an edge if and only if their symmetric difference is an edge in
$E$. Using the isoperimetric properties of the vertex-induced subgraphs of $G$
and Sobolev inequalities on graphs, we obtain various edge-isoperimetric
inequalities pertaining to the symmetric product of certain families of finite
and infinite graphs.

 <dc:description>  The deluge of networked data motivates the development of algorithms for
computation- and communication-efficient information processing. In this
context, three data-adaptive censoring strategies are introduced to
considerably reduce the computation and communication overhead of decentralized
recursive least-squares (D-RLS) solvers. The first relies on alternating
minimization and the stochastic Newton iteration to minimize a network-wide
cost, which discards observations with small innovations. In the resultant
algorithm, each node performs local data-adaptive censoring to reduce
computations, while exchanging its local estimate with neighbors so as to
consent on a network-wide solution. The communication cost is further reduced
by the second strategy, which prevents a node from transmitting its local
estimate to neighbors when the innovation it induces to incoming data is
minimal. In the third strategy, not only transmitting, but also receiving
estimates from neighbors is prohibited when data-adaptive censoring is in
effect. For all strategies, a simple criterion is provided for selecting the
threshold of innovation to reach a prescribed average data reduction. The novel
censoring-based (C)D-RLS algorithms are proved convergent to the optimal
argument in the mean-square deviation sense. Numerical experiments validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in reducing computation and
communication overhead.

 <dc:description>  Tracking is one of the most important but still difficult tasks in computer
vision and pattern recognition. The main difficulties in the tracking field are
appearance variation and occlusion. Most traditional tracking methods set the
parameters or templates to track target objects in advance and should be
modified accordingly. Thus, we propose a new and robust tracking method using a
Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to obtain an object probability map and
Dynamic Programming (DP) to seek the globally optimal path through all frames
of video. Our proposed method solves the object appearance variation problem
with the use of a FCN and deals with occlusion by DP. We show that our method
is effective in tracking various single objects through video frames.

 <dc:description>  In deep tissue photoacoustic imaging the spatial resolution is inherently
limited by the acoustic wavelength. Recently, it was demonstrated that it is
possible to surpass the acoustic diffraction limit by analyzing fluctuations in
a set of photoacoustic images obtained under unknown speckle illumination
patterns. Here, we purpose an approach to boost reconstruction fidelity and
resolution, while reducing the number of acquired images by utilizing a
compressed sensing computational reconstruction framework. The approach takes
into account prior knowledge of the system response and sparsity of the target
structure. We provide proof of principle experiments of the approach and
demonstrate that improved performance is obtained when both speckle
fluctuations and object priors are used. We numerically study the expected
performance as a function of the measurements signal to noise ratio and sample
spatial-sparsity. The presented reconstruction framework can be applied to
analyze existing photoacoustic experimental datasets containing dynamic
fluctuations.

 <dc:description>  Let $G$ be a simple undirected graph.A broadcast on $G$ isa function $f :
V(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(v)\le e\_G(v)$ holds for every vertex
$v$ of $G$, where $e\_G(v)$ denotes the eccentricity of $v$ in $G$, that is,
the maximum distance from $v$ to any other vertex of $G$.The cost of $f$ is the
value ${\rm cost}(f)=\sum\_{v\in V(G)}f(v)$.A broadcast $f$ on $G$ is
independent if for every two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$,
$d\_G(u,v)&gt;\max\{f(u),f(v)\}$,where $d\_G(u,v)$ denotes the distance between
$u$ and $v$ in $G$.The broadcast independence number of $G$ is then defined as
the maximum cost of an independent broadcast on $G$. In this paper, we study
independent broadcasts of caterpillars and give an explicit formula for the
broadcast independence number of caterpillars having no pair of adjacent
vertices with degree 2.

 <dc:description>  The coverage probability and average data rate of normalized SNR-based
scheduling in a downlink cellular network are derived by modeling the locations
of the base stations and users as two independent Poison point processes. The
scheduler selects the user with the largest instantaneous SNR normalized by the
short-term average SNR. In normalized SNR scheduling, the coverage probability
when the desired signal experiences Rayleigh fading is shown to be given by a
series of Laplace transforms of the probability density function of
interference. Also, a closed-form expression for the coverage probability is
approximately achieved. The results confirm that normalized SNR scheduling
increases the coverage probability due to the multi-user diversity gain.

 <dc:title>Throughput Maximization in Multi-Channel Cognitive Radio Systems with

 <dc:description>  We study the throughput-vs-delay trade-off in an overlay multi-channel
single-secondary-user cognitive radio system. Due to the limited sensing
capabilities of the cognitive radio user, channels are sensed sequentially.
Maximizing the throughput in such a problem is well-studied in the literature.
Yet, in real-time applications, hard delay constraints need to be considered
besides throughput. In this paper, optimal stopping rule and optimal power
allocation are discussed to maximize the secondary user's throughput, subject
to an average delay constraint. We provide a low complexity approach to the
optimal solution of this problem. Simulation results show that this solution
allows the secondary user to meet the delay constraint without sacrificing
throughput significantly. It also shows the benefits of the optimal power
allocation strategy over the constant power allocation strategy.

 <dc:title>Power Control and Scheduling under Hard Deadline Constraints for On-Off
  Fading Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ewaisha, Ahmed</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tepedelenlioglu, Cihan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the joint scheduling-and-power-allocation problem of a downlink
cellular system. The system consists of two groups of users: real-time (RT) and
non-real-time (NRT) users. Given some average power constraint on the base
station, the problem is to find an algorithm that satisfies the RT and NRT
quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. The RT QoS constraints guarantee the
portion of RT packets that miss their deadline are no more than a pre-specified
threshold. On the other hand, the NRT QoS is only to guarantee the stability of
their queues. We propose a sum-rate-maximizing algorithm that satisfy all QoS
and average power constraints. The proposed power allocation policy has a
closed-form expression for the two groups of users. However, the power policy
of the RT users differ in structure from the NRT users. The proposed algorithm
is optimal for the on-off channel model with a polynomial-time scheduling
complexity. Using extensive simulations, the throughput of the proposed
algorithm is shown exceed existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate secure transmission over the large-scale
multiple-antenna wiretap channel with finite alphabet inputs. First, we show
analytically that a generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) based
design, which is optimal for Gaussian inputs, may exhibit a severe performance
loss for finite alphabet inputs in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.
In light of this, we propose a novel Per-Group-GSVD (PG-GSVD) design which can
effectively compensate the performance loss caused by the GSVD design. More
importantly, the computational complexity of the PG-GSVD design is by orders of
magnitude lower than that of the existing design for finite alphabet inputs in
[1] while the resulting performance loss is minimal. Numerical results indicate
that the proposed PG-GSVD design can be efficiently implemented in large-scale
multiple-antenna systems and achieves significant performance gains compared to
the GSVD design.

 <dc:title>Text Summarization using Deep Learning and Ridge Regression</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We develop models and extract relevant features for automatic text
summarization and investigate the performance of different models on the DUC
2001 dataset. Two different models were developed, one being a ridge regressor
and the other one was a multi-layer perceptron. The hyperparameters were varied
and their performance were noted. We segregated the summarization task into 2
main steps, the first being sentence ranking and the second step being sentence
selection. In the first step, given a document, we sort the sentences based on
their Importance, and in the second step, in order to obtain non-redundant
sentences, we weed out the sentences that are have high similarity with the
previously selected sentences.

 <dc:title>Bit Partitioning Schemes for Multicell Zero-Forcing Coordinated

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we have studied the bit partitioning schemes for the multicell
multiple-input and single-output (MISO) infrastructure. Zero forcing
beamforming is used to null out the interference signals and the random vector
quantization, quantizes the channel vectors. For minimal feedback period (MFP),
the upper bound of rate loss is calculated and optimal bit partitioning among
the channels is shown. For adaptive feedback period scheme (AFP), joint
optimization schemes of feedback period and bit partitioning are proposed.
Finally, we compare the sum rate efficiency of each scheme and conclude that
minimal feedback period outperforms other schemes.

 <dc:description>  The recent rise of interest in Virtual Reality (VR) came with the
availability of commodity commercial VR prod- ucts, such as the Head Mounted
Displays (HMD) created by Oculus and other vendors. To accelerate the user
adoption of VR headsets, content providers should focus on producing high
quality immersive content for these devices. Similarly, multimedia streaming
service providers should enable the means to stream 360 VR content on their
platforms. In this study, we try to cover different aspects related to VR
content representation, streaming, and quality assessment that will help
establishing the basic knowledge of how to build a VR streaming system.

 <dc:description>  In studies of social dynamics, cohesion refers to a group's tendency to stay
in unity, which -- as argued in sociometry -- arises from the network topology
of interpersonal ties between members of the group. We follow this idea and
propose a game-based model of cohesion that not only relies on the social
network, but also reflects individuals' social needs. In particular, our model
is a type of cooperative games where players may gain popularity by
strategically forming groups. A group is socially cohesive if the grand
coalition is core stable. We study social cohesion in some special types of
graphs and draw a link between social cohesion and the classical notion of
structural cohesion. We then focus on the problem of deciding whether a given
social network is socially cohesive and show that this problem is
CoNP-complete. Nevertheless, we give two efficient heuristics for coalition
structures where players enjoy high popularity and experimentally evaluate
their performances.

 <dc:description>  We present a distributed algorithm for joint power control, routing and
scheduling in multihop wireless networks. The algorithm also provides for
Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees, namely, end-to-end mean delay guarantees
and hard deadline guarantees, for different users. It is easily implementable
and works by giving local dynamic priority to flows requiring QoS, the priority
being a function of the queue length at the nodes. We provide theoretical
bounds for the stability properties of the algorithm. We also compare the
performance of the algorithm with other existing algorithms by means of
extensive simulations, and demonstrate its efficacy in providing QoS on demand.

 <dc:description>  We present novel method for image-text multi-modal representation learning.
In our knowledge, this work is the first approach of applying adversarial
learning concept to multi-modal learning and not exploiting image-text pair
information to learn multi-modal feature. We only use category information in
contrast with most previous methods using image-text pair information for
multi-modal embedding. In this paper, we show that multi-modal feature can be
achieved without image-text pair information and our method makes more similar
distribution with image and text in multi-modal feature space than other
methods which use image-text pair information. And we show our multi-modal
feature has universal semantic information, even though it was trained for
category prediction. Our model is end-to-end backpropagation, intuitive and
easily extended to other multi-modal learning work.

 <dc:description>  Through pixel-wise optical coding of images during exposure time, it is
possible to extract sub-exposure images from a single capture. Such a
capability can be used for different purposes, including high-speed imaging,
high-dynamic-range imaging and compressed sensing. In this paper, we
demonstrate a sub-exposure image extraction method, where the exposure coding
pattern is inspired from frequency division multiplexing idea of communication
systems. The coding masks modulate sub-exposure images in such a way that they
are placed in non-overlapping regions in Fourier domain. The sub-exposure image
extraction process involves digital filtering of the captured signal with
proper band-pass filters. The prototype imaging system incorporates a Liquid
Crystal over Silicon (LCoS) based spatial light modulator synchronized with a
camera for pixel-wise exposure coding.

 <dc:description>  Headline generation for spoken content is important since spoken content is
difficult to be shown on the screen and browsed by the user. It is a special
type of abstractive summarization, for which the summaries are generated word
by word from scratch without using any part of the original content. Many deep
learning approaches for headline generation from text document have been
proposed recently, all requiring huge quantities of training data, which is
difficult for spoken document summarization. In this paper, we propose an ASR
error modeling approach to learn the underlying structure of ASR error patterns
and incorporate this model in an Attentive Recurrent Neural Network (ARNN)
architecture. In this way, the model for abstractive headline generation for
spoken content can be learned from abundant text data and the ASR data for some
recognizers. Experiments showed very encouraging results and verified that the
proposed ASR error model works well even when the input spoken content is
recognized by a recognizer very different from the one the model learned from.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world systems can be studied in terms of pattern recognition tasks,
so that proper use (and understanding) of machine learning methods in practical
applications becomes essential. While a myriad of classification methods have
been proposed, there is no consensus on which methods are more suitable for a
given dataset. As a consequence, it is important to comprehensively compare
methods in many possible scenarios. In this context, we performed a systematic
comparison of 7 well-known clustering methods available in the R language. In
order to account for the many possible variations of data, we considered
artificial datasets with several tunable properties (number of classes,
separation between classes, etc). In addition, we also evaluated the
sensitivity of the clustering methods with regard to their parameters
configuration. The results revealed that, when considering the default
configurations of the adopted methods, the spectral approach usually
outperformed the other clustering algorithms. We also found that the default
configuration of the adopted implementations was not accurate. In these cases,
a simple approach based on random selection of parameters values proved to be a
good alternative to improve the performance. All in all, the reported approach
provides subsidies guiding the choice of clustering algorithms.

to the problem of automatic tag generation. The predicted tags together with
their corresponding acoustic representation are exploited for the construction
of acoustic-semantic clip embeddings. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on
the task of similarity measurement between music clips. Acoustic-semantic
models are shown to outperform the state-of-the-art for this task and produce

 <dc:description>  Multivariate Pattern (MVP) classification holds enormous potential for
decoding visual stimuli in the human brain by employing task-based fMRI data
sets. There is a wide range of challenges in the MVP techniques, i.e.
decreasing noise and sparsity, defining effective regions of interest (ROIs),
visualizing results, and the cost of brain studies. In overcoming these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel model of neural representation, which
can automatically detect the active regions for each visual stimulus and then
utilize these anatomical regions for visualizing and analyzing the functional
activities. Therefore, this model provides an opportunity for neuroscientists
to ask this question: what is the effect of a stimulus on each of the detected
regions instead of just study the fluctuation of voxels in the manually
selected ROIs. Moreover, our method introduces analyzing snapshots of brain
image for decreasing sparsity rather than using the whole of fMRI time series.
Further, a new Gaussian smoothing method is proposed for removing noise of
voxels in the level of ROIs. The proposed method enables us to combine
different fMRI data sets for reducing the cost of brain studies. Experimental
studies on 4 visual categories (words, consonants, objects and nonsense photos)
confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  The inference of correlated signal fields with unknown correlation structures
is of high scientific and technological relevance, but poses significant
conceptual and numerical challenges. To address these, we develop the
correlated signal inference (CSI) algorithm within information field theory
(IFT) and discuss its numerical implementation. To this end, we introduce the
free energy exploration (FrEE) strategy for numerical information field theory
(NIFTy) applications. The FrEE strategy is to let the mathematical structure of
the inference problem determine the dynamics of the numerical solver. FrEE uses
the Gibbs free energy formalism for all involved unknown fields and correlation
structures without marginalization of nuisance quantities. It thereby avoids
the complexity marginalization often impose to IFT equations. FrEE
simultaneously solves for the mean and the uncertainties of signal, nuisance,
and auxiliary fields, while exploiting any analytically calculable quantity.
Finally, FrEE uses a problem specific and self-tuning exploration strategy to
swiftly identify the optimal field estimates as well as their uncertainty maps.
For all estimated fields, properly weighted posterior samples drawn from their
exact, fully non-Gaussian distributions can be generated. Here, we develop the
FrEE strategies for the CSI of a normal, a log-normal, and a Poisson log-normal
IFT signal inference problem and demonstrate their performances via their NIFTy
implementations.

 <dc:description>  Depth scans acquired from different views may contain nuisances such as
noise, occlusion, and varying point density. We propose a novel Signature of
Geometric Centroids descriptor, supporting direct shape matching on the scans,
without requiring any preprocessing such as scan denoising or converting into a
mesh. First, we construct the descriptor by voxelizing the local shape within a
uniquely defined local reference frame and concatenating geometric centroid and
point density features extracted from each voxel. Second, we compare two
descriptors by employing only corresponding voxels that are both non-empty,
thus supporting matching incomplete local shape such as those close to scan
boundary. Third, we propose a descriptor saliency measure and compute it from a
descriptor-graph to improve shape matching performance. We demonstrate the
descriptor's robustness and effectiveness for shape matching by comparing it
with three state-of-the-art descriptors, and applying it to object/scene
reconstruction and 3D object recognition.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised Learning for Computational Phenotyping</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With large volumes of health care data comes the research area of
computational phenotyping, making use of techniques such as machine learning to
describe illnesses and other clinical concepts from the data itself. The
&quot;traditional&quot; approach of using supervised learning relies on a domain expert,
and has two main limitations: requiring skilled humans to supply correct labels
limits its scalability and accuracy, and relying on existing clinical
descriptions limits the sorts of patterns that can be found. For instance, it
may fail to acknowledge that a disease treated as a single condition may really
have several subtypes with different phenotypes, as seems to be the case with
asthma and heart disease. Some recent papers cite successes instead using
unsupervised learning. This shows great potential for finding patterns in
Electronic Health Records that would otherwise be hidden and that can lead to
greater understanding of conditions and treatments. This work implements a
method derived strongly from Lasko et al., but implements it in Apache Spark
and Python and generalizes it to laboratory time-series data in MIMIC-III. It
is released as an open-source tool for exploration, analysis, and
visualization, available at https://github.com/Hodapp87/mimic3_phenotyping

 <dc:description>  Today, social media provide the means by which billions of people experience
news and events happening around the world. However, the absence of traditional
journalistic gatekeeping allows information to flow unencumbered through these
platforms, often raising questions of veracity and credibility of the reported
information. Here we ask: How do the dynamics of collective attention directed
toward an event reported on social media vary with its perceived credibility?
By examining the first large-scale, systematically tracked credibility database
of public Twitter messages (47M messages corresponding to 1,138 real-world
events over a span of three months), we established a relationship between the
temporal dynamics of events reported on social media and their associated level
of credibility judgments. Representing collective attention by the aggregate
temporal signatures of an event reportage, we found that the amount of
continued attention focused on an event provides information about its
associated levels of perceived credibility. Events exhibiting sustained,
intermittent bursts of attention were found to be associated with lower levels
of perceived credibility. In other words, as more people showed interest during
moments of transient collective attention, the associated uncertainty
surrounding these events also increased.

 <dc:description>  Network slicing to enable resource sharing among multiple tenants --network
operators and/or services-- is considered a key functionality for next
generation mobile networks. This paper provides an analysis of a well-known
model for resource sharing, the 'share-constrained proportional allocation'
mechanism, to realize network slicing. This mechanism enables tenants to reap
the performance benefits of sharing, while retaining the ability to customize
their own users' allocation. This results in a network slicing game in which
each tenant reacts to the user allocations of the other tenants so as to
maximize its own utility. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the game
associated with such strategic behavior converges to a Nash equilibrium. At the
Nash equilibrium, a tenant always achieves the same, or better, performance
than under a static partitioning of resources, hence providing the same level
of protection as such static partitioning. We further analyze the efficiency
and fairness of the resulting allocations, providing tight bounds for the price
of anarchy and envy-freeness. Our analysis and extensive simulation results
confirm that the mechanism provides a comprehensive practical solution to
realize network slicing. Our theoretical results also fill a gap in the
literature regarding the analysis of this resource allocation model under
strategic players.

 <dc:description>  Networks are a fundamental tool for understanding and modeling complex
systems in physics, biology, neuroscience, engineering, and social science.
Many networks are known to exhibit rich, lower-order connectivity patterns that
can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges. However,
higher-order organization of complex networks---at the level of small network
subgraphs---remains largely unknown. Here we develop a generalized framework
for clustering networks based on higher-order connectivity patterns. This
framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained
clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges. The framework reveals
higher-order organization in a number of networks including information
propagation units in neuronal networks and hub structure in transportation
networks. Results show that networks exhibit rich higher-order organizational
structures that are exposed by clustering based on higher-order connectivity
patterns.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the thermodynamic costs of the three main approaches to generating
random numbers via the recently introduced Information Processing Second Law.
Given access to a specified source of randomness, a random number generator
(RNG) produces samples from a desired target probability distribution. This
differs from pseudorandom number generators (PRNG) that use wholly
deterministic algorithms and from true random number generators (TRNG) in which
the randomness source is a physical system. For each class, we analyze the
thermodynamics of generators based on algorithms implemented as finite-state
machines, as these allow for direct bounds on the required physical resources.
This establishes bounds on heat dissipation and work consumption during the
operation of three main classes of RNG algorithms---including those of von
Neumann, Knuth and Yao, and Roche and Hoshi---and for PRNG methods. We
introduce a general TRNG and determine its thermodynamic costs exactly for
arbitrary target distributions. The results highlight the significant
differences between the three main approaches to random number generation: One
is work producing, one is work consuming, and the other is potentially
dissipation neutral. Notably, TRNGs can both generate random numbers and
convert thermal energy to stored work. These thermodynamic costs on information
creation complement Landauer's limit on the irreducible costs of information
destruction.

 <dc:description>  Owing to their low-complexity iterations, Frank-Wolfe (FW) solvers are well
suited for various large-scale learning tasks. When block-separable constraints
are present, randomized block FW (RB-FW) has been shown to further reduce
complexity by updating only a fraction of coordinate blocks per iteration. To
circumvent the limitations of existing methods, the present work develops step
sizes for RB-FW that enable a flexible selection of the number of blocks to
update per iteration while ensuring convergence and feasibility of the
iterates. To this end, convergence rates of RB-FW are established through
computational bounds on a primal sub-optimality measure and on the duality gap.
The novel bounds extend the existing convergence analysis, which only applies
to a step-size sequence that does not generally lead to feasible iterates.
Furthermore, two classes of step-size sequences that guarantee feasibility of
the iterates are also proposed to enhance flexibility in choosing decay rates.
The novel convergence results are markedly broadened to encompass also
nonconvex objectives, and further assert that RB-FW with exact line-search
reaches a stationary point at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$. Performance of
RB-FW with different step sizes and number of blocks is demonstrated in two
applications, namely charging of electrical vehicles and structural support
vector machines. Extensive simulated tests demonstrate the performance
improvement of RB-FW relative to existing randomized single-block FW methods.

 <dc:description>  By the distributed averaging problem is meant the problem of computing the
average value of a set of numbers possessed by the agents in a distributed
network using only communication between neighboring agents. Gossiping is a
well-known approach to the problem which seeks to iteratively arrive at a
solution by allowing each agent to interchange information with at most one
neighbor at each iterative step. Crafting a gossiping protocol which
accomplishes this is challenging because gossiping is an inherently
collaborative process which can lead to deadlocks unless careful precautions
are taken to ensure that it does not. Many gossiping protocols are
request-based which means simply that a gossip between two agents will occur
whenever one of the two agents accepts a request to gossip placed by the other.
In this paper, we present three deterministic request-based protocols. We show
by example that the first can deadlock. The second is guaranteed to avoid
deadlocks and requires fewer transmissions per iteration than standard
broadcast-based distributed averaging protocols by exploiting the idea of local
ordering together with the notion of an agent's neighbor queue; the protocol
requires the simplest queue updates, which provides an in-depth understanding
of how local ordering and queue updates avoid deadlocks. It is shown that a
third protocol which uses a slightly more complicated queue update rule can
lead to significantly faster convergence; a worst case bound on convergence
rate is provided.

 <dc:description>  Conventionally, interference and noise are treated as catastrophic elements
in wireless communications. However, it has been shown recently that exploiting
known interference constructively can even contribute to signal detection
ability at the receiving end. This paper exploits this concept to design
artificial noise (AN) beamformers constructive to the intended receiver (IR)
yet keeping AN disruptive to possible eavesdroppers (Eves). The scenario
considered here is a multiple-input single-output (MISO) wiretap channel with
multiple eavesdroppers. Both perfect and imperfect channel information have
been considered. The main objective is to improve the receive
signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) at IR through exploitation of AN
power in an attempt to minimize the total transmit power, while confusing the
Eves. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed constructive AN
precoding approach yields superior performance over conventional AN schemes in
terms of transmit power as well as symbol error rate (SER).

bias on nonlinear modulation bandwidth and dynamic range of the VLC system. The
linear dynamic range is enhanced by using series-connected LED chips, and the
modulation bandwidth is extended to 40 MHz by post-equalization without using a
blue filter. The experimental results well match the theoretical model of LED
nonlinear modulation characteristics. The results show that the modulation
bandwidth increases and saturates with an increase in LED DC bias current due
to nonlinear effect of carrier lifetime and junction capacitance. The optimized
DC-bias current that corresponds to the minimum BER increases with the increase
of data rate. A 60-Mbps NRZ transmission can be achieved with BER threshold of
10-3 by properly adjusting LED DC bias point.

 <dc:description>  The paper addresses secure state estimation of cyber-physical systems subject
to switching signal attacks and injection of counterfeit measurements. In
particular, the random set paradigm is adopted in order to model the switching
nature of the signal attack and the fake measurement injection via Bernoulli
and/or Poisson random sets. The problem of jointly detecting a signal attack
and estimating the system state in presence of fake measurements is then
formulated and solved in the Bayesian framework leading to the analytical
derivation of a hybrid Bernoulli filter that updates in real-time the joint
posterior density of the detection attack Bernoulli set and of the state
vector. A closed-form Gaussian-mixture implementation of the proposed hybrid
Bernoulli filter is fully derived. Finally, the effectiveness of the developed
tools for joint attack detection and secure state estimation is tested on two
case-studies concerning a benchmark system with direct feedthrough and a
standard IEEE power network application.

 <dc:description>  We investigate opinion spreading by a threshold model in a situation where
the influence of people is heterogeneously distributed. We focus on the
response of the average opinion as a function between the trend between
out-degree (number of neighbors)---effectively the strength of influence of a
node---and the threshold for adopting a new product or opinion. We find that if
the coupling is very positive, the final state of the system will be a mix of
different opinions otherwise it will it converges to a consensus state. We find
that this cannot be simply explained as a phase transition, but emerges from a
combination of mechanisms and their relative dominance in different regions of
parameter space.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays the CNN is widely used in practical applications for image
classification task. However the design of the CNN model is very professional
work and which is very difficult for ordinary users. Besides, even for experts
of CNN, to select an optimal model for specific task may still need a lot of
time (to train many different models). In order to solve this problem, we
proposed an automated CNN recommendation system for image classification task.
Our system is able to evaluate the complexity of the classification task and
the classification ability of the CNN model precisely. By using the evaluation
results, the system can recommend the optimal CNN model and which can match the
task perfectly. The recommendation process of the system is very fast since we
don't need any model training. The experiment results proved that the
evaluation methods are very accurate and reliable.

 <dc:description>  It has long been recognized that the invariance and equivariance properties
of a representation are critically important for success in many vision tasks.
In this paper we present Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks, an efficient
and flexible class of equivariant convolutional networks. We show that
steerable CNNs achieve state of the art results on the CIFAR image
classification benchmark. The mathematical theory of steerable representations
reveals a type system in which any steerable representation is a composition of
elementary feature types, each one associated with a particular kind of
symmetry. We show how the parameter cost of a steerable filter bank depends on
the types of the input and output features, and show how to use this knowledge
to construct CNNs that utilize parameters effectively.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a deep nonlinear metric learning framework for data
visualization on an image dataset. We propose the Triangular Similarity and
prove its equivalence to the Cosine Similarity in measuring a data pair. Based
on this novel similarity, a geometrically motivated loss function - the
triangular loss - is then developed for optimizing a metric learning system
comprising two identical CNNs. It is shown that this deep nonlinear system can
be efficiently trained by a hybrid algorithm based on the conventional
backpropagation algorithm. More interestingly, benefiting from classical
manifold learning theories, the proposed system offers two different views to
visualize the outputs, the second of which provides better classification
results than the state-of-the-art methods in the visualizable spaces.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we extend some usual techniques of classification resulting
from a large-scale data-mining and network approach. This new technology, which
in particular is designed to be suitable to big data, is used to construct an
open consolidated database from raw data on 4 million patents taken from the US
patent office from 1976 onward. To build the pattern network, not only do we
look at each patent title, but we also examine their full abstract and extract
the relevant keywords accordingly. We refer to this classification as semantic
approach in contrast with the more common technological approach which consists
in taking the topology when considering US Patent office technological classes.
Moreover, we document that both approaches have highly different topological
measures and strong statistical evidence that they feature a different model.
This suggests that our method is a useful tool to extract endogenous
information.

 <dc:title>Generic and lifted probabilistic comparisons -- max replaces minmax</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a collection of powerful statistical comparison
results. We first present the results that we obtained while developing a
general comparison concept. After that we introduce a separate lifting
procedure that is a comparison concept on its own. We then show how in certain
scenarios the lifting procedure basically represents a substantial upgrade over
the general strategy. We complement the introduced results with a fairly large
collection of numerical experiments that are in an overwhelming agreement with
what the theory predicts. We also show how many well known comparison results
(e.g. Slepian's max and Gordon's minmax principle) can be obtained as special
cases. Moreover, it turns out that the minmax principle can be viewed as a
single max principle as well. The range of applications is enormous. It starts
with revisiting many of the results we created in recent years in various
mathematical fields and recognizing that they are fully self-contained as their
starting blocks are specialized variants of the concepts introduced here.
Further upgrades relate to core comparison extensions on the one side and more
practically oriented modifications on the other. Those that we deem the most
important we discuss in several separate companion papers to ensure preserving
the introductory elegance and simplicity of what is presented here.

 <dc:description>  We consider the non-Lambertian object intrinsic problem of recovering diffuse
albedo, shading, and specular highlights from a single image of an object.
  We build a large-scale object intrinsics database based on existing 3D models
in the ShapeNet database. Rendered with realistic environment maps, millions of
synthetic images of objects and their corresponding albedo, shading, and
specular ground-truth images are used to train an encoder-decoder CNN. Once
trained, the network can decompose an image into the product of albedo and
shading components, along with an additive specular component.
  Our CNN delivers accurate and sharp results in this classical inverse problem
of computer vision, sharp details attributed to skip layer connections at
corresponding resolutions from the encoder to the decoder. Benchmarked on our
ShapeNet and MIT intrinsics datasets, our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a large margin.
  We train and test our CNN on different object categories. Perhaps surprising
especially from the CNN classification perspective, our intrinsics CNN
generalizes very well across categories. Our analysis shows that feature
learning at the encoder stage is more crucial for developing a universal
representation across categories.
  We apply our synthetic data trained model to images and videos downloaded
from the internet, and observe robust and realistic intrinsics results. Quality
non-Lambertian intrinsics could open up many interesting applications such as
image-based albedo and specular editing.

 <dc:description>  Controller synthesis techniques for continuous systems with respect to
temporal logic specifications typically use a finite-state symbolic abstraction
of the system model. Constructing this abstraction for the entire system is
computationally expensive, and does not exploit natural decompositions of many
systems into interacting components. We describe a methodology for
compositional symbolic abstraction to help scale controller synthesis for
temporal logic to larger systems.
  We introduce a new relation, called (approximate) disturbance bisimulation,
as the basis for compositional symbolic abstractions. Disturbance bisimulation
strengthens the standard approximate alternating bisimulation relation used in
control. It extends naturally to systems which are composed of weakly
interconnected sub-components possibly connected in feedback, and models the
coupling signals as disturbances. After proving this composability of
disturbance bisimulation for metric systems we apply this result to the
compositional abstraction of networks of input-to-state stable deterministic
non-linear control systems. We give conditions that allow to construct
finite-state abstractions compositionally for each component in such a network,
so that the abstractions are simultaneously disturbance bisimilar to their
continuous counterparts. Combining these two results, we show conditions under
which one can compositionally abstract a network of non-linear control systems
in a modular way while ensuring that the final composed abstraction is
disturbance bisimilar to the original system. We discuss how we get a
compositional abstraction-based controller synthesis methodology for networks
of such systems against local temporal specifications as a by-product of our
construction.

 <dc:description>  In our companion paper \cite{Stojnicgscomp16} we introduce a collection of
fairly powerful statistical comparison results. They relate to a general
comparison concept and its an upgrade that we call lifting procedure. Here we
provide a different generic principle (which we call fully bilinear) that in
certain cases turns out to be stronger than the corresponding one from
\cite{Stojnicgscomp16}. Moreover, we also show how the principle that we
introduce here can also be pushed through the lifting machinery of
\cite{Stojnicgscomp16}. Finally, as was the case in \cite{Stojnicgscomp16},
here we also show how the well known Slepian's max and Gordon's minmax
comparison principles can be obtained as special cases of the mechanisms that
we present here. We also create their lifted upgrades which happen to be
stronger than the corresponding ones in \cite{Stojnicgscomp16}. A fairly large
collection of results obtained through numerical experiments is also provided.
It is observed that these results are in an excellent agreement with what the
theory predicts.

 <dc:description>  Face recognition techniques have been developed significantly in recent
years. However, recognizing faces with partial occlusion is still challenging
for existing face recognizers which is heavily desired in real-world
applications concerning surveillance and security. Although much research
effort has been devoted to developing face de-occlusion methods, most of them
can only work well under constrained conditions, such as all the faces are from
a pre-defined closed set. In this paper, we propose a robust LSTM-Autoencoders
(RLA) model to effectively restore partially occluded faces even in the wild.
The RLA model consists of two LSTM components, which aims at occlusion-robust
face encoding and recurrent occlusion removal respectively. The first one,
named multi-scale spatial LSTM encoder, reads facial patches of various scales
sequentially to output a latent representation, and occlusion-robustness is
achieved owing to the fact that the influence of occlusion is only upon some of
the patches. Receiving the representation learned by the encoder, the LSTM
decoder with a dual channel architecture reconstructs the overall face and
detects occlusion simultaneously, and by feat of LSTM, the decoder breaks down
the task of face de-occlusion into restoring the occluded part step by step.
Moreover, to minimize identify information loss and guarantee face recognition
accuracy over recovered faces, we introduce an identity-preserving adversarial
training scheme to further improve RLA. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real datasets of faces with occlusion clearly demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed RLA in removing different types of facial occlusion at various
locations. The proposed method also provides significantly larger performance
gain than other de-occlusion methods in promoting recognition performance over
partially-occluded faces.

(or a binary stream), based on the answers to the binary queries that it makes
during the computation. We study the probability that the machine will produce
a computable function when it is given a random stream of bits as the answers
to its queries. Surprisingly, we find that these probabilities are the entire
class of real numbers in (0, 1) that can be written as the difference of two
halting probabilities relative to the halting problem. In particular, there are
universal Turing machines which produce a computable output with probability
exactly 1/2. Our results contrast a large array of facts (the most well-known
being the randomness of Chaitin's halting probability) which witness maximal
initial segment complexity of probabilities associated with universal machines.
Our proof uses recent advances in algorithmic randomness.

 <dc:description>  Differential space time block coding (STBC) achieves full spatial diversity
and avoids channel estimation overhead. Over highly frequency-selective
channels, STBC is integrated with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) to efficiently mitigate intersymbol interference effects. However,
low-cost implementation of STBC-OFDM with direct-conversion transceivers is
sensitive to In-phase/Quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI). In this paper, we
quantify the performance impact of IQI at both the transmitter and receiver
radio frequency front-ends on differential STBC-OFDM systems which has not been
investigated before in the literature. In addition, we propose a widely-linear
compensation algorithm at the receiver to mitigate the performance degradation
caused by the IQI at the transmitter and receiver ends. Moreover, a
parameter-based generalized algorithm is proposed to extract the IQI parameters
and improve the performance under high-mobility. The adaptive compensation
algorithms are blind and work in a decision-directed manner without using known
pilots or training sequences. Numerical results show that our proposed
compensation algorithms can effectively mitigate IQI in differential STBC-OFDM.

 <dc:description>  Big data trend has enforced the data-centric systems to have continuous fast
data streams. In recent years, real-time analytics on stream data has formed
into a new research field, which aims to answer queries about
what-is-happening-now with a negligible delay. The real challenge with
real-time stream data processing is that it is impossible to store instances of
data, and therefore online analytical algorithms are utilized. To perform
real-time analytics, pre-processing of data should be performed in a way that
only a short summary of stream is stored in main memory. In addition, due to
high speed of arrival, average processing time for each instance of data should
be in such a way that incoming instances are not lost without being captured.
Lastly, the learner needs to provide high analytical accuracy measures.
Sentinel is a distributed system written in Java that aims to solve this
challenge by enforcing both the processing and learning process to be done in
distributed form. Sentinel is built on top of Apache Storm, a distributed
computing platform. Sentinels learner, Vertical Hoeffding Tree, is a parallel
decision tree-learning algorithm based on the VFDT, with ability of enabling
parallel classification in distributed environments. Sentinel also uses
SpaceSaving to keep a summary of the data stream and stores its summary in a
synopsis data structure. Application of Sentinel on Twitter Public Stream API
is shown and the results are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains,
have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex
physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm
that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the
effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The
overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an
essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing
scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific
understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of
TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such
as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical
science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper,
we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of
research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain
knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from
different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel
research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.

 <dc:description>  We propose a geometric assumption on nonnegative data matrices such that
under this assumption, we are able to provide upper bounds (both deterministic
and probabilistic) on the relative error of nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF). The algorithm we propose first uses the geometric assumption to obtain
an exact clustering of the columns of the data matrix; subsequently, it employs
several rank-one NMFs to obtain the final decomposition. When applied to data
matrices generated from our statistical model, we observe that our proposed
algorithm produces factor matrices with comparable relative errors vis-\`a-vis
classical NMF algorithms but with much faster speeds. On face image and
hyperspectral imaging datasets, we demonstrate that our algorithm provides an
excellent initialization for applying other NMF algorithms at a low
computational cost. Finally, we show on face and text datasets that the
combinations of our algorithm and several classical NMF algorithms outperform
other algorithms in terms of clustering performance.

It consists of a cellular automata grid coupled to a dynamic network topology.
The inherently heterogeneous properties of urban structure and function are
taken into account in the dynamics of the system. We propose various layout and
performance measures to categorize and explore the generated configurations. An
economic evaluation metric was also designed using the sensitivity of
segregation models to spatial configuration. Our model is applied to a
real-world case, offering a means to optimize the distribution of activities in

 <dc:title>Monte Carlo Sort for unreliable human comparisons</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Algorithms which sort lists of real numbers into ascending order have been
studied for decades. They are typically based on a series of pairwise
comparisons and run entirely on chip. However people routinely sort lists which
depend on subjective or complex judgements that cannot be automated. Examples
include marketing research; where surveys are used to learn about customer
preferences for products, the recruiting process; where interviewers attempt to
rank potential employees, and sporting tournaments; where we infer team
rankings from a series of one on one matches. We develop a novel sorting
algorithm, where each pairwise comparison reflects a subjective human judgement
about which element is bigger or better. We introduce a finite and large error
rate to each judgement, and we take the cost of each comparison to
significantly exceed the cost of other computational steps. The algorithm must
request the most informative sequence of comparisons from the user; in order to
identify the correct sorted list with minimum human input. Our Discrete
Adiabatic Monte Carlo approach exploits the gradual acquisition of information
by tracking a set of plausible hypotheses which are updated after each
additional comparison.

 <dc:description>  Both authentication and deauthentication are instrumental for preventing
unauthorized access to computer and data assets. While there are obvious
motivating factors for using strong authentication mechanisms, convincing users
to deauthenticate is not straight-forward, since deauthentication is not
considered mandatory. A user who leaves a logged-in workstation unattended
(especially for a short time) is typically not inconvenienced in any way; in
fact, the other way around: no annoying reauthentication is needed upon return.
However, an unattended workstation is trivially susceptible to the well-known
&quot;lunchtime attack&quot; by any nearby adversary who simply takes over the departed
user's log-in session. At the same time, since deathentication does not
intrinsically require user secrets, it can, in principle, be made unobtrusive.
To this end, this paper designs the first automatic user deauthentication
system, FADEWICH, that does not rely on biometric- or behavior-based techniques
(e.g., keystroke dynamics) and does not require users to carry any devices. It
uses physical properties of wireless signals and the effect of human bodies on
their propagation. To assess FADEWICH's feasibility and performance, extensive
experiments were conducted with its prototype. Results show that it suffices to
have nine inexpensive wireless sensors deployed in a shared office setting to
correctly deauthenticate all users within six seconds (90% within four seconds)
after they leave their workstation's vicinity. We considered two realistic
scenarios where the adversary attempts to subvert FADEWICH and showed that
lunchtime attacks fail.

 <dc:description>  Today's unrelenting increase in demand for information processing creates the
need for novel computing concepts. Reservoir computing is such a concept that
lends itself particularly well to photonic hardware implementations. Over
recent years, these hardware implementations have gained maturity and now
achieve state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark tasks. However,
implementations so far are essentially all based on sequential data processing,
leaving the inherent parallelism of photonics unexploited. Parallel
implementations process all neurons simultaneously, and therefore have the
potential of reducing computation time by a factor equal to the number of
neurons, compared to sequential architectures. Here, we report a parallel
reservoir computer that uses frequency domain multiplexing of neuron states. We
illustrate its performance on standard benchmark tasks such as nonlinear
channel equalization, the reproduction of a nonlinear 10th-order system, and
speech recognition, obtaining error rates similar to previous optical
experiments. The present experiment is thus an important step towards high
speed, low footprint, all optical photonic information processing.

 <dc:description>  Emerging workloads, such as graph processing and machine learning are
approximate because of the scale of data involved and the stochastic nature of
the underlying algorithms. These algorithms are often distributed over multiple
machines using bulk-synchronous processing (BSP) or other synchronous
processing paradigms such as map-reduce. However, data parallel processing
primitives such as repeated barrier and reduce operations introduce high
synchronization overheads. Hence, many existing data-processing platforms use
asynchrony and staleness to improve data-parallel job performance. Often, these
systems simply change the synchronous communication to asynchronous between the
worker nodes in the cluster. This improves the throughput of data processing
but results in poor accuracy of the final output since different workers may
progress at different speeds and process inconsistent intermediate outputs.
  In this paper, we present ASAP, a model that provides asynchronous and
approximate processing semantics for data-parallel computation. ASAP provides
fine-grained worker synchronization using NOTIFY-ACK semantics that allows
independent workers to run asynchronously. ASAP also provides stochastic reduce
that provides approximate but guaranteed convergence to the same result as an
aggregated all-reduce. In our results, we show that ASAP can reduce
synchronization costs and provides 2-10X speedups in convergence and up to 10X
savings in network costs for distributed machine learning applications and
provides strong convergence guarantees.

 <dc:title>Asynchronous Operations on Qubits in Distributed Simulation Environments
  using QooSim</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Operations on a pair of entangled qubits are conventionally presented as the
application of the tensor product of operations. The tensor product is linearly
extended to act synchronously across the entire entangled system. When
simulating an entangled system, the conventional approach is possible and
practical if both parts of the entangled system exist within the same physical
simulator. However, if we wish to simulate an entangled system across a
distributed network, sending half of the entangled pair to another simulator on
another computer system, the synchronous approach becomes difficult. In the
first part of this paper, we demonstrate a method of simulating operations on
entangled states in a distributed environment which is equivalent to the
conventional approach. The advantage to our approach is that we can simulate
distributed quantum systems on physically distributed hardware. Such a system
advances the possibilities of demonstrating distributed quantum algorithms for
research, teaching, and learning.
  Further, the security of quantum key exchange depends on successfully
detecting the presence of an eavesdropper. In most cases this is done by
comparing the errors introduced by an eavesdropper with the channel error rate.
In other words, the communicating parties must tolerate some errors without
losing a significant amount of key information. In the second part of this
paper, we characterize the effects of amplitude damping errors on quantum key
distribution protocols and explore allowable tolerances. Through simulations we
observe that the effect of these errors, in some cases, is highly dependent on
where the eavesdropper is located on the channel.
  In this paper, we also briefly describe the development of a new quantum
simulation library called QooSim.

 <dc:description>  A central result that arose in applying information theory to the stochastic
thermodynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems is the Information-Processing
Second Law (IPSL): the physical entropy of the universe can decrease if
compensated by the Shannon-Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy change of appropriate
information-carrying degrees of freedom. In particular, the asymptotic-rate
IPSL precisely delineates the thermodynamic functioning of autonomous
Maxwellian demons and information engines. How do these systems begin to
function as engines, Landauer erasers, and error correctors? Here, we identify
a minimal, inescapable transient dissipation engendered by physical information
processing not captured by asymptotic rates, but critical to adaptive
thermodynamic processes such as found in biological systems. A component of
transient dissipation, we also identify an implementation-dependent cost that
varies from one physical substrate to another for the same information
processing task. Applying these results to producing structured patterns from a
structureless information reservoir, we show that &quot;retrodictive&quot; generators
achieve the minimal costs. The results establish the thermodynamic toll imposed
by a physical system's structure as it comes to optimally transduce
information.

 <dc:description>  We propose a mapping of spreading dynamics to an ensemble of weighted
networks, where edge weights represent propagation time delays. In this
mapping, shortest paths in the weighted networks preserve the temporal
causality of spreading. Furthermore, for efficient sampling, we construct a
Markov Chain (Gibbs sampler) over elements of an ensemble of mapped weighted
networks. Our framework provides insights into the local and global spreading
dynamics from arbitrary source nodes and the scaling the of average propagation
time for Markovian and non-Markovian processes. Furthermore, it enables
efficient source detection and helps to improve strategies for time-critical
vaccination. Our framework overcomes the limitations of previous methods such
as tree-like assumptions of message passing, omitting dynamical correlations
with mean-field approximations, or setting all initial conditions upfront for
the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Finally, in a limit of process time, we
establish the connection of our mapping with bond percolation.

 <dc:description>  We develop a model for a random walker with long-range hops on general
graphs. This random multi-hopper jumps from a node to any other node in the
graph with a probability that decays as a function of the shortest-path
distance between the two nodes. We consider here two decaying functions in the
form of the Laplace and Mellin transforms of the shortest-path distances.
Remarkably, when the parameters of these transforms approach zero
asymptotically, the multi-hopper's hitting times between any two nodes in the
graph converge to their minimum possible value, given by the hitting times of a
normal random walker on a complete graph. Stated differently, for small
parameter values the multi-hopper explores a general graph as fast as possible
when compared to a random walker on a full graph. Using computational
experiments we show that compared to the normal random walker, the multi-hopper
indeed explores graphs with clusters or skewed degree distributions more
efficiently for a large parameter range. We provide further computational
evidence of the speed-up attained by the random multi-hopper model with respect
to the normal random walker by studying deterministic, random and real-world
networks.

 <dc:description>  AUC (Area under the ROC curve) is an important performance measure for
applications where the data is highly imbalanced. Learning to maximize AUC
performance is thus an important research problem. Using a max-margin based
surrogate loss function, AUC optimization problem can be approximated as a
pairwise rankSVM learning problem. Batch learning methods for solving the
kernelized version of this problem suffer from scalability and may not result
in sparse classifiers. Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in the
development of online or single-pass online learning algorithms that design a
classifier by maximizing the AUC performance. The AUC performance of nonlinear
classifiers, designed using online methods, is not comparable with that of
nonlinear classifiers designed using batch learning algorithms on many
real-world datasets. Motivated by these observations, we design a scalable
algorithm for maximizing AUC performance by greedily adding the required number
of basis functions into the classifier model. The resulting sparse classifiers
perform faster inference. Our experimental results show that the level of
sparsity achievable can be order of magnitude smaller than the Kernel RankSVM
model without affecting the AUC performance much.

 <dc:description>  A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a system that aims for establishing a
non-muscular communication path for subjects who had suffer from a
neurodegenerative disease. Many BCI systems make use of the phenomena of
event-related synchronization and de-synchronization of brain waves as a main
feature for classification of different cognitive tasks. However, the temporal
dynamics of the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals contain additional
information that can be incorporated into the inference engine in order to
improve the performance of the BCIs. This information about the dynamics of the
signals have been exploited previously in BCIs by means of generative and
discriminative methods. In particular, hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been
used in previous works. These methods have the disadvantage that the model
parameters such as the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian
mixtures need to be fix &quot;a priori&quot;. In this work, we propose a Bayesian
nonparametric model for brain signal classification that does not require &quot;a
priori&quot; selection of the number of hidden states and the number of Gaussian
mixtures of a HMM. The results show that the proposed model outperform other
methods based on HMM as well as the winner algorithm of the BCI competition IV.

 <dc:description>  Ranking in bibliographic information networks is a widely studied problem due
to its many applications such as advertisement industry, funding, search
engines, etc. Most of the existing works on ranking in bibliographic
information network are based on ranking of research papers and their authors.
But the bibliographic information network can be used for solving other
important problems as well. The KDD Cup $2016$ competition considers one such
problem, which is to measure the impact of research institutions, i.e. to
perform ranking of research institutions. The competition took place in three
phases. In this paper, we discuss our solutions for ranking institutions in
each phase. We participated under team name &quot;anu@TASL&quot; and our solutions
achieved the average NDCG@$20$ score of $0.7483$, ranking in eleventh place in
the contest.

 <dc:description>  Environment plays a vital role in the sleep mechanism of a human. It has been
shown from many studies that sleeping and waking environment, waking time and
hours of sleep is of very significant importance which can result in sleeping
disorders and variety of diseases. This paper finds the sleep cycle of an
individual and according changes the ambient temperature to maximize his/her
sleep efficiency. We suggest a method which will assist in increasing sleep
efficiency. Using Fast-Fourier-Transformation (FFT) of heart rate signals to
extract heart rate variability data such that low frequency / high frequency
(LF/HF) power ratio we are detecting sleep stages using an automated algorithm
and then applying feedback mechanism to alter the ambient temperature depending
upon the sleep stage.

 <dc:description>  Massive spatial modulation aided multiple-input multiple-output (SM-MIMO)
systems have recently been proposed as a novel combination of spatial
modulation (SM) and of conventional massive MIMO, where the base station (BS)
is equipped with a large number of antennas and simultaneously serves multiple
user equipment (UE) that employ SM for their uplink transmission. Since the
massive SM-MIMO concept combines the benefits of both the SM and massive MIMO
techniques, it has recently attracted substantial research interest. In this
paper, we study the achievable uplink spectral efficiency (SE) of a multi-cell
massive SM-MIMO system, and derive closed-form expressions to asymptotically
lower-bound the SE yielded by two linear BS combining schemes, including
maximum ratio (MR) combining and zero forcing (ZF) combining, when a
sufficiently large number of BS antennas are equipped. The derivation takes
into account the impact of transmitter spatial correlations, of imperfect
channel estimations, of user-specific power controls and of different pilot
reuse factors. The proposed asymptotic bounds are shown to be tight, even when
the scale of BS antennas is limited. The new SE results facilitate a
system-level investigation of the optimal number of uplink transmit antennas
(TAs) $N$ with respect to SE maximization. Explicitly, we provide theoretical
insights on the SE of massive SM-MIMO systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
massive SM-MIMO systems are capable of outperforming the SE of conventional
massive MIMOs relying on single-TA UEs.

 <dc:description>  Gene expression data is widely used in disease analysis and cancer diagnosis.
However, since gene expression data could contain thousands of genes
simultaneously, successful microarray classification is rather difficult.
Feature selection is an important pre-treatment for any classification process.
Selecting a useful gene subset as a classifier not only decreases the
computational time and cost, but also increases classification accuracy. In
this study, we applied the information gain method as a filter approach, and an
improved binary particle swarm optimization as a wrapper approach to implement
feature selection; selected gene subsets were used to evaluate the performance
of classification. Experimental results show that by employing the proposed
method fewer gene subsets needed to be selected and better classification
accuracy could be obtained.

 <dc:title>Optimizing Secure Statistical Computations with PICCO</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>DeBenedetto, Justin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Growth in research collaboration has caused an increased need for sharing of
data. However, when this data is private, there is also an increased need for
maintaining security and privacy. Secure multi-party computation enables any
function to be securely evaluated over private data without revealing any
unintended data. A number of tools and compilers have been recently developed
to support evaluation of various functionalities over private data. PICCO is
one of such compilers that transforms a general-purpose user program into its
secure distributed implementation. Here we assess performance of common
statistical programs using PICCO. Specifically, we focus on chi-squared and
standard deviation computations and optimize user programs for them to assess
performance that an informed user might expect from securely evaluating these
functions using a general-purpose compiler.

 <dc:title>Differentiable monotonicity-preserving schemes for discontinuous
  Galerkin methods on arbitrary meshes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This work is devoted to the design of interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin
(dG) schemes that preserve maximum principles at the discrete level for the
steady transport and convection-diffusion problems and the respective transient
problems with implicit time integration. Monotonic schemes that combine
explicit time stepping with dG space discretization are very common, but the
design of such schemes for implicit time stepping is rare, and it had only been
attained so far for 1D problems. The proposed scheme is based on an artificial
diffusion that linearly depends on a shock detector that identifies the
troublesome areas. In order to define the new shock detector, we have
introduced the concept of discrete local extrema. The diffusion operator is a
graph-Laplacian, instead of the more common finite element discretization of
the Laplacian operator, which is essential to keep monotonicity on general
meshes and in multi-dimension. The resulting nonlinear stabilization is
non-smooth and nonlinear solvers can fail to converge. As a result, we propose
a smoothed (twice differentiable) version of the nonlinear stabilization, which
allows us to use Newton with line search nonlinear solvers and dramatically
improve nonlinear convergence. A theoretical numerical analysis of the proposed
schemes show that they satisfy the desired monotonicity properties. Further,
the resulting operator is Lipschitz continuous and there exists at least one
solution of the discrete problem, even in the non-smooth version. We provide a
set of numerical results to support our findings.

 <dc:description>  Randomized algorithms provide solutions to two ubiquitous problems: (1) the
distributed calculation of a principal component analysis or singular value
decomposition of a highly rectangular matrix, and (2) the distributed
calculation of a low-rank approximation (in the form of a singular value
decomposition) to an arbitrary matrix. Carefully honed algorithms yield results
that are uniformly superior to those of the stock, deterministic
implementations in Spark (the popular platform for distributed computation); in
particular, whereas the stock software will without warning return left
singular vectors that are far from numerically orthonormal, a significantly
burnished randomized implementation generates left singular vectors that are
numerically orthonormal to nearly the machine precision.

 <dc:description>  It has long been considered a significant problem to improve the visual
quality of lossy image and video compression. Recent advances in computing
power together with the availability of large training data sets has increased
interest in the application of deep learning cnns to address image recognition
and image processing tasks. Here, we present a powerful cnn tailored to the
specific task of semantic image understanding to achieve higher visual quality
in lossy compression. A modest increase in complexity is incorporated to the
encoder which allows a standard, off-the-shelf jpeg decoder to be used. While
jpeg encoding may be optimized for generic images, the process is ultimately
unaware of the specific content of the image to be compressed. Our technique
makes jpeg content-aware by designing and training a model to identify multiple
semantic regions in a given image. Unlike object detection techniques, our
model does not require labeling of object positions and is able to identify
objects in a single pass. We present a new cnn architecture directed
specifically to image compression, which generates a map that highlights
semantically-salient regions so that they can be encoded at higher quality as
compared to background regions. By adding a complete set of features for every
class, and then taking a threshold over the sum of all feature activations, we
generate a map that highlights semantically-salient regions so that they can be
encoded at a better quality compared to background regions. Experiments are
presented on the Kodak PhotoCD dataset and the MIT Saliency Benchmark dataset,
in which our algorithm achieves higher visual quality for the same compressed
size.

 <dc:description>  Clustering is a widely used unsupervised learning method for finding
structure in the data. However, the resulting clusters are typically presented
without any guarantees on their robustness; slightly changing the used data
sample or re-running a clustering algorithm involving some stochastic component
may lead to completely different clusters. There is, hence, a need for
techniques that can quantify the instability of the generated clusters. In this
study, we propose a technique for quantifying the instability of a clustering
solution and for finding robust clusters, termed core clusters, which
correspond to clusters where the co-occurrence probability of each data item
within a cluster is at least $1 - \alpha$. We demonstrate how solving the core
clustering problem is linked to finding the largest maximal cliques in a graph.
We show that the method can be used with both clustering and classification
algorithms. The proposed method is tested on both simulated and real datasets.
The results show that the obtained clusters indeed meet the guarantees on
robustness.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a dataset for facilitating audio-visual analysis of musical
performances. The dataset comprises a number of simple multi-instrument
classical music pieces assembled from coordinated but separately recorded
performances of individual tracks. For each piece, we provide the musical score
in MIDI format, the audio recordings of the individual tracks, the audio and
video recording of the assembled mixture, and ground-truth annotation files
including frame-level and note-level transcriptions. We describe our
methodology for the creation of this dataset, particularly highlighting our
approaches for addressing the challenges involved in maintaining
synchronization and naturalness. We compare this dataset with existing widely
used music audio datasets on the synchronization quality and show its high
quality. We anticipate that the dataset will be useful for the development and
evaluation of many existing music information retrieval (MIR) tasks, as well as
many novel multi-modal tasks. On this end, we benchmark this dataset with
existing music audio datasets using two existing MIR tasks (multi-pitch
analysis and score-informed source separation). We also define two novel
multi-modal MIR tasks (visually informed multi-pitch analysis and polyphonic
vibrato analysis), provide evaluation measures and baseline systems for future
comparisons. Finally, we propose several emerging research directions that can
be supported by this dataset.

 <dc:description>  This article introduces a new notion of optimal transport (OT) between tensor
fields, which are measures whose values are positive semidefinite (PSD)
matrices. This &quot;quantum&quot; formulation of OT (Q-OT) corresponds to a relaxed
version of the classical Kantorovich transport problem, where the fidelity
between the input PSD-valued measures is captured using the geometry of the
Von-Neumann quantum entropy. We propose a quantum-entropic regularization of
the resulting convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently
using an iterative scaling algorithm. This method is a generalization of the
celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm to the quantum setting of PSD matrices. We extend
this formulation and the quantum Sinkhorn algorithm to compute barycenters
within a collection of input tensor fields. We illustrate the usefulness of the
proposed approach on applications to procedural noise generation, anisotropic
meshing, diffusion tensor imaging and spectral texture synthesis.

 <dc:description>  Cellular communication networks are plagued with redundant capacity, which
results in low utilization and cost-effectiveness of network capital
investments. The redundant capacity can be exploited to deliver secondary
traffic that is ultra-elastic and delay-tolerant. In this paper, we propose an
analytical framework to study the capacity-delay tradeoff of elastic/secondary
traffic in large scale cellular networks with spectrum aggregation. Our
framework integrates stochastic geometry and queueing theory models and gives
analytical insights into the capacity-delay performance in the interference
limited regime. Closed-form results are obtained to characterize the mean delay
and delay distribution as functions of per user throughput capacity. The
impacts of spectrum aggregation, user and base station (BS) densities, traffic
session payload, and primary traffic dynamics on the capacity-delay tradeoff
relationship are investigated. The fundamental capacity limit is derived and
its scaling behavior is revealed. Our analysis shows the feasibility of
providing secondary communication services over cellular networks and
highlights some critical design issues.

 <dc:description>  Classification of human behavior is key to developing closed-loop Deep Brain
Stimulation (DBS) systems, which may be able to decrease the power consumption
and side effects of the existing systems. Recent studies have shown that the
Local Field Potential (LFP) signals from both Subthalamic Nuclei (STN) of the
brain can be used to recognize human behavior. Since the DBS leads implanted in
each STN can collect three bipolar signals, the selection of a suitable pair of
LFPs that achieves optimal recognition performance is still an open problem to
address. Considering the presence of synchronized aggregate activity in the
basal ganglia, this paper presents an FFT-based synchronization approach to
automatically select a relevant pair of LFPs and use the pair together with an
SVM-based MKL classifier for behavior recognition purposes. Our experiments on
five subjects show the superiority of the proposed approach compared to other
methods used for behavior classification.

 <dc:description>  Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is an important index for wireless
communications. In CDMA systems, spreading sequences are utilized. This series
of papers show the method to derive spreading sequences as the solutions of
non-linear programming: maximize SNR. In this paper, we derive the optimization
problems with the expression SNR derived in Part I and the necessary conditions
for the global solutions. We numerically solve the problems and evaluate the
solutions with two factors, mean-square correlations and maximum mean-square
correlations.

 <dc:description>  Composition and parametrisation of multicomponent predictive systems (MCPSs)
consisting of chains of data transformation steps is a challenging task. This
paper is concerned with theoretical considerations and extensive experimental
analysis for automating the task of building such predictive systems. In the
theoretical part of the paper, we first propose to adopt the Well-handled and
Acyclic Workflow (WA-WF) Petri net as a formal representation of MCPSs. We then
define the optimisation problem in which the search space consists of suitably
parametrised directed acyclic graphs (i.e. WA-WFs) forming the sought MCPS
solutions. In the experimental analysis we focus on examining the impact of
considerably extending the search space resulting from incorporating multiple
sequential data cleaning and preprocessing steps in the process of composing
optimised MCPSs, and the quality of the solutions found. In a range of
extensive experiments three different optimisation strategies are used to
automatically compose MCPSs for 21 publicly available datasets and 7 datasets
from real chemical processes. The diversity of the composed MCPSs found is an
indication that fully and automatically exploiting different combinations of
data cleaning and preprocessing techniques is possible and highly beneficial
for different predictive models. Our findings can have a major impact on
development of high quality predictive models as well as their maintenance and
scalability aspects needed in modern applications and deployment scenarios.

 <dc:title>Superpixel Segmentation Using Gaussian Mixture Model</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Superpixel segmentation algorithms are to partition an image into
perceptually coherence atomic regions by assigning every pixel a superpixel
label. Those algorithms have been wildly used as a preprocessing step in
computer vision works, as they can enormously reduce the number of entries of
subsequent algorithms. In this work, we propose an alternative superpixel
segmentation method based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) by assuming that each
superpixel corresponds to a Gaussian distribution, and assuming that each pixel
is generated by first randomly choosing one distribution from several Gaussian
distributions which are defined to be related to that pixel, and then the pixel
is drawn from the selected distribution. Based on this assumption, each pixel
is supposed to be drawn from a mixture of Gaussian distributions with unknown
parameters (GMM). An algorithm based on expectation-maximization method is
applied to estimate the unknown parameters. Once the unknown parameters are
obtained, the superpixel label of a pixel is determined by a posterior
probability. The success of applying GMM to superpixel segmentation depends on
the two major differences between the traditional GMM-based clustering and the
proposed one: data points in our model may be non-identically distributed, and
we present an approach to control the shape of the estimated Gaussian functions
by adjusting their covariance matrices. Our method is of linear complexity with
respect to the number of pixels. The proposed algorithm is inherently parallel
and can get faster speed by adding simple OpenMP directives to our
implementation. According to our experiments, our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms in accuracy and presents a competitive
performance in computational efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Many machine learning applications use latent variable models to explain
structure in data, whereby visible variables (= coordinates of the given
datapoint) are explained as a probabilistic function of some hidden variables.
Finding parameters with the maximum likelihood is NP-hard even in very simple
settings. In recent years, provably efficient algorithms were nevertheless
developed for models with linear structures: topic models, mixture models,
hidden markov models, etc. These algorithms use matrix or tensor decomposition,
and make some reasonable assumptions about the parameters of the underlying
model.
  But matrix or tensor decomposition seems of little use when the latent
variable model has nonlinearities. The current paper shows how to make
progress: tensor decomposition is applied for learning the single-layer {\em
noisy or} network, which is a textbook example of a Bayes net, and used for
example in the classic QMR-DT software for diagnosing which disease(s) a
patient may have by observing the symptoms he/she exhibits.
  The technical novelty here, which should be useful in other settings in
future, is analysis of tensor decomposition in presence of systematic error
(i.e., where the noise/error is correlated with the signal, and doesn't
decrease as number of samples goes to infinity). This requires rethinking all
steps of tensor decomposition methods from the ground up.
  For simplicity our analysis is stated assuming that the network parameters
were chosen from a probability distribution but the method seems more generally
applicable.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a model for classification of logos based on symbolic
representation of features is presented. The proposed model makes use of global
features of logo images such as color, texture, and shape features for
classification. The logo images are broadly classified into three different
classes, viz., logo image containing only text, an image with only symbol, and
an image with both text and a symbol. In each class, the similar looking logo
images are clustered using K-means clustering algorithm. The intra-cluster
variations present in each cluster corresponding to each class are then
preserved using symbolic interval data. Thus referenced logo images are
represented in the form of interval data. A sample logo image is then
classified using suitable symbolic classifier. For experimentation purpose,
relatively large amount of color logo images is created consisting of 5044 logo
images. The classification results are validated with the help of accuracy,
precision, recall, F-measure, and time. To check the efficacy of the proposed
model, the comparative analyses are given against the other models. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms the other models with respect to time
and F-measure.

 <dc:description>  One of the key challenges of artificial intelligence is to learn models that
are effective in the context of planning. In this document we introduce the
predictron architecture. The predictron consists of a fully abstract model,
represented by a Markov reward process, that can be rolled forward multiple
&quot;imagined&quot; planning steps. Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates
internal rewards and values over multiple planning depths. The predictron is
trained end-to-end so as to make these accumulated values accurately
approximate the true value function. We applied the predictron to procedurally
generated random mazes and a simulator for the game of pool. The predictron
yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional deep neural
network architectures.

 <dc:description>  Testing provides means pertaining to assuring software performance. The total
aim of software industry is actually to make a certain start associated with
high quality software for the end user. However, associated with software
testing has quite a few underlying concerns, which are very important and need
to pay attention on these issues. These issues are effectively generating,
prioritization of test cases, etc. These issues can be overcome by paying
attention and focus. Solitary of the greatest Problems in the software testing
area is usually how to acquire a great proper set associated with cases to
confirm software. Some other strategies and also methodologies are proposed
pertaining to shipping care of most of these issues. Genetic Algorithm (GA)
belongs to evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary algorithms have a significant
role in the automatic test generation and many researchers are focusing on it.
In this study explored software testing related issues by using the GA
approach. In addition to right after applying some analysis, better solution
produced, that is feasible and reliable. The particular research presents the
implementation of GAs because of its generation of optimized test cases. Along
these lines, this paper gives proficient system for the optimization of test

 <dc:title>Multivariate mixture model for myocardium segmentation combining
  multi-source images</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhuang, Xiahai</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a method for simultaneous segmentation of multi-source
images, using the multivariate mixture model (MvMM) and maximum of
log-likelihood (LL) framework. The segmentation is a procedure of texture
classification, and the MvMM is used to model the joint intensity distribution
of the images. Specifically, the method is applied to the myocardial
segmentation combining the complementary texture information from
multi-sequence (MS) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images. Furthermore, there
exist inter-image mis-registration and intra-image misalignment of slices in
the MS CMR images. Hence, the MvMM is formulated with transformations, which
are embedded into the LL framework and optimized simultaneously with the
segmentation parameters. The proposed method is able to correct the inter- and
intra-image misalignment by registering each slice of the MS CMR to a virtual
common space, as well as to delineate the indistinguishable boundaries of
myocardium consisting of pathologies. Results have shown statistically
significant improvement in the segmentation performance of the proposed method
with respect to the conventional approaches which can solely segment each image
separately. The proposed method has also demonstrated better robustness in the
incongruent data, where some images may not fully cover the region of interest
and the full coverage can only be reconstructed combining the images from
multiple sources.

 <dc:description>  A seminal result of Bulow and Klemperer [1989] demonstrates the power of
competition for extracting revenue: when selling a single item to $n$ bidders
whose values are drawn i.i.d. from a regular distribution, the simple
welfare-maximizing VCG mechanism (in this case, a second price-auction) with
one additional bidder extracts at least as much revenue in expectation as the
optimal mechanism. The beauty of this theorem stems from the fact that VCG is a
{\em prior-independent} mechanism, where the seller possesses no information
about the distribution, and yet, by recruiting one additional bidder it
performs better than any prior-dependent mechanism tailored exactly to the
distribution at hand (without the additional bidder).
  In this work, we establish the first {\em full Bulow-Klemperer} results in
{\em multi-dimensional} environments, proving that by recruiting additional
bidders, the revenue of the VCG mechanism surpasses that of the optimal
(possibly randomized, Bayesian incentive compatible) mechanism. For a given
environment with i.i.d. bidders, we term the number of additional bidders
needed to achieve this guarantee the environment's {\em competition
complexity}.
  Using the recent duality-based framework of Cai et al. [2016] for reasoning
about optimal revenue, we show that the competition complexity of $n$ bidders
with additive valuations over $m$ independent, regular items is at most
$n+2m-2$ and at least $\log(m)$. We extend our results to bidders with additive
valuations subject to downward-closed constraints, showing that these
significantly more general valuations increase the competition complexity by at
most an additive $m-1$ factor. We further improve this bound for the special
case of matroid constraints, and provide additional extensions as well.

Niho exponents based on some subtle manipulation of solving equations with low
degrees over finite fields.

 <dc:description>  Convolutions have long been regarded as fundamental to applied mathematics,
physics and engineering. Their mathematical elegance allows for common tasks
such as numerical differentiation to be computed efficiently on large data
sets. Efficient computation of convolutions is critical to artificial
intelligence in real-time applications, like machine vision, where convolutions
must be continuously and efficiently computed on tens to hundreds of kilobytes
per second. In this paper, we explore how convolutions are used in fundamental
machine vision applications. We present an accelerated n-dimensional
convolution package in the high performance computing language, Julia, and
demonstrate its efficacy in solving the time to contact problem for machine
vision. Results are measured against synthetically generated videos and
quantitatively assessed according to their mean squared error from the ground
truth. We achieve over an order of magnitude decrease in compute time and
allocated memory for comparable machine vision applications. All code is
packaged and integrated into the official Julia Package Manager to be used in
various other scenarios.

 <dc:title>Making Bipartite Graphs DM-irreducible</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Dulmage--Mendelsohn decomposition (or the DM-decomposition) gives a
unique partition of the vertex set of a bipartite graph reflecting the
structure of all the maximum matchings therein. A bipartite graph is said to be
DM-irreducible if its DM-decomposition consists of a single component.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of making a given bipartite graph
DM-irreducible by adding edges. When the input bipartite graph is balanced
(i.e., both sides have the same number of vertices) and has a perfect matching,
this problem is equivalent to making a directed graph strongly connected by
adding edges, for which the minimum number of additional edges was
characterized by Eswaran and Tarjan (1976).
  We give a general solution to this problem, which is divided into three
parts. We first show that our problem can be formulated as a special case of a
general framework of covering supermodular functions, which was introduced by
Frank and Jord\'an (1995) to investigate the directed connectivity augmentation
problem. Secondly, when the input graph is not balanced, the problem is solved
via matroid intersection. This result can be extended to the minimum cost
version in which the addition of an edge gives rise to an individual cost.
Thirdly, for balanced input graphs, we devise a combinatorial algorithm that
finds a minimum number of additional edges to attain the DM-irreducibility,
while the minimum cost version of this problem is NP-hard. These results also
lead to min-max characterizations of the minimum number, which generalize the
result of Eswaran and Tarjan.

 <dc:title>Multi-Party Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage using Bloom Filters</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL), the problem of identifying records
that correspond to the same real-world entity across several data sources held
by different parties without revealing any sensitive information about these
records, is increasingly being required in many real-world application areas.
Examples range from public health surveillance to crime and fraud detection,
and national security. Various techniques have been developed to tackle the
problem of PPRL, with the majority of them considering linking data from only
two sources. However, in many real-world applications data from more than two
sources need to be linked. In this paper we propose a viable solution for
multi-party PPRL using two efficient privacy techniques: Bloom filter encoding
and distributed secure summation. Our proposed protocol efficiently identifies
matching sets of records held by all data sources that have a similarity above
a certain minimum threshold. While being efficient, our protocol is also secure
under the semi-honest adversary model in that no party can learn any sensitive
information about any other parties' data, but all parties learn which of their
records have a high similarity with records held by the other parties. We
evaluate our protocol on a large real voter registration database showing the
scalability, linkage quality, and privacy of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by communication channels in which the transmitted sequences are
subject to random permutations, as well as by certain DNA storage systems, we
study the error control problem in settings where the information is
stored/transmitted in the form of multisets of symbols from a given finite
alphabet. A general channel model is assumed in which the transmitted multisets
are potentially impaired by insertions, deletions, substitutions, and erasures
of symbols. Several constructions of error-correcting codes for this channel
are described, and bounds on the size of optimal codes correcting any given
number of errors derived. The construction based on the notion of Sidon sets in
finite Abelian groups is shown to be optimal, in the sense of the asymptotic
scaling of code redundancy, for any &quot;error radius&quot; and any alphabet size. It is
also shown to be optimal in the stronger sense of maximal code cardinality in
various cases.

 <dc:description>  Objects appear to scale differently in natural images. This fact requires
methods dealing with object-centric tasks (e.g. object proposal) to have robust
performance over variances in object scales. In the paper, we present a novel
segment proposal framework, namely FastMask, which takes advantage of
hierarchical features in deep convolutional neural networks to segment
multi-scale objects in one shot. Innovatively, we adapt segment proposal
network into three different functional components (body, neck and head). We
further propose a weight-shared residual neck module as well as a
scale-tolerant attentional head module for efficient one-shot inference. On MS
COCO benchmark, the proposed FastMask outperforms all state-of-the-art segment
proposal methods in average recall being 2~5 times faster. Moreover, with a
slight trade-off in accuracy, FastMask can segment objects in near real time
(~13 fps) with 800*600 resolution images, demonstrating its potential in
practical applications. Our implementation is available on
https://github.com/voidrank/FastMask.

 <dc:description>  A feasible, secure and collusion-attack-free quantum sealed-bid auction
protocol is proposed using a modified scheme for multi-party circular quantum
key agreement. In the proposed protocol, the set of all ($n$) bidders is
grouped in to $l$ subsets (sub-circles) in such a way that only the initiator
(who prepares the quantum state to be distributed for a particular round of
communication and acts as the receiver in that round) is a member of all the
subsets (sub-circles) prepared for a particular round, while any other bidder
is part of only a single subset. All $n$ bidders and auctioneer initiate one
round of communication, and each of them prepares $l$ copies of a
$\left(r-1\right)$-partite entangled state (one for each sub-circle), where
$r=\frac{n}{l}+1$. The efficiency and security\textcolor{blue}{{} }of the
proposed protocol are critically analyzed. It is shown that the proposed
protocol is free from the collusion attacks that are possible on the existing
schemes of quantum sealed-bid auction. Further, it is observed that the
security against collusion attack increases with the increase in $l$, but that
reduces the complexity (number of entangled qubits in each entangled state) of
the entangled states to be used and that makes the scheme scalable and
implementable with the available technologies. The additional security and
scalability is shown to arise due to the use of a circular structure in place
of a complete-graph or tree-type structure used earlier.

 <dc:description>  Defining various dishonest notions in a formal way is a key step to enable
intelligent agents to act in untrustworthy environments. This review evaluates
the literature for this topic by looking at formal definitions based on modal
logic as well as other formal approaches. Criteria from philosophical
groundwork is used to assess the definitions for correctness and completeness.
The key contribution of this review is to show that only a few definitions
fully comply with this gold standard and to point out the missing steps towards
a successful application of these definitions in an actual agent environment.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel social network-aware user association in wireless
small cell networks with underlaid device-to-device (D2D) communication is
investigated. The proposed approach exploits social strategic relationships
between user equipments (UEs) and their physical proximity to optimize the
overall network performance. This problem is formulated as a matching game
between UEs and their serving nodes (SNs) in which, an SN can be a small cell
base station (SCBS) or an important UE with D2D capabilities. The problem is
cast as a many-to-one matching game in which UEs and SNs rank one another using
preference relations that capture both the wireless aspects (i.e., received
signal strength, traffic load, etc.) and users' social ties (e.g., UE proximity
and social distance). Due to the combinatorial nature of the network-wide UE-SN
matching, the problem is decomposed into a dynamic clustering problem in which
SCBSs are grouped into disjoint clusters based on mutual interference.
Subsequently, an UE-SN matching game is carried out per cluster. The game under
consideration is shown to belong to a class of matching games with
externalities arising from interference and peer effects due to users social
distance, enabling UEs and SNs to interact with one another until reaching a
stable matching. Simulation results show that the proposed social-aware user
association approach yields significant performance gains, reaching up to 26%,
24%, and 31% for 5-th, 50-th and 95-th percentiles for UE throughputs,
respectively, as compared to the classical social-unaware baseline.

Opportunistic Networks where formed over these mobile nodes, is one of the
interesting topics in the research community. In this paper, we measure
communicability capacity of DTN Network formed over the mobile nodes at a
university campus and also an area in Montreal city through exploiting static
and temporal graphs. We observed a significant difference between
communicability measures in static and temporal cases, especially for short
snapshot windows. It implies that analyzing dynamic networks by considering a
static model for them may lead to an unrealistic and even mislead results.

 <dc:title>Semantic Video Segmentation by Gated Recurrent Flow Propagation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nilsson, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Semantic video segmentation is challenging due to the sheer amount of data
that needs to be processed and labeled in order to construct accurate models.
In this paper we present a deep, end-to-end trainable methodology to video
segmentation that is capable of leveraging information present in unlabeled
data in order to improve semantic estimates. Our model combines a convolutional
architecture and a spatio-temporal transformer recurrent layer that are able to
temporally propagate labeling information by means of optical flow, adaptively
gated based on its locally estimated uncertainty. The flow, the recognition and
the gated temporal propagation modules can be trained jointly, end-to-end. The
temporal, gated recurrent flow propagation component of our model can be
plugged into any static semantic segmentation architecture and turn it into a
weakly supervised video processing one. Our extensive experiments in the
challenging CityScapes and Camvid datasets, and based on multiple deep
architectures, indicate that the resulting model can leverage unlabeled
temporal frames, next to a labeled one, in order to improve both the video
segmentation accuracy and the consistency of its temporal labeling, at no
additional annotation cost and with little extra computation.

 <dc:title>Context-Free Path Querying with Structural Representation of Result</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Grigorev, Semyon</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph data model and graph databases are very popular in various areas such
as bioinformatics, semantic web, and social networks. One specific problem in
the area is a path querying with constraints formulated in terms of formal
grammars. The query in this approach is written as grammar, and paths querying
is graph parsing with respect to given grammar. There are several solutions to
it, but how to provide structural representation of query result which is
practical for answer processing and debugging is still an open problem. In this
paper we propose a graph parsing technique which allows one to build such
representation with respect to given grammar in polynomial time and space for
arbitrary context-free grammar and graph. Proposed algorithm is based on
generalized LL parsing algorithm, while previous solutions are based mostly on
CYK or Earley algorithms, which reduces time complexity in some cases.

 <dc:description>  We show that for linear classifiers defined by convex margin-based surrogate
losses that are monotonically decreasing, it is impossible to construct any
semi-supervised approach that is able to guarantee an improvement over the
supervised classifier measured by this surrogate loss. For non-monotonically
decreasing loss functions, we demonstrate safe improvements are possible.

 <dc:description>  With the development of deep learning, supervised learning has frequently
been adopted to classify remotely sensed images using convolutional networks
(CNNs). However, due to the limited amount of labeled data available,
supervised learning is often difficult to carry out. Therefore, we proposed an
unsupervised model called multiple-layer feature-matching generative
adversarial networks (MARTA GANs) to learn a representation using only
unlabeled data. MARTA GANs consists of both a generative model $G$ and a
discriminative model $D$. We treat $D$ as a feature extractor. To fit the
complex properties of remote sensing data, we use a fusion layer to merge the
mid-level and global features. $G$ can produce numerous images that are similar
to the training data; therefore, $D$ can learn better representations of
remotely sensed images using the training data provided by $G$. The
classification results on two widely used remote sensing image databases show
that the proposed method significantly improves the classification performance
compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Improving Blind Steganalysis in Spatial Domain using a Criterion to

 <dc:description>  Conventional state-of-the-art image steganalysis approaches usually consist
of a classifier trained with features provided by rich image models. As both
features extraction and classification steps are perfectly embodied in the deep
learning architecture called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), different
studies have tried to design a CNN-based steganalyzer. The network designed by
Xu et al. is the first competitive CNN with the combination Spatial Rich Models
(SRM) and Ensemble Classifier (EC) providing detection performances of the same
order. In this work we propose a criterion to choose either the CNN or the
SRM+EC method for a given input image. Our approach is studied with three
different steganographic spatial domain algorithms: S-UNIWARD, MiPOD, and HILL,
using the Tensorflow computing platform, and exhibits detection capabilities
better than each method alone. Furthermore, as SRM+EC and the CNN are both only
trained with a single embedding algorithm, namely MiPOD, the proposed method
can be seen as an approach for blind steganalysis. In blind detection, error
rates are respectively of 16% for S-UNIWARD, 16% for MiPOD, and 17% for HILL on
the BOSSBase with a payload of 0.4 bpp. For 0.1 bpp, the respective
corresponding error rates are of 39%, 38%, and 41%, and are always better than
the ones provided by SRM+EC.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies critical nodes or &quot;middlemen&quot; that intermediate flows in a
directed network. The contestability of a node is introduced as a network
topological concept of competitiveness meaning that an intermediary's role in
the brokering of flows in the network can be substituted by a group of other
nodes. We establish the equivalence of uncontested intermediaries and
middlemen.
  The notion of node contestability gives rise to a measure that quantifies the
control exercised by a middleman in a network. We present a comparison of this
middleman centrality measures with relevant, established network centrality
measures. Furthermore, we provide concepts and measures expressing the
robustness of a middleman as the number of links or nodes that have to be added
to or removed from the network to nullify the middleman's power.
  We use these concepts to identify and measure middleman power and robustness
in two empirical networks: Krackhardt's advice network of managers in a medium
sized corporation and the well-known Florentine marriage network as a proxy of
power brokerage between houses in Renaissance Florence.

 <dc:title>On the commitment value and commitment optimal strategies in bimatrix

 <dc:description>  Given a bimatrix game, the associated leadership or commitment games are
defined as the games at which one player, the leader, commits to a (possibly
mixed) strategy and the other player, the follower, chooses his strategy after
having observed the irrevocable commitment of the leader. Based on a result by
von Stengel and Zamir [2010], the notions of commitment value and commitment
optimal strategies for each player are discussed as a possible solution
concept. It is shown that in non-degenerate bimatrix games (a) pure commitment
optimal strategies together with the follower's best response constitute Nash
equilibria, and (b) strategies that participate in a completely mixed Nash
equilibrium are strictly worse than commitment optimal strategies, provided
they are not matrix game optimal. For various classes of bimatrix games that
generalize zero sum games, the relationship between the maximin value of the
leader's payoff matrix, the Nash equilibrium payoff and the commitment optimal
value is discussed. For the Traveler's Dilemma, the commitment optimal strategy
and commitment value for the leader are evaluated and seem more acceptable as a
solution than the unique Nash equilibrium. Finally, the relationship between
commitment optimal strategies and Nash equilibria in $2 \times 2$ bimatrix
games is thoroughly examined and in addition, necessary and sufficient
conditions for the follower to be worse off at the equilibrium of the
leadership game than at any Nash equilibrium of the simultaneous move game are
provided.

 <dc:description>  Significant advances have been made towards building accurate automatic
segmentation systems for a variety of biomedical applications using machine
learning. However, the performance of these systems often degrades when they
are applied on new data that differ from the training data, for example, due to
variations in imaging protocols. Manually annotating new data for each test
domain is not a feasible solution. In this work we investigate unsupervised
domain adaptation using adversarial neural networks to train a segmentation
method which is more invariant to differences in the input data, and which does
not require any annotations on the test domain. Specifically, we learn
domain-invariant features by learning to counter an adversarial network, which
attempts to classify the domain of the input data by observing the activations
of the segmentation network. Furthermore, we propose a multi-connected domain
discriminator for improved adversarial training. Our system is evaluated using
two MR databases of subjects with traumatic brain injuries, acquired using
different scanners and imaging protocols. Using our unsupervised approach, we
obtain segmentation accuracies which are close to the upper bound of supervised
domain adaptation.

 <dc:description>  In recent times, the functioning of various aspects of modern
society---ranging from the various infrastructural utilities such as electrical
power, water to socio-economical aspects such as telecommunications, business,
commerce, education---has become critically reliant on communication networks,
and particularly on the Internet. With the migration of critical facilities to
the Internet, it has become vitally important to ensure the reliability and
availability of networks. In this paper, we study various modeling and analysis
techniques that can aid in the study of reliability of communication networks.
In this regard, we provide background on the modeling techniques (such as
reliability block diagrams, fault trees, Markov chains, etc.) and analysis
techniques (such as mathematical analytical methods, simulation methods, and
formal methods). Apart from providing the necessary background, we also
critically evaluate the pros and cons of different approaches, and provide a
detailed survey of their applications in communication networks. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first in-depth review of the application of
reliability modeling and analysis techniques in communication networks.

collected more than 300,000 marijuana related tweets during November 2016 in
our study. Our text-mining based algorithms and data analysis unveil some
interesting patterns including: (i) users' attitudes (e.g., positive or
negative) can be characterized by the existence of outer links in a tweet; (ii)
67% users use their mobile phones to post their messages while many users
publish their messages using third-party automatic posting services; and (3)
the number of tweets during weekends is much higher than during weekdays. Our
data also showed the impact of the political events such as the U.S.
presidential election or state marijuana legalization votes on the
marijuana-related tweeting frequencies.

 <dc:description>  Reliable broadcasting data to multiple receivers over lossy wireless channels
is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the wireless link conditions.
Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) based retransmission schemes are bandwidth
inefficient due to data duplication at receivers. Network coding (NC) has been
shown to be a promising technique for improving network bandwidth efficiency by
combining multiple lost data packets for retransmission. However, it is
challenging to accurately determine which lost packets should be combined
together due to disrupted feedback channels. This paper proposes an adaptive
data encoding scheme at the transmitter by joining network coding and machine
learning (NCML) for retransmission of lost packets. Our proposed NCML extracts
the important features from historical feedback signals received by the
transmitter to train a classifier. The constructed classifier is then used to
predict states of transmitted data packets at different receivers based on
their corrupted feedback signals for effective data mixing. We have conducted
extensive simulations to collaborate the efficiency of our proposed approach.
The simulation results show that our machine learning algorithm can be trained
efficiently and accurately. The simulation results show that on average the
proposed NCML can correctly classify 90% of the states of transmitted data
packets at different receivers. It achieves significant bandwidth gain compared
with the ARQ and NC based schemes in different transmission terrains, power
levels, and the distances between the transmitter and receivers.

 <dc:description>  Color transfer between images uses the statistics information of image
effectively. We present a novel approach of local color transfer between images
based on the simple statistics and locally linear embedding. A sketching
interface is proposed for quickly and easily specifying the color
correspondences between target and source image. The user can specify the
correspondences of local region using scribes, which more accurately transfers
the target color to the source image while smoothly preserving the boundaries,
and exhibits more natural output results. Our algorithm is not restricted to
one-to-one image color transfer and can make use of more than one target images
to transfer the color in different regions in the source image. Moreover, our
algorithm does not require to choose the same color style and image size
between source and target images. We propose the sub-sampling to reduce the
computational load. Comparing with other approaches, our algorithm is much
better in color blending in the input data. Our approach preserves the other
color details in the source image. Various experimental results show that our
approach specifies the correspondences of local color region in source and
target images. And it expresses the intention of users and generates more
actual and natural results of visual effect.

 <dc:description>  Topic models (e.g., pLSA, LDA, sLDA) have been widely used for segmenting
imagery. However, these models are confined to crisp segmentation, forcing a
visual word (i.e., an image patch) to belong to one and only one topic. Yet,
there are many images in which some regions cannot be assigned a crisp
categorical label (e.g., transition regions between a foggy sky and the ground
or between sand and water at a beach). In these cases, a visual word is best
represented with partial memberships across multiple topics. To address this,
we present a partial membership latent Dirichlet allocation (PM-LDA) model and
an associated parameter estimation algorithm. This model can be useful for
imagery where a visual word may be a mixture of multiple topics. Experimental
results on visual and sonar imagery show that PM-LDA can produce both crisp and
soft semantic image segmentations; a capability previous topic modeling methods
do not have.

there are multiple marked elements. Our algorithm uses quadratically fewer
steps than a random walk on the grid, ignoring logarithmic factors. This is the
first known quantum walk that finds a marked element in a number of steps less
than the square-root of the extended hitting time. We also give a new tighter
upper bound on the extended hitting time of a marked subset, expressed in terms
of the hitting times of its members.

 <dc:description>  An existing hyperelastic membrane model for graphene calibrated from
ab-initio data (Kumar and Parks, 2014) is adapted to curvilinear coordinates
and extended to a rotation-free shell formulation based on isogeometric finite
elements. Therefore, the membrane model is extended by a hyperelastic bending
model that reflects the ab-inito data of Kudin et al. (2001). The proposed
formulation can be implemented straight-forwardly into an existing finite
element package, since it does not require the description of molecular
interactions. It thus circumvents the use of interatomic potentials that tend
to be less accurate than ab-initio data. The proposed shell formulation is
verified and analyzed by a set of simple test cases. The results are in
agreement to analytical solutions and satisfy the FE patch test. The
performance of the shell formulation for graphene structures is illustrated by
several numerical examples. The considered examples are indentation and peeling
of graphene and torsion, bending and axial stretch of carbon nanotubes.
Adhesive substrates are modeled by the Lennard-Jones potential and a coarse
grained contact model. In principle, the proposed formulation can be extended
to other 2D materials.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the issue of finding a good policy when the number of policy
updates is limited. This is done by approximating the expected policy reward as
a sequence of concave lower bounds which can be efficiently maximized,
drastically reducing the number of policy updates required to achieve good
performance. We also extend existing methods to negative rewards, enabling the
use of control variates.

 <dc:description>  Arabic is a widely-spoken language with a rich and long history spanning more
than fourteen centuries. Yet existing Arabic corpora largely focus on the
modern period or lack sufficient diachronic information. We develop a
large-scale, historical corpus of Arabic of about 1 billion words from diverse
periods of time. We clean this corpus, process it with a morphological
analyzer, and enhance it by detecting parallel passages and automatically
dating undated texts. We demonstrate its utility with selected case-studies in
which we show its application to the digital humanities.

 <dc:title>Here's My Point: Joint Pointer Architecture for Argument Mining</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  One of the major goals in automated argumentation mining is to uncover the
argument structure present in argumentative text. In order to determine this
structure, one must understand how different individual components of the
overall argument are linked. General consensus in this field dictates that the
argument components form a hierarchy of persuasion, which manifests itself in a
tree structure. This work provides the first neural network-based approach to
argumentation mining, focusing on the two tasks of extracting links between
argument components, and classifying types of argument components. In order to
solve this problem, we propose to use a joint model that is based on a Pointer
Network architecture. A Pointer Network is appealing for this task for the
following reasons: 1) It takes into account the sequential nature of argument
components; 2) By construction, it enforces certain properties of the tree
structure present in argument relations; 3) The hidden representations can be
applied to auxiliary tasks. In order to extend the contribution of the original
Pointer Network model, we construct a joint model that simultaneously attempts
to learn the type of argument component, as well as continuing to predict links
between argument components. The proposed joint model achieves state-of-the-art
results on two separate evaluation corpora, achieving far superior performance
than a regular Pointer Network model. Our results show that optimizing for both
tasks, and adding a fully-connected layer prior to recurrent neural network
input, is crucial for high performance.

 <dc:description>  Digital predistortion (DPD) is a widely adopted baseband processing technique
in current radio transmitters. While DPD can effectively suppress unwanted
spurious spectrum emissions stemming from imperfections of analog RF and
baseband electronics, it also introduces extra processing complexity and poses
challenges on efficient and flexible implementations, especially for mobile
cellular transmitters, considering their limited computing power compared to
basestations. In this paper, we present high data rate implementations of
broadband DPD on modern embedded processors, such as mobile GPU and multicore
CPU, by taking advantage of emerging parallel computing techniques for
exploiting their computing resources. We further verify the suppression effect
of DPD experimentally on real radio hardware platforms. Performance evaluation
results of our DPD design demonstrate the high efficacy of modern general
purpose mobile processors on accelerating DPD processing for a mobile
transmitter.

 <dc:title>Signal to noise in matching markets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weinberg, S. Matthew</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zou, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many matching markets, one side &quot;applies&quot; to the other, and these
applications are often expensive and time-consuming (e.g. students applying to
college). It is tempting to think that making the application process easier
should benefit both sides of the market. After all, the applicants could submit
more applications, and the recipients would have more applicants to choose
from. In this paper, we propose and analyze a simple model to understand
settings where both sides of the market suffer from increased number of
applications.
  The main insights of the paper are derived from quantifying the signal to
noise tradeoffs in random matchings, as applications provide a signal of the
applicants' preferences. When applications are costly the signal is stronger,
as the act of making an application itself is meaningful. Therefore more
applications may yield potentially better matches, but fewer applications
create stronger signals for the receiving side to learn true preferences.
  We derive analytic characterizations of the expected quality of stable
matchings in a simple utility model where applicants have an overall quality,
but also synergy with specific possible partners. Our results show how reducing
application cost without introducing an effective signaling mechanism might
lead to inefficiencies for both sides of the market.

 <dc:description>  Kernel fusion is a popular and effective approach for combining multiple
features that characterize different aspects of data. Traditional approaches
for Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) attempt to learn the parameters for
combining the kernels through sophisticated optimization procedures. In this
paper, we propose an alternative approach that creates dense embeddings for
data using the kernel similarities and adopts a deep neural network
architecture for fusing the embeddings. In order to improve the effectiveness
of this network, we introduce the kernel dropout regularization strategy
coupled with the use of an expanded set of composition kernels. Experiment
results on a real-world activity recognition dataset show that the proposed
architecture is effective in fusing kernels and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

 <dc:creator>Salem, Fathi M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a model of a basic recurrent neural network (or bRNN) that
includes a separate linear term with a slightly &quot;stable&quot; fixed matrix to
guarantee bounded solutions and fast dynamic response. We formulate a state
space viewpoint and adapt the constrained optimization Lagrange Multiplier
(CLM) technique and the vector Calculus of Variations (CoV) to derive the
(stochastic) gradient descent. In this process, one avoids the commonly used
re-application of the circular chain-rule and identifies the error
back-propagation with the co-state backward dynamic equations. We assert that
this bRNN can successfully perform regression tracking of time-series.
Moreover, the &quot;vanishing and exploding&quot; gradients are explicitly quantified and
explained through the co-state dynamics and the update laws. The adapted CoV
framework, in addition, can correctly and principally integrate new loss
functions in the network on any variable and for varied goals, e.g., for
supervised learning on the outputs and unsupervised learning on the internal
(hidden) states.

 <dc:description>  Prior studies on covert communication with noise uncertainty adopted a
worst-case approach from the warden's perspective. That is, the worst-case
detection performance of the warden is used to assess covertness, which is
overly optimistic. Instead of simply considering the worst limit, in this work,
we take the distribution of noise uncertainty into account to evaluate the
overall covertness in a statistical sense. Specifically, we define new metrics
for measuring the covertness, which are then adopted to analyze the maximum
achievable rate for a given covertness requirement under both bounded and
unbounded noise uncertainty models.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a distributed convex optimization problem with
inequality constraints over time-varying unbalanced digraphs, where the cost
function is a sum of local objectives, and each node of the graph only knows
its local objective and inequality constraints. Although there is a vast
literature on distributed optimization, most of them require the graph to be
balanced, which is quite restrictive and not necessary. Very recently, the
unbalanced problem has been resolved only for either time-invariant graphs or
unconstrained optimization. This work addresses the unbalancedness by focusing
on an epigraph form of the constrained optimization. A striking feature is that
this novel idea can be easily used to study time-varying unbalanced digraphs.
Under local communications, a simple iterative algorithm is then designed for
each node. We prove that if the graph is uniformly jointly strongly connected,
each node asymptotically converges to some common optimal solution.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new paradigm to investigate unsupervised learning, reducing
unsupervised learning to supervised learning. Specifically, we mitigate the
subjectivity in unsupervised decision-making by leveraging knowledge acquired
from prior, possibly heterogeneous, supervised learning tasks. We demonstrate
the versatility of our framework via comprehensive expositions and detailed
experiments on several unsupervised problems such as (a) clustering, (b)
outlier detection, and (c) similarity prediction under a common umbrella of
meta-unsupervised-learning. We also provide rigorous PAC-agnostic bounds to
establish the theoretical foundations of our framework, and show that our
framing of meta-clustering circumvents Kleinberg's impossibility theorem for
clustering.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we extend the geometric descent method recently proposed by
Bubeck, Lee and Singh to tackle nonsmooth and strongly convex composite
problems. We prove that our proposed algorithm, dubbed geometric proximal
gradient method (GeoPG), converges with a linear rate $(1-1/\sqrt{\kappa})$ and
thus achieves the optimal rate among first-order methods, where $\kappa$ is the
condition number of the problem. Numerical results on linear regression and

favorably with Nesterov's accelerated proximal gradient method, especially when

 <dc:title>Deep Learning and Hierarchal Generative Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mossel, Elchanan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new prism for studying deep learning motivated by connections
between deep learning and evolution. We hypothesize that deep learning is
efficient in learning data from &quot;generative hierarchal models&quot;. Our main
contributions are:
  1. We introduce of a sequence of increasingly complex hierarchical generative
models which interpolate between standard Markov models on trees (phylogenetic
models) and novel models which encapsulate interaction between features and
change of representation, two keys features empirically observed in deep
learning.
  2. Formal definitions of classes of algorithms that are not deep.
  3. Rigorous proofs showing that classes of algorithms that are not deep are
information theoretically much weaker than optimal &quot;deep&quot; learning algorithms.
In our models, deep learning is performed efficiently and proven to classify
correctly with high probability.
  All of the models and results are in the semi-supervised setting. Some open
problems and future directions are presented.

 <dc:description>  The cloud computing model is rapidly transforming the IT landscape. Cloud
computing is a new computing paradigm that delivers computing resources as a
set of reliable and scalable internet-based services allowing customers to
remotely run and manage these services. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) is
one of the popular cloud computing services. IaaS allows customers to increase
their computing resources on the fly without investing in new hardware. IaaS
adapts virtualization to enable on-demand access to a pool of virtual computing
resources. Although there are great benefits to be gained from cloud computing,
cloud computing also enables new categories of threats to be introduced. These
threats are a result of the cloud virtual infrastructure complexity created by
the adoption of the virtualization technology.
  Breaching the security of any component in the cloud virtual infrastructure
significantly impacts on the security of other components and consequently
affects the overall system security. This paper explores the security problem
of the cloud platform virtual infrastructure identifying the existing security
threats and the complexities of this virtual infrastructure. The paper also
discusses the existing security approaches to secure the cloud virtual
infrastructure and their drawbacks. Finally, we propose and explore some key
research challenges of implementing new virtualization-aware security solutions
that can provide the pre-emptive protection for complex and ever- dynamic cloud
virtual infrastructure.

 <dc:description>  Summary: Abstracts in biomedical articles can provide a quick overview of the
articles but detailed information cannot be obtained without reading full-text
contents. Full-text articles certainly generate more information and contents;
however, accessing full-text documents is usually time consuming. Condensedly
is a web-based application, which provides readers an easy and efficient way to
access full-text paragraphs using sentences in abstracts as fishing bait to
retrieve the big fish reside in full-text. Condensedly is based on the
paragraph ranking algorithm, which evaluates and ranks full-text paragraphs
based on their association scores with sentences in abstracts.

 <dc:title>TDSelector: A Training Data Selection Method for Cross-Project Defect
  Prediction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In recent years, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) attracted much
attention and has been validated as a feasible way to address the problem of
local data sparsity in newly created or inactive software projects.
Unfortunately, the performance of CPDP is usually poor, and low quality
training data selection has been regarded as a major obstacle to achieving
better prediction results. To the best of our knowledge, most of existing
approaches related to this topic are only based on instance similarity.
Therefore, the objective of this work is to propose an improved training data
selection method for CPDP that considers both similarity and the number of
defects each training instance has (denoted by defects), which is referred to
as TDSelector, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our
experiments were conducted on 14 projects (including 15 data sets) collected
from two public repositories. The results indicate that, in a specific CPDP
scenario, the TDSelector-based bug predictor performs, on average, better than
those based on the baseline methods, and the AUC (area under ROC curve) values
are increased by up to 10.6 and 4.3%, respectively. Besides, an additional
experiment shows that selecting those instances with more bugs directly as
training data can further improve the performance of the bug predictor trained
by our method.

 <dc:title>Phase Retrieval Via Reweighted Wirtinger Flow</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Phase retrieval(PR) problem is a kind of ill-condition inverse problem which
is arising in various of applications. Based on the Wirtinger flow(WF) method,
a reweighted Wirtinger flow(RWF) method is proposed to deal with PR problem.
RWF finds the global optimum by solving a series of sub-PR problems with
changing weights. Theoretical analyses illustrate that the RWF has a geometric
convergence from a deliberate initialization when the weights are bounded by 1
and $\frac{10}{9}$. Numerical testing shows RWF has a lower sampling complexity
compared with WF. As an essentially adaptive truncated Wirtinger flow(TWF)
method, RWF performs better than TWF especially when the ratio between sampling
number $m$ and length of signal $n$ is small.

 <dc:title>Active Hypothesis Testing on A Tree: Anomaly Detection under

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of detecting a few anomalous processes among a large number of
$M$ processes is considered. At each time, aggregated observations can be taken
from a chosen subset of processes, where the chosen subset conforms to a given
binary tree structure. The random observations are i.i.d. over time with a
general distribution that may depend on the size of the chosen subset and the
number of anomalous processes in the subset. The objective is a sequential
search strategy that minimizes the sample complexity (i.e., the expected number
of observations which represents detection delay) subject to a reliability
constraint. A sequential test that results in a biased random walk on the tree
is developed and is shown to be asymptotically optimal in terms of detection
accuracy. Furthermore, it achieves the optimal logarithmic-order sample
complexity in $M$ provided that the Kullback-Liebler divergence between
aggregated observations in the presence and the absence of anomalous processes
are bounded away from zero at all levels of the tree structure as $M$
approaches infinity. Sufficient conditions on the decaying rate of the
aggregated observations to pure noise under which a sublinear scaling in $M$ is
preserved are also identified for the Bernoulli case.

 <dc:description>  We consider a cache network in which a single server is connected to multiple
users via a shared error free link. The server has access to a database with
$N$ files of equal length $F$, and serves $K$ users each with a cache memory of
$MF$ bits. A novel centralized coded caching scheme is proposed for scenarios
with more users than files $N\leq K$ and cache capacities satisfying
$\frac{1}{K}\leq M\leq\frac{N}{K}$. The proposed scheme outperforms the best
rate-memory region known in the literature if $N\leq K\leq\frac{N^{2}+1}{2}$.

 <dc:title>Selecting Bases in Spectral learning of Predictive State Representations
  via Model Entropy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Yunlong</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Predictive State Representations (PSRs) are powerful techniques for modelling
dynamical systems, which represent a state as a vector of predictions about
future observable events (tests). In PSRs, one of the fundamental problems is
the learning of the PSR model of the underlying system. Recently, spectral
methods have been successfully used to address this issue by treating the
learning problem as the task of computing an singular value decomposition (SVD)
over a submatrix of a special type of matrix called the Hankel matrix. Under
the assumptions that the rows and columns of the submatrix of the Hankel Matrix
are sufficient~(which usually means a very large number of rows and columns,
and almost fails in practice) and the entries of the matrix can be estimated
accurately, it has been proven that the spectral approach for learning PSRs is
statistically consistent and the learned parameters can converge to the true
parameters. However, in practice, due to the limit of the computation ability,
only a finite set of rows or columns can be chosen to be used for the spectral
learning. While different sets of columns usually lead to variant accuracy of
the learned model, in this paper, we propose an approach for selecting the set
of columns, namely basis selection, by adopting a concept of model entropy to
measure the accuracy of the learned model. Experimental results are shown to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>A Constant Optimization of the Binary Indexed Tree Query Operation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Baweja, Anubhav</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are several data structures which can calculate the prefix sums of an
array efficiently, while handling point updates on the array, such as Segment
Trees and Binary Indexed Trees (BIT). Both these data structures can handle the
these two operations (query and update) in $O(\log{n})$ time. In this paper, we
present a data structure similar to the BIT, but with an even smaller constant.
To do this, we use Zeckendorf's Theorem, a property of the Fibonacci sequence
of numbers. The new data structure achieves the same complexity of
$O(\log{n})$, but requires about $\log_{\phi^{2}} n$ computations for the Query
Operation as opposed to the $\log_{2} n$ computations required for a BIT Query
Operation in the worst case.

 <dc:title>Efficient isogeometric thin shell formulations for soft biological

 <dc:description>  This paper presents three different constitutive approaches to model thin
rotation-free shells based on the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis. One approach is
based on numerical integration through the shell thickness while the other two
approaches do not need any numerical integration and so they are
computationally more efficient. The formulation is designed for large
deformations and allows for geometrical and material nonlinearities, which
makes it very suitable for the modeling of soft tissues. Furthermore, six
different isotropic and anisotropic material models, which are commonly used to
model soft biological materials, are examined for the three proposed
constitutive approaches. Following an isogeometric approach, NURBS-based finite
elements are used for the discretization of the shell surface. Several
numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the capabilities of the
formulation. Those include the contact simulation during balloon angioplasty.

 <dc:description>  There is a common observation that audio event classification is easier to
deal with than detection. So far, this observation has been accepted as a fact
and we lack of a careful analysis. In this paper, we reason the rationale
behind this fact and, more importantly, leverage them to benefit the audio
event detection task. We present an improved detection pipeline in which a
verification step is appended to augment a detection system. This step employs
a high-quality event classifier to postprocess the benign event hypotheses
outputted by the detection system and reject false alarms. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed pipeline, we implement and pair up different
event detectors based on the most common detection schemes and various event
classifiers, ranging from the standard bag-of-words model to the
state-of-the-art bank-of-regressors one. Experimental results on the ITC-Irst
dataset show significant improvements to detection performance. More
importantly, these improvements are consistent for all detector-classifier
combinations.

 <dc:description>  Rare events have played an increasing role in molecular phylogenetics as
potentially homoplasy-poor characters.In this contribution we analyze the
phylogenetic information content from a combinatorial point of view by
consid-ering the binary relation on the set of taxa defined by the existence of
a single event separating two taxa. We showthat the graph-representation of
this relation must be a tree. Moreover, we characterize completely the
relationshipbetween the tree of such relations and the underlying phylogenetic
tree. With directed operations such as tandem-duplication-random-loss events in
mind we demonstrate how non-symmetric information constrains the position ofthe
root in the partially reconstructed phylogeny.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces optimally-blended quadrature rules for isogeometric
analysis and analyzes the numerical dispersion of the resulting
discretizations. To quantify the approximation errors when we modify the inner
products, we generalize the Pythagorean eigenvalue theorem of Strang and Fix.
The proposed blended quadrature rules have advantages over alternative
integration rules for isogeometric analysis on uniform and non-uniform meshes
as well as for different polynomial orders and continuity of the basis. The
optimally-blended schemes improve the convergence rate of the method by two
orders with respect to the fully-integrated Galerkin method. The proposed
technique increases the accuracy and robustness of isogeometric analysis for
wave propagation problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a method is presented for lowering the energy consumption
and/or increasing the speed of a standard manipulator spray painting a surface.
The approach is based on the observation that a small angle between the spray
direction and the surface normal does not affect the quality of the paint job.
Recent results in set-based kinematic control are utilized to develop a
switched control system, where this angle is defined as a set-based task with a
maximum allowed limit. Four different set-based methods are implemented and
tested on a UR5 manipulator from Universal Robots. Experimental results verify
the correctness of the method, and demonstrate that the set-based approaches
can substantially lower the paint time and energy consumption compared to the
current standard solution.

 <dc:description>  Energy disaggregation (a.k.a nonintrusive load monitoring, NILM), a
single-channel blind source separation problem, aims to decompose the mains
which records the whole house electricity consumption into appliance-wise
readings. This problem is difficult because it is inherently unidentifiable.
Recent approaches have shown that the identifiability problem could be reduced
by introducing domain knowledge into the model. Deep neural networks have been
shown to be a promising approach for these problems, but sliding windows are
necessary to handle the long sequences which arise in signal processing
problems, which raises issues about how to combine predictions from different
sliding windows. In this paper, we propose sequence-to-point learning, where
the input is a window of the mains and the output is a single point of the
target appliance. We use convolutional neural networks to train the model.
Interestingly, we systematically show that the convolutional neural networks
can inherently learn the signatures of the target appliances, which are
automatically added into the model to reduce the identifiability problem. We
applied the proposed neural network approaches to real-world household energy
data, and show that the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving
two standard error measures by 84% and 92%.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a novel Neural Network algorithm for conducting
semi-supervised learning for sequence labeling tasks arranged in a
linguistically motivated hierarchy. This relationship is exploited to
regularise the representations of supervised tasks by backpropagating the error
of the unsupervised task through the supervised tasks. We introduce a neural
network where lower layers are supervised by junior downstream tasks and the
final layer task is an auxiliary unsupervised task. The architecture shows
improvements of up to two percentage points F1 for Chunking compared to a

 <dc:description>  Supervised learning tends to produce more accurate classifiers than
unsupervised learning in general. This implies that training data is preferred
with annotations. When addressing visual perception challenges, such as
localizing certain object classes within an image, the learning of the involved
classifiers turns out to be a practical bottleneck. The reason is that, at
least, we have to frame object examples with bounding boxes in thousands of
images. A priori, the more complex the model is regarding its number of
parameters, the more annotated examples are required. This annotation task is
performed by human oracles, which ends up in inaccuracies and errors in the
annotations (aka ground truth) since the task is inherently very cumbersome and
sometimes ambiguous. As an alternative we have pioneered the use of virtual
worlds for collecting such annotations automatically and with high precision.
However, since the models learned with virtual data must operate in the real
world, we still need to perform domain adaptation (DA). In this chapter we
revisit the DA of a deformable part-based model (DPM) as an exemplifying case
of virtual- to-real-world DA. As a use case, we address the challenge of
vehicle detection for driver assistance, using different publicly available
virtual-world data. While doing so, we investigate questions such as: how does
the domain gap behave due to virtual-vs-real data with respect to dominant
object appearance per domain, as well as the role of photo-realism in the
virtual world.

 <dc:description>  We consider a dynamical process in a network which distributes all particles
(tokens) located at a node among its neighbors, in a round-robin manner.
  We show that in the recurrent state of this dynamics (i.e., disregarding a
polynomially long initialization phase of the system), the number of particles
located on a given edge, averaged over an interval of time, is tightly
concentrated around the average particle density in the system. Formally, for a
system of $k$ particles in a graph of $m$ edges, during any interval of length
$T$, this time-averaged value is $k/m \pm \widetilde{O}(1/T)$, whenever
$\gcd(m,k) = \widetilde{O}(1)$ (and so, e.g., whenever $m$ is a prime number).
To achieve these bounds, we link the behavior of the studied dynamics to
ergodic properties of traversals based on Eulerian circuits on a symmetric
directed graph. These results are proved through sum set methods and are likely
to be of independent interest.
  As a corollary, we also obtain bounds on the \emph{idleness} of the studied
dynamics, i.e., on the longest possible time between two consecutive
appearances of a token on an edge, taken over all edges. Designing trajectories
for $k$ tokens in a way which minimizes idleness is fundamental to the study of
the patrolling problem in networks. Our results immediately imply a bound of
$\widetilde{O}(m/k)$ on the idleness of the studied process, showing that it is
a distributed $\widetilde{O}(1)$-competitive solution to the patrolling task,
for all of the covered cases. Our work also provides some further insights that
may be interesting in load-balancing applications.

 <dc:description>  Traditional speech enhancement techniques modify the magnitude of a speech in
time-frequency domain, and use the phase of a noisy speech to resynthesize a
time domain speech. This work proposes a complex-valued Gaussian process latent
variable model (CGPLVM) to enhance directly the complex-valued noisy spectrum,
modifying not only the magnitude but also the phase. The main idea that
underlies the developed method is the modeling of short-time Fourier transform
(STFT) coefficients across the time frames of a speech as a proper complex
Gaussian process (GP) with noise added. The proposed method is based on
projecting the spectrum into a low-dimensional subspace. The likelihood
criterion is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model. Experiments
were carried out on the CHTTL database, which contains the digits zero to nine
in Mandarin. Several standard measures are used to demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  Graph similarity search has received considerable attention in many
applications, such as bioinformatics, data mining, pattern recognition, and
social networks. Existing methods for this problem have limited scalability
because of the huge amount of memory they consume when handling very large
graph databases with millions or billions of graphs.
  In this paper, we study the problem of graph similarity search under the
graph edit distance constraint. We present a space-efficient index structure
based upon the q-gram tree that incorporates succinct data structures and
hybrid encoding to achieve improved query time performance with minimal space
usage. Specifically, the space usage of our index requires only 5%-15% of the
previous state-of-the-art indexing size on the tested data while at the same
time achieving 2-3 times acceleration in query time with small data sets. We
also boost the query performance by augmenting the global filter with range
search, which allows us to perform a query in a reduced region. In addition, we
propose two effective filters that combine degree structures and label
structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach is
superior in space and competitive in filtering to the state-of-the-art
approaches. To the best of our knowledge, our index is the first in-memory
index for this problem that successfully scales to cope with the large dataset
of 25 million chemical structure graphs from the PubChem dataset.

 <dc:title>The interplay between system identification and machine learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Learning from examples is one of the key problems in science and engineering.
It deals with function reconstruction from a finite set of direct and noisy
samples. Regularization in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) is widely
used to solve this task and includes powerful estimators such as regularization
networks. Recent achievements include the proof of the statistical consistency
of these kernel- based approaches. Parallel to this, many different system
identification techniques have been developed but the interaction with machine
learning does not appear so strong yet. One reason is that the RKHSs usually
employed in machine learning do not embed the information available on dynamic
systems, e.g. BIBO stability. In addition, in system identification the
independent data assumptions routinely adopted in machine learning are never
satisfied in practice. This paper provides new results which strengthen the
connection between system identification and machine learning. Our starting
point is the introduction of RKHSs of dynamic systems. They contain functionals
over spaces defined by system inputs and allow to interpret system
identification as learning from examples. In both linear and nonlinear
settings, it is shown that this perspective permits to derive in a relatively
simple way conditions on RKHS stability (i.e. the property of containing only
BIBO stable systems or predictors), also facilitating the design of new kernels
for system identification. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the
regularized estimator to the optimal predictor under conditions typical of
dynamic systems.

 <dc:description>  Real-world image recognition systems need to recognize tens of thousands of
classes that constitute a plethora of visual concepts. The traditional approach
of annotating thousands of images per class for training is infeasible in such
a scenario, prompting the use of webly supervised data. This paper explores the
training of image-recognition systems on large numbers of images and associated
user comments. In particular, we develop visual n-gram models that can predict
arbitrary phrases that are relevant to the content of an image. Our visual
n-gram models are feed-forward convolutional networks trained using new loss
functions that are inspired by n-gram models commonly used in language
modeling. We demonstrate the merits of our models in phrase prediction,
phrase-based image retrieval, relating images and captions, and zero-shot
transfer.

 <dc:description>  Comparison of two numbers in RNS systems is a challenging task. In this
paper, a new algorithm to compare the magnitude of two RNS numbers, using a
clustering method has been proposed. In the clustering process, each inputted
number is assigned to a cluster. To compare the magnitude of two numbers, first
the clusters of these numbers and their differences are obtained. Then by
comparing these clusters, the relative magnitude of two numbers is determined.
All of these processes are performed in RNS system without converting numbers
to the binary system.

 <dc:description>  The weighted entropy $H^{\rm w}_\phi (X)=H^{\rm w}_\phi (f)$ of a random
variable $X$ with values $x$ and a probability-mass/density function $f$ is
defined as the mean value ${\mathbb E} I^{\rm w}_\phi(X)$ of the weighted
information $I^{\rm w}_\phi (x)=-\phi (x)\log\,f(x)$. Here $x\mapsto\phi
(x)\in{\mathbb R}$ is a given weight function (WF) indicating a 'value' of
outcome $x$. For an $n$-component random vector
${\mathbf{X}}_0^{n-1}=(X_0,\ldots ,X_{n-1})$ produced by a random process
${\mathbf{X}}=(X_i,i\in{\mathbb Z})$, the weighted information $I^{\rm
w}_{\phi_n}({\mathbf x}_0^{n-1})$ and weighted entropy $H^{\rm
w}_{\phi_n}({\mathbf{X}}_0^{n-1})$ are defined similarly, with an WF
$\phi_n({\mathbf x}_0^{n-1})$. Two types of WFs $\phi_n$ are considered, based
on additive and a multiplicative forms ($\phi_n({\mathbf
x}_0^{n-1})=\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}{\varphi} (x_i)$ and $\phi_n({\mathbf
x}_0^{n-1})=\prod\limits_{i=0}^{n-1}{\varphi} (x_i)$, respectively). The focus
is upon ${\it rates}$ of the weighted entropy and information, regarded as
parameters related to ${\mathbf{X}}$. We show that, in the context of
ergodicity, a natural scale for an asymptotically additive/multiplicative WF is
$\frac{1}{n^2}H^{\rm w}_{\phi_n}({\mathbf{X}}_0^{n-1})$ and
$\frac{1}{n}\log\;H^{\rm w}_{\phi_n}({\mathbf{X}}_0^{n-1})$, respectively. This
gives rise to ${\it primary}$ ${\it rates}$. The next-order terms can also be
identified, leading to ${\it secondary}$ ${\it rates}$. We also consider
emerging generalisations of the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem.

 <dc:title>A Unified Approach to Analyzing Asynchronous Coordinate Descent and
  Tatonnement</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper concerns asynchrony in iterative processes, focusing on gradient
descent and tatonnement, a fundamental price dynamic.
  Gradient descent is an important class of iterative algorithms for minimizing
convex functions. Classically, gradient descent has been a sequential and
synchronous process, although distributed and asynchronous variants have been
studied since the 1980s. Coordinate descent is a commonly studied version of
gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on asynchronous coordinate descent on
convex functions $F:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ of the form $F(x) = f(x)
+ \sum_{k=1}^n \Psi_k(x_k)$, where $f:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a
smooth convex function, and each $\Psi_k:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a
univariate and possibly non-smooth convex function. Such functions occur in
many data analysis and machine learning problems.
  We give new analyses of cyclic coordinate descent, a parallel asynchronous
stochastic coordinate descent, and a rather general worst-case parallel
asynchronous coordinate descent. For all of these, we either obtain sharply
improved bounds, or provide the first analyses. Our analyses all use a common
amortized framework. The application of this framework to the asynchronous
stochastic version requires some new ideas, for it is not obvious how to ensure
a uniform distribution where it is needed in the face of asynchronous actions
that may undo uniformity. We believe that our approach may well be applicable
to the analysis of other iterative asynchronous stochastic processes.
  We extend the framework to show that an asynchronous version of tatonnement,
a fundamental price dynamic widely studied in general equilibrium theory,
converges toward a market equilibrium for Fisher markets with CES utilities or
Leontief utilities, for which tatonnement is equivalent to coordinate descent.

and their behavior under certain quotients. We illustrate the power of our
ideas in a new modular normal form algorithm for modules over rings of
integers, vastly outperforming classical algorithms.

 <dc:description>  All methodologies for detecting plagiarism to date have focused on the final
digital &quot;outcome&quot;, such as a document or source code. Our novel approach takes
the creation process into account using logged events collected by special
software or by the macro recorders found in most office applications. We look
at an author's interaction logs with the software used to create the work.
Detection relies on comparing the histograms of multiple logs' command use. A
work is classified as plagiarism if its log deviates too much from logs of
&quot;honestly created&quot; works or if its log is too similar to another log. The
technique supports the detection of plagiarism for digital outcomes that stem
from \emph{unique} tasks, such as theses and \emph{equal} tasks such as
assignments for which the same problem sets are solved by multiple students.
Focusing on the latter case, we evaluate this approach using logs collected by
an interactive development environment (IDE) from more than sixty students who
completed three programming assignments.

 <dc:description>  We propose a localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, which is
simple in design, does not involve significant overhead and yet provides
acceptable position estimates of sensor nodes. The algorithm uses settled nodes
as beacon nodes so as to increase the number of beacon nodes. The algorithm is
range free and does not need any additional piece of hardware for ranging. It
also does not involve any significant communication overhead for localization.
The simulation and results show that good localization accuracy is achieved for
outdoor environments.

 <dc:description>  Results are presented for optimizing device-to-device communications in
cellular networks, while maintaining spectral efficiency of the
base-station-to-device downlink channel. We build upon established and tested
stochastic geometry models of signal-to-interference ratio in wireless networks
based on the Poisson point process, which incorporate random propagation
effects such as fading and shadowing. A key result is a simple formula,
allowing one to optimize the device-to-device spatial throughput by suitably
adjusting the proportion of active devices. These results can lead to further
investigation as they can be immediately applied to more sophisticated models
such as studying multi-tier network models to address coverage in closed access
networks.

 <dc:title>Quantum Clustering and Gaussian Mixtures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The mixture of Gaussian distributions, a soft version of k-means , is
considered a state-of-the-art clustering algorithm. It is widely used in
computer vision for selecting classes, e.g., color, texture, and shapes. In
this algorithm, each class is described by a Gaussian distribution, defined by
its mean and covariance. The data is described by a weighted sum of these
Gaussian distributions. We propose a new method, inspired by quantum
interference in physics. Instead of modeling each class distribution directly,
we model a class wave function such that its magnitude square is the class
Gaussian distribution. We then mix the class wave functions to create the
mixture wave function. The final mixture distribution is then the magnitude
square of the mixture wave function. As a result, we observe the quantum class
interference phenomena, not present in the Gaussian mixture model. We show that
the quantum method outperforms the Gaussian mixture method in every aspect of
the estimations. It provides more accurate estimations of all distribution
parameters, with much less fluctuations, and it is also more robust to data
deformations from the Gaussian assumptions. We illustrate our method for color
segmentation as an example application.

 <dc:description>  Despite of the pain and limited accuracy of blood tests for early recognition
of cardiovascular disease, they dominate risk screening and triage. On the
other hand, heart rate variability is non-invasive and cheap, but not
considered accurate enough for clinical practice. Here, we tackle heart beat
interval based classification with deep learning. We introduce an end to end
differentiable hybrid architecture, consisting of a layer of biological neuron
models of cardiac dynamics (modified FitzHugh Nagumo neurons) and several
layers of a standard feed-forward neural network. The proposed model is
evaluated on ECGs from 474 stable at-risk (coronary artery disease) patients,
and 1172 chest pain patients of an emergency department. We show that it can
significantly outperform models based on traditional heart rate variability
predictors, as well as approaching or in some cases outperforming clinical
blood tests, based only on 60 seconds of inter-beat intervals.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present an algorithm for composing monophonic melodies
similar in style to those of a given, phrase annotated, sample of melodies. For
implementation, a hybrid approach incorporating parametric Markov models of
higher order and a contour concept of phrases is used. This work is based on
the master thesis of Thayabaran Kathiresan (2015). An online listening test
conducted shows that enhancing a pure Markov model with musically relevant

significantly.

 <dc:title>Joint Channel Estimation and Nonlinear Distortion Compensation in OFDM
  Receivers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhidkov, Sergey V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Nonlinear distortion in power amplifiers (PA) can significantly degrade
performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) communication
systems. This paper presents a joint maximum-likelihood channel frequency
response and nonlinear PA model estimator for OFDM signals. Derivation of the
estimator is based on Taylor-series representation of power amplifier
nonlinearity and is suitable for wide range of memoryless PA models. A
sub-optimal decision-aided algorithm for adaptive compensation of nonlinear
distortion effects at the receiver-side is also presented. It is shown that the
proposed algorithms can be used in IEEE 802.11a/g/p/ac compliant wireless LAN
receivers without any modifications at the transmitter side. The performance of
the proposed algorithms is studied by means of computer simulation.

 <dc:description>  We show that the distillable coherence---which is equal to the relative
entropy of coherence---is, up to a constant factor, always bounded by the
$\ell_1$-norm measure of coherence (defined as the sum of absolute values of
off diagonals). Thus the latter plays a similar role as logarithmic negativity
plays in entanglement theory and this is the best operational interpretation
from a resource-theoretic viewpoint. Consequently the two measures are
intimately connected to another operational measure, the robustness of
coherence. We find also relationships between these measures, which are tight
for general states, and the tightest possible for pure and qubit states. For a
given robustness, we construct a state having minimum distillable coherence.

 <dc:title>Lifted Relational Algebra with Recursion and Connections to Modal Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We propose a new formalism for specifying and reasoning about problems that
involve heterogeneous &quot;pieces of information&quot; -- large collections of data,
decision procedures of any kind and complexity and connections between them.
The essence of our proposal is to lift Codd's relational algebra from
operations on relational tables to operations on classes of structures (with
recursion), and to add a direction of information propagation. We observe the
presence of information propagation in several formalisms for efficient
reasoning and use it to express unary negation and operations used in graph
databases. We carefully analyze several reasoning tasks and establish a precise
connection between a generalized query evaluation and temporal logic model
checking. Our development allows us to reveal a general correspondence between
classical and modal logics and may shed a new light on the good computational
properties of modal logics and related formalisms.

 <dc:title>Conditional Central Limit Theorems for Gaussian Projections</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Reeves, Galen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Statistics Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the question of when projections of a high-dimensional
random vector are approximately Gaussian. This problem has been studied
previously in the context of high-dimensional data analysis, where the focus is
on low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional point clouds. The focus of
this paper is on the typical behavior when the projections are generated by an
i.i.d. Gaussian projection matrix. The main results are bounds on the deviation
between the conditional distribution of the projections and a Gaussian
approximation, where the conditioning is on the projection matrix. The bounds
are given in terms of the quadratic Wasserstein distance and relative entropy
and are stated explicitly as a function of the number of projections and
certain key properties of the random vector. The proof uses Talagrand's
transportation inequality and a general integral-moment inequality for mutual
information. Applications to random linear estimation and compressed sensing
are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Localization is a key requirement for mobile robot autonomy and human-robot
interaction. Vision-based localization is accurate and flexible, however, it
incurs a high computational burden which limits its application on many
resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we address the problem of
performing real-time localization in large-scale 3D point cloud maps of
ever-growing size. While most systems using multi-modal information reduce
localization time by employing side-channel information in a coarse manner (eg.
WiFi for a rough prior position estimate), we propose to inter-weave the map
with rich sensory data. This multi-modal approach achieves two key goals
simultaneously. First, it enables us to harness additional sensory data to
localise against a map covering a vast area in real-time; and secondly, it also
allows us to roughly localise devices which are not equipped with a camera. The
key to our approach is a localization policy based on a sequential Monte Carlo
estimator. The localiser uses this policy to attempt point-matching only in
nodes where it is likely to succeed, significantly increasing the efficiency of
the localization process. The proposed multi-modal localization system is
evaluated extensively in a large museum building. The results show that our
multi-modal approach not only increases the localization accuracy but
significantly reduces computational time.

 <dc:description>  Networks are a fundamental tool for modeling complex systems in a variety of
domains including social and communication networks as well as biology and
neuroscience. Small subgraph patterns in networks, called network motifs, are
crucial to understanding the structure and function of these systems. However,
the role of network motifs in temporal networks, which contain many timestamped
links between the nodes, is not yet well understood.
  Here we develop a notion of a temporal network motif as an elementary unit of
temporal networks and provide a general methodology for counting such motifs.
We define temporal network motifs as induced subgraphs on sequences of temporal
edges, design fast algorithms for counting temporal motifs, and prove their
runtime complexity. Our fast algorithms achieve up to 56.5x speedup compared to
a baseline method. Furthermore, we use our algorithms to count temporal motifs
in a variety of networks. Results show that networks from different domains
have significantly different motif counts, whereas networks from the same
domain tend to have similar motif counts. We also find that different motifs
occur at different time scales, which provides further insights into structure
and function of temporal networks.

  a novel approach based on analysis of graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work we continue the investigation of different approaches to
conception and modeling of composite materials. The global method we focus on,
is called 'stochastic homogenization'. In this approach, the classical
deterministic \emph{homogenization} techniques and procedures are used to
compute the macroscopic parameters of a composite starting from its microscopic
properties. The \emph{stochastic} part is due to averaging over some series of
samples, and the fact that these samples fit into the concept of RVE
(Representative Volume Element) in order to reduce the variance effect.
  In this article, we present a novel method for computation of effective
electric properties of composites -- it is based on the analysis of the
connectivity graph (and the respective adjacency matrix) for each sample of a
composite material. We describe how this matrix is constructed in order to take
into account complex microscopic geometry. We also explain what we mean by
homogenization procedure for electrical conductivity, and how the constructed
matrix is related to the problem. The developed method is applied to a test
study of the influence of micromorphology of composites materials on their
conductivity.

 <dc:description>  Discourse varies with age, education, psychiatric state and historical epoch,
but the ontogenetic and cultural dynamics of discourse structure remain to be
quantitatively characterized. To this end we investigated word graphs obtained
from verbal reports of 200 subjects ages 2-58, and 676 literary texts spanning
~5,000 years. In healthy subjects, lexical diversity, graph size, and
long-range recurrence departed from initial near-random levels through a
monotonic asymptotic increase across ages, while short-range recurrence showed
a corresponding decrease. These changes were explained by education and suggest
a hierarchical development of discourse structure: short-range recurrence and
lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, but graph size and
long-range recurrence only stabilize after high school. This gradual maturation
was blurred in psychotic subjects, who maintained in adulthood a near-random
structure. In literature, monotonic asymptotic changes over time were
remarkable: While lexical diversity, long-range recurrence and graph size
increased away from near-randomness, short-range recurrence declined, from
above to below random levels. Bronze Age texts are structurally similar to
childish or psychotic discourses, but subsequent texts converge abruptly to the
healthy adult pattern around the onset of the Axial Age (800-200 BC), a period
of pivotal cultural change. Thus, individually as well as historically,
discourse maturation increases the range of word recurrence away from
randomness.

 <dc:title>On Planar Greedy Drawings of 3-Connected Planar Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Da Lozzo, Giordano</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  A graph drawing is $\textit{greedy}$ if, for every ordered pair of vertices
$(x,y)$, there is a path from $x$ to $y$ such that the Euclidean distance to
$y$ decreases monotonically at every vertex of the path. Greedy drawings
support a simple geometric routing scheme, in which any node that has to send a
packet to a destination &quot;greedily&quot; forwards the packet to any neighbor that is
closer to the destination than itself, according to the Euclidean distance in
the drawing. In a greedy drawing such a neighbor always exists and hence this
routing scheme is guaranteed to succeed.
  In 2004 Papadimitriou and Ratajczak stated two conjectures related to greedy
drawings. The $\textit{greedy embedding conjecture}$ states that every
$3$-connected planar graph admits a greedy drawing. The $\textit{convex greedy
embedding conjecture}$ asserts that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a
planar greedy drawing in which the faces are delimited by convex polygons. In
2008 the greedy embedding conjecture was settled in the positive by Leighton
and Moitra.
  In this paper we prove that every $3$-connected planar graph admits a
$\textit{planar}$ greedy drawing. Apart from being a strengthening of Leighton
and Moitra's result, this theorem constitutes a natural intermediate step
towards a proof of the convex greedy embedding conjecture.

 <dc:title>Generalized Intersection Kernel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Ping</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Following the very recent line of work on the ``generalized min-max'' (GMM)
kernel, this study proposes the ``generalized intersection'' (GInt) kernel and
the related ``normalized generalized min-max'' (NGMM) kernel. In computer
vision, the (histogram) intersection kernel has been popular, and the GInt
kernel generalizes it to data which can have both negative and positive
entries. Through an extensive empirical classification study on 40 datasets
from the UCI repository, we are able to show that this (tuning-free) GInt
kernel performs fairly well.
  The empirical results also demonstrate that the NGMM kernel typically
outperforms the GInt kernel. Interestingly, the NGMM kernel has another
interpretation --- it is the ``asymmetrically transformed'' version of the GInt
kernel, based on the idea of ``asymmetric hashing''. Just like the GMM kernel,
the NGMM kernel can be efficiently linearized through (e.g.,) generalized
consistent weighted sampling (GCWS), as empirically validated in our study.
Owing to the discrete nature of hashed values, it also provides a scheme for
approximate near neighbor search.

 <dc:description>  Single flux quantum (SFQ) circuits form a natural neuromorphic technology
with SFQ pulses and superconducting transmission lines simulating action
potentials and axons, respectively. Here we present a new component, magnetic
Josephson junctions, that have a tunablility and re-configurability that was
lacking from previous SFQ neuromorphic circuits. The nanoscale magnetic
structure acts as a tunable synaptic constituent that modifies the junction
critical current. These circuits can operate near the thermal limit where
stochastic firing of the neurons is an essential component of the technology.
This technology has the ability to create complex neural systems with greater
than 10^21 neural firings per second with approximately 1 W dissipation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a general theory for studying the \xl{landscape} of nonconvex
\xl{optimization} with underlying symmetric structures \tz{for a class of
machine learning problems (e.g., low-rank matrix factorization, phase
retrieval, and deep linear neural networks)}. In specific, we characterize the
locations of stationary points and the null space of Hessian matrices \xl{of
the objective function} via the lens of invariant groups\removed{for associated
optimization problems, including low-rank matrix factorization, phase
retrieval, and deep linear neural networks}. As a major motivating example, we
apply the proposed general theory to characterize the global \xl{landscape} of
the \xl{nonconvex optimization in} low-rank matrix factorization problem. In
particular, we illustrate how the rotational symmetry group gives rise to
infinitely many nonisolated strict saddle points and equivalent global minima
of the objective function. By explicitly identifying all stationary points, we
divide the entire parameter space into three regions: ($\cR_1$) the region
containing the neighborhoods of all strict saddle points, where the objective
has negative curvatures; ($\cR_2$) the region containing neighborhoods of all
global minima, where the objective enjoys strong convexity along certain
directions; and ($\cR_3$) the complement of the above regions, where the
gradient has sufficiently large magnitudes. We further extend our result to the
matrix sensing problem. Such global landscape implies strong global convergence
guarantees for popular iterative algorithms with arbitrary initial solutions.

We design an algorithm that reads b bits of advice and achieves a competitive
ratio of (M/m)^(1/(2^b+1)) where M and m are the maximum and minimum price in

 <dc:description>  Semidefinite programs (SDPs) are a framework for exact or approximate
optimization that have widespread application in quantum information theory. We
introduce a new method for using reductions to construct integrality gaps for
SDPs. These are based on new limitations on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy
in approximating two particularly important sets in quantum information theory,
where previously no $\omega(1)$-round integrality gaps were known: the set of
separable (i.e. unentangled) states, or equivalently, the $2 \rightarrow 4$
norm of a matrix, and the set of quantum correlations; i.e. conditional
probability distributions achievable with local measurements on a shared
entangled state. In both cases no-go theorems were previously known based on
computational assumptions such as the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) which
asserts that 3-SAT requires exponential time to solve. Our unconditional
results achieve the same parameters as all of these previous results (for
separable states) or as some of the previous results (for quantum
correlations). In some cases we can make use of the framework of
Lee-Raghavendra-Steurer (LRS) to establish integrality gaps for any SDP, not
only the SoS hierarchy. Our hardness result on separable states also yields a
dimension lower bound of approximate disentanglers, answering a question of
Watrous and Aaronson et al. These results can be viewed as limitations on the
monogamy principle, the PPT test, the ability of Tsirelson-type bounds to
restrict quantum correlations, as well as the SDP hierarchies of
Doherty-Parrilo-Spedalieri, Navascues-Pironio-Acin and Berta-Fawzi-Scholz.

 <dc:description>  In the context of network dynamics, the complexity of systems increases
possible evolutionary paths that often are not deterministic. Occasionally,
some map routs form over the course of time which guide systems towards some
particular states. The main intention of this study is to discover an indicator
that can help predict these pseudo-deterministic paths in advance. Here we
investigate the dynamics of networks based on Heider balance theory that states
the tendency of systems towards decreasing tension. This inclination leads
systems to some local and global minimum tension states called &quot;jammed states&quot;
and &quot;balanced states&quot;, respectively. We show that not only paths towards jammed
states are not completely random but also there exist secret pseudo
deterministic paths that bound the system to end up in these special states.
Our results display that the Inverse Participation Ratio method (IPR) can be a
suitable indicator that exhibits collective behaviors of systems. According to
this method, these specific paths are those that host the most participation of
the constituents in the system. A direct proportionality exists between the
distance and the selectable paths towards local minimums; where by getting
close to the final steps there is no other way but the one to the jammed
states.

 <dc:description>  This is an introduction to Shannon's Information Theory. It is more like a
long note so that it is by no means a complete survey or completely
mathematically rigorous. It covers two main topics: entropy and channel
capacity. All related concepts will be developed in a totally combinatorial
flavor. Some issues usually not addressed in the literature will be discussed
here as well. Hopefully, it will be interesting to those interested in
Information Theory.

 <dc:description>  Logo detection in unconstrained images is challenging, particularly when only
very sparse labelled training images are accessible due to high labelling
costs. In this work, we describe a model training image synthesising method
capable of improving significantly logo detection performance when only a
handful of (e.g., 10) labelled training images captured in realistic context
are available, avoiding extensive manual labelling costs. Specifically, we
design a novel algorithm for generating Synthetic Context Logo (SCL) training
images to increase model robustness against unknown background clutters,
resulting in superior logo detection performance. For benchmarking model
performance, we introduce a new logo detection dataset TopLogo-10 collected
from top 10 most popular clothing/wearable brandname logos captured in rich
visual context. Extensive comparisons show the advantages of our proposed SCL
model over the state-of-the-art alternatives for logo detection using two
real-world logo benchmark datasets: FlickrLogo-32 and our new TopLogo-10.

 <dc:description>  Question Answering System (QAS) is used for information retrieval and natural
language processing (NLP) to reduce human effort. There are numerous QAS based
on the user documents present today, but they all are limited to providing
objective answers and process simple questions only. Complex questions cannot
be answered by the existing QAS, as they require interpretation of the current
and old data as well as the question asked by the user. The above limitations
can be overcome by using deep cases and neural network. Hence we propose a
modified QAS in which we create a deep artificial neural network with
associative memory from text documents. The modified QAS processes the contents
of the text document provided to it and find the answer to even complex
questions in the documents.

 <dc:description>  Many events occur in the world. Some event types are stochastically excited
or inhibited---in the sense of having their probabilities elevated or
decreased---by patterns in the sequence of previous events. Discovering such
patterns can help us predict which type of event will happen next and when. We
model streams of discrete events in continuous time, by constructing a neurally
self-modulating multivariate point process in which the intensities of multiple
event types evolve according to a novel continuous-time LSTM. This generative
model allows past events to influence the future in complex and realistic ways,
by conditioning future event intensities on the hidden state of a recurrent
neural network that has consumed the stream of past events. Our model has
desirable qualitative properties. It achieves competitive likelihood and
predictive accuracy on real and synthetic datasets, including under
missing-data conditions.

 <dc:description>  Access control systems are widely used means for the protection of computing
systems. They are defined in terms of access control policies regulating the
accesses to system resources. In this paper, we introduce a formally-defined,
fully-implemented framework for specification, analysis and enforcement of
attribute-based access control policies. The framework rests on FACPL, a
language with a compact, yet expressive, syntax for specification of real-world
access control policies and with a rigorously defined denotational semantics.
The framework enables the automatic verification of properties regarding both
the authorisations enforced by single policies and the relationships among
multiple policies. Effectiveness and performance of the analysis rely on a
semantic-preserving representation of FACPL policies in terms of SMT formulae
and on the use of efficient SMT solvers. Our analysis approach explicitly
addresses some crucial aspects of policy evaluation, as e.g. missing
attributes, erroneous values and obligations, which are instead overlooked in
other proposals. The framework is supported by Java-based tools, among which an
Eclipse- based IDE offering a tailored development and analysis environment for
FACPL policies and a Java library for policy enforcement. We illustrate the
framework and its formal ingredients by means of an e-Health case study, while
its effectiveness is assessed by means of performance stress tests and
experiments on a well-established benchmark.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the notion of information ratio $\text{Ir}(H/G)$ between two
(simple, undirected) graphs $G$ and $H$, defined as the supremum of ratios
$k/n$ such that there exists a mapping between the strong products $G^k$ to
$H^n$ that preserves non-adjacency. Operationally speaking, the information
ratio is the maximal number of source symbols per channel use that can be
reliably sent over a channel with a confusion graph $H$, where reliability is
measured w.r.t. a source confusion graph $G$. Various results are provided,
including in particular lower and upper bounds on $\text{Ir}(H/G)$ in terms of
different graph properties, inequalities and identities for behavior under
strong product and disjoint union, relations to graph cores, and notions of
graph criticality. Informally speaking, $\text{Ir}(H/G)$ can be interpreted as
a measure of similarity between $G$ and $H$. We make this notion precise by
introducing the concept of information equivalence between graphs, a more
quantitative version of homomorphic equivalence. We then describe a natural
partial ordering over the space of information equivalence classes, and endow
it with a suitable metric structure that is contractive under the strong
product. Various examples and open problems are discussed.

 <dc:description>  In many computer vision tasks, we expect a particular behavior of the output
with respect to rotations of the input image. If this relationship is
explicitly encoded, instead of treated as any other variation, the complexity
of the problem is decreased, leading to a reduction in the size of the required
model. In this paper, we propose the Rotation Equivariant Vector Field Networks
(RotEqNet), a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture encoding rotation
equivariance, invariance and covariance. Each convolutional filter is applied
at multiple orientations and returns a vector field representing magnitude and
angle of the highest scoring orientation at every spatial location. We develop
a modified convolution operator relying on this representation to obtain deep
architectures. We test RotEqNet on several problems requiring different
responses with respect to the inputs' rotation: image classification,
biomedical image segmentation, orientation estimation and patch matching. In
all cases, we show that RotEqNet offers extremely compact models in terms of
number of parameters and provides results in line to those of networks orders
of magnitude larger.

adapting a 3D model of the tongue surface to an articulatory dataset and
training a statistical parametric speech synthesis system directly on the
tongue model parameters. We evaluate the model at every step by comparing the
spatial coordinates of predicted articulatory movements against the reference
data. The results indicate a global mean Euclidean distance of less than 2.8
mm, and our approach can be adapted to add an articulatory modality to
conventional TTS applications without the need for extra data.

 <dc:description>  This paper initiates the studies of parallel algorithms for core maintenance
in dynamic graphs. The core number is a fundamental index reflecting the
cohesiveness of a graph, which are widely used in large-scale graph analytics.
The core maintenance problem requires to update the core numbers of vertices
after a set of edges and vertices are inserted into or deleted from the graph.
We investigate the parallelism in the core update process when multiple edges
and vertices are inserted or deleted. Specifically, we discover a structure
called superior edge set, the insertion or deletion of edges in which can be
processed in parallel. Based on the structure of superior edge set, efficient
parallel algorithms are then devised for incremental and decremental core
maintenance respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithms
are the first parallel ones for the fundamental core maintenance problem. The
algorithms show a significant speedup in the processing time compared with
previous results that sequentially handle edge and vertex insertions/deletions.
Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on different types of real-world
and synthetic datasets, and the results illustrate the efficiency, stability
and scalability of the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We consider the non-adaptive bit-probe complexity of the set membership
problem, where a set S of size at most n from a universe of size m is to be
represented as a short bit vector in order to answer membership queries of the
form &quot;Is x in S?&quot; by non-adaptively probing the bit vector at t places. Let
s_N(m,n,t) be the minimum number of bits of storage needed for such a scheme.
In this work, we show existence of non-adaptive and adaptive schemes for a
range of t that improves an upper bound of Buhrman, Miltersen, Radhakrishnan
and Srinivasan (2002) on s_N(m,n,t). For three non-adaptive probes, we improve
the previous best lower bound on s_N(m,n,3) by Alon and Feige (2009).

 <dc:description>  The generalized Hamming weights of a linear code have been extensively
studied since Wei first use them to characterize the cryptography performance
of a linear code over the wire-tap channel of type II. In this paper, we
investigate the generalized Hamming weights of three classes of linear codes
constructed through defining sets and determine them partly for some cases.
Particularly, in the semiprimitive case we solve an problem left in Yang et al.
(IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 61(9): 4905--4913, 2015).

 <dc:description>  We present a technique for automatically generating features for data-driven
program analyses. Recently data-driven approaches for building a program
analysis have been proposed, which mine existing codebases and automatically
learn heuristics for finding a cost-effective abstraction for a given analysis
task. Such approaches reduce the burden of the analysis designers, but they do
not remove it completely; they still leave the highly nontrivial task of
designing so called features to the hands of the designers. Our technique
automates this feature design process. The idea is to use programs as features
after reducing and abstracting them. Our technique goes through selected
program-query pairs in codebases, and it reduces and abstracts the program in
each pair to a few lines of code, while ensuring that the analysis behaves
similarly for the original and the new programs with respect to the query. Each
reduced program serves as a boolean feature for program-query pairs. This
feature evaluates to true for a given program-query pair when (as a program) it
is included in the program part of the pair. We have implemented our approach
for three real-world program analyses. Our experimental evaluation shows that
these analyses with automatically-generated features perform comparably to
those with manually crafted features.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have recently shown promising
performance in many computer vision tasks, especially image-based recognition.
How to effectively apply ConvNets to sequence-based data is still an open
problem. This paper proposes an effective yet simple method to represent
spatio-temporal information carried in $3D$ skeleton sequences into three $2D$
images by encoding the joint trajectories and their dynamics into color
distribution in the images, referred to as Joint Trajectory Maps (JTM), and
adopts ConvNets to learn the discriminative features for human action
recognition. Such an image-based representation enables us to fine-tune
existing ConvNets models for the classification of skeleton sequences without
training the networks afresh. The three JTMs are generated in three orthogonal
planes and provide complimentary information to each other. The final
recognition is further improved through multiply score fusion of the three
JTMs. The proposed method was evaluated on four public benchmark datasets, the
large NTU RGB+D Dataset, MSRC-12 Kinect Gesture Dataset (MSRC-12), G3D Dataset
and UTD Multimodal Human Action Dataset (UTD-MHAD) and achieved the
state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>Shape Estimation from Defocus Cue for Microscopy Images via Belief
  Propagation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bhavsar, Arnav</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, the usefulness of 3D shape estimation is being realized in
microscopic or close-range imaging, as the 3D information can further be used
in various applications. Due to limited depth of field at such small distances,
the defocus blur induced in images can provide information about the 3D shape
of the object. The task of `shape from defocus' (SFD), involves the problem of
estimating good quality 3D shape estimates from images with depth-dependent
defocus blur. While the research area of SFD is quite well-established, the
approaches have largely demonstrated results on objects with bulk/coarse shape
variation. However, in many cases, objects studied under microscopes often
involve fine/detailed structures, which have not been explicitly considered in
most methods. In addition, given that, in recent years, large data volumes are
typically associated with microscopy related applications, it is also important
for such SFD methods to be efficient. In this work, we provide an indication of
the usefulness of the Belief Propagation (BP) approach in addressing these
concerns for SFD. BP has been known to be an efficient combinatorial
optimization approach, and has been empirically demonstrated to yield good
quality solutions in low-level vision problems such as image restoration,
stereo disparity estimation etc. For exploiting the efficiency of BP in SFD, we
assume local space-invariance of the defocus blur, which enables the
application of BP in a straightforward manner. Even with such an assumption,
the ability of BP to provide good quality solutions while using non-convex
priors, reflects in yielding plausible shape estimates in presence of fine
structures on the objects under microscopy imaging.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of quantifying biomarkers in multi-stained
tissues, based on color and spatial information. A deep learning based method
that can automatically localize and quantify the cells expressing biomarker(s)
in a whole slide image is proposed. The deep learning network is a fully
convolutional network (FCN) whose input is the true RGB color image of a tissue
and output is a map of the different biomarkers. The FCN relies on a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies each cell separately
according to the biomarker it expresses. In this study, images of
immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained slides were collected and used. More than
4,500 RGB images of cells were manually labeled based on the expressing
biomarkers. The labeled cell images were used to train the CNN (obtaining an
accuracy of 92% in a test set). The trained CNN is then extended to an FCN that
generates a map of all biomarkers in the whole slide image acquired by the
scanner (instead of classifying every cell image). To evaluate our method, we
manually labeled all nuclei expressing different biomarkers in two whole slide
images and used theses as the ground truth. Our proposed method for
immunohistochemical analysis compares well with the manual labeling by humans
(average F-score of 0.96).

some deficiencies that address expensive equipment, the requirement of
laboratory conditions and applicability. In this paper we address this issue by
using widely available and inexpensive EEG device to verify its capability for
authentication. As a part of this research, we developed two phase
authentication that enables users to enhance their password with the mental
state by breaking the password into smaller, marry them with mental state, and
generate one time pad for a secure session.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we identify a new form of attack, called the Balance attack,
against proof-of-work blockchain systems. The novelty of this attack consists
of delaying network communications between multiple subgroups of nodes with
balanced mining power. Our theoretical analysis captures the precise tradeoff
between the network delay and the mining power of the attacker needed to double
spend in Ethereum with high probability.
  We quantify our probabilistic analysis with statistics taken from the R3
consortium, and show that a single machine needs 20 minutes to attack the
consortium. Finally, we run an Ethereum private chain in a distributed system
with similar settings as R3 to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and
discuss the application of the Balance attack to Bitcoin. Our results clearly
confirm that main proof-of-work blockchain protocols can be badly suited for
consortium blockchains.

 <dc:description>  Opponent modeling consists in modeling the strategy or preferences of an
agent thanks to the data it provides. In the context of automated negotiation
and with machine learning, it can result in an advantage so overwhelming that
it may restrain some casual agents to be part of the bargaining process. We
qualify as &quot;curious&quot; an agent driven by the desire of negotiating in order to
collect information and improve its opponent model. However, neither
curiosity-based rational-ity nor curiosity-robust protocol have been studied in
automatic negotiation. In this paper, we rely on mechanism design to propose
three extensions of the standard bargaining protocol that limit information
leak. Those extensions are supported by an enhanced rationality model, that
considers the exchanged information. Also, they are theoretically analyzed and
experimentally evaluated.

These discretized operators usually depend on bandwidth parameters whose tuning
remains a theoretical and practical problem. In this paper, we address this
problem for the unnormalized graph Laplacian by establishing an oracle
inequality that opens the door to a well-founded data-driven procedure for the
bandwidth selection. Our approach relies on recent results by Lacour and

 <dc:description>  The study of networks has emerged in diverse disciplines as a means of
analyzing complex relationship data. Beyond graph analysis tasks like graph
query processing, link analysis, influence propagation, there has recently been
some work in the area of outlier detection for information network data.
Although various kinds of outliers have been studied for graph data, there is
not much work on anomaly detection from edge-attributed graphs. In this paper,
we introduce a method that detects novel outlier graph nodes by taking into
account the node data and edge data simultaneously to detect anomalies. We
model the problem as a community detection task, where outliers form a separate
community. We propose a method that uses a probabilistic graph model (Hidden
Markov Random Field) for joint modeling of nodes and edges in the network to
compute Holistic Community Outliers (HCOutliers). Thus, our model presents a
natural setting for heterogeneous graphs that have multiple edges/relationships
between two nodes. EM (Expectation Maximization) is used to learn model
parameters, and infer hidden community labels. Experimental results on
synthetic datasets and the DBLP dataset show the effectiveness of our approach
for finding novel outliers from networks.

 <dc:description>  A pair of non-adjacent edges is said to be separated in a circular ordering
of vertices, if the endpoints of the two edges do not alternate in the
ordering. The circular separation dimension of a graph $G$, denoted by
$\pi^\circ(G)$, is the minimum number of circular orderings of the vertices of
$G$ such that every pair of non-adjacent edges is separated in at least one of
the circular orderings. This notion is introduced by Loeb and West in their
recent paper. In this article, we consider two subclasses of planar graphs,
namely $2$-outerplanar graphs and series-parallel graphs. A $2$-outerplanar
graph has a planar embedding such that the subgraph obtained by removal of the
vertices of the exterior face is outerplanar. We prove that if $G$ is
$2$-outerplanar then $\pi^\circ(G) = 2$. We also prove that if $G$ is a
series-parallel graph then $\pi^\circ(G) \leq 2$.

 <dc:description>  The recent successful deep neural networks are largely trained in a
supervised manner. It {\it associates} complex patterns of input samples with
neurons in the last layer, which form representations of {\it concepts}. In
spite of their successes, the properties of complex patterns associated a
learned concept remain elusive. In this work, by analyzing how neurons are
associated with concepts in supervised networks, we hypothesize that with
proper priors to regulate learning, neural networks can automatically associate
neurons in the intermediate layers with concepts that are aligned with real
world concepts, when trained only with labels that associate concepts with top
level neurons, which is a plausible way for unsupervised learning. We develop a
prior to verify the hypothesis and experimentally find the proposed prior help
neural networks automatically learn both basic physical concepts at the lower
layers, e.g., rotation of filters, and highly semantic concepts at the higher
layers, e.g., fine-grained categories of an entry-level category.

 <dc:description>  Electro-quasistatic field problems involving nonlinear materials are commonly
discretized in space using finite elements. In this paper, it is proposed to
solve the resulting system of ordinary differential equations by an explicit
Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev time-integration scheme. This mitigates the need for
Newton-Raphson iterations, as they are necessary within fully implicit time
integration schemes. However, the electro-quasistatic system of ordinary
differential equations has a Laplace-type mass matrix such that parts of the
explicit time-integration scheme remain implicit. An iterative solver with
constant preconditioner is shown to efficiently solve the resulting multiple
right-hand side problem. This approach allows an efficient parallel
implementation on a system featuring multiple graphic processing units.

 <dc:description>  Interorganizational interactions are often complex and paradoxical. In this
research, we transcend two management paradoxes: competition versus cooperation
and open-source versus proprietary technology development. We follow the
OpenStack open-source ecosystem where competing firms cooperate in the
joint-development of a cloud infrastructure for big data. We provide a
narrative, complemented with social network visualizations, which depicts the
evolution of cooperation and competition. Our findings suggest that development
transparency and weak intellectual property rights (i.e., characteristics of
open-source ecosystems) allow a focal firm to transfer information and
resources more easily between multiple alliances.

 <dc:description>  Temporal Difference learning or TD($\lambda$) is a fundamental algorithm in
the field of reinforcement learning. However, setting TD's $\lambda$ parameter,
which controls the timescale of TD updates, is generally left up to the
practitioner. We formalize the $\lambda$ selection problem as a bias-variance
trade-off where the solution is the value of $\lambda$ that leads to the
smallest Mean Squared Value Error (MSVE). To solve this trade-off we suggest
applying Leave-One-Trajectory-Out Cross-Validation (LOTO-CV) to search the
space of $\lambda$ values. Unfortunately, this approach is too computationally
expensive for most practical applications. For Least Squares TD (LSTD) we show
that LOTO-CV can be implemented efficiently to automatically tune $\lambda$ and
apply function optimization methods to efficiently search the space of
$\lambda$ values. The resulting algorithm, ALLSTD, is parameter free and our
experiments demonstrate that ALLSTD is significantly computationally faster
than the na\&quot;{i}ve LOTO-CV implementation while achieving similar performance.

 <dc:description>  Micro-blogs are contemporary broadcasting services for exchanging small
elements of content, including video and images. Despite its popularity,
micro-blogging is not without issues. So far, various security concerns, such
as: privacy and confidentiality of micro-blogging systems have attracted the
interest of the scientific community. Nevertheless, in this document we refer
to a security issue that is concerned with the posting and circulation of fake
messages. With the aim to make micro-blogs a credible source of information, in
this work we propose a protocol, as a solution, that can be easily adapted to
existing services such as: Twitter and Facebook. With the main keys of the
solution being the employment of digital signatures and watermarks, the
protocol can serve postings of various types of content. Finally, the solution
serves the dual purpose of proofing the fake messages as well as the
repudiation of postings.

 <dc:description>  The notion of strong external difference family (SEDF) in a finite abelian
group $(G,+)$ is raised by M. B. Paterson and D. R. Stinson [5] in 2016 and
motivated by its application in communication theory to construct $R$-optimal
regular algebraic manipulation detection code. A series of
$(n,m,k,\lambda)$-SEDF's have been constructed in [5, 4, 2, 1] with $m=2$. In
this note we present an example of (243, 11, 22, 20)-SEDF in finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ $(q=3^5=243).$ This is an answer for the following problem
raised in [5] and continuously asked in [4, 2, 1]: if there exists an
$(n,m,k,\lambda)$-SEDF for $m\geq 5$.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a multi-hop energy harvesting (EH) communication
system in a full-duplex mode, where arrival data and harvested energy curves in
the source and the relays are modeled as general functions. This model includes
the EH system with discrete arrival processes as a special case. We investigate
the throughput maximization problem considering minimum utilized energy in the
source and relays and find the optimal offline algorithm. We show that the
optimal solution of the two-hop transmission problem have three main steps: (i)
Solving a point-to-point throughput maximization problem at the source; (ii)
Solving a point-to-point throughput maximization problem at the relay (after
applying the solution of first step as the input of this second problem); (iii)
Minimizing utilized energy in the source. In addition, we show that how the
optimal algorithm for the completion time minimization problem can be derived
from the proposed algorithm for throughput maximization problem. Also, for the
throughput maximization problem, we propose an online algorithm and show that
it is more efficient than the benchmark one (which is a direct application of
an existing point-to-point online algorithm to the multi-hop system).

 <dc:description>  The energy internet is one of the most promising future energy
infrastructures that could both enhance energy efficiency and improve its
operating flexibility. Analogous to the micro-grid, the micro energy internet
emphasizes the distribution level and demand side. This paper proposes concepts
and design principles of a smart micro energy internet for accommodating
micro-grids, distributed poly-generation systems, energy storage facilities,
and associated energy distribution infrastructures. Since the dispatch and
control system of the smart micro energy internet is responsible for external
disturbances, it should be able to approach a satisfactory operating point
while supporting multiple criteria, such as safety, economy, and environmental
protection. To realize the vision of a smart micro energy internet, an
engineering game theory based energy management system with
self-approaching-optimum capability is investigated. Based on the proposed
concepts, design principles, and energy management system, this paper presents
a prototype of China's first conceptual solar-based smart micro energy
internet, established in Qinghai University.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For a quantale ${\sf{V}}$, the category $\sf V$-${\bf Top}$ of
${\sf{V}}$-valued topological spaces may be introduced as a full subcategory of
those ${\sf{V}}$-valued closure spaces whose closure operation preserves finite
joins. In generalization of Barr's characterization of topological spaces as
the lax algebras of a lax extension of the ultrafilter monad from maps to
relations of sets, for ${\sf{V}}$ completely distributive,
${\sf{V}}$-topological spaces have recently been shown to be characterizable by
a lax extension of the ultrafilter monad to ${\sf{V}}$-valued relations. As a
consequence, ${\sf{V}}$-$\bf Top$ is seen to be a topological category over
$\bf Set$, provided that ${\sf{V}}$ is completely distributive. In this paper
we give a choice-free proof that ${\sf{V}}$-$\bf Top$ is a topological category
over $\bf Set$ under the considerably milder provision that ${\sf{V}}$ be a
spatial coframe. When ${\sf{V}}$ is a continuous lattice, that provision yields
complete distributivity of ${\sf{V}}$ in the constructive sense, hence also in
the ordinary sense whenever the Axiom of Choice is granted.

 <dc:description>  With rapid development of the Internet, web contents become huge. Most of the
websites are publicly available, and anyone can access the contents from
anywhere such as workplace, home and even schools. Nevertheless, not all the
web contents are appropriate for all users, especially children. An example of
these contents is pornography images which should be restricted to certain age
group. Besides, these images are not safe for work (NSFW) in which employees
should not be seen accessing such contents during work. Recently, convolutional
neural networks have been successfully applied to many computer vision
problems. Inspired by these successes, we propose a mixture of convolutional
neural networks for adult content recognition. Unlike other works, our method
is formulated on a weighted sum of multiple deep neural network models. The
weights of each CNN models are expressed as a linear regression problem learned
using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed model outperforms both single CNN model and the average sum of CNN
models in adult content recognition.

 <dc:description>  Currently, the most successful learning models in computer vision are based
on learning successive representations followed by a decision layer. This is
usually actualized through feedforward multilayer neural networks, e.g.
ConvNets, where each layer forms one of such successive representations.
However, an alternative that can achieve the same goal is a feedback based
approach in which the representation is formed in an iterative manner based on
a feedback received from previous iteration's output.
  We establish that a feedback based approach has several fundamental
advantages over feedforward: it enables making early predictions at the query
time, its output naturally conforms to a hierarchical structure in the label
space (e.g. a taxonomy), and it provides a new basis for Curriculum Learning.
We observe that feedback networks develop a considerably different
representation compared to feedforward counterparts, in line with the
aforementioned advantages. We put forth a general feedback based learning
architecture with the endpoint results on par or better than existing
feedforward networks with the addition of the above advantages. We also
investigate several mechanisms in feedback architectures (e.g. skip connections
in time) and design choices (e.g. feedback length). We hope this study offers
new perspectives in quest for more natural and practical learning models.

 <dc:title>A Ghost at $\omega_1$</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levy, Paul Blain</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the final chain of the countable powerset functor, we show that the set at
index $\omega_1$, regarded as a transition system, is not strongly extensional
because it contains a &quot;ghost&quot; element that has no successor even though its
component at index 1 is inhabited. The method, adapted from a construction of
Forti and Honsell, also gives ghosts at larger ordinals in the final chain of
other subfunctors of the powerset functor. This leads to a precise description
of which sets in these final chains are strongly extensional.

 <dc:title>A Scalable Framework for CSI Feedback in FDD Massive MIMO via DL Path

 <dc:description>  Unlike the time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, the downlink (DL) and
uplink (UL) channels are not reciprocal anymore in the case of
frequency-division duplexing (FDD). However, some long-term parameters, e.g.
the time delays and angles of arrival (AoAs) of the channel paths, still enjoy
reciprocity. In this paper, by efficiently exploiting the aforementioned
limited reciprocity, we address the DL channel state information (CSI) feedback
in a practical wideband massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system
operating in the FDD mode. With orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
(OFDM) waveform and assuming frequency-selective fading channels, we propose a
scalable framework for the DL pilots design, DL CSI acquisition, and the
corresponding CSI feedback in the UL. In particular, the base station (BS) can
transmit the FFT-based pilots with the carefully-selected phase shifts. Then
the user can rely on the so-called time-domain aggregate channel (TAC) to
derive the feedback of reduced imensionality according to either its own
knowledge about the statistics of the DL channels or the instruction from the
serving BS. We demonstrate that each user can just feed back one scalar number
per DL channel path for the BS to recover the DL CSIs. Comprehensive numerical
results further corroborate our designs.

 <dc:description>  Aggregating statistically diverse renewable power producers (RPPs) is an
effective way to reduce the uncertainty of the RPPs. The key question in
aggregation of RPPs is how to allocate payoffs among the RPPs. In this paper, a
payoff allocation mechanism (PAM) with a simple closed-form expression is
proposed: It achieves stability (in the core) and fairness both in the
&quot;ex-post&quot; sense, i.e., for all possible realizations of renewable power
generation. Furthermore, this PAM can in fact be derived from the competitive
equilibrium in a market. The proposed PAM is evaluated in a simulation study
with ten wind power producers in the PJM interconnection.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a memory efficient architecture that implements the
Multi-Scale Line Detector (MSLD) algorithm for real-time retinal blood vessel
detection in fundus images on a Zynq FPGA. This implementation benefits from
the FPGA parallelism to drastically reduce the memory requirements of the MSLD
from two images to a few values. The architecture is optimized in terms of
resource utilization by reusing the computations and optimizing the bit-width.
The throughput is increased by designing fully pipelined functional units. The
architecture is capable of achieving a comparable accuracy to its software
implementation but 70x faster for low resolution images. For high resolution
images, it achieves an acceleration by a factor of 323x.

 <dc:title>Ontology-based Access Control in Open Scenarios: Applications to Social

 <dc:creator>Imran-Daud, Malik</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Thanks to the advent of the Internet, it is now possible to easily share vast
amounts of electronic information and computer resources (which include
hardware, computer services, etc.) in open distributed environments. These
environments serve as a common platform for heterogeneous users (e.g.,
corporate, individuals etc.) by hosting customized user applications and
systems, providing ubiquitous access to the shared resources and requiring less
administrative efforts; as a result, they enable users and companies to
increase their productivity. Unfortunately, sharing of resources in open
environments has significantly increased the privacy threats to the users.
Indeed, shared electronic data may be exploited by third parties, such as Data
Brokers, which may aggregate, infer and redistribute (sensitive) personal
features, thus potentially impairing the privacy of the individuals. A way to
palliate this problem consists on controlling the access of users over the
potentially sensitive resources. Specifically, access control management
regulates the access to the shared resources according to the credentials of
the users, the type of resource and the privacy preferences of the
resource/data owners. The efficient management of access control is crucial in
large and dynamic environments. Moreover, in order to propose a feasible and
scalable solution, we need to get rid of manual management of rules/constraints
(in which most available solutions rely) that constitutes a serious burden for
the users and the administrators. Finally, access control management should be
intuitive for the end users, who usually lack technical expertise, and they may
find access control mechanism more difficult to understand and rigid to apply
due to its complex configuration settings.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Finding the main product of a chemical reaction is one of the important
problems of organic chemistry. This paper describes a method of applying a
neural machine translation model to the prediction of organic chemical
reactions. In order to translate 'reactants and reagents' to 'products', a
gated recurrent unit based sequence-to-sequence model and a parser to generate
input tokens for model from reaction SMILES strings were built. Training sets
are composed of reactions from the patent databases, and reactions manually
generated applying the elementary reactions in an organic chemistry textbook of
Wade. The trained models were tested by examples and problems in the textbook.
The prediction process does not need manual encoding of rules (e.g., SMARTS
transformations) to predict products, hence it only needs sufficient training
reaction sets to learn new types of reactions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a stochastic queuing model for the road traffic,
which captures the stationary density-flow relationships in both uncongested
and congestion conditions. The proposed model is based on the $M/g/c/c$ state
dependent queuing model of Jain and Smith, and is inspired from the
deterministic Godunov scheme for the road traffic simulation. We first propose
a reformulation of the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent model that works with
density-flow fundamental diagrams rather than density-speed relationships. We
then extend this model in order to consider upstream traffic demand as well as
downstream traffic supply. Finally, we calculate the speed and travel time
distributions for the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent queuing model and for the
proposed model, and derive stationary performance measures (expected number of
cars, blocking probability, expected travel time, and throughput). A comparison
with results predicted by the $M/g/c/c$ state dependent queuing model shows
that the proposed model correctly represents the dynamics of traffic and gives
good performances measures. The results illustrate the good accuracy of the
proposed model.

 <dc:description>  The rapid developments of high-speed trains (HSTs) introduce new challenges
to HST wireless communication systems. Realistic HST channel models play a
critical role in designing and evaluating HST communication systems. Due to the
length limitation, bounding of tunnel itself, and waveguide effect, channel
characteristics in tunnel scenarios are very different from those in other HST
scenarios. Therefore, accurate tunnel channel models considering both
large-scale and small-scale fading characteristics are essential for HST
communication systems. Moreover, certain characteristics of tunnel channels
have not been investigated sufficiently. This article provides a comprehensive
review of the measurement campaigns in tunnels and presents some tunnel channel
models using various modeling methods. Finally, future directions in HST tunnel
channel measurements and modeling are discussed.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the entity extraction task (named entity recognition)
of a text mining process that aims at unveiling non-trivial semantic
structures, such as relationships and interaction between entities or
communities. In this paper we present a simple and efficient named entity
extraction algorithm. The method, named PAMPO (PAttern Matching and POs tagging
based algorithm for NER), relies on flexible pattern matching, part-of-speech
tagging and lexical-based rules. It was developed to process texts written in
Portuguese, however it is potentially applicable to other languages as well.
  We compare our approach with current alternatives that support Named Entity
Recognition (NER) for content written in Portuguese. These are Alchemy, Zemanta
and Rembrandt. Evaluation of the efficacy of the entity extraction method on
several texts written in Portuguese indicates a considerable improvement on
$recall$ and $F_1$ measures.

 <dc:description>  Referring expressions are natural language constructions used to identify
particular objects within a scene. In this paper, we propose a unified
framework for the tasks of referring expression comprehension and generation.
Our model is composed of three modules: speaker, listener, and reinforcer. The
speaker generates referring expressions, the listener comprehends referring
expressions, and the reinforcer introduces a reward function to guide sampling
of more discriminative expressions. The listener-speaker modules are trained
jointly in an end-to-end learning framework, allowing the modules to be aware
of one another during learning while also benefiting from the discriminative
reinforcer's feedback. We demonstrate that this unified framework and training
achieves state-of-the-art results for both comprehension and generation on
three referring expression datasets. Project and demo page:

 <dc:description>  Appearance variations result in many difficulties in face image analysis. To
deal with this challenge, we present a Unified Tensor-based Active Appearance
Model (UT-AAM) for jointly modelling the geometry and texture information of 2D
faces. For each type of face information, namely shape and texture, we
construct a unified tensor model capturing all relevant appearance variations.
This contrasts with the variation-specific models of the classical tensor AAM.
To achieve the unification across pose variations, a strategy for dealing with
self-occluded faces is proposed to obtain consistent shape and texture
representations of pose-varied faces. In addition, our UT-AAM is capable of
constructing the model from an incomplete training dataset, using tensor
completion methods. Last, we use an effective cascaded-regression-based method
for UT-AAM fitting. With these advancements, the utility of UT-AAM in practice
is considerably enhanced. As an example, we demonstrate the improvements in
training facial landmark detectors through the use of UT-AAM to synthesise a
large number of virtual samples. Experimental results obtained using the
Multi-PIE and 300-W face datasets demonstrate the merits of the proposed
approach.

 <dc:title>Unified Theory for Recovery of Sparse Signals in a General Transform

 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing provided a data-acquisition paradigm for sparse signals.
Remarkably, it has been shown that practical algorithms provide robust recovery
from noisy linear measurements acquired at a near optimal sampling rate. In
many real-world applications, a signal of interest is typically sparse not in
the canonical basis but in a certain transform domain, such as wavelets or the
finite difference. The theory of compressed sensing was extended to the
analysis sparsity model but known extensions are limited to specific choices of
sensing matrix and sparsifying transform. In this paper, we propose a unified
theory for robust recovery of sparse signals in a general transform domain by
convex programming. In particular, our results apply to general acquisition and
sparsity models and show how the number of measurements for recovery depends on
properties of measurement and sparsifying transforms. Moreover, we also provide
extensions of our results to the scenarios where the atoms in the transform has
varying incoherence parameters and the unknown signal exhibits a structured
sparsity pattern. In particular, for the partial Fourier recovery of sparse
signals over a circulant transform, our main results suggest a uniformly random
sampling. Numerical results demonstrate that the variable density random
sampling by our main results provides superior recovery performance over known
sampling strategies.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the FolksoDriven Cloud (FDC) built on Cloud and on
Semantic technologies. Cloud computing has emerged in these recent years as the
new paradigm for the provision of on-demand distributed computing resources.
Semantic Web can be used for relationship between different data and
descriptions of services to annotate provenance of repositories on ontologies.
The FDC service is composed of a back-end which submits and monitors the
documents, and a user front-end which allows users to schedule on-demand
operations and to watch the progress of running processes. The impact of the
proposed method is illustrated on a user since its inception.

 <dc:description>  The Folksodriven framework makes it possible for data scientists to define an
ontology environment where searching for buried patterns that have some kind of
predictive power to build predictive models more effectively. It accomplishes
this through an abstractions that isolate parameters of the predictive modeling
process searching for patterns and designing the feature set, too. To reflect
the evolving knowledge, this paper considers ontologies based on folksonomies
according to a new concept structure called &quot;Folksodriven&quot; to represent
folksonomies. So, the studies on the transformational regulation of the
Folksodriven tags are regarded to be important for adaptive folksonomies
classifications in an evolving environment used by Intelligent Systems to
represent the knowledge sharing. Folksodriven tags are used to categorize
salient data points so they can be fed to a machine-learning system and
&quot;featurizing&quot; the data.

 <dc:description>  This manuscript serves as a correctness proof of the Hierarchical MCS locks
with Timeout (HMCS-T) described in our paper titled &quot;An Efficient
Abortable-locking Protocol for Multi-level NUMA Systems&quot; appearing in the
proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of
Parallel Programming.
  HMCS-T is a very involved protocol. The system is stateful; the values of
prior acquisition efforts affect the subsequent acquisition efforts. Also, the
status of successors, predecessors, ancestors, and descendants affect steps
followed by the protocol. The ability to make the protocol fully non-blocking
leads to modifications to the \texttt{next} field, which causes deviation from
the original MCS lock protocol both in acquisition and release. At several
places, unconditional field updates are replaced with SWAP or CAS operations.
  We follow a multi-step approach to prove the correctness of HMCS-T. To
demonstrate the correctness of the HMCS-T lock, we use the Spin model checking.
Model checking causes a combinatorial explosion even to simulate a handful of
threads. First, we understand the minimal, sufficient configurations necessary
to prove safety properties of a single level of lock in the tree. We construct
HMCS-T locks that represent these configurations. We model check these
configurations, which proves the correctness of components of an HMCS-T lock.
Finally, building upon these facts, we argue logically for the correctness of
HMCS-T&lt;n&gt;.

 <dc:description>  This technical report describes the usage, syntax, semantics and core
algorithms of the probabilistic inductive logic programming framework PrASP.
PrASP is a research software which integrates non-monotonic reasoning based on
Answer Set Programming (ASP), probabilistic inference and parameter learning.
In contrast to traditional approaches to Probabilistic (Inductive) Logic
Programming, our framework imposes only little restrictions on probabilistic
logic programs. In particular, PrASP allows for ASP as well as First-Order
Logic syntax, and for the annotation of formulas with point probabilities as
well as interval probabilities. A range of widely configurable inference
algorithms can be combined in a pipeline-like fashion, in order to cover a
variety of use cases.

 <dc:title>When the map is better than the territory</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The causal structure of any system can be analyzed at a multitude of spatial
and temporal scales. It has long been thought that while higher scale (macro)
descriptions of causal structure may be useful to observers, they are at best a
compressed description and at worse leave out critical information. However,
recent research applying information theory to causal analysis has shown that
the causal structure of some systems can actually come into focus (be more
informative) at a macroscale (Hoel et al. 2013). That is, a macro model of a
system (a map) can be more informative than a fully detailed model of the
system (the territory). This has been called causal emergence. While causal
emergence may at first glance seem counterintuitive, this paper grounds the
phenomenon in a classic concept from information theory: Shannon's discovery of
the channel capacity. I argue that systems have a particular causal capacity,
and that different causal models of those systems take advantage of that
capacity to various degrees. For some systems, only macroscale causal models
use the full causal capacity. Such macroscale causal models can either be
coarse-grains, or may leave variables and states out of the model (exogenous)
in various ways, which can improve the model's efficacy and its informativeness
via the same mathematical principles of how error-correcting codes take
advantage of an information channel's capacity. As model choice increase, the
causal capacity of a system approaches the channel capacity. Ultimately, this
provides a general framework for understanding how the causal structure of some
systems cannot be fully captured by even the most detailed microscopic model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a fuzzy constraint linear discriminant analysis
(FC-LDA). The FC-LDA tries to minimize misclassification error based on
modified perceptron criterion that benefits handling the uncertainty near the
decision boundary by means of a fuzzy linear programming approach with fuzzy
resources. The method proposed has low computational complexity because of its
linear characteristics and the ability to deal with noisy data with different
degrees of tolerance. Obtained results verify the success of the algorithm when
dealing with different problems. Comparing FC-LDA and LDA shows superiority in
classification task.

 <dc:description>  We are in the middle of a remarkable rise in the use and capability of
artificial intelligence. Much of this growth has been fueled by the success of
deep learning architectures: models that map from observables to outputs via
multiple layers of latent representations. These deep learning algorithms are
effective tools for unstructured prediction, and they can be combined in AI
systems to solve complex automated reasoning problems. This paper provides a
recipe for combining ML algorithms to solve for causal effects in the presence
of instrumental variables -- sources of treatment randomization that are
conditionally independent from the response. We show that a flexible IV
specification resolves into two prediction tasks that can be solved with deep
neural nets: a first-stage network for treatment prediction and a second-stage
network whose loss function involves integration over the conditional treatment
distribution. This Deep IV framework imposes some specific structure on the
stochastic gradient descent routine used for training, but it is general enough
that we can take advantage of off-the-shelf ML capabilities and avoid extensive
algorithm customization. We outline how to obtain out-of-sample causal
validation in order to avoid over-fit. We also introduce schemes for both
Bayesian and frequentist inference: the former via a novel adaptation of
dropout training, and the latter via a data splitting routine.

 <dc:description>  Gravitational wave astronomy has set in motion a scientific revolution. To
further enhance the science reach of this emergent field, there is a pressing
need to increase the depth and speed of the gravitational wave algorithms that
have enabled these groundbreaking discoveries. To contribute to this effort, we
introduce Deep Filtering, a new highly scalable method for end-to-end
time-series signal processing, based on a system of two deep convolutional
neural networks, which we designed for classification and regression to rapidly
detect and estimate parameters of signals in highly noisy time-series data
streams. We demonstrate a novel training scheme with gradually increasing noise
levels, and a transfer learning procedure between the two networks. We showcase
the application of this method for the detection and parameter estimation of
gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Our results indicate that
Deep Filtering significantly outperforms conventional machine learning
techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while
being several orders of magnitude faster thus allowing real-time processing of
raw big data with minimal resources. More importantly, Deep Filtering extends
the range of gravitational wave signals that can be detected with ground-based
gravitational wave detectors. This framework leverages recent advances in
artificial intelligence algorithms and emerging hardware architectures, such as
deep-learning-optimized GPUs, to facilitate real-time searches of gravitational
wave sources and their electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts.

 <dc:description>  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a prob- lem with many
applications, ranging from facial recognition to document clustering. However,
due to the variety of algorithms that solve NMF, the randomness involved in
these algorithms, and the somewhat subjective nature of the problem, there is
no clear &quot;correct answer&quot; to any particular NMF problem, and as a result, it
can be hard to test new algorithms. This paper suggests some test cases for NMF
algorithms derived from matrices with enumerable exact non-negative
factorizations and perturbations of these matrices. Three algorithms using
widely divergent approaches to NMF all give similar solutions over these test
cases, suggesting that these test cases could be used as test cases for
implementations of these existing NMF algorithms as well as potentially new NMF
algorithms. This paper also describes how the proposed test cases could be used
in practice.

 <dc:title>Technical Report: Optimal Surveillance of Dynamic Parades using Teams of

 <dc:creator>Alexis, Kostas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This technical report addresses the problem of optimal surveillance of the
route followed by a dynamic parade using a team of aerial robots. The dynamic
parade is considered to take place within an urban environment, it is
discretized and at every iteration, the algorithm computes the best possible
placing of the aerial robotic team members, subject to their camera model and
the occlusions arising from the environment. As the parade route is only as
well covered as its least-covered point, the optimization objective is to place
the aerial robots such that they maximize the minimum coverage over the points
in the route at every time instant of it. A set of simulation studies is used
to demonstrate the operation and performance characteristics of the approach,
while computational analysis is also provided and verifies the good scalability
properties of the contributed algorithm regarding the size of the aerial
robotics team.

 <dc:description>  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) systems are becoming popular because
they present several advantages over competing systems. However, EIT leads to
images with very low resolution. Moreover, the nonuniform sampling
characteristic of EIT precludes the straightforward application of traditional
image ruper-resolution techniques. In this work, we propose a resampling based
Super-Resolution method for EIT image quality improvement. Preliminary results
show that the proposed technique can lead to substantial improvements in EIT
image resolution, making it more competitive with other technologies.

 <dc:title>p-DLA: A Predictive System Model for Onshore Oil and Gas Pipeline
  Dataset Classification and Monitoring - Part 1</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Osegi, E. N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the rise in militant activity and rogue behaviour in oil and gas regions
around the world, oil pipeline disturbances is on the increase leading to huge
losses to multinational operators and the countries where such facilities
exist. However, this situation can be averted if adequate predictive monitoring
schemes are put in place. We propose in the first part of this paper, an
artificial intelligence predictive monitoring system capable of predictive
classification and pattern recognition of pipeline datasets. The predictive
system is based on a highly sparse predictive Deviant Learning Algorithm
(p-DLA) designed to synthesize a sequence of memory predictive clusters for
eventual monitoring, control and decision making. The DLA (p-DLA) is compared
with a popular machine learning algorithm, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
which is based on a temporal version of the standard feed-forward
back-propagation trained artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results of
simulations study show impressive results and validates the sparse memory
predictive approach which favours the sub-synthesis of a highly compressed and
low dimensional knowledge discovery and information prediction scheme. It also
shows that the proposed new approach is competitive with a well-known and
proven AI approach such as the LSTM.

 <dc:title>Compressed sensing and optimal denoising of monotone signals</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pnevmatikakis, Eftychios A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Statistics Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problems of compressed sensing and optimal denoising for
signals $\mathbf{x_0}\in\mathbb{R}^N$ that are monotone, i.e.,
$\mathbf{x_0}(i+1) \geq \mathbf{x_0}(i)$, and sparsely varying, i.e.,
$\mathbf{x_0}(i+1) &gt; \mathbf{x_0}(i)$ only for a small number $k$ of indices
$i$. We approach the compressed sensing problem by minimizing the total
variation norm restricted to the class of monotone signals subject to equality
constraints obtained from a number of measurements $A\mathbf{x_0}$. For random
Gaussian sensing matrices $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times N}$ we derive a closed form
expression for the number of measurements $m$ required for successful
reconstruction with high probability. We show that the probability undergoes a
phase transition as $m$ varies, and depends not only on the number of change
points, but also on their location. For denoising we regularize with the same
norm and derive a formula for the optimal regularizer weight that depends only
mildly on $\mathbf{x_0}$. We obtain our results using the statistical dimension
tool.

 <dc:description>  It has been shown in recent years that the stochastic block model (SBM) is
sometimes undetectable in the sparse limit, i.e., that no algorithm can
identify a partition correlated with the partition used to generate an
instance, if the instance is sparse enough and infinitely large. In this
contribution, we treat the finite case explicitly, using arguments drawn from
information theory and statistics. We give a necessary condition for
finite-size detectability in the general SBM. We then distinguish the concept
of average detectability from the concept of instance-by-instance detectability
and give explicit formulas for both definitions. Using these formulas, we prove
that there exist large equivalence classes of parameters, where widely
different network ensembles are equally detectable with respect to our
definitions of detectability. In an extensive case study, we investigate the
finite-size detectability of a simplified variant of the SBM, which encompasses
a number of important models as special cases. These models include the
symmetric SBM, the planted coloring model, and more exotic SBMs not previously
studied. We conclude with three appendices, where we study the interplay of
noise and detectability, establish a connection between our
information-theoretic approach and random matrix theory, and provide proofs of
some of the more technical results.

 <dc:title>An Entropic Measure of Nonclassicality of Single Mode Quantum Light</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Optics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Nonclassical states of a quantized light are described in terms of
Glauber-Sudarshan P function which is not a genuine classical probability
function. Despite several attempts, defining a uniform measure of
nonclassicality (NC) for the single mode quantum states of light is yet an open
task. Here, we propose a measure of NC of single mode quantum states of light,
in terms of its Wehrl entropy, that require no numerical minimization. It
exploits classical like Q distribution which could be calculated easily as well
be retrieved experimentally in optical heterodyne detection. We show that,
alongwith the simple states which are generated under single NC-inducing
operations, for the broader class of states, generated under multiple
NC-inducing operations, our measure quantifies the NC consistently, in contrast
to the other measures. The work, presented in this paper, becomes important in
describing NC of quantum processes including open quantum systems as well as in
understanding the role of single mode NC as a resource in several information
processing protocols.

 <dc:title>Evaluating Ternary Adders using a hybrid Memristor / CMOS approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fey, Dietmar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the potentials of using a hybrid memristor CMOS
technology, called MeMOS, for the realisation of ternary adders. Ternary adders
exploit the qualitative advantage of multi-value storage capability of
memristors compared to conventional CMOS flip-flops storing only binary values
in one cell. Furthermore they carry out an addition in $O(1)$ and are therefore
considered. The MeMOS approach is compared to a CMOS solution for the ternary
adders using multi value memristors as registers concerning the achievable
latency and the energy consumption. It is shown that using the TEAM, VTEAM
model and a model considering commercially available memristors from Known the
approach of using CMOS ternary adders using memristors as multi-value register
memory is to prefer. MeMOS circuits have advantages for a static operation
mode, i.e. if they are operated after a reset.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Building Part-of-Speech (POS) taggers for code-mixed Indian languages is a
particularly challenging problem in computational linguistics due to a dearth
of accurately annotated training corpora. ICON, as part of its NLP tools
contest has organized this challenge as a shared task for the second
consecutive year to improve the state-of-the-art. This paper describes the POS
tagger built at Surukam to predict the coarse-grained and fine-grained POS tags
for three language pairs - Bengali-English, Telugu-English and Hindi-English,
with the text spanning three popular social media platforms - Facebook,
WhatsApp and Twitter. We employed Conditional Random Fields as the sequence
tagging algorithm and used a library called sklearn-crfsuite - a thin wrapper
around CRFsuite for training our model. Among the features we used include -
character n-grams, language information and patterns for emoji, number,
punctuation and web-address. Our submissions in the constrained
environment,i.e., without making any use of monolingual POS taggers or the
like, obtained an overall average F1-score of 76.45%, which is comparable to
the 2015 winning score of 76.79%.

 <dc:title>Graph or Relational Databases: A Speed Comparison for Process Mining

 <dc:subject>H.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Process-Aware Information System (PAIS) are IT systems that manages, supports
business processes and generate large event logs from execution of business
processes. An event log is represented as a tuple of the form CaseID,
TimeStamp, Activity and Actor. Process Mining is an emerging area of research
that deals with the study and analysis of business processes based on event
logs. Process Mining aims at analyzing event logs and discover business process
models, enhance them or check for conformance with an a priori model. The large
volume of event logs generated are stored in databases. Relational databases
perform well for certain class of applications. However, there are certain
class of applications for which relational databases are not able to scale. A
number of NoSQL databases have emerged to encounter the challenges of
scalability. Discovering social network from event logs is one of the most
challenging and important Process Mining task. Similar-Task and Sub-Contract
algorithms are some of the most widely used Organizational Mining techniques.
Our objective is to investigate which of the databases (Relational or Graph)
perform better for Organizational Mining under Process Mining. An intersection
of Process Mining and Graph Databases can be accomplished by modelling these
Organizational Mining metrics with graph databases. We implement Similar-Task
and Sub-Contract algorithms on relational and NoSQL (graph-oriented) databases
using only query language constructs. We conduct empirical analysis on a large
real world data set to compare the performance of row-oriented database and
NoSQL graph-oriented database. We benchmark performance factors like query
execution time, CPU usage and disk/memory space usage for NoSQL graph-oriented
database against row-oriented database.

 <dc:description>  The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a structured repository of concepts
(HPO Terms) that are associated to one or more diseases. The process of
association is referred to as annotation. The relevance and the specificity of
both HPO terms and annotations are evaluated by a measure defined as
Information Content (IC). The analysis of annotated data is thus an important
challenge for bioinformatics. There exist different approaches of analysis.
From those, the use of Association Rules (AR) may provide useful knowledge, and
it has been used in some applications, e.g. improving the quality of
annotations. Nevertheless classical association rules algorithms do not take
into account the source of annotation nor the importance yielding to the
generation of candidate rules with low IC. This paper presents HPO-Miner (Human
Phenotype Ontology-based Weighted Association Rules) a methodology for
extracting Weighted Association Rules. HPO-Miner can extract relevant rules
from a biological point of view. A case study on using of HPO-Miner on publicly
available HPO annotation datasets is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our methodology.

 <dc:description>  Functions of brain areas in complex animals are believed to rely on the
dynamics of networks of neurons rather than on single neurons. On the other
hand, the network dynamics reflect and arise from the integration and
coordination of the activity of populations of single neurons. Understanding
how single-neurons and neural-circuits dynamics complement each other to
produce brain functions is thus of paramount importance. LFPs and EEGs are good
indicators of the dynamics of mesoscopic and macroscopic populations of
neurons, while microscopic-level activities can be documented by measuring the
membrane potential, the synaptic currents or the spiking activity of individual
neurons. In this thesis we develop mathematical modelling and mathematical
analysis tools that can help the interpretation of joint measures of neural
activity at microscopic and mesoscopic or macroscopic scales. In particular, we
develop network models of recurrent cortical circuits that can clarify the
impact of several aspects of single-neuron (i.e., microscopic-level) dynamics
on the activity of the whole neural population (as measured by LFP). We then
develop statistical tools to characterize the relationship between the action
potential firing of single neurons and mass signals. We apply these latter
analysis techniques to joint recordings of the firing activity of individual
cell-type identified neurons and mesoscopic (i.e., LFP) and macroscopic (i.e.,
EEG) signals in the mouse neocortex. We identified several general aspects of
the relationship between cell-specific neural firing and mass circuit activity,
providing for example general and robust mathematical rules which infer
single-neuron firing activity from mass measures such as the LFP and the EEG.

 <dc:description>  A partial password is a mode of password-based authentication that is widely
used, especially in the financial sector. It is based on a challenge-response
protocol, where at each login attempt, a challenge requesting characters from
randomly selected positions of a pre-shared secret is presented to the user.
This model could be seen as a cheap way of preventing for example a malware or
a key-logger installed on a user's device to learn the full password in a
single step. Despite of the widespread adoption of this mechanism, especially
by many UK banks, there is limited material in the open literature. Questions
like how the security of the scheme varies with the sampling method employed to
form the challenges or what are the existing server-side implementations are
left unaddressed. In this paper, we study questions like how the security of
this mechanism varies in relation to the number of challenge-response pairs
available to an attacker under different ways of generating challenges. In
addition, we discuss possible server-side implementations as &quot;unofficially&quot;
listed in different online forums by information security ex- perts. To the
best of our knowledge there is no formal academic literature in this direction
and one of the aims of this paper is to motivate other researchers to study
this topic.

 <dc:title>Parichayana: An Eclipse Plugin for Detecting Exception Handling

 <dc:description>  Anti-patterns and code-smells are signs in the source code which are not
defects (does not prevent the program from functioning and does not cause
compile errors) and are rather indicators of deeper and bigger problems.
Exception handling is a programming construct de- signed to handle the
occurrence of anomalous or exceptional conditions (that changes the normal flow
of program execution). In this paper, we present an Eclipse plug-in (called as
Parichayana) for detecting exception handling anti-patterns and code smells in
Java programs. Parichayana is capable of automatically detecting several
commonly occurring excep- tion handling programming mistakes. We extend the
Eclipse IDE and create new menu entries and associated action via the
Parichayana plug- in (free and open-source hosted on GitHub). We compare and
contrast Parichayana with several code smell detection tools and demonstrate
that our tool provides unique capabilities in context to existing tools. We
have created an update site and developers can use the Eclipse up- date manager
to install Parichayana from our site. We used Parichyana on several large
open-source Java based projects and detected presence of exception handling
anti-patterns

 <dc:title>An initial performance review of software components for a heterogeneous

 <dc:description>  The design of embedded systems is a complex activity that involves a lot of
decisions. With high performance demands of present day usage scenarios and
software, they often involve energy hungry state-of-the-art computing units.
While focusing on power consumption of computing units, the physical properties
of software are often ignored. Recently, there has been a growing interest to
quantify and model the physical footprint of software (e.g. consumed power,
generated heat, execution time, etc.), and a component based approach
facilitates methods for describing such properties. Based on these, software
architects can make energy-efficient software design solutions. This paper
presents power consumption and execution time profiling of a component software
that can be allocated on heterogeneous computing units (CPU, GPU, FPGA) of a
tracked robot.

 <dc:description>  Allocation of software components on a heterogeneous computing platform
involves hard decisions; handling different types of computing units with
specific processing paradigms and a number of software components which require
specific resources. An allocation method which explores the design space to
provide a system architect with deployment alternatives in an early design
phase can have a significant impact on the utilization of underlying platform.
In this paper we present SCALL, an early prototype tool which uses heuristics
and AHP for weighted multi-objective design space exploration to support
systems architects in complex allocation decisions in early design phases.

 <dc:description>  This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that is
often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models. Our basic idea is to
jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary in the
encoder and control the output words based on the estimation in the decoder.
Our method shows significant improvement over a strong RNN-based
encoder-decoder baseline and achieved its best results on an abstractive
summarization benchmark.

 <dc:description>  We give a finite presentation by generators and relations of unitary
operators expressible over the $\{\mathrm{CNOT}, T, X\}$ gate set, also known
as $\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral operators. To this end, we introduce a notion of
normal form for $\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral circuits and prove that every
$\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral operator admits a unique normal form. Moreover, we
show that in the presence of certain structural rules only finitely many
circuit identities are required to reduce an arbitrary $\mathrm{CNOT}$-dihedral
circuit to its normal form.
  By appropriately restricting our relations, we obtain a finite presentation
of unitary operators expressible over the $\{\mathrm{CNOT}, T, X\}$ gate set as
a corollary.

 <dc:description>  Marker-based and marker-less optical skeletal motion-capture methods use an
outside-in arrangement of cameras placed around a scene, with viewpoints
converging on the center. They often create discomfort by possibly needed
marker suits, and their recording volume is severely restricted and often
constrained to indoor scenes with controlled backgrounds. We therefore propose
a new method for real-time, marker-less and egocentric motion capture which
estimates the full-body skeleton pose from a lightweight stereo pair of fisheye
cameras that are attached to a helmet or virtual-reality headset. It combines
the strength of a new generative pose estimation framework for fisheye views
with a ConvNet-based body-part detector trained on a new automatically
annotated and augmented dataset. Our inside-in method captures full-body motion
in general indoor and outdoor scenes, and also crowded scenes.

 <dc:description>  Recent approaches for sentiment lexicon induction have capitalized on
pre-trained word embeddings that capture latent semantic properties. However,
embeddings obtained by optimizing performance of a given task (e.g. predicting
contextual words) are sub-optimal for other applications. In this paper, we
address this problem by exploiting task-specific representations, induced via
embedding sub-space projection. This allows us to expand lexicons describing
multiple semantic properties. For each property, our model jointly learns
suitable representations and the concomitant predictor. Experiments conducted
over multiple subjective lexicons, show that our model outperforms previous
work and other baselines; even in low training data regimes. Furthermore,
lexicon-based sentiment classifiers built on top of our lexicons outperform
similar resources and yield performances comparable to those of supervised
models.

 <dc:description>  We prove the computational intractability of rotating and placing $n$ square
tiles into a $1 \times n$ array such that adjacent tiles are compatible--either
equal edge colors, as in edge-matching puzzles, or matching tab/pocket shapes,
as in jigsaw puzzles. Beyond basic NP-hardness, we prove that it is NP-hard
even to approximately maximize the number of placed tiles (allowing blanks),
while satisfying the compatibility constraint between nonblank tiles, within a
factor of 0.9999999851. (On the other hand, there is an easy $1 \over
2$-approximation.) This is the first (correct) proof of inapproximability for
edge-matching and jigsaw puzzles. Along the way, we prove NP-hardness of
distinguishing, for a directed graph on $n$ nodes, between having a Hamiltonian
path (length $n-1$) and having at most $0.999999284 (n-1)$ edges that form a
vertex-disjoint union of paths. We use this gap hardness and gap-preserving
reductions to establish similar gap hardness for $1 \times n$ jigsaw and
edge-matching puzzles.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed
sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature,
sound, pressure, etc. However, the limited resources of sensors and hostile
environments in which they could be deployed, make this type of networks
vulnerable to several types of attacks similar to those occurring in ad hoc
networks. The most crucial and fundamental challenge that WSN is facing is
security. The primary subject of all my work is to address this issue. Due to
minimum capacity in term of memory cost, processing and physical accessibility
to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic. They are mostly
deployed in open area so are more exposed to different kinds of attacks. They
must be designed in a way to successfully recover itself from different kinds
of attacks. In this paper, we proposed a new lightweight cryptography algorithm
based on LEAP+. Our evaluations on TOSSIM give a precise and detailed idea of
the extra cost of consumption of resources needed to ensure the high level of
expected security.

 <dc:description>  We present lifestate rules--an approach for abstracting event-driven object
protocols. Developing applications against event-driven software frameworks is
notoriously difficult. One reason why is that to create functioning
applications, developers must know about and understand the complex protocols
that abstract the internal behavior of the framework. Such protocols intertwine
the proper registering of callbacks to receive control from the framework with
appropriate application programming interface (API) calls to delegate back to
it. Lifestate rules unify lifecycle and typestate constraints in one common
specification language. Our primary contribution is a model of event-driven
systems from which lifestate rules can be derived. We then apply specification
mining techniques to learn lifestate specifications for Android framework
types. In the end, our implementation is able to find several rules that
characterize actual behavior of the Android framework.

 <dc:title>Improved Stereo Matching with Constant Highway Networks and Reflective

 <dc:creator>Shaked, Amit</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an improved three-step pipeline for the stereo matching problem
and introduce multiple novelties at each stage. We propose a new highway
network architecture for computing the matching cost at each possible
disparity, based on multilevel weighted residual shortcuts, trained with a
hybrid loss that supports multilevel comparison of image patches. A novel
post-processing step is then introduced, which employs a second deep
convolutional neural network for pooling global information from multiple
disparities. This network outputs both the image disparity map, which replaces
the conventional &quot;winner takes all&quot; strategy, and a confidence in the
prediction. The confidence score is achieved by training the network with a new
technique that we call the reflective loss. Lastly, the learned confidence is
employed in order to better detect outliers in the refinement step. The
proposed pipeline achieves state of the art accuracy on the largest and most
competitive stereo benchmarks, and the learned confidence is shown to
outperform all existing alternatives.

 <dc:title>Very Fast Kernel SVM under Budget Constraints</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Picard, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a fast online Kernel SVM algorithm under tight
budget constraints. We propose to split the input space using LVQ and train a
Kernel SVM in each cluster. To allow for online training, we propose to limit
the size of the support vector set of each cluster using different strategies.
We show in the experiment that our algorithm is able to achieve high accuracy
while having a very high number of samples processed per second both in
training and in the evaluation.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Argumentation mining from social media content has attracted increasing
attention. The task is both challenging and rewarding. The informal nature of
user-generated content makes the task dauntingly difficult. On the other hand,
the insights that could be gained by a large-scale analysis of social media
argumentation make it a very worthwhile task. In this position paper I discuss
the motivation for social media argumentation mining, as well as the tasks and
challenges involved.

 <dc:title>Vertical stratification of forest canopy for segmentation of under-story

 <dc:description>  Airborne LiDAR point cloud representing a forest contains 3D data, from which
vertical stand structure even of understory layers can be derived. This paper
presents a tree segmentation approach for multi-story stands that stratifies
the point cloud to canopy layers and segments individual tree crowns within
each layer using a digital surface model based tree segmentation method. The
novelty of the approach is the stratification procedure that separates the
point cloud to an overstory and multiple understory tree canopy layers by
analyzing vertical distributions of LiDAR points within overlapping locales.
The procedure does not make a priori assumptions about the shape and size of
the tree crowns and can, independent of the tree segmentation method, be
utilized to vertically stratify tree crowns of forest canopies. We applied the
proposed approach to the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest - a natural
deciduous forest with complex and highly variable terrain and vegetation
structure. The segmentation results showed that using the stratification
procedure strongly improved detecting understory trees (from 46% to 68%) at the
cost of introducing a fair number of over-segmented understory trees (increased
from 1% to 16%), while barely affecting the overall segmentation quality of
overstory trees. Results of vertical stratification of the canopy showed that
the point density of understory canopy layers were suboptimal for performing a
reasonable tree segmentation, suggesting that acquiring denser LiDAR point
clouds would allow more improvements in segmenting understory trees. As shown
by inspecting correlations of the results with forest structure, the
segmentation approach is applicable to a variety of forest types.

 <dc:description>  We prove that counting copies of any graph $F$ in another graph $G$ can be
achieved using basic matrix operations on the adjacency matrix of $G$.
Moreover, the resulting algorithm is competitive for medium-sized $F$: our
algorithm recovers the best known complexity for rooted 6-clique counting and
improves on the best known for 9-cycle counting. Underpinning our proofs is the
new result that, for a general class of graph operators, matrix operations are
homomorphisms for operations on rooted graphs.

 <dc:description>  Techniques known as Nonlinear Set Membership prediction, Lipschitz
Interpolation or Kinky Inference are approaches to machine learning that
utilise presupposed Lipschitz properties to compute inferences over unobserved
function values. Provided a bound on the true best Lipschitz constant of the
target function is known a priori they offer convergence guarantees as well as
bounds around the predictions. Considering a more general setting that builds
on Hoelder continuity relative to pseudo-metrics, we propose an online method
for estimating the Hoelder constant online from function value observations
that possibly are corrupted by bounded observational errors. Utilising this to
compute adaptive parameters within a kinky inference rule gives rise to a
nonparametric machine learning method, for which we establish strong universal
approximation guarantees. That is, we show that our prediction rule can learn
any continuous function in the limit of increasingly dense data to within a
worst-case error bound that depends on the level of observational uncertainty.
We apply our method in the context of nonparametric model-reference adaptive
control (MRAC). Across a range of simulated aircraft roll-dynamics and
performance metrics our approach outperforms recently proposed alternatives
that were based on Gaussian processes and RBF-neural networks. For
discrete-time systems, we provide stability guarantees for our learning-based
controllers both for the batch and the online learning setting.

 <dc:title>A scalable approach for tree segmentation within small-footprint

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a distributed approach that scales up to segment tree
crowns within a LiDAR point cloud representing an arbitrarily large forested
area. The approach uses a single-processor tree segmentation algorithm as a
building block in order to process the data delivered in the shape of tiles in
parallel. The distributed processing is performed in a master-slave manner, in
which the master maintains the global map of the tiles and coordinates the
slaves that segment tree crowns within and across the boundaries of the tiles.
A minimal bias was introduced to the number of detected trees because of trees
lying across the tile boundaries, which was quantified and adjusted for.
Theoretical and experimental analyses of the runtime of the approach revealed a
near linear speedup. The estimated number of trees categorized by crown class
and the associated error margins as well as the height distribution of the
detected trees aligned well with field estimations, verifying that the
distributed approach works correctly. The approach enables providing
information of individual tree locations and point cloud segments for a
forest-level area in a timely manner, which can be used to create detailed
remotely sensed forest inventories. Although the approach was presented for
tree segmentation within LiDAR point clouds, the idea can also be generalized
to scale up processing other big spatial datasets.
  Highlights: - A scalable distributed approach for tree segmentation was
developed and theoretically analyzed. - ~2 million trees in a 7440 ha forest
was segmented in 2.5 hours using 192 cores. - 2% false positive trees were
identified as a result of the distributed run. - The approach can be used to
scale up processing other big spatial data

 <dc:description>  Short text clustering is a challenging problem due to its sparseness of text
representation. Here we propose a flexible Self-Taught Convolutional neural
network framework for Short Text Clustering (dubbed STC^2), which can flexibly
and successfully incorporate more useful semantic features and learn non-biased
deep text representation in an unsupervised manner. In our framework, the
original raw text features are firstly embedded into compact binary codes by
using one existing unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods. Then, word
embeddings are explored and fed into convolutional neural networks to learn
deep feature representations, meanwhile the output units are used to fit the
pre-trained binary codes in the training process. Finally, we get the optimal
clusters by employing K-means to cluster the learned representations. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective,
flexible and outperform several popular clustering methods when tested on three
public short text datasets.

adversarial models which specify constraints on packet arrivals and jamming. We
consider deterministic distributed broadcast algorithms and give upper bounds
on the worst-case packet latency and the number of queued packets in relation
to the parameters defining adversaries. Packet arrivals are determined by the
rate of injections and number of packets that can arrive in one round. Jamming
is constrained by the rate with which the adversary can jam rounds and by the
number of consecutive rounds that can be jammed.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a neural method for transfer learning between two (source and
target) classification tasks or aspects over the same domain. Rather than
training on target labels, we use a few keywords pertaining to source and
target aspects indicating sentence relevance instead of document class labels.
Documents are encoded by learning to embed and softly select relevant sentences
in an aspect-dependent manner. A shared classifier is trained on the source
encoded documents and labels, and applied to target encoded documents. We
ensure transfer through aspect-adversarial training so that encoded documents
are, as sets, aspect-invariant. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms different baselines and model variants on two datasets,
yielding an improvement of 27% on a pathology dataset and 5% on a review
dataset.

 <dc:description>  Video based person re-identification plays a central role in realistic
security and video surveillance. In this paper we propose a novel Accumulative
Motion Context (AMOC) network for addressing this important problem, which
effectively exploits the long-range motion context for robustly identifying the
same person under challenging conditions. Given a video sequence of the same or
different persons, the proposed AMOC network jointly learns appearance
representation and motion context from a collection of adjacent frames using a
two-stream convolutional architecture. Then AMOC accumulates clues from motion
context by recurrent aggregation, allowing effective information flow among
adjacent frames and capturing dynamic gist of the persons. The architecture of
AMOC is end-to-end trainable and thus motion context can be adapted to
complement appearance clues under unfavorable conditions (e.g. occlusions).
Extensive experiments are conduced on three public benchmark datasets, i.e.,
the iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011 and MARS datasets, to investigate the performance of
AMOC. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AMOC network
outperforms state-of-the-arts for video-based re-identification significantly
and confirm the advantage of exploiting long-range motion context for video
based person re-identification, validating our motivation evidently.

approach collects crown information such as steepness and height on-the-fly to
delineate crown boundaries, and most importantly, does not require a priori
assumptions of crown shape and size. The approach segments trees iteratively
starting from the tallest within a given area to the smallest until all trees
have been segmented. To evaluate its performance, the approach was applied to
the University of Kentucky Robinson Forest, a deciduous closed-canopy forest
with complex terrain and vegetation conditions. The approach identified 94% of
dominant and co-dominant trees with a false detection rate of 13%. About 62% of
intermediate, overtopped, and dead trees were also detected with a false
detection rate of 15%. The overall segmentation accuracy was 77%. Correlations
of the segmentation scores of the proposed approach with local terrain and
stand metrics was not significant, which is likely an indication of the
robustness of the approach as results are not sensitive to the differences in
terrain and stand structures.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation has become one of the most important components of online
services for improving sale records, however visualization work for online
recommendation is still very limited. This paper presents an interactive
recommendation approach with the following two components. First, rating
records are the most widely used data for online recommendation, but they are
often processed in high-dimensional spaces that can not be easily understood or
interacted with. We propose a Latent Semantic Model (LSM) that captures the
statistical features of semantic concepts on 2D domains and abstracts user
preferences for personal recommendation. Second, we propose an interactive
recommendation approach through a storytelling mechanism for promoting the
communication between the user and the recommendation system. Our approach
emphasizes interactivity, explicit user input, and semantic information convey;
thus it can be used by general users without any knowledge of recommendation or
visualization algorithms. We validate our model with data statistics and
demonstrate our approach with case studies from the MovieLens100K dataset. Our
approaches of latent semantic analysis and interactive recommendation can also
be extended to other network-based visualization applications, including
various online recommendation systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on one of the representative 5G network scenarios,
namely multi-tier heterogeneous cellular networks. User association is
investigated in order to reduce the down-link co-channel interference. Firstly,
in order to analyze the multi-tier heterogeneous cellular networks where the
base stations in different tiers usually adopt different transmission powers,
we propose a Transmission Power Normalization Model (TPNM), which is able to
convert a multi-tier cellular network into a single-tier network, such that all
base stations have the same normalized transmission power. Then using TPNM, the
signal and interference received at any point in the complex multi-tier
environment can be analyzed by considering the same point in the equivalent
single-tier cellular network model, thus significantly simplifying the
analysis. On this basis, we propose a new user association scheme in
heterogeneous cellular networks, where the base station that leads to the
smallest interference to other co-channel mobile stations is chosen from a set
of candidate base stations that satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) constraint
for an intended mobile station. Numerical results show that the proposed user
association scheme is able to significantly reduce the down-link interference
compared with existing schemes while maintaining a reasonably good QoS.

 <dc:title>Construction and Encoding of QC-LDPC Codes Using Group Rings</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khodaiemehr, Hassan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes which are known as
QC-LDPC codes, have many applications due to their simple encoding
implementation by means of cyclic shift registers. In this paper, we construct
QC-LDPC codes from group rings. A group ring is a free module (at the same time
a ring) constructed in a natural way from any given ring and any given group.
We present a structure based on the elements of a group ring for constructing
QC-LDPC codes. Some of the previously addressed methods for constructing
QC-LDPC codes based on finite fields are special cases of the proposed
construction method. The constructed QC-LDPC codes perform very well over the
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with iterative decoding in terms
of bit-error probability and block-error probability. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed codes have competitive performance in comparison
with the similar existing LDPC codes. Finally, we propose a new encoding method
for the proposed group ring based QC-LDPC codes that can be implemented faster
than the current encoding methods. The encoding complexity of the proposed
method is analyzed mathematically, and indicates a significate reduction in the
required number of operations, even when compared to the available efficient
encoding methods that have linear time and space complexities.

 <dc:description>  Today, smartphone devices are owned by a large portion of the population and
have become a very popular platform for accessing the Internet. Smartphones
provide the user with immediate access to information and services. However,
they can easily expose the user to many privacy risks. Applications that are
installed on the device and entities with access to the device's Internet
traffic can reveal private information about the smartphone user and steal
sensitive content stored on the device or transmitted by the device over the
Internet. In this paper, we present a method to reveal various demographics and
technical computer skills of smartphone users by their Internet traffic
records, using machine learning classification models. We implement and
evaluate the method on real life data of smartphone users and show that
smartphone users can be classified by their gender, smoking habits, software
programming experience, and other characteristics.

 <dc:description>  The TTE approach to Computable Analysis is the study of so-called
representations (encodings for continuous objects such as reals, functions, and
sets) with respect to the notions of computability they induce. A rich variety
of such representations had been devised over the past decades, particularly
regarding closed subsets of Euclidean space plus subclasses thereof (like
compact subsets). In addition, they had been compared and classified with
respect to both non-uniform computability of single sets and uniform
computability of operators on sets. In this paper we refine these
investigations from the point of view of computational complexity. Benefiting
from the concept of second-order representations and complexity recently
devised by Kawamura &amp; Cook (2012), we determine parameterized complexity bounds
for operators such as union, intersection, projection, and more generally
function image and inversion. By indicating natural parameters in addition to
the output precision, we get a uniform view on results by Ko (1991-2013),
Braverman (2004/05) and Zhao &amp; M\&quot;uller (2008), relating these problems to the
polynomial time (P)/unambiguous non-deterministic polynomial time
(UP)/non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) question in discrete complexity
theory.

 <dc:description>  How to implement an impeccable space system-of-systems (SoS) internetworking
architecture has been a significant issue in system engineering for years.
Reliable data transmission is considered one of the most important technologies
of space SoS internetworking systems. Due to the high bit error rate (BER),
long time delay and asymmetrical channel in the space communication
environment, the congestion control mechanism of classic transport control
protocols (TCP) shows unsatisfying performances. With the help of existing TCP
modifications, this paper contributes an aggressive congestion control
mechanism. The proposed mechanism is characterized with a fast start procedure,
as well as the feedback information to analyze network traffic and with a link
terminating processing mechanism, which can help to reveal the real reason of
packet loss, and maintain the size of congestion window at a high level.
Simulation results are shown in the end to verify the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  How to enhance the communication efficiency and quality on vehicular networks
is one critical important issue. While with the larger and larger scale of
vehicular networks in dense cities, the real-world datasets show that the
vehicular networks essentially belong to the complex network model. Meanwhile,
the extensive research on complex networks has shown that the complex network
theory can both provide an accurate network illustration model and further make
great contributions to the network design, optimization and management. In this
paper, we start with analyzing characteristics of a taxi GPS dataset and then
establishing the vehicular-to-infrastructure, vehicle-to-vehicle and the hybrid
communication model, respectively. Moreover, we propose a clustering algorithm
for station selection, a traffic allocation optimization model and an
information source selection model based on the communication performances and
complex network theory.

 <dc:description>  The recently announced Super Wi-Fi Network proposal in United States is
aiming to enable Internet access in a nation-wide area. As traditional
cable-connected power supply system becomes impractical or costly for a wide
range wireless network, new infrastructure deployment for Super Wi-Fi is
required. The fast developing Energy Harvesting (EH) techniques receive global
attentions for their potential of solving the above power supply problem. It is
a critical issue, from the user's perspective, how to make efficient network
selection and access strategies. Unlike traditional wireless networks, the
battery charge state and tendency in EH based networks have to be taken into
account when making network selection and access, which has not been well
investigated. In this paper, we propose a practical and efficient framework for
multiple base stations access strategy in an EH powered Super Wi-Fi network. We
consider the access strategy from the user's perspective, who exploits downlink
transmission opportunities from one base station. To formulate the problem, we
used Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) to model users'
observations on the base stations' battery situation and decisions on the base
station selection and access. Simulation results show that our methods are
efficacious and significantly outperform the traditional widely used CSMA
method.

x^{2^s}+1\rangle}$ is a chain ring. Furthermore, these results have been
generalized to $\lambda$-constacyclic codes for any unit $\lambda$ of the form
$4z-1$, $z\in GR(2^a, m)$. In this paper, we study more general cases and
investigate all cases where $\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\gamma)=
\frac{GR(p^a,m)[x]}{\langle x^{p^s}-\gamma \rangle}$ is a chain ring. In
particular, necessary and sufficient conditions for the ring
$\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\gamma)$ to be a chain ring are obtained. In addition, by
using this structure we investigate all $\gamma$-constacyclic codes over
$GR(p^a,m)$ when $\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\gamma)$ is a chain ring. Necessary and
sufficient conditions for the existence of self-orthogonal and self-dual
$\gamma$-constacyclic codes are also provided. Among others, for any prime $p$,
the structure of $\mathcal{R}_p(a,m,\gamma)=\frac{GR(p^a,m)[x]}{\langle
x^{p^s}-\gamma\rangle}$ is used to establish the Hamming and homogeneous
distances of $\gamma$-constacyclic codes.

 <dc:description>  Proper incentive mechanisms are critical for mobile crowdsensing systems to
motivate people to actively and persistently participate. This article provides
an exposition of design principles of six incentive mechanisms, drawing special
attention to the sustainability issue. We cover three primary classes of
incentive mechanisms: auctions, lotteries, and trust and reputation systems, as
well as three other frameworks of promising potential: bargaining games,
contract theory, and market-driven mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning from noisy data in practical settings
where the size of data is too large to store on a single machine. More
challenging, the data coming from the wild may contain malicious outliers. To
address the scalability and robustness issues, we present an online robust
learning (ORL) approach. ORL is simple to implement and has provable robustness
guarantee -- in stark contrast to existing online learning approaches that are
generally fragile to outliers. We specialize the ORL approach for two concrete
cases: online robust principal component analysis and online linear regression.
We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness advantages of ORL through
comprehensive simulations and predicting image tags on a large-scale data set.
We also discuss extension of the ORL to distributed learning and provide
experimental evaluations.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) setup where
full-duplex (FD) multi-antenna nodes apply linear beamformers to simultaneously
transmit and receive multiple streams over Rician fading channels. The exact
first and second positive moments of the residual self-interference (SI),
involving the squared norm of a sum of non-identically distributed random
variables, are derived in closed-form. The method of moments is hence invoked
to provide a Gamma approximation for the residual SI distribution. The proposed
theorem holds under arbitrary linear precoder/decoder design, number of
antennas and streams, and SI cancellation capability.

 <dc:description>  The stochastic interpretation of Parikh's game logic should not follow the
usual pattern of Kripke models, which in turn are based on the Kleisli
morphisms for the Giry monad, rather, a specific and more general approach to
probabilistic nondeterminism is required. We outline this approach together
with its probabilistic and measure theoretic basis, introducing in a leisurely
pace the Giry monad and their Kleisli morphisms together with important
techniques for manipulating them. Proof establishing specific techniques are
given, and pointers to the extant literature are provided. After working
through this tutorial, the reader should find it easier to follow the original
literature in this and related areas, and it should be possible for her or him
to appreciate measure theoretic arguments for original work in the areas of
Markov transition systems, and stochastic effectivity functions.

 <dc:description>  Many robotic planning applications involve continuous actions with highly
non-linear constraints, which cannot be modeled using modern planners that
construct a propositional representation. We introduce STRIPStream: an
extension of the STRIPS language which can model these domains by supporting
the specification of blackbox generators to handle complex constraints. The
outputs of these generators interact with actions through possibly infinite
streams of objects and static predicates. We provide two algorithms which both
reduce STRIPStream problems to a sequence of finite-domain planning problems.
The representation and algorithms are entirely domain independent. We
demonstrate our framework on simple illustrative domains, and then on a
high-dimensional, continuous robotic task and motion planning domain.

 <dc:description>  We examine the relationship between social structure and sentiment through
the analysis of a large collection of tweets about the Irish Marriage
Referendum of 2015. We obtain the sentiment of every tweet with the hashtags
#marref and #marriageref that was posted in the days leading to the referendum,
and construct networks to aggregate sentiment and use it to study the
interactions among users. Our results show that the sentiment of mention tweets
posted by users is correlated with the sentiment of received mentions, and
there are significantly more connections between users with similar sentiment
scores than among users with opposite scores in the mention and follower
networks. We combine the community structure of the two networks with the
activity level of the users and sentiment scores to find groups of users who
support voting `yes' or `no' in the referendum. There were numerous
conversations between users on opposing sides of the debate in the absence of
follower connections, which suggests that there were efforts by some users to
establish dialogue and debate across ideological divisions. Our analysis shows
that social structure can be integrated successfully with sentiment to analyse
and understand the disposition of social media users. These results have
potential applications in the integration of data and meta-data to study
opinion dynamics, public opinion modelling, and polling.

 <dc:description>  The $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ distribution is able to characterize different regions
in monopolarized SAR imagery. It is indexed by three parameters: the number of
looks (which can be estimated in the whole image), a scale parameter and a
texture parameter. This paper presents a new proposal for feature extraction
and region discrimination in SAR imagery, using the geodesic distance as a
measure of dissimilarity between $\mathcal{G}_I^0$ models. We derive geodesic
distances between models that describe several practical situations, assuming
the number of looks known, for same and different texture and for same and
different scale. We then apply this new tool to the problems of (i)~identifying
edges between regions with different texture, and (ii)~quantify the
dissimilarity between pairs of samples in actual SAR data. We analyze the
advantages of using the geodesic distance when compared to stochastic
distances.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Geometry-based Comparison of Secrecy Enhancement Techniques

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This letter presents a performance comparison of two popular secrecy
enhancement techniques in wireless networks: (i) creating guard zones by
restricting transmissions of legitimate transmitters whenever any eavesdropper
is detected in their vicinity, and (ii) adding artificial noise to the
confidential messages to make it difficult for the eavesdroppers to decode
them. Focusing on a noise-limited regime, we use tools from stochastic geometry
to derive the secrecy outage probability at the eavesdroppers as well as the
coverage probability at the legitimate users for both these techniques. Using
these results, we derive a threshold on the density of the eavesdroppers below
which no secrecy enhancing technique is required to ensure a target secrecy
outage probability. For eavesdropper densities above this threshold, we
concretely characterize the regimes in which each technique outperforms the
other. Our results demonstrate that guard zone technique is better when the
distances between the transmitters and their legitimate receivers are higher
than a certain threshold.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Deep Neural Networks: Optimizing Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-offs

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce Dynamic Deep Neural Networks (D2NN), a new type of feed-forward
deep neural network that allows selective execution. Given an input, only a
subset of D2NN neurons are executed, and the particular subset is determined by
the D2NN itself. By pruning unnecessary computation depending on input, D2NNs
provide a way to improve computational efficiency. To achieve dynamic selective
execution, a D2NN augments a feed-forward deep neural network (directed acyclic
graph of differentiable modules) with controller modules. Each controller
module is a sub-network whose output is a decision that controls whether other
modules can execute. A D2NN is trained end to end. Both regular and controller
modules in a D2NN are learnable and are jointly trained to optimize both
accuracy and efficiency. Such training is achieved by integrating
backpropagation with reinforcement learning. With extensive experiments of
various D2NN architectures on image classification tasks, we demonstrate that
D2NNs are general and flexible, and can effectively optimize
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

 <dc:title>Topological Analysis and Synthesis of Structures related to Certain

 <dc:creator>Frasser, Carlos E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A fundamental characteristic of computer networks is their topological
structure. The question of the description of the structural characteristics of
computer networks represents a problem that is not completely solved. Search
methods for structures of computer networks, for which the values of the
selected parameters of their operation quality are extreme, have not been
completely developed. The construction of computer networks with optimum
indices of their operation quality is reduced to the solution of discrete
optimization problems over graphs. This paper describes in detail the
advantages of the practical use of k-geodetic graphs [2, 3] in the topological
design of computer networks as an alternative for the solution of the
fundamental problems mentioned above which, we believe, are still open. Also,
the topological analysis and synthesis of some classes of these networks have
been performed.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the use of carbon nanotube field effect transistors
(CNFETs) for the design of ternary full adder cells. The proposed circuits have
been designed based on the unique properties of CNFETs such as having desired
threshold voltages by adjusting diameter of the CNFETs gate nanotubes. The
proposed circuits are examined using HSPICE simulator with the standard 32 nm
CNFET technology. The proposed methods are simulated at different conditions
such as different supply voltages, different temperature and operational
frequencies. Simulation results show that the proposed designs are faster than
the state of the art CNFET based ternary full adders.

 <dc:description>  Biological cells are the prototypical example of active matter. Cells sense
and respond to mechanical, chemical and electrical environmental stimuli with a
range of behaviors, including dynamic changes in morphology and mechanical
properties, chemical uptake and secretion, cell differentiation, proliferation,
death, or migration.
  Modeling and simulation of such dynamic phenomena poses a number of
computational challenges. A modeling language to describe cellular dynamics
must be able to naturally represent complex intra and extra-cellular spatial
structures, and coupled mechanical, chemical and electrical processes. In order
to be useful to domain experts, a modeling language should be based on
concepts, terms and principles native to the problem domain. A compiler must
then be able to generate an executable model from this physically motivated
description. Finally, an executable model must efficiently calculate the time
evolution of such dynamic and inhomogeneous phenomena.
  We present a spatial hybrid systems modeling language, compiler and mesh-free
Lagrangian based simulation engine which will enable domain experts to define
models using natural, biologically motivated constructs and to simulate time
evolution of coupled cellular, mechanical and chemical processes acting on a
time varying number of cells and their environment.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the ever increasing number of filed patent applications every year, the
need for effective and efficient systems for managing such tremendous amounts
of data becomes inevitably important. Patent Retrieval (PR) is considered is
the pillar of almost all patent analysis tasks. PR is a subfield of Information
Retrieval (IR) which is concerned with developing techniques and methods that
effectively and efficiently retrieve relevant patent documents in response to a
given search request. In this paper we present a comprehensive review on PR
methods and approaches. It is clear that, recent successes and maturity in IR
applications such as Web search can not be transferred directly to PR without
deliberate domain adaptation and customization. Furthermore, state-of-the-art
performance in automatic PR is still around average. These observations
motivates the need for interactive search tools which provide cognitive
assistance to patent professionals with minimal effort. These tools must also
be developed in hand with patent professionals considering their practices and
expectations. We additionally touch on related tasks to PR such as patent
valuation, litigation, licensing, and highlight potential opportunities and
open directions for computational scientists in these domains.

 <dc:description>  Since the introduction of Direct Electron Detectors (DEDs), the resolution
and range of macromolecules amenable to this technique has significantly
widened, generating a broad interest that explains the well over a dozen
reviews in top journal in the last two years. Similarly, the number of job
offers to lead EM groups and/or coordinate EM facilities has exploded, and FEI
(the main microscope manufacturer for Life Sciences) has received more than 100
orders of high-end electron microscopes by summer 2016. Strategic corporate
movements are also happening, with very big players entering the market through
key acquisitions (Thermo Fisher has recently bought FEI for \$4.2B), partly
attracted by new Pharma interest in the field, now perceived to be in a
position to impact structure-based drug design. The scientific perspectives are
indeed extremely positive but, in these moments of well-founded generalized
optimists, we want to make a reflection on some of the hurdles ahead us, since
they certainly exist and they indeed limit the informational content of cryoEM
projects. Here we focus on image processing aspects, particularly in the
so-called area of Single Particle Analysis, discussing some of the current
resolution and high-throughput limiting factors.

 <dc:title>Can simple transmission chains foster collective intelligence in

 <dc:description>  In many social systems, groups of individuals can find remarkably efficient
solutions to complex cognitive problems, sometimes even outperforming a single
expert. The success of the group, however, crucially depends on how the
judgments of the group members are aggregated to produce the collective answer.
A large variety of such aggregation methods have been described in the
literature, such as averaging the independent judgments, relying on the
majority or setting up a group discussion. In the present work, we introduce a
novel approach for aggregating judgments - the transmission chain - which has
not yet been consistently evaluated in the context of collective intelligence.
In a transmission chain, all group members have access to a unique collective
solution and can improve it sequentially. Over repeated improvements, the
collective solution that emerges reflects the judgments of every group members.
We address the question of whether such a transmission chain can foster
collective intelligence for binary-choice problems. In a series of numerical
simulations, we explore the impact of various factors on the performance of the
transmission chain, such as the group size, the model parameters, and the
structure of the population. The performance of this method is compared to
those of the majority rule and the confidence-weighted majority. Finally, we
rely on two existing datasets of individuals performing a series of binary
decisions to evaluate the expected performances of the three methods
empirically. We find that the parameter space where the transmission chain has
the best performance rarely appears in real datasets. We conclude that the
transmission chain is best suited for other types of problems, such as those
that have cumulative properties.

 <dc:description>  Distributed storage systems such as Hadoop File System or Google File System
(GFS) ensure data availability and durability using replication. This paper is
focused on the analysis of the efficiency of replication mechanism that
determines the location of the copies of a given file at some server. The
variability of the loads of the nodes of the network is investigated for
several policies. Three replication mechanisms are tested against simulations
in the context of a real implementation of a such a system: Random, Least
Loaded and Power of Choice.
  The simulations show that some of these policies may lead to quite unbalanced
situations: if $\beta$ is the average number of copies per node it turns out
that, at equilibrium, the load of the nodes may exhibit a high variability. It
is shown in this paper that a simple variant of a power of choice type
algorithm has a striking effect on the loads of the nodes: at equilibrium, the
distribution of the load of a node has a bounded support, most of nodes have a
load less than $2\beta$ which is an interesting property for the design of the
storage space of these systems.
  Mathematical models are introduced and investigated to explain this
interesting phenomenon. The analysis of these systems turns out to be quite
complicated mainly because of the large dimensionality of the state spaces
involved. Our study relies on probabilistic methods, mean-field analysis, to
analyze the asymptotic behavior of an arbitrary node of the network when the
total number of nodes gets large. An additional ingredient is the use of
stochastic calculus with marked Poisson point processes to establish some of
our results.

 <dc:description>  Modern technology for producing extremely bright and coherent X-ray laser
pulses provides the possibility to acquire a large number of diffraction
patterns from individual biological nanoparticles, including proteins, viruses,
and DNA. These two-dimensional diffraction patterns can be practically
reconstructed and retrieved down to a resolution of a few \angstrom. In
principle, a sufficiently large collection of diffraction patterns will contain
the required information for a full three-dimensional reconstruction of the
biomolecule. The computational methodology for this reconstruction task is
still under development and highly resolved reconstructions have not yet been
produced.
  We analyze the Expansion-Maximization-Compression scheme, the current state
of the art approach for this very challenging application, by isolating
different sources of uncertainty. Through numerical experiments on synthetic
data we evaluate their respective impact. We reach conclusions of relevance for
handling actual experimental data, as well as pointing out certain improvements
to the underlying estimation algorithm.
  We also introduce a practically applicable computational methodology in the
form of bootstrap procedures for assessing reconstruction uncertainty in the
real data case. We evaluate the sharpness of this approach and argue that this
type of procedure will be critical in the near future when handling the
increasing amount of data.

 <dc:title>An affective computational model for machine consciousness</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chandra, Rohitash</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the past, several models of consciousness have become popular and have led
to the development of models for machine consciousness with varying degrees of
success and challenges for simulation and implementations. Moreover, affective
computing attributes that involve emotions, behavior and personality have not
been the focus of models of consciousness as they lacked motivation for
deployment in software applications and robots. The affective attributes are
important factors for the future of machine consciousness with the rise of
technologies that can assist humans. Personality and affection hence can give
an additional flavor for the computational model of consciousness in humanoid
robotics. Recent advances in areas of machine learning with a focus on deep
learning can further help in developing aspects of machine consciousness in
areas that can better replicate human sensory perceptions such as speech
recognition and vision. With such advancements, one encounters further
challenges in developing models that can synchronize different aspects of
affective computing. In this paper, we review some existing models of
consciousnesses and present an affective computational model that would enable
the human touch and feel for robotic systems.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel algorithm for weakly supervised semantic segmentation
based on image-level class labels only. In weakly supervised setting, it is
commonly observed that trained model overly focuses on discriminative parts
rather than the entire object area. Our goal is to overcome this limitation
with no additional human intervention by retrieving videos relevant to target
class labels from web repository, and generating segmentation labels from the
retrieved videos to simulate strong supervision for semantic segmentation.
During this process, we take advantage of image classification with
discriminative localization technique to reject false alarms in retrieved
videos and identify relevant spatio-temporal volumes within retrieved videos.
Although the entire procedure does not require any additional supervision, the
segmentation annotations obtained from videos are sufficiently strong to learn
a model for semantic segmentation. The proposed algorithm substantially
outperforms existing methods based on the same level of supervision and is even
as competitive as the approaches relying on extra annotations.

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the channel estimation problem in multi-user
millimeter wave (mmWave) wireless systems with large antenna arrays. We develop
a novel simultaneous-estimation with iterative fountain training (SWIFT)
framework, in which multiple users estimate their channels at the same time and
the required number of channel measurements is adapted to various channel
conditions of different users. To achieve this, we represent the beam direction
estimation process by a graph, referred to as the beam-on-graph, and associate
the channel estimation process with a code-on-graph decoding problem.
Specifically, the base station (BS) and each user measure the channel with a
series of random combinations of transmit/receive beamforming vectors until the
channel estimate converges. As the proposed SWIFT does not adapt the BS's beams
to any single user, we are able to estimate all user channels simultaneously.
Simulation results show that SWIFT can significantly outperform the existing
random beamforming-based approaches, which use a predetermined number of
measurements, over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios and channel coherence
time. Furthermore, by utilizing the users' order in terms of completing their
channel estimation, our SWIFT framework can infer the sequence of users'
channel quality and perform effective user scheduling to achieve superior
performance.

 <dc:title>A time-variant channel prediction and feedback framework for

 <dc:description>  In interference channels, channel state information (CSI) can be exploited to
reduce the interference signal dimensions and thus achieve the optimal capacity
scaling, i.e. degrees of freedom, promised by the interference alignment
technique. However, imperfect CSI, due to channel estimation error, imperfect
CSI feedback and time selectivity of the channel, lead to a performance loss.
In this work, we propose a novel limited feedback algorithm for single-input
single-output interference alignment in time-variant channels. The feedback
algorithm encodes the channel evolution in a small number of subspace
coefficients, which allow for reduced-rank channel prediction to compensate for
the channel estimation error due to time selectivity of the fading process and
feedback delay. An upper bound for the rate loss caused by feedback
quantization and channel prediction is derived. Based on this bound, we develop
a dimension switching algorithm for the reduced-rank predictor to find the best
tradeoff between quantization- and prediction-error. Besides, we characterize
the scaling of the required number of feedback bits in order to decouple the
rate loss due to channel quantization from the transmit power. Simulation
results show that a rate gain over the traditional non-predictive feedback
strategy can be secured and a 60% higher rate is achieved at 20 dB
signal-to-noise ratio with moderate mobility.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first propose a novel generalized power iteration method
(GPI) to solve the quadratic problem on the Stiefel manifold (QPSM) as
min_{W^TW=I}Tr(W^TAW-2W^TB) along with the theoretical analysis. Accordingly,
its special case known as the orthogonal least square regression (OLSR) is
under further investigation. Based on the aforementioned studies, we then cast
major focus on solving the unbalanced orthogonal procrustes problem (UOPP). As
a result, not only a general convergent algorithm is derived theoretically but
the efficiency of the proposed approach is verified empirically as well.

 <dc:title>Multi-objective dynamic virtual machine consolidation in the cloud using

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel multi-objective ant colony system algorithm
for virtual machine (VM) consolidation in cloud data centers. The proposed
algorithm builds VM migration plans, which are then used to minimize
over-provisioning of physical machines (PMs) by consolidating VMs on
under-utilized PMs. It optimizes two objectives that are ordered by their
importance. The first and foremost objective in the proposed algorithm is to
maximize the number of released PMs. Moreover, since VM migration is a
resource-intensive operation, it also tries to minimize the number of VM
migrations. The proposed algorithm is empirically evaluated in a series of
experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm provides
an efficient solution for VM consolidation in cloud data centers. Moreover, it
outperforms two existing ant colony optimization based VM consolidation
algorithms in terms of number of released PMs and number of VM migrations.

 <dc:description>  Cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) and Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) have
emerged as promising candidates for the next generation access network
techniques. MCC enables resource limited mobile devices to offload
computationally intensive tasks to the cloud, while C-RAN offers a technology
that addresses the increasing mobile traffic. In this paper, we propose a
protocol for task offloading and for managing resources in both C-RAN and
mobile cloud together using a centralised controller. Experiments on resource
management using cloud auto-scaling shows that resource (CPU, RAM, Storage)
scaling times vary.

 <dc:description>  This report describes the computation of gradients by algorithmic
differentiation for statistically optimum beamforming operations. Especially
the derivation of complex-valued functions is a key component of this approach.
Therefore the real-valued algorithmic differentiation is extended via the
complex-valued chain rule. In addition to the basic mathematic operations the
derivative of the eigenvalue problem with complex-valued eigenvectors is one of
the key results of this report. The potential of this approach is shown with
experimental results on the CHiME-3 challenge database. There, the beamforming
task is used as a front-end for an ASR system. With the developed derivatives a
joint optimization of a speech enhancement and speech recognition system w.r.t.
the recognition optimization criterion is possible.

 <dc:title>Time and space efficient generators for quasiseparable matrices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pernet, Clement</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Storjohann, Arne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The class of quasiseparable matrices is defined by the property that any
submatrix entirely below or above the main diagonal has small rank, namely
below a bound called the order of quasiseparability. These matrices arise
naturally in solving PDE's for particle interaction with the Fast Multi-pole
Method (FMM), or computing generalized eigenvalues. From these application
fields, structured representations and algorithms have been designed in
numerical linear algebra to compute with these matrices in time linear in the
matrix dimension and either quadratic or cubic in the quasiseparability order.
Motivated by the design of the general purpose exact linear algebra library
LinBox, and by algorithmic applications in algebraic computing, we adapt
existing techniques introduce novel ones to use quasiseparable matrices in
exact linear algebra, where sub-cubic matrix arithmetic is available. In
particular, we will show, the connection between the notion of
quasiseparability and the rank profile matrix invariant, that we have
introduced in 2015. It results in two new structured representations, one being
a simpler variation on the hierarchically semiseparable storage, and the second
one exploiting the generalized Bruhat decomposition. As a consequence, most
basic operations, such as computing the quasiseparability orders, applying a
vector, a block vector, multiplying two quasiseparable matrices together,
inverting a quasiseparable matrix, can be at least as fast and often faster
than previous existing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The data warehousing and OLAP technologies are now moving onto handling
complex data that mostly originate from the Web. However, intagrating such data
into a decision-support process requires their representation under a form
processable by OLAP and/or data mining techniques. We present in this paper a
complex data warehousing methodology that exploits XML as a pivot language. Our
approach includes the integration of complex data in an ODS, under the form of
XML documents; their dimensional modeling and storage in an XML data warehouse;
and their analysis with combined OLAP and data mining techniques. We also
address the crucial issue of performance in XML warehouses.

 <dc:description>  Data warehouse architectural choices and optimization techniques are critical
to decision support query performance. To facilitate these choices, the
performance of the designed data warehouse must be assessed, usually with
benchmarks. These tools can either help system users comparing the performances
of different systems, or help system engineers testing the effect of various
design choices. While the Transaction Processing Performance Council's standard
benchmarks address the first point, they are not tunable enough to address the
second one and fail to model different data warehouse schemas. By contrast, our
Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows generating various ad-hoc
synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is implemented as a Java free
software that can be interfaced with most existing relational database
management systems. The full specifications of DWEB, as well as experiments we
performed to illustrate how our benchmark may be used, are provided in this
paper.

 <dc:title>Evaluating the Dynamic Behavior of Database Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the effect that changing access patterns has on the
performance of database management systems. Changes in access patterns play an
important role in determining the efficiency of key performance optimization
techniques, such as dynamic clustering, prefetching, and buffer replacement.
However, all existing benchmarks or evaluation frameworks produce static access
patterns in which objects are always accessed in the same order repeatedly.
Hence, we have proposed the Dynamic Evaluation Framework (DEF) that simulates
access pattern changes using configurable styles of change. DEF has been
designed to be open and fully extensible (e.g., new access pattern change
models can be added easily). In this paper, we instantiate DEF into the Dynamic
object Evaluation Framework (DoEF) which is designed for object databases,
i.e., object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multi-media
databases or most XML databases.The capabilities of DoEF have been evaluated by
simulating the execution of four different dynamic clustering algorithms. The
results confirm our analysis that flexible conservative re-clustering is the
key in determining a clustering algorithm's ability to adapt to changes in
access pattern. These results show the effectiveness of DoEF at determining the
adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern
in a simulation environment. In a second set of experiments, we have used DoEF
to compare the performance of two real-life object stores : Platypus and SHORE.
DoEF has helped to reveal the poor swapping performance of Platypus.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed
sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature,
sound, pressure, etc. The most crucial and fundamental challenge facing WSN is
security. Due to minimum capacity in-term of memory cost, processing and
physical accessibility to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic.
They are mostly deployed in open area, which expose them to different kinds of
attacks. In this paper, we present an illustration of different attacks and
vulnerabilities in WSN. Then we proposed a new lightweight cryptography
algorithm for identifying compromised node in WSN called Leap Enhanced. Our
evaluations on TOSSIM give a precise and detailed idea of the extra cost of
consumption of resources needed to ensure the high level of expected security
compared to other cryptography schemes in literature.

 <dc:description>  Generalization performance of trained computer vision systems that use
computer graphics (CG) generated data is not yet effective due to the concept
of 'domain-shift' between virtual and real data. Although simulated data
augmented with a few real world samples has been shown to mitigate domain shift
and improve transferability of trained models, guiding or bootstrapping the
virtual data generation with the distributions learnt from target real world
domain is desired, especially in the fields where annotating even few real
images is laborious (such as semantic labeling, and intrinsic images etc.). In
order to address this problem in an unsupervised manner, our work combines
recent advances in CG (which aims to generate stochastic scene layouts coupled
with large collections of 3D object models) and generative adversarial training
(which aims train generative models by measuring discrepancy between generated
and real data in terms of their separability in the space of a deep
discriminatively-trained classifier). Our method uses iterative estimation of
the posterior density of prior distributions for a generative graphical model.
This is done within a rejection sampling framework. Initially, we assume
uniform distributions as priors on the parameters of a scene described by a
generative graphical model. As iterations proceed the prior distributions get
updated to distributions that are closer to the (unknown) distributions of
target data. We demonstrate the utility of adversarially tuned scene generation
on two real-world benchmark datasets (CityScapes and CamVid) for traffic scene
semantic labeling with a deep convolutional net (DeepLab). We realized
performance improvements by 2.28 and 3.14 points (using the IoU metric) between
the DeepLab models trained on simulated sets prepared from the scene generation
models before and after tuning to CityScapes and CamVid respectively.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the fine-grained connections between the average degree and the
power-law degree distribution exponent in growing information networks. Our
starting observation is a power-law degree distribution with a decreasing
exponent and increasing average degree as a function of the network size. Our
experiments are based on three Twitter at-mention networks and three more from
the Koblenz Network Collection. We observe that popular network models cannot
explain decreasing power-law degree distribution exponent and increasing
average degree at the same time.
  We propose a model that is the combination of exponential growth, and a
power-law developing network, in which new &quot;homophily&quot; edges are continuously
added to nodes proportional to their current homophily degree. Parameters of
the average degree growth and the power-law degree distribution exponent
functions depend on the ratio of the network growth exponent parameters.
Specifically, we connect the growth of the average degree to the decreasing
exponent of the power-law degree distribution. Prior to our work, only one of
the two cases were handled. Existing models and even their combinations can
only reproduce some of our key new observations in growing information
networks.

 <dc:description>  This article presents an empirical study of how the use of relational
database access technologies in open source Java projects evolves over time.
Our observations may be useful to project managers to make more informed
decisions on which technologies to introduce into an existing project and when.
We selected 2,457 Java projects on GitHub using the low-level JDBC technology
and higher-level object relational mappings such as Hibernate XML configuration
files and JPA annotations. At a coarse-grained level, we analysed the
probability of introducing such technologies over time, as well as the
likelihood that multiple technologies co-occur within the same project. At a
fine-grained level, we analysed to which extent these different technologies
are used within the same set of project files. We also explored how the
introduction of a new database technology in a Java project impacts the use of
existing ones. We observed that, contrary to what could have been expected,
object-relational mapping technologies do not tend to replace existing ones but
rather complement them.

 <dc:description>  Motif finding in DNA, RNA and proteins plays an important role in life
science research. Recent patents concerning motif finding in the biomolecular
data are recorded in the DNA Patent Database which serves as a resource for
policy makers and members of the general public interested in fields like
genomics, genetics and biotechnology. In this paper we present a computational
approach to mining for RNA tertiary motifs in genomic sequences. Specifically
we describe a method, named CSminer, for finding RNA coaxial helical stackings
in genomes. A coaxial helical stacking occurs in an RNA tertiary structure
where two separate helical elements form a pseudocontiguous helix and provides
thermodynamic stability to the molecule as a whole. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:title>Toward sensitive document release with privacy guarantees</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>S&#xe1;nchez, David</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Privacy has become a serious concern for modern Information Societies. The
sensitive nature of much of the data that are daily exchanged or released to
untrusted parties requires that responsible organizations undertake appropriate
privacy protection measures. Nowadays, much of these data are texts (e.g.,
emails, messages posted in social media, healthcare outcomes, etc.) that,
because of their unstructured and semantic nature, constitute a challenge for
automatic data protection methods. In fact, textual documents are usually
protected manually, in a process known as document redaction or sanitization.
To do so, human experts identify sensitive terms (i.e., terms that may reveal
identities and/or confidential information) and protect them accordingly (e.g.,
via removal or, preferably, generalization). To relieve experts from this
burdensome task, in a previous work we introduced the theoretical basis of
C-sanitization, an inherently semantic privacy model that provides the basis to
the development of automatic document redaction/sanitization algorithms and
offers clear and a priori privacy guarantees on data protection; even though
its potential benefits C-sanitization still presents some limitations when
applied to practice (mainly regarding flexibility, efficiency and accuracy). In
this paper, we propose a new more flexible model, named (C, g(C))-sanitization,
which enables an intuitive configuration of the trade-off between the desired
level of protection (i.e., controlled information disclosure) and the
preservation of the utility of the protected data (i.e., amount of semantics to
be preserved). Moreover, we also present a set of technical solutions and
algorithms that provide an efficient and scalable implementation of the model
and improve its practical accuracy, as we also illustrate through empirical
experiments.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates efficient techniques to collect and concentrate an
under-actuated particle swarm despite obstacles. Concentrating a swarm of
particles is of critical importance in health-care for targeted drug delivery,
where micro-scale particles must be steered to a goal location. Individual
particles must be small in order to navigate through micro-vasculature, but
decreasing size brings new challenges. Individual particles are too small to
contain on-board power or computation and are instead controlled by a global
input, such as an applied fluidic flow or electric field.
  To make progress, this paper considers a swarm of robots initialized in a
grid world in which each position is either free-space or obstacle. This paper
provides algorithms that collect all the robots to one position and compares
these algorithms on the basis of efficiency and implementation time.

 <dc:title>Retrieving Similar X-Ray Images from Big Image Data Using Radon Barcodes

 <dc:description>  The idea of Radon barcodes (RBC) has been introduced recently. In this paper,
we propose a content-based image retrieval approach for big datasets based on
Radon barcodes. Our method (Single Projection Radon Barcode, or SP-RBC) uses
only a few Radon single projections for each image as global features that can
serve as a basis for weak learners. This is our most important contribution in
this work, which improves the results of the RBC considerably. As a matter of
fact, only one projection of an image, as short as a single SURF feature
vector, can already achieve acceptable results. Nevertheless, using multiple
projections in a long vector will not deliver anticipated improvements. To
exploit the information inherent in each projection, our method uses the
outcome of each projection separately and then applies more precise local
search on the small subset of retrieved images. We have tested our method using
IRMA 2009 dataset a with 14,400 x-ray images as part of imageCLEF initiative.
Our approach leads to a substantial decrease in the error rate in comparison
with other non-learning methods.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Deep-HiTS, a rotation invariant convolutional neural network
(CNN) model for classifying images of transients candidates into artifacts or
real sources for the High cadence Transient Survey (HiTS). CNNs have the
advantage of learning the features automatically from the data while achieving
high performance. We compare our CNN model against a feature engineering
approach using random forests (RF). We show that our CNN significantly
outperforms the RF model reducing the error by almost half. Furthermore, for a
fixed number of approximately 2,000 allowed false transient candidates per
night we are able to reduce the miss-classified real transients by
approximately 1/5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time CNNs
have been used to detect astronomical transient events. Our approach will be
very useful when processing images from next generation instruments such as the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We have made all our code and data
available to the community for the sake of allowing further developments and
comparisons at https://github.com/guille-c/Deep-HiTS.

 <dc:description>  For nanotechnology, the semiconductor device is scaled down dramatically with
additional strain engineering for device enhancement, the overall device
characteristic is no longer dominated by the device size but also circuit
layout. The higher order layout effects, such as well proximity effect (WPE),
oxide spacing effect (OSE) and poly spacing effect (PSE), play an important
role for the device performance, it is critical to understand Design for
Manufacturability (DFM) impacts with various layout topology toward the overall
circuit performance. Currently, the layout effects (WPE, OSE and PSE) are
validated through digital standard cell and analog differential pair test
structure. However, two analog layout structures: the guard ring and dummy fill
impact are not well studied yet, then, this paper describes the current mirror
test circuit to examine the guard ring and dummy fills DFM impacts using TSMC
28nm HPM process.

 <dc:title>Conceptual Spaces for Cognitive Architectures: A Lingua Franca for
  Different Levels of Representation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  During the last decades, many cognitive architectures (CAs) have been
realized adopting different assumptions about the organization and the
representation of their knowledge level. Some of them (e.g. SOAR [Laird
(2012)]) adopt a classical symbolic approach, some (e.g. LEABRA [O'Reilly and
Munakata (2000)]) are based on a purely connectionist model, while others (e.g.
CLARION [Sun (2006)] adopt a hybrid approach combining connectionist and
symbolic representational levels. Additionally, some attempts (e.g. biSOAR)
trying to extend the representational capacities of CAs by integrating
diagrammatical representations and reasoning are also available [Kurup and
Chandrasekaran (2007)]. In this paper we propose a reflection on the role that
Conceptual Spaces, a framework developed by Peter G\&quot;ardenfors [G\&quot;ardenfors
(2000)] more than fifteen years ago, can play in the current development of the
Knowledge Level in Cognitive Systems and Architectures. In particular, we claim
that Conceptual Spaces offer a lingua franca that allows to unify and
generalize many aspects of the symbolic, sub-symbolic and diagrammatic
approaches (by overcoming some of their typical problems) and to integrate them
on a common ground. In doing so we extend and detail some of the arguments
explored by G\&quot;ardenfors [G\&quot;ardenfors (1997)] for defending the need of a
conceptual, intermediate, representation level between the symbolic and the
sub-symbolic one.

 <dc:description>  Copy-move forgery is the most popular and simplest image manipulation method.
In this type of forgery, an area from the image copied, then after post
processing such as rotation and scaling, placed on the destination. The goal of
Copy-move forgery is to hide or duplicate one or more objects in the image.
Key-point based Copy-move forgery detection methods have five main steps:
preprocessing, feature extraction, matching, transform estimation and post
processing that matching and transform estimation have important effect on the
detection. More over the error could happens in some steps due to the noise.
The existing methods process these steps separately and in case of having an
error in a step, this error could be propagated to the following steps and
affects the detection. To solve the above mentioned problem, in this paper the
steps of the detection system interact with each other and if an error happens
in a step, following steps are trying to detect and solve it. We formulate this
interaction by defining and optimizing a cost function. This function includes
matching and transform estimation steps. Then in an iterative procedure the
steps are executed and in case of detecting error, the error will be corrected.
The efficiency of the proposed method analyzed in diverse cases such as pixel
image precision level on the simple forgery images, robustness to the rotation
and scaling, detecting professional forgery images and the precision of the
transformation matrix. The results indicate the better efficiency of the
proposed method.

 <dc:title>SINR Outage Evaluation in Cellular Networks: Saddle Point Approximation
  (SPA) Using Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) Distribution</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SINR) outage probability is among
one of the key performance metrics of a wireless cellular network. In this
paper, we propose a semi-analytical method based on saddle point approximation
(SPA) technique to calculate the SINR outage of a wireless system whose SINR
can be modeled in the form $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^M X_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i +1}$ where
$X_i$ denotes the useful signal power, $Y_i$ denotes the power of the
interference signal, and $\sum_{i=1}^M X_i$, $\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i$ are independent
random variables. Both $M$ and $N$ can also be random variables. The proposed
approach is based on the saddle point approximation to cumulative distribution
function (CDF) as given by \tit{Wood-Booth-Butler formula}. The approach is
applicable whenever the cumulant generating function (CGF) of the received
signal and interference exists, and it allows us to tackle distributions with
large skewness and kurtosis with higher accuracy. In this regard, we exploit a
four parameter \tit{normal-inverse Gaussian} (NIG) distribution as a base
distribution. Given that the skewness and kurtosis satisfy a specific
condition, NIG-based SPA works reliably. When this condition is violated, we
recommend SPA based on normal or symmetric NIG distribution, both special cases
of NIG distribution, at the expense of reduced accuracy. For the purpose of
demonstration, we apply SPA for the SINR outage evaluation of a typical user
experiencing a downlink coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP) from the
base stations (BSs) that are modeled by homogeneous Poisson point process. We
characterize the outage of the typical user in scenarios such as (a)~when the
number and locations of interferers are random, and (b)~when the fading
channels and number of interferers are random. Numerical results are presented
to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed set of approximations.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid proliferation of Internet of Things and intelligent edge
devices, there is an increasing need for implementing machine learning
algorithms, including deep learning, on resource-constrained mobile embedded
devices with limited memory and computation power. Typical large Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) need large amounts of memory and computational power,
and cannot be deployed on embedded devices efficiently. We present Two-Bit
Networks (TBNs) for model compression of CNNs with edge weights constrained to
(-2, -1, 1, 2), which can be encoded with two bits. Our approach can reduce the
memory usage and improve computational efficiency significantly while achieving
good performance in terms of classification accuracy, thus representing a
reasonable tradeoff between model size and performance.

 <dc:description>  Speechreading is a notoriously difficult task for humans to perform. In this
paper we present an end-to-end model based on a convolutional neural network
(CNN) for generating an intelligible acoustic speech signal from silent video
frames of a speaking person. The proposed CNN generates sound features for each
frame based on its neighboring frames. Waveforms are then synthesized from the
learned speech features to produce intelligible speech. We show that by
leveraging the automatic feature learning capabilities of a CNN, we can obtain
state-of-the-art word intelligibility on the GRID dataset, and show promising
results for learning out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.

 <dc:title>Distributed Graph Layout for Scalable Small-world Network Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The in-memory graph layout or organization has a considerable impact on the
time and energy efficiency of distributed memory graph computations. It affects
memory locality, inter-task load balance, communication time, and overall
memory utilization. Graph layout could refer to partitioning or replication of
vertex and edge arrays, selective replication of data structures that hold
meta-data, and reordering vertex and edge identifiers. In this work, we present
DGL, a fast, parallel, and memory-efficient distributed graph layout strategy
that is specifically designed for small-world networks (low-diameter graphs
with skewed vertex degree distributions). Label propagation-based partitioning
and a scalable BFS-based ordering are the main steps in the layout strategy. We
show that the DGL layout can significantly improve end-to-end performance of
five challenging graph analytics workloads: PageRank, a parallel subgraph
enumeration program, tuned implementations of breadth-first search and
single-source shortest paths, and RDF3X-MPI, a distributed SPARQL query
processing engine. Using these benchmarks, we additionally offer a
comprehensive analysis on how graph layout affects the performance of graph
analytics with variable computation and communication characteristics.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our system created to detect stance in online
discussions. The goal is to identify whether the author of a comment is in
favor of the given target or against. Our approach is based on a maximum
entropy classifier, which uses surface-level, sentiment and domain-specific
features. The system was originally developed to detect stance in English
tweets. We adapted it to process Czech news commentaries.

 <dc:description>  We consider that a network is an observation, and a collection of observed
networks forms a sample. In this setting, we provide methods to test whether
all observations in a network sample are drawn from a specified model. We
achieve this by deriving, under the null of the graphon model, the joint
asymptotic properties of average subgraph counts as the number of observed
networks increases but the number of nodes in each network remains finite. In
doing so, we do not require that each observed network contains the same number
of nodes, or is drawn from the same distribution. Our results yield joint
confidence regions for subgraph counts, and therefore methods for testing
whether the observations in a network sample are drawn from: a specified
distribution, a specified model, or from the same model as another network
sample. We present simulation experiments and an illustrative example on a
sample of brain networks where we find that highly creative individuals' brains
present significantly more short cycles.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we suggest that in the framework of the Category Theory it is
possible to demonstrate the mathematical and logical \textit{dual equivalence}
between the category of the $q$-deformed Hopf Coalgebras and the category of
the $q$-deformed Hopf Algebras in QFT, interpreted as a thermal field theory.
Each pair algebra-coalgebra characterizes, indeed, a QFT system and its
mirroring thermal bath, respectively, so to model dissipative quantum systems
persistently in far-from-equilibrium conditions, with an evident significance
also for biological sciences. The $q$-deformed Hopf Coalgebras and the
$q$-deformed Hopf Algebras constitute two dual categories because characterized
by the same functor $T$, related with the Bogoliubov transform, and by its
contravariant application $T^{op}$, respectively. The \textit{q}-deformation
parameter, indeed, is related to the Bogoliubov angle, and it is effectively a
thermal parameter. Therefore, the different values of $q$ identify univocally,
and then label, the vacua appearing in the foliation process of the quantum
vacuum. This means that, in the framework of Universal Coalgebra, as general
theory of dynamic and computing systems (&quot;labelled state-transition systems&quot;),
the so labelled infinitely many quantum vacua can be interpreted as the Final
Coalgebra of an &quot;Infinite State Black-Box Machine&quot;. All this opens the way to
the possibility of designing a new class of universal quantum computing
architectures based on this coalgebraic formulation of QFT, as its ability of
naturally generating a Fibonacci progression demonstrates.

 <dc:title>Truthful Facility Location with Additive Errors</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We address the problem of locating facilities on the $[0,1]$ interval based
on reports from strategic agents. The cost of each agent is her distance to the
closest facility, and the global objective is to minimize either the maximum
cost of an agent or the social cost.
  As opposed to the extensive literature on facility location which considers
the multiplicative error, we focus on minimizing the worst-case additive error.
Minimizing the additive error incentivizes mechanisms to adapt to the size of
the instance. I.e., mechanisms can sacrifice little efficiency in small
instances (location profiles in which all agents are relatively close to one
another), in order to gain more [absolute] efficiency in large instances. We
argue that this measure is better suited for many manifestations of the
facility location problem in various domains.
  We present tight bounds for mechanisms locating a single facility in both
deterministic and randomized cases. We further provide several extensions for
locating multiple facilities.

 <dc:description>  We address the NP-hard problem of finding a non-overlapping dense packing
pattern for n Unequal Circle items in a two-dimensional Square Container
(PUC-SC) such that the size of the container is minimized. Based on our
previous work on an Action Space based Global Optimization (ASGO) that
approximates each circle item as a square item to efficiently find the large
unoccupied spaces, we propose an optimization algorithm based on the
Partitioned Action Space and Partitioned Circle Items (PAS-PCI). The PAS is to
partition the narrow action space on the long side to find two equal action
spaces to fully utilize the unoccupied spaces. The PCI is to partition the
circle items into four groups based on size for the basin hopping strategy.
Experiments on two sets of benchmark instances show the effectiveness of the
proposed method. In comparison with our previous algorithm ASGO on the 68
tested instances that ASGO published, PAS-PCI not only gains smaller containers
in 64 instances and matches the other 4 but also runs faster in most instances.
In comparison with the best record of the Packomania website on a total of 98
instances, PAS-PCI finds smaller containers on 82 and matches the other 16.
Note that we updated 19 records for (47-48, 51-54, 57, 61-72) that had been
kept unchanged since 2013.

 <dc:description>  Recently, distributed processing of large dynamic graphs has become very
popular, especially in certain domains such as social network analysis, Web
graph analysis and spatial network analysis. In this context, many
distributed/parallel graph processing systems have been proposed, such as
Pregel, GraphLab, and Trinity. These systems can be divided into two
categories: (1) vertex-centric and (2) block-centric approaches. In
vertex-centric approaches, each vertex corresponds to a process, and message
are exchanged among vertices. In block-centric approaches, the unit of
computation is a block, a connected subgraph of the graph, and message
exchanges occur among blocks. In this paper, we are considering the issues of
scale and dynamism in the case of block-centric approaches. We present bladyg,
a block-centric framework that addresses the issue of dynamism in large-scale
graphs. We present an implementation of BLADYG on top of akka framework. We
experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed framework.

 <dc:title>Discrete Optimal Global Convergence of an Evolutionary Algorithm for

 <dc:description>  A review of the properties that bond the particles under Lennard Jones
Potential allow to states properties and conditions for building evolutive
algorithms using the CB lattice with other different lattices. The new lattice
is called CB lattice and it is based on small cubes. A set of propositions
states convergence and optimal conditions over the CB lattice for an
evolutionary algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm is a reload version of
previous genetic algorithms based in phenotypes. The novelty using CB lattice,
together with the other lattices, and ad-hoc cluster segmentation and
enumeration, is to allow the combination of genotype (DNA coding for cluster
using their particle's number) and phenotype (geometrical shapes using
particle's coordinates in 3D). A parallel version of an evolutionary algorithm
for determining the global optimality is depicted. The results presented are
from a standalone program for a personal computer of the evolutionary
algorithm, which can estimate all putative optimal Lennard Jones Clusters from
13 to 1612 particles. The novelty are the theoretical results for the
evolutionary algorithm's efficiency, the strategies with phenotype or genotype,
and the classification of the clusters based in an ad-hoc geometric algorithm
for segmenting a cluster into its nucleus and layers. Also, the standalone
program is not only capable to replicate the optimal Lennard Jones clusters in
The Cambridge Cluster Database (CCD), but to find new ones.

 <dc:description>  Visual tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Recently, some
deep-learning-based tracking algorithms have been achieving record-breaking
performances. However, due to the high complexity of deep learning, most deep
trackers suffer from low tracking speed, and thus are impractical in many
real-world applications. Some new deep trackers with smaller network structure
achieve high efficiency while at the cost of significant decrease on precision.
In this paper, we propose to transfer the feature for image classification to
the visual tracking domain via convolutional channel reductions. The channel
reduction could be simply viewed as an additional convolutional layer with the
specific task. It not only extracts useful information for object tracking but
also significantly increases the tracking speed. To better accommodate the
useful feature of the target in different scales, the adaptation filters are
designed with different sizes. The yielded visual tracker is real-time and also
illustrates the state-of-the-art accuracies in the experiment involving two
well-adopted benchmarks with more than 100 test videos.

 <dc:description>  A new type of End-to-End system for text-dependent speaker verification is
presented in this paper. Previously, using the phonetically
discriminative/speaker discriminative DNNs as feature extractors for speaker
verification has shown promising results. The extracted frame-level (DNN
bottleneck, posterior or d-vector) features are equally weighted and aggregated
to compute an utterance-level speaker representation (d-vector or i-vector). In
this work we use speaker discriminative CNNs to extract the noise-robust
frame-level features. These features are smartly combined to form an
utterance-level speaker vector through an attention mechanism. The proposed
attention model takes the speaker discriminative information and the phonetic
information to learn the weights. The whole system, including the CNN and
attention model, is joint optimized using an end-to-end criterion. The training
algorithm imitates exactly the evaluation process --- directly mapping a test
utterance and a few target speaker utterances into a single verification score.
The algorithm can automatically select the most similar impostor for each
target speaker to train the network. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the
proposed end-to-end system on Windows $10$ &quot;Hey Cortana&quot; speaker verification
task.

 <dc:description>  Graph theoretical analysis of the community structure of networks attempts to
identify the communities (or modules) to which each node affiliates. However,
this is in most cases an ill-posed problem, as the affiliation of a node to a
single community is often ambiguous. Previous solutions have attempted to
identify all of the communities to which each node affiliates. Instead of
taking this approach, we introduce versatility, $V$, as a novel metric of nodal
affiliation: $V \sim 0$ means that a node is consistently assigned to a
specific community; $V \gg 0$ means it is inconsistently assigned to different
communities. Versatility works in conjunction with existing community detection
algorithms, and it satisfies many theoretically desirable properties in
idealised networks designed to maximise ambiguity of modular decomposition. The
local minima of global mean versatility identified the resolution parameters of
a hierarchical community detection algorithm that least ambiguously decomposed
the community structure of a social (karate club) network and the mouse brain
connectome. Our results suggest that nodal versatility is useful in quantifying
the inherent ambiguity of modular decomposition.

 <dc:description>  We analyzed the performance of a biologically inspired algorithm called the
Corrected Projections Algorithm (CPA) when a sparseness constraint is required
to unambiguously reconstruct an observed signal using atoms from an
overcomplete dictionary. By changing the geometry of the estimation problem,
CPA gives an analytical expression for a binary variable that indicates the
presence or absence of a dictionary atom using an L2 regularizer. The
regularized solution can be implemented using an efficient real-time
Kalman-filter type of algorithm. The smoother L2 regularization of CPA makes it
very robust to noise, and CPA outperforms other methods in identifying known
atoms in the presence of strong novel atoms in the signal.

 <dc:description>  Deep stacked RNNs are usually hard to train. Adding shortcut connections
across different layers is a common way to ease the training of stacked
networks. However, extra shortcuts make the recurrent step more complicated. To
simply the stacked architecture, we propose a framework called shortcut block,
which is a marriage of the gating mechanism and shortcuts, while discarding the
self-connected part in LSTM cell. We present extensive empirical experiments
showing that this design makes training easy and improves generalization. We
propose various shortcut block topologies and compositions to explore its
effectiveness. Based on this architecture, we obtain a 6% relatively
improvement over the state-of-the-art on CCGbank supertagging dataset. We also
get comparable results on POS tagging task.

 <dc:description>  Many biological processes are governed by protein-ligand interactions. One
such example is the recognition of self and nonself cells by the immune system.
This immune response process is regulated by the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) protein which is encoded by the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
complex. Understanding the binding potential between MHC and peptides can lead
to the design of more potent, peptide-based vaccines and immunotherapies for
infectious autoimmune diseases.
  We apply machine learning techniques from the natural language processing
(NLP) domain to address the task of MHC-peptide binding prediction. More
specifically, we introduce a new distributed representation of amino acids,
name HLA-Vec, that can be used for a variety of downstream proteomic machine
learning tasks. We then propose a deep convolutional neural network
architecture, name HLA-CNN, for the task of HLA class I-peptide binding
prediction. Experimental results show combining the new distributed
representation with our HLA-CNN architecture achieves state-of-the-art results
in the majority of the latest two Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) weekly
automated benchmark datasets. We further apply our model to predict binding on
the human genome and identify 15 genes with potential for self binding.

 <dc:description>  Point-Of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to mine a user's visiting history
and find her/his potentially preferred places. Although location recommendation
methods have been studied and improved pervasively, the challenges w.r.t
employing various influences including temporal aspect still remain. Inspired
by the fact that time includes numerous granular slots (e.g. minute, hour, day,
week and etc.), in this paper, we define a new problem to perform
recommendation through exploiting all diversified temporal factors. In
particular, we argue that most existing methods only focus on a limited number
of time-related features and neglect others. Furthermore, considering a
specific granularity (e.g. time of a day) in recommendation cannot always apply
to each user or each dataset. To address the challenges, we propose a
probabilistic generative model, named after Multi-aspect Time-related Influence
(MATI) to promote POI recommendation. We also develop a novel optimization
algorithm based on Expectation Maximization (EM). Our MATI model firstly
detects a user's temporal multivariate orientation using her check-in log in
Location-based Social Networks(LBSNs). It then performs recommendation using
temporal correlations between the user and proposed locations. Our method is
adaptable to various types of recommendation systems and can work efficiently
in multiple time-scales. Extensive experimental results on two large-scale LBSN
datasets verify the effectiveness of our method over other competitors.

 <dc:description>  Discovering causal models from observational and interventional data is an
important first step preceding what-if analysis or counterfactual reasoning. As
has been shown before, the direction of pairwise causal relations can, under
certain conditions, be inferred from observational data via standard
gradient-boosted classifiers (GBC) using carefully engineered statistical
features. In this paper we apply deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
this problem by plotting attribute pairs as 2-D scatter plots that are fed to
the CNN as images. We evaluate our approach on the 'Cause- Effect Pairs' NIPS
2013 Data Challenge. We observe that a weighted ensemble of CNN with the
earlier GBC approach yields significant improvement. Further, we observe that
when less training data is available, our approach performs better than the GBC
based approach suggesting that CNN models pre-trained to determine the
direction of pairwise causal direction could have wider applicability in causal
discovery and enabling what-if or counterfactual analysis.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new deep network for audio event recognition, called AENet. In
contrast to speech, sounds coming from audio events may be produced by a wide
variety of sources. Furthermore, distinguishing them often requires analyzing
an extended time period due to the lack of clear sub-word units that are
present in speech. In order to incorporate this long-time frequency structure
of audio events, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on
a large temporal input. In contrast to previous works this allows us to train
an audio event detection system end-to-end. The combination of our network
architecture and a novel data augmentation outperforms previous methods for
audio event detection by 16%. Furthermore, we perform transfer learning and
show that our model learnt generic audio features, similar to the way CNNs
learn generic features on vision tasks. In video analysis, combining visual
features and traditional audio features such as MFCC typically only leads to
marginal improvements. Instead, combining visual features with our AENet
features, which can be computed efficiently on a GPU, leads to significant
performance improvements on action recognition and video highlight detection.
In video highlight detection, our audio features improve the performance by
more than 8% over visual features alone.

 <dc:title>Akid: A Library for Neural Network Research and Production from a

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural networks are a revolutionary but immature technique that is fast
evolving and heavily relies on data. To benefit from the newest development and
newly available data, we want the gap between research and production as small
as possibly. On the other hand, differing from traditional machine learning
models, neural network is not just yet another statistic model, but a model for
the natural processing engine --- the brain. In this work, we describe a neural
network library named {\texttt akid}. It provides higher level of abstraction
for entities (abstracted as blocks) in nature upon the abstraction done on
signals (abstracted as tensors) by Tensorflow, characterizing the dataism
observation that all entities in nature processes input and emit out in some
ways. It includes a full stack of software that provides abstraction to let
researchers focus on research instead of implementation, while at the same time
the developed program can also be put into production seamlessly in a
distributed environment, and be production ready. At the top application stack,
it provides out-of-box tools for neural network applications. Lower down, akid
provides a programming paradigm that lets user easily build customized models.
The distributed computing stack handles the concurrency and communication, thus
letting models be trained or deployed to a single GPU, multiple GPUs, or a
distributed environment without affecting how a model is specified in the
programming paradigm stack. Lastly, the distributed deployment stack handles
how the distributed computing is deployed, thus decoupling the research
prototype environment with the actual production environment, and is able to
dynamically allocate computing resources, so development (Devs) and operations
(Ops) could be separated. Please refer to http://akid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
for documentation.

 <dc:description>  The importance of dimensional analysis and dimensional homogeneity in
bibliometric studies is always overlooked. In this paper, we look at this issue
systematically and show that most h-type indices have the dimensions of [P],
where [P] is the basic dimensional unit in bibliometrics which is the unit

Euclidean length of the citation vector has the dimensions [P3/2]. An empirical
example is used to illustrate the concepts.

 <dc:title>Coloring graphs of various maximum degree from random lists</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Casselgren, Carl Johan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let $G=G(n)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree
$\Delta=\Delta(n)$. Assign to each vertex $v$ of $G$ a list $L(v)$ of colors by
choosing each list independently and uniformly at random from all $k$-subsets
of a color set $\mathcal{C}$ of size $\sigma= \sigma(n)$. Such a list
assignment is called a \emph{random $(k,\mathcal{C})$-list assignment}. In this
paper, we are interested in determining the asymptotic probability (as $n \to
\infty$) of the existence of a proper coloring $\varphi$ of $G$, such that
$\varphi(v) \in L(v)$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, a so-called $L$-coloring. We
give various lower bounds on $\sigma$, in terms of $n$, $k$ and $\Delta$, which
ensures that with probability tending to 1 as $n \to \infty$ there is an
$L$-coloring of $G$. In particular, we show, for all fixed $k$ and growing $n$,
that if $\sigma(n) = \omega(n^{1/k^2} \Delta^{1/k})$ and
$\Delta=O\left(n^{\frac{k-1}{k(k^3+ 2k^2 - k +1)}}\right)$, then the
probability that $G$ has an $L$-coloring tends to 1 as $n \rightarrow \infty$.
If $k\geq 2$ and $\Delta= \Omega(n^{1/2})$, then the same conclusion holds
provided that $\sigma=\omega(\Delta)$. We also give related results for other
bounds on $\Delta$, when $k$ is constant or a strictly increasing function of
$n$.

 <dc:description>  The discrete Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{2k+1}$ is the group
generated by $a_1,b_1,\ldots,a_k,b_k,c$, subject to the relations
$[a_1,b_1]=\ldots=[a_k,b_k]=c$ and
$[a_i,a_j]=[b_i,b_j]=[a_i,b_j]=[a_i,c]=[b_i,c]=1$ for every distinct $i,j\in
\{1,\ldots,k\}$. Denote $S=\{a_1^{\pm 1},b_1^{\pm 1},\ldots,a_k^{\pm
1},b_k^{\pm 1}\}$. The horizontal boundary of $\Omega\subset
\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{2k+1}$, denoted $\partial_{h}\Omega$, is the set of
all $(x,y)\in \Omega\times (\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{2k+1}\setminus \Omega)$
such that $x^{-1}y\in S$. The horizontal perimeter of $\Omega$ is
$|\partial_{h}\Omega|$. For $t\in \mathbb{N}$, define $\partial^t_{v} \Omega$
to be the set of all $(x,y)\in \Omega\times
(\mathbb{H}_{\mathsf{Z}}^{2k+1}\setminus \Omega)$ such that $x^{-1}y\in
\{c^t,c^{-t}\}$. The vertical perimeter of $\Omega$ is defined by
$|\partial_{v}\Omega|= \sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^\infty |\partial^t_{v}\Omega|^2/t^2}$.
It is shown here that if $k\ge 2$, then $|\partial_{v}\Omega|\lesssim
\frac{1}{k} |\partial_{h}\Omega|$. The proof of this &quot;vertical versus
horizontal isoperimetric inequality&quot; uses a new structural result that
decomposes sets of finite perimeter in the Heisenberg group into pieces that
admit an &quot;intrinsic corona decomposition.&quot; This allows one to deduce an
endpoint $W^{1,1}\to L_2(L_1)$ boundedness of a certain singular integral
operator from a corresponding lower-dimensional $W^{1,2}\to L_2(L_2)$
boundedness. The above inequality has several applications, including that any
embedding into $L_1$ of a ball of radius $n$ in the word metric on
$\mathbb{H}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{5}$ incurs bi-Lipschitz distortion that is at least a
constant multiple of $\sqrt{\log n}$. It follows that the integrality gap of
the Goemans--Linial semidefinite program for the Sparsest Cut Problem on inputs
of size $n$ is at least a constant multiple of $\sqrt{\log n}$.

these different formats of knowledge and reason about them. Even the file
systems on different computers can be part of the knowledge base. Often, it is
necessary to handle different versions of a knowledge base. E.g., we might want
to find out common parts or differences of two versions of a relational
database.
  We will examine the use of abstractions of rule bases by predicate dependency
and rule predicate graphs. Also the proof trees of derived atoms can help to
compare different versions of a rule base. Moreover, it might be possible to
have derivations joining rules with other formalisms of knowledge
representation.
  Ontologies have shown their benefits in many applications of intelligent
systems, and there have been many proposals for rule languages compatible with
the semantic web stack, e.g., SWRL, the semantic web rule language. Recently,
ontologies are used in hybrid systems for specifying the provenance of the
different components.

 <dc:description>  Bottom-up evaluation of Datalog has been studied for a long time, and is
standard material in textbooks. However, if one actually wants to develop a
deductive database system, it turns out that there are many implementation
options. For instance, the sequence in which rule instances are applied is not
given. In this paper, we study a method that immediately uses a derived tuple
to derive more tuples (called the Push method). In this way, storage space for
intermediate results can be reduced. The main contribution of our method is the
way in which we minimize the copying of values at runtime, and do much work
already at compile-time.

 <dc:description>  We revisit variable renaming from a practitioner's point of view, presenting
concepts we found useful in dealing with operational semantics of pure Prolog.
A concept of relaxed core representation is introduced, upon which a concept of
prenaming is built. Prenaming formalizes the intuitive practice of renaming
terms by just considering the necessary bindings, where now some passive
&quot;bindings&quot; x/x may be necessary as well. As an application, a constructive
version of variant lemma for implemented Horn clause logic has been obtained.
There, prenamings made it possible to incrementally handle new (local)
variables.

 <dc:title>Implementing GraphQL as a Query Language for Deductive Databases in
  SWI-Prolog Using DCGs, Quasi Quotations, and Dicts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The methods to access large relational databases in a distributed system are
well established: the relational query language SQL often serves as a language
for data access and manipulation, and in addition public interfaces are exposed
using communication protocols like REST. Similarly to REST, GraphQL is the
query protocol of an application layer developed by Facebook. It provides a
unified interface between the client and the server for data fetching and
manipulation. Using GraphQL's type system, it is possible to specify data
handling of various sources and to combine, e.g., relational with NoSQL
databases. In contrast to REST, GraphQL provides a single API endpoint and
supports flexible queries over linked data.
  GraphQL can also be used as an interface for deductive databases. In this
paper, we give an introduction of GraphQL and a comparison to REST. Using
language features recently added to SWI-Prolog 7, we have developed the Prolog
library GraphQL.pl, which implements the GraphQL type system and query syntax
as a domain-specific language with the help of definite clause grammars (DCG),
quasi quotations, and dicts. Using our library, the type system created for a
deductive database can be validated, while the query system provides a unified
interface for data access and introspection.

 <dc:description>  OpenRuleBench is a large benchmark suite for rule engines, which includes
deductive databases. We previously proposed a translation of Datalog to C++
based on a method that &quot;pushes&quot; derived tuples immediately to places where they
are used. In this paper, we report performance results of various
implementation variants of this method compared to XSB, YAP and DLV. We study
only a fraction of the OpenRuleBench problems, but we give a quite detailed
analysis of each such task and the factors which influence performance. The
results not only show the potential of our method and implementation approach,
but could be valuable for anybody implementing systems which should be able to
execute tasks of the discussed types.

 <dc:description>  We present a CLP(FD)-based constraint solver able to deal with unbounded
domains. It is based on constraint propagation, resorting to enumeration if all
other methods fail. An important aspect is detecting when enumeration was
complete and if this has an impact on the soundness of the result. We present a
technique which guarantees soundness in the following way: if the constraint
solver finds a solution it is guaranteed to be correct; if the constraint
solver fails to find a solution it can either return the result &quot;definitely
false&quot; in case it knows enumeration was exhaustive, or &quot;unknown&quot; in case it was
aborted. The technique can deal with nested universal and existential
quantifiers. It can easily be extended to set comprehensions and other
operators introducing new quantified variables. We show applications in data
validation and proof.

 <dc:description>  System relevant embedded software needs to be reliable and, therefore, well
tested, especially for aerospace systems. A common technique to verify programs
is the analysis of their abstract syntax tree (AST). Tree structures can be
elegantly analyzed with the logic programming language Prolog. Moreover, Prolog
offers further advantages for a thorough analysis: On the one hand, it natively
provides versatile options to efficiently process tree or graph data
structures. On the other hand, Prolog's non-determinism and backtracking eases
tests of different variations of the program flow without big effort. A
rule-based approach with Prolog allows to characterize the verification goals
in a concise and declarative way.
  In this paper, we describe our approach to verify the source code of a flash
file system with the help of Prolog. The flash file system is written in C++
and has been developed particularly for the use in satellites. We transform a
given abstract syntax tree of C++ source code into Prolog facts and derive the
call graph and the execution sequence (tree), which then are further tested
against verification goals. The different program flow branching due to control
structures is derived by backtracking as subtrees of the full execution
sequence. Finally, these subtrees are verified in Prolog.
  We illustrate our approach with a case study, where we search for incorrect
applications of semaphores in embedded software using the real-time operating
system RODOS. We rely on computation tree logic (CTL) and have designed an
embedded domain specific language (DSL) in Prolog to express the verification
goals.

 <dc:title>A Typeful Integration of SQL into Curry</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an extension of the declarative programming language Curry to
support the access to data stored in relational databases via SQL. Since Curry
is statically typed, our emphasis on this SQL integration is on type safety.
Our extension respects the type system of Curry so that run-time errors due to
ill-typed data are avoided. This is obtained by preprocessing SQL statements at
compile time and translating them into type-safe database access operations. As
a consequence, the type checker of the Curry system can spot type errors in SQL
statements at compile time. To generate appropriately typed access operations,
the preprocessor uses an entity-relationship (ER) model describing the
structure of the relational data. In addition to standard SQL, SQL statements
embedded in Curry can include program expressions and also relationships
specified in the ER model. The latter feature is useful to avoid the
error-prone use of foreign keys. As a result, our SQL integration supports a
high-level and type-safe access to databases in Curry programs.

 <dc:description>  The Timed Concurrent Constraint Language tccp is a declarative synchronous
concurrent language, particularly suitable for modelling reactive systems. In
tccp, agents communicate and synchronise through a global constraint store. It
supports a notion of discrete time that allows all non-blocked agents to
proceed with their execution simultaneously.
  In this paper, we present a modular architecture for the simulation of tccp
programs. The tool comprises three main components. First, a set of basic
abstract instructions able to model the tccp agent behaviour, the memory model
needed to manage the active agents and the state of the store during the
execution. Second, the agent interpreter that executes the instructions of the
current agent iteratively and calculates the new agents to be executed at the
next time instant. Finally, the constraint solver components which are the
modules that deal with constraints.
  In this paper, we describe the implementation of these components and present
an example of a real system modelled in tccp.

based on microKanren, a domain-specific logic language shallowly embedded in
Racket. We rely on Racket's macro system to generate a constraint solver and
other components of the microKanren embedding. The framework itself and the
constraints' implementations amounts to just over 100 lines of code. Our
framework is both a teachable implementation for CLP as well as a test-bed and
prototyping tool for symbolic constraint systems.

 <dc:description>  Paisley is an extensible lightweight embedded domain-specific language for
nondeterministic pattern matching in Java. Using simple APIs and programming
idioms, it brings the power of functional-logic processing of arbitrary data
objects to the Java platform, without constraining the underlying
object-oriented semantics. Here we present an extension to the Paisley
framework that adds pattern-based control flow. It exploits recent additions to
the Java language, namely functional interfaces and lambda expressions, for an
explicit and transparent continuation-passing style approach to control. We
evaluate the practical impact of the novel features on a real-world case study
that reengineers a third-party open-source project to use Paisley in place of
conventional object-oriented data query idioms. We find the approach viable for
incremental refactoring of legacy code, with significant qualitative
improvements regarding separation of concerns, clarity and intentionality, thus
making for easier code understanding, testing and debugging.

 <dc:title>An Agglomeration Law for Sorting Networks and its Application in
  Functional Programming</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schiller, Lukas Immanuel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we will present a general agglomeration law for sorting
networks. Agglomeration is a common technique when designing parallel
programmes to control the granularity of the computation thereby finding a
better fit between the algorithm and the machine on which the algorithm runs.
Usually this is done by grouping smaller tasks and computing them en bloc
within one parallel process. In the case of sorting networks this could be done
by computing bigger parts of the network with one process. The agglomeration
law in this paper pursues a different strategy: The input data is grouped and
the algorithm is generalized to work on the agglomerated input while the
original structure of the algorithm remains. This will result in a new access
opportunity to sorting networks well-suited for efficient parallelization on
modern multicore computers, computer networks or GPGPU programming.
Additionally this enables us to use sorting networks as (parallel or
distributed) merging stages for arbitrary sorting algorithms, thereby creating
new hybrid sorting algorithms with ease. The expressiveness of functional
programming languages helps us to apply this law to systematically constructed
sorting networks, leading to efficient and easily adaptable sorting algorithms.
An application example is given, using the Eden programming language to show
the effectiveness of the law. The implementation is compared with different
parallel sorting algorithms by runtime behaviour.

 <dc:description>  We investigate proving properties of Curry programs using Agda. First, we
address the functional correctness of Curry functions that, apart from some
syntactic and semantic differences, are in the intersection of the two
languages. Second, we use Agda to model non-deterministic functions with two
distinct and competitive approaches incorporating the non-determinism. The
first approach eliminates non-determinism by considering the set of all
non-deterministic values produced by an application. The second approach
encodes every non-deterministic choice that the application could perform. We
consider our initial experiment a success. Although proving properties of
programs is a notoriously difficult task, the functional logic paradigm does
not seem to add any significant layer of difficulty or complexity to the task.

 <dc:description>  The Church-Rosser theorem in the type-free lambda-calculus is well
investigated both for beta-equality and beta-reduction. We provide a new proof
of the theorem for beta-equality with no use of parallel reductions, but simply
with Takahashi's translation (Gross-Knuth strategy). Based on this, upper
bounds for reduction sequences on the theorem are obtained as the fourth level
of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy.

 <dc:title>Confluence of Conditional Term Rewrite Systems via Transformations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gmeiner, Karl</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Conditional term rewriting is an intuitive yet complex extension of term
rewriting. In order to benefit from the simpler framework of unconditional
rewriting, transformations have been defined to eliminate the conditions of
conditional term rewrite systems.
  Recent results provide confluence criteria for conditional term rewrite
systems via transformations, yet they are restricted to CTRSs with certain
syntactic properties like weak left-linearity. These syntactic properties imply
that the transformations are sound for the given CTRS.
  This paper shows how to use transformations to prove confluence of
operationally terminating, right-stable deterministic conditional term rewrite
systems without the necessity of soundness restrictions. For this purpose, it
is shown that certain rewrite strategies, in particular almost U-eagerness and
innermost rewriting, always imply soundness.

 <dc:title>An Extension of Proof Graphs for Disjunctive Parameterised Boolean
  Equation Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A parameterised Boolean equation system (PBES) is a set of equations that
defines sets as the least and/or greatest fixed-points that satisfy the
equations. This system is regarded as a declarative program defining functions
that take a datum and returns a Boolean value. The membership problem of PBESs
is a problem to decide whether a given element is in the defined set or not,
which corresponds to an execution of the program. This paper introduces reduced
proof graphs, and studies a technique to solve the membership problem of PBESs,
which is undecidable in general, by transforming it into a reduced proof graph.
  A vertex X(v) in a proof graph represents that the data v is in the set X, if
the graph satisfies conditions induced from a given PBES. Proof graphs are,
however, infinite in general. Thus we introduce vertices each of which stands
for a set of vertices of the original ones, which possibly results in a finite
graph. For a subclass of disjunctive PBESs, we clarify some conditions which
reduced proof graphs should satisfy. We also show some examples having no
finite proof graph except for reduced one. We further propose a reduced
dependency space, which contains reduced proof graphs as sub-graphs if a proof
graph exists. We provide a procedure to construct finite reduced dependency
spaces, and show the soundness and completeness of the procedure.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multi-way massive multiple-input multiple-output relay network
with zero-forcing processing at the relay. By taking into account the
time-division duplex protocol with channel estimation, we derive an analytical
approximation of the spectral efficiency. This approximation is very tight and
simple which enables us to analyze the system performance, as well as, to
compare the spectral efficiency with zero-forcing and maximum-ratio processing.
Our results show that by using a very large number of relay antennas and with
the zero-forcing technique, we can simultaneously serve many active users in
the same time-frequency resource, each with high spectral efficiency.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a link between preference-based and multiobjective
sequential decision-making. While transforming a multiobjective problem to a
preference-based one is quite natural, the other direction is a bit less
obvious. We present how this transformation (from preference-based to
multiobjective) can be done under the classic condition that preferences over
histories can be represented by additively decomposable utilities and that the
decision criterion to evaluate policies in a state is based on expectation.
This link yields a new source of multiobjective sequential decision-making
problems (i.e., when reward values are unknown) and justifies the use of
solving methods developed in one setting in the other one.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Abstract Machines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Accattoli, Beniamino</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The lambda-calculus is a peculiar computational model whose definition does
not come with a notion of machine. Unsurprisingly, implementations of the
lambda-calculus have been studied for decades. Abstract machines are
implementations schema for fixed evaluation strategies that are a compromise
between theory and practice: they are concrete enough to provide a notion of
machine and abstract enough to avoid the many intricacies of actual
implementations. There is an extensive literature about abstract machines for
the lambda-calculus, and yet-quite mysteriously-the efficiency of these
machines with respect to the strategy that they implement has almost never been
studied.
  This paper provides an unusual introduction to abstract machines, based on
the complexity of their overhead with respect to the length of the implemented
strategies. It is conceived to be a tutorial, focusing on the case study of
implementing the weak head (call-by-name) strategy, and yet it is an original
re-elaboration of known results. Moreover, some of the observation contained
here never appeared in print before.

equivalent transformation proposed by Serbanuta and Rosu, is a sound
structure-preserving transformation for weakly-left-linear deterministic
conditional term rewriting systems. More precisely, we show that every
weakly-left-linear deterministic conditional term rewriting system can be
converted to an equivalent weakly-left-linear and ultra-weakly-left-linear
deterministic conditional term rewriting system and prove that the SR
transformation is sound for weakly-left-linear and ultra-weakly-left-linear
deterministic conditional term rewriting systems. Here, soundness for a
conditional term rewriting system means that reduction of the transformed
unconditional term rewriting system creates no undesired reduction sequence for
the conditional system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent work by Abramsky and Brandenburger used sheaf theory to give a
mathematical formulation of non-locality and contextuality. By adopting this
viewpoint, it has been possible to define cohomological obstructions to the
existence of global sections. In the present work, we illustrate new insights
into different aspects of this theory. We shed light on the power of detection
of the cohomological obstruction by showing that it is not a complete invariant
for strong contextuality even under symmetry and connectedness restrictions on
the measurement cover, disproving a previous conjecture. We generalise
obstructions to higher cohomology groups and show that they give rise to a
refinement of the notion of cohomological contextuality: different &quot;levels&quot; of
contextuality are organised in a hierarchy of logical implications. Finally, we
present an alternative description of the first cohomology group in terms of
torsors, resulting in a new interpretation of the cohomological obstructions.

 <dc:title>A Topological Perspective on Interacting Algebraic Theories</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hadzihasanovic, Amar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Category Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Techniques from higher categories and higher-dimensional rewriting are
becoming increasingly important for understanding the finer, computational
properties of higher algebraic theories that arise, among other fields, in
quantum computation. These theories have often the property of containing
simpler sub-theories, whose interaction is regulated in a limited number of
ways, which reveals a topological substrate when pictured by string diagrams.
By exploring the double nature of computads as presentations of higher
algebraic theories, and combinatorial descriptions of &quot;directed spaces&quot;, we
develop a basic language of directed topology for the compositional study of
algebraic theories. We present constructions of computads, all with clear
analogues in standard topology, that capture in great generality such notions
as homomorphisms and actions, and the interactions of monoids and comonoids
that lead to the theory of Frobenius algebras and of bialgebras. After a number
of examples, we describe how a fragment of the ZX calculus can be reconstructed
in this framework.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Following on from the notion of (first-order) causality, which generalises
the notion of being tracepreserving from CP-maps to abstract processes, we give
a characterization for the most general kind of map which sends causal
processes to causal processes. These new, second-order causal processes enable
us to treat the input processes as 'local laboratories' whose causal ordering
needs not be fixed in advance. Using this characterization, we give a
fully-diagrammatic proof of a non-trivial theorem: namely that being
causality-preserving on separable processes implies being 'completely'
causality preserving. That is, causality is preserved even when the 'local
laboratories' are allowed to have ancilla systems. An immediate consequence is
that preserving causality is separable processes is equivalence to preserving
causality for strongly non-signalling (a.k.a. localizable) processes.

 <dc:title>Ambiguity and Incomplete Information in Categorical Models of Language</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We investigate notions of ambiguity and partial information in categorical
distributional models of natural language. Probabilistic ambiguity has
previously been studied using Selinger's CPM construction. This construction
works well for models built upon vector spaces, as has been shown in quantum
computational applications. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to provide a
satisfactory method for introducing mixing in other compact closed categories
such as the category of sets and binary relations. We therefore lack a uniform
strategy for extending a category to model imprecise linguistic information.
  In this work we adopt a different approach. We analyze different forms of
ambiguous and incomplete information, both with and without quantitative
probabilistic data. Each scheme then corresponds to a suitable enrichment of
the category in which we model language. We view different monads as
encapsulating the informational behaviour of interest, by analogy with their
use in modelling side effects in computation. Previous results of Jacobs then
allow us to systematically construct suitable bases for enrichment.
  We show that we can freely enrich arbitrary dagger compact closed categories
in order to capture all the phenomena of interest, whilst retaining the
important dagger compact closed structure. This allows us to construct a model
with real convex combination of binary relations that makes non-trivial use of
the scalars. Finally we relate our various different enrichments, showing that
finite subconvex algebra enrichment covers all the effects under consideration.

 <dc:description>  Many algorithms for the computation of correspondences between deformable
shapes rely on some variant of nearest neighbor matching in a descriptor space.
Such are, for example, various point-wise correspondence recovery algorithms
used as a post-processing stage in the functional correspondence framework.
Such frequently used techniques implicitly make restrictive assumptions (e.g.,
near-isometry) on the considered shapes and in practice suffer from lack of
accuracy and result in poor surjectivity. We propose an alternative recovery
technique capable of guaranteeing a bijective correspondence and producing
significantly higher accuracy and smoothness. Unlike other methods our approach
does not depend on the assumption that the analyzed shapes are isometric. We
derive the proposed method from the statistical framework of kernel density
estimation and demonstrate its performance on several challenging deformable 3D
shape matching datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, prediction for linear systems with missing information is
investigated. New methods are introduced to improve the Mean Squared Error
(MSE) on the test set in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, through
appropriate tuning of Bias-Variance trade-off. First, the use of proposed Soft
Weighted Prediction (SWP) algorithm and its efficacy are depicted and compared
to previous works for non-missing scenarios. The algorithm is then modified and
optimized for missing scenarios. It is shown that controlled over-fitting by
suggested algorithms will improve prediction accuracy in various cases.
Simulation results approve our heuristics in enhancing the prediction accuracy.

 <dc:title>Removing Depth-Order Cycles Among Triangles: An Efficient Algorithm
  Generating Triangular Fragments</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>de Berg, Mark</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  More than 25 years ago Chazelle~\emph{et al.} (FOCS 1991) studied the
following question: Is it possible to cut any set of $n$ lines in ${\Bbb R}^3$
into a subquadratic number of fragments such that the resulting fragments admit
a depth order? They proved an $O(n^{9/4})$ bound for the very special case of
bipartite weavings of lines. Since then only little progress was made, until a
recent breakthrough by Aronov and Sharir (STOC 2016) who showed that
$O(n^{3/2}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$ fragments suffice for any set of lines. In a
follow-up paper Aronov, Miller and Sharir (SODA 2017) proved an
$O(n^{3/2+\varepsilon})$ bound for triangles, but their method results in
pieces with curved boundaries. Moreover, their method uses polynomial
partitions, for which currently no algorithm is known. Thus the most natural
version of the problem is still wide open: Can we cut any collection of $n$
disjoint triangles in ${\Bbb R}^3$ into a subquadratic number of triangular
fragments that admit a depth order? And if so, can we compute the cuts
efficiently?
  We answer this question by presenting an algorithm that cuts any set of $n$
disjoint triangles in ${\Bbb R}^3$ into $O(n^{7/4}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$
triangular fragments that admit a depth order. The running time of our
algorithm is $O(n^{3.69})$. We also prove a refined bound that depends on the
number, $K$, of intersections between the projections of the triangle edges
onto the $xy$-plane: we show that $O(n^{1+\varepsilon} + n^{1/4}
K^{3/4}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$ fragments suffice to obtain a depth order. This
result extends to $xy$-monotone surface patches bounded by a constant number of
bounded-degree algebraic arcs, constituting the first subquadratic bound for
surface patches. As a byproduct of our approach we obtain a faster algorithm to
cut a set of lines into $O(n^{3/2}\mathrm{polylog}\; n)$ fragments that admit a
depth order.

 <dc:description>  Radio tomographic imaging (RTI) has recently been proposed for tracking
object location via radio waves without requiring the objects to transmit or
receive radio signals. The position is extracted by inferring which voxels are
obstructing a subset of radio links in a dense wireless sensor network. This
paper proposes a variety of modeling and algorithmic improvements to RTI for
the scenario of roadside surveillance. These include the use of a more
physically motivated weight matrix, a method for mitigating negative
(aphysical) data due to noisy observations, and a method for combining frames
of a moving vehicle into a single image. The proposed approaches are used to
show improvement in both imaging (useful for human-in-the-loop target
recognition) and automatic target recognition in a measured data set.

 <dc:description>  When a measurement falls outside the quantization or measurable range, it
becomes saturated and cannot be used in classical reconstruction methods. For
example, in C-arm angiography systems, which provide projection radiography,
fluoroscopy, digital subtraction angiography, and are widely used for medical
diagnoses and interventions, the limited dynamic range of C-arm flat detectors
leads to overexposure in some projections during an acquisition, such as
imaging relatively thin body parts (e.g., the knee). Aiming at overexposure
correction for computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, we in this paper
propose a mixed one-bit compressive sensing (M1bit-CS) to acquire information
from both regular and saturated measurements. This method is inspired by the
recent progress on one-bit compressive sensing, which deals with only sign
observations. Its successful applications imply that information carried by
saturated measurements is useful to improve recovery quality. For the proposed
M1bit-CS model, alternating direction methods of multipliers is developed and
an iterative saturation detection scheme is established. Then we evaluate
M1bit-CS on one-dimensional signal recovery tasks. In some experiments, the
performance of the proposed algorithms on mixed measurements is almost the same
as recovery on unsaturated ones with the same amount of measurements. Finally,
we apply the proposed method to overexposure correction for CT reconstruction
on a phantom and a simulated clinical image. The results are promising, as the
typical streaking artifacts and capping artifacts introduced by saturated
projection data are effectively reduced, yielding significant error reduction
compared with existing algorithms based on extrapolation.

with distances between models. But human beings certainly have no tables of

the final section, we reconsider the components, and postulate that there are
no atomic pictures, we can always look inside.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes our approach to the Bosch production line performance
challenge run by Kaggle.com. Maximizing the production yield is at the heart of
the manufacturing industry. At the Bosch assembly line, data is recorded for
products as they progress through each stage. Data science methods are applied
to this huge data repository consisting records of tests and measurements made
for each component along the assembly line to predict internal failures. We
found that it is possible to train a model that predicts which parts are most
likely to fail. Thus a smarter failure detection system can be built and the
parts tagged likely to fail can be salvaged to decrease operating costs and
increase the profit margins.

 <dc:description>  Let $ex(n, P)$ be the maximum possible number of ones in any 0-1 matrix of
dimensions $n \times n$ that avoids $P$. Matrix $P$ is called minimally
non-linear if $ex(n, P) = \omega(n)$ but $ex(n, P') = O(n)$ for every strict
subpattern $P'$ of $P$. We prove that the ratio between the length and width of
any minimally non-linear 0-1 matrix is at most $4$, and that a minimally
non-linear 0-1 matrix with $k$ rows has at most $5k-3$ ones. We also obtain an
upper bound on the number of minimally non-linear 0-1 matrices with $k$ rows.
  In addition, we prove corresponding bounds for minimally non-linear ordered
graphs. The minimal non-linearity that we investigate for ordered graphs is for
the extremal function $ex_{&lt;}(n, G)$, which is the maximum possible number of
edges in any ordered graph on $n$ vertices with no ordered subgraph isomorphic
to $G$.

theoretical foundations for IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, interval

 <dc:description>  Nonlocal image representation has been successfully used in many
image-related inverse problems including denoising, deblurring and deblocking.
However, a majority of reconstruction methods only exploit the nonlocal
self-similarity (NSS) prior of the degraded observation image, it is very
challenging to reconstruct the latent clean image. In this paper we propose a
novel model for image denoising via group sparsity residual and external NSS
prior. To boost the performance of image denoising, the concept of group
sparsity residual is proposed, and thus the problem of image denoising is
transformed into one that reduces the group sparsity residual. Due to the fact
that the groups contain a large amount of NSS information of natural images, we
obtain a good estimation of the group sparse coefficients of the original image
by the external NSS prior based on Gaussian Mixture model (GMM) learning and
the group sparse coefficients of noisy image is used to approximate the
estimation. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method not
only outperforms many state-of-the-art methods, but also delivers the best
qualitative denoising results with finer details and less ringing artifacts.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present the results of a systematic study to investigate the
(commercial) benefits of automatic text summarization systems in a real world
scenario. More specifically, we define a use case in the context of media
monitoring and media response analysis and claim that even using a simple
query-based extractive approach can dramatically save the processing time of
the employees without significantly reducing the quality of their work.

 <dc:description>  We propose a swarm-based optimization algorithm inspired by air currents of a
tornado. Two main air currents - spiral and updraft - are mimicked. Spiral
motion is designed for exploration of new search areas and updraft movements is
deployed for exploitation of a promising candidate solution. Assignment of just
one search direction to each particle at each iteration, leads to low
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm respect to the conventional
algorithms. Regardless of the step size parameters, the only parameter of the
proposed algorithm, called tornado diameter, can be efficiently adjusted by
randomization. Numerical results over six different benchmark cost functions
indicate comparable and, in some cases, better performance of the proposed
algorithm respect to some other metaheuristics.

 <dc:description>  We consider the multi-view data completion problem, i.e., to complete a
matrix $\mathbf{U}=[\mathbf{U}_1|\mathbf{U}_2]$ where the ranks of
$\mathbf{U},\mathbf{U}_1$, and $\mathbf{U}_2$ are given. In particular, we
investigate the fundamental conditions on the sampling pattern, i.e., locations
of the sampled entries for finite completability of such a multi-view data
given the corresponding rank constraints. In contrast with the existing
analysis on Grassmannian manifold for a single-view matrix, i.e., conventional
matrix completion, we propose a geometric analysis on the manifold structure
for multi-view data to incorporate more than one rank constraint. We provide a
deterministic necessary and sufficient condition on the sampling pattern for
finite completability. We also give a probabilistic condition in terms of the
number of samples per column that guarantees finite completability with high
probability. Finally, using the developed tools, we derive the deterministic
and probabilistic guarantees for unique completability.

 <dc:title>Optimized, Direct Sale of Privacy in Personal-Data Marketplaces</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Very recently, we are witnessing the emergence of a number of start-ups that
enables individuals to sell their private data directly to brokers and
businesses. While this new paradigm may shift the balance of power between
individuals and companies that harvest data, it raises some practical,
fundamental questions for users of these services: how they should decide which
data must be vended and which data protected, and what a good deal is. In this
work, we investigate a mechanism that aims at helping users address these
questions. The investigated mechanism relies on a hard-privacy model and allows
users to share partial or complete profile data with broker companies in
exchange for an economic reward. The theoretical analysis of the trade-off
between privacy and money posed by such mechanism is the object of this work.
We adopt a generic measure of privacy although part of our analysis focuses on
some important examples of Bregman divergences. We find a parametric solution
to the problem of optimal exchange of privacy for money, and obtain a
closed-form expression and characterize the trade-off between
profile-disclosure risk and economic reward for several interesting cases.

 <dc:description>  Government statistical agencies collect enormously valuable data on the
nation's population and business activities. Wide access to these data enables
evidence-based policy making, supports new research that improves society,
facilitates training for students in data science, and provides resources for
the public to better understand and participate in their society. These data
also affect the private sector. For example, the Employment Situation in the
United States, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, moves markets.
Nonetheless, government agencies are under increasing pressure to limit access
to data because of a growing understanding of the threats to data privacy and
confidentiality.
  &quot;De-identification&quot; - stripping obvious identifiers like names, addresses,
and identification numbers - has been found inadequate in the face of modern
computational and informational resources.
  Unfortunately, the problem extends even to the release of aggregate data
statistics. This counter-intuitive phenomenon has come to be known as the
Fundamental Law of Information Recovery. It says that overly accurate estimates
of too many statistics can completely destroy privacy. One may think of this as
death by a thousand cuts. Every statistic computed from a data set leaks a
small amount of information about each member of the data set - a tiny cut.
This is true even if the exact value of the statistic is distorted a bit in
order to preserve privacy. But while each statistical release is an almost
harmless little cut in terms of privacy risk for any individual, the cumulative
effect can be to completely compromise the privacy of some individuals.

 <dc:description>  Controlling Chaos could be a big factor in getting great stable amounts of
energy out of small amounts of not necessarily stable resources. By definition,
Chaos is getting huge changes in the system's output due to unpredictable small
changes in initial conditions, and that means we could take advantage of this
fact and select the proper control system to manipulate system's initial
conditions and inputs in general and get a desirable output out of otherwise a
Chaotic system. That was accomplished by first building some known chaotic
circuit (Chua circuit) and the NI's MultiSim was used to simulate the ANN
control system. It was shown that this technique can also be used to stabilize
some hard to stabilize electronic systems.

 <dc:description>  Signed networks allow to model positive and negative relationships. We
analyze existing extensions of spectral clustering to signed networks. It turns
out that existing approaches do not recover the ground truth clustering in
several situations where either the positive or the negative network structures
contain no noise. Our analysis shows that these problems arise as existing
approaches take some form of arithmetic mean of the Laplacians of the positive
and negative part. As a solution we propose to use the geometric mean of the
Laplacians of positive and negative part and show that it outperforms the
existing approaches. While the geometric mean of matrices is computationally
expensive, we show that eigenvectors of the geometric mean can be computed
efficiently, leading to a numerical scheme for sparse matrices which is of
independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Massive MIMO systems promise high data rates by employing large number of
antennas, which also increases the power usage of the system as a consequence.
This creates an optimization problem which specifies how many antennas the
system should employ in order to operate with maximal energy efficiency. Our
main goal is to consider a base station with a fixed number of antennas, such
that the system can operate with a smaller subset of antennas according to the
number of active user terminals, which may vary over time. Thus, in this paper
we propose an antenna selection algorithm which selects the best antennas
according to the better channel conditions with respect to the users, aiming at
improving the overall energy efficiency. Then, due to the complexity of the
mathematical formulation, a tight approximation for the consumed power is
presented, using the Wishart theorem, and it is used to find a deterministic
formulation for the energy efficiency. Simulation results show that the
approximation is quite tight and that there is significant improvement in terms
of energy efficiency when antenna selection is employed.

 <dc:description>  In an endeavor to reach the vision of ubiquitous computing where users are
able to use pervasive services without spatial and temporal constraints, we are
witnessing a fast growing number of mobile and sensor-enhanced devices becoming
available. However, in order to take full advantage of the numerous benefits
offered by novel mobile devices and services, we must address the related
security issues. In this paper, we present results of a systematic literature
review (SLR) on security-related topics in ubiquitous computing environments.
In our study, we found 5165 scientific contributions published between 2003 and
2015. We applied a systematic procedure to identify the threats,
vulnerabilities, attacks, as well as corresponding defense mechanisms that are
discussed in those publications. While this paper mainly discusses the results
of our study, the corresponding SLR protocol which provides all details of the
SLR is also publicly available for download.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a new weakly-supervised learning algorithm to learn
to segment cancerous regions in histopathology images. Our work is under a
multiple instance learning framework (MIL) with a new formulation, deep weak
supervision (DWS); we also propose an effective way to introduce constraints to
our neural networks to assist the learning process. The contributions of our
algorithm are threefold: (1) We build an end-to-end learning system that
segments cancerous regions with fully convolutional networks (FCN) in which
image-to-image weakly-supervised learning is performed. (2) We develop a deep
week supervision formulation to exploit multi-scale learning under weak
supervision within fully convolutional networks. (3) Constraints about positive
instances are introduced in our approach to effectively explore additional
weakly-supervised information that is easy to obtain and enjoys a significant
boost to the learning process. The proposed algorithm, abbreviated as DWS-MIL,
is easy to implement and can be trained efficiently. Our system demonstrates
state-of-the-art results on large-scale histopathology image datasets and can
be applied to various applications in medical imaging beyond histopathology
images such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound images.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid growth of social media on the web, emotional polarity
computation has become a flourishing frontier in the text mining community.
However, it is challenging to understand the latest trends and summarize the
state or general opinions about products due to the big diversity and size of
social media data and this creates the need of automated and real time opinion
extraction and mining. On the other hand, the bulk of current research has been
devoted to study the subjective sentences which contain opinion keywords and
limited work has been reported for objective statements that imply sentiment.
In this paper, fuzzy based knowledge engineering model has been developed for
sentiment classification of special group of such sentences including the
change or deviation from desired range or value. Drug reviews are the rich
source of such statements. Therefore, in this research, some experiments were
carried out on patient's reviews on several different cholesterol lowering
drugs to determine their sentiment polarity. The main conclusion through this
study is, in order to increase the accuracy level of existing drug opinion
mining systems, objective sentences which imply opinion should be taken into
account. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model obtains
over 72 percent F1 value.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new hyperspectral unmixing method for nonlinearly mixed
hyperspectral data using a semantic representation in a semi-supervised
fashion, assuming the availability of a spectral reference library. Existing
semi-supervised unmixing algorithms select members from an endmember library
that are present at each of the pixels; most such methods assume a linear
mixing model. However, those methods will fail in the presence of nonlinear
mixing among the observed spectra. To address this issue, we develop an
endmember selection method using a recently proposed semantic spectral
representation obtained via non-homogeneous hidden Markov chain (NHMC) model
for a wavelet transform of the spectra. The semantic representation can encode
spectrally discriminative features for any observed spectrum and, therefore,
our proposed method can perform endmember selection without any assumption on
the mixing model. Experimental results show that in the presence of
sufficiently nonlinear mixing our proposed method outperforms dictionary-based
sparse unmixing approaches based on linear models.

 <dc:description>  A symmetric matrix is Robinsonian if its rows and columns can be
simultaneously reordered in such a way that entries are monotone nondecreasing
in rows and columns when moving toward the diagonal. The adjacency matrix of a
graph is Robinsonian precisely when the graph is a unit interval graph, so that
Robinsonian matrices form a matrix analogue of the class of unit interval
graphs. Here we provide a structural characterization for Robinsonian matrices
in terms of forbidden substructures, extending the notion of asteroidal triples
to weighted graphs. This implies the known characterization of unit interval
graphs and leads to an efficient algorithm for certifying that a matrix is not
Robinsonian.

 <dc:description>  Generating random variates from high-dimensional distributions is often done
approximately using Markov chain Monte Carlo. In certain cases, perfect
simulation algorithms exist that allow one to draw exactly from the stationary
distribution, but most require $O(n \ln(n))$ time, where $n$ measures the size
of the input. In this work a new protocol for creating perfect simulation
algorithms that runs in $O(n)$ time for a wider range of parameters on several
models (such as Strauss, Ising, and random cluster) than was known previously.
This work represents an extension of the popping algorithms due to Wilson.

 <dc:description>  Single image super-resolution (SR) is an ill-posed problem which aims to
recover high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR)
observations. The crux of this problem lies in learning the complex mapping
between low-resolution patches and the corresponding high-resolution patches.
Prior arts have used either a mixture of simple regression models or a single
non-linear neural network for this propose. This paper proposes the method of
learning a mixture of SR inference modules in a unified framework to tackle
this problem. Specifically, a number of SR inference modules specialized in
different image local patterns are first independently applied on the LR image
to obtain various HR estimates, and the resultant HR estimates are adaptively
aggregated to form the final HR image. By selecting neural networks as the SR
inference module, the whole procedure can be incorporated into a unified
network and be optimized jointly. Extensive experiments are conducted to
investigate the relation between restoration performance and different network
architectures. Compared with other current image SR approaches, our proposed
method achieves state-of-the-arts restoration results on a wide range of images
consistently while allowing more flexible design choices. The source codes are
available in http://www.ifp.illinois.edu/~dingliu2/accv2016.

 <dc:description>  We analyze a new approach to Machine Learning coming from a modification of
classical regularization networks by casting the process in the time dimension,
leading to a sort of collapse of dimensionality in the problem of learning the
model parameters. This approach allows the definition of a online learning
algorithm that progressively accumulates the knowledge provided in the input
trajectory. The regularization principle leads to a solution based on a
dynamical system that is paired with a procedure to develop a graph structure
that stores the input regularities acquired from the temporal evolution. We
report an extensive experimental exploration on the behavior of the parameter
of the proposed model and an evaluation on artificial dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a non-probabilistic method based on fuzzy logic is used to
update finite element models (FEMs). Model updating techniques use the measured
data to improve the accuracy of numerical models of structures. However, the
measured data are contaminated with experimental noise and the models are
inaccurate due to randomness in the parameters. This kind of aleatory
uncertainty is irreducible, and may decrease the accuracy of the finite element
model updating process. However, uncertainty quantification methods can be used
to identify the uncertainty in the updating parameters. In this paper, the
uncertainties associated with the modal parameters are defined as fuzzy
membership functions, while the model updating procedure is defined as an
optimization problem at each {\alpha}-cut level. To determine the membership
functions of the updated parameters, an objective function is defined and
minimized using two metaheuristic optimization algorithms: ant colony
optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). A structural example
is used to investigate the accuracy of the fuzzy model updating strategy using
the PSO and ACO algorithms. Furthermore, the results obtained by the fuzzy
finite element model updating are compared with the Bayesian model updating
results.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the use of WiFi and mobile device-to-device networks,
with vehicular ad hoc networks being a typical example, as a complementary
means to offload and reduce the traffic load of cellular networks. A novel
cooperative content dissemination strategy is proposed for a heterogeneous
network consisting of different types of devices with different levels of
mobility, ranging from static WiFi access points to mobile devices such as
vehicles. The proposed strategy offloads a significant proportion of data
traffic from cellular networks to WiFi or device-to-device networks. Detailed
analysis is provided for the content dissemination process in heterogeneous
networks adopting the strategy. On that basis, the optimal parameter settings
for the content dissemination strategy are discussed. Simulation and numerical
studies show that the proposed strategy effectively reduces data traffic for
cellular networks while guaranteeing successful content delivery.

 <dc:description>  Optical interconnects play a key role in the implementation of high-speed
short-reach communication links within high-performance electronic systems.
Multimode polymer waveguides in particular are strong candidates for use in
passive optical backplanes as they can be cost-effectively integrated onto
standard PCBs. Various optical backplanes using this technology and featuring a
large number of multimode polymer waveguide components have been recently
demonstrated. The optimisation of the loss performance of these complex
waveguide layouts becomes particularly important at high data rates (&gt;=25 Gb/s)
due to the associated stringent power budget requirements. Moreover, launch
conditions have to be carefully considered in such systems due to the
highly-multimoded nature of this waveguide technology. In this paper therefore,
we present thorough loss and bandwidth studies on siloxane-based multimode
waveguides and waveguide components (i.e. bends and crossings) that enable the
implementation of passive optical backplanes. The performance of these
components is experimentally investigated under different launch conditions for
different waveguide profiles that can be readily achieved through fabrication.
Useful design rules on the use of waveguide bends and crossings are derived for
each waveguide type. It is shown that the choice of waveguide parameters
depends on the particular waveguide layout, assumed launch conditions and
desired link bandwidth. As an application of these studies, the obtained
results are employed to optimise the loss performance of a 10-card shuffle
router and enable &gt;=40 Gb/s data transmission.

 <dc:description>  We study the outcome of deferred acceptance when prospective medical
residents can only apply to a limited set of hospitals. This limitation
requires residents to make a strategic choice about the quality of hospitals
they apply to. Through a mix of theoretical and experimental results, we study
the effect of this strategic choice on the preferences submitted by
participants, as well as on the overall welfare. We find that residents'
choices in our model mimic the behavior observed in real systems where
individuals apply to a mix of positions consisting mostly of places where they
are reasonably likely to get accepted, as well as a few &quot;reach&quot; applications to
hospitals of very high quality, and a few &quot;safe&quot; applications to hospitals of
lower than their expected level. Surprisingly, the number of such &quot;safe&quot;
applications is not monotone in the number of allowed applications. We also
find that selfish behavior can hurt social welfare, but the deterioration of
overall welfare is very minimal.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised neural and Bayesian models for zero-resource speech

 <dc:creator>Kamper, Herman</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In settings where only unlabelled speech data is available, zero-resource
speech technology needs to be developed without transcriptions, pronunciation
dictionaries, or language modelling text. There are two central problems in
zero-resource speech processing: (i) finding frame-level feature
representations which make it easier to discriminate between linguistic units
(phones or words), and (ii) segmenting and clustering unlabelled speech into
meaningful units. In this thesis, we argue that a combination of top-down and
bottom-up modelling is advantageous in tackling these two problems.
  To address the problem of frame-level representation learning, we present the
correspondence autoencoder (cAE), a neural network trained with weak top-down
supervision from an unsupervised term discovery system. By combining this
top-down supervision with unsupervised bottom-up initialization, the cAE yields
much more discriminative features than previous approaches. We then present our
unsupervised segmental Bayesian model that segments and clusters unlabelled
speech into hypothesized words. By imposing a consistent top-down segmentation
while also using bottom-up knowledge from detected syllable boundaries, our
system outperforms several others on multi-speaker conversational English and
Xitsonga speech data. Finally, we show that the clusters discovered by the
segmental Bayesian model can be made less speaker- and gender-specific by using
features from the cAE instead of traditional acoustic features.
  In summary, the different models and systems presented in this thesis show
that both top-down and bottom-up modelling can improve representation learning,
segmentation and clustering of unlabelled speech data.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this book is to help you program shared-memory parallel
machines without risking your sanity. We hope that this book's design
principles will help you avoid at least some parallel-programming pitfalls.
That said, you should think of this book as a foundation on which to build,
rather than as a completed cathedral. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is
to help make further progress in the exciting field of parallel
programming--progress that will in time render this book obsolete. Parallel
programming is not as hard as some say, and we hope that this book makes your
parallel-programming projects easier and more fun.
  In short, where parallel programming once focused on science, research, and
grand-challenge projects, it is quickly becoming an engineering discipline. We
therefore examine specific parallel-programming tasks and describe how to
approach them. In some surprisingly common cases, they can even be automated.
  This book is written in the hope that presenting the engineering discipline
underlying successful parallel-programming projects will free a new generation
of parallel hackers from the need to slowly and painstakingly reinvent old
wheels, enabling them to instead focus their energy and creativity on new
frontiers. We sincerely hope that parallel programming brings you at least as
much fun, excitement, and challenge that it has brought to us!

 <dc:description>  This article is an extended version of previous work of the authors [40, 41]
on low-rank matrix estimation in the presence of constraints on the factors
into which the matrix is factorized. Low-rank matrix factorization is one of
the basic methods used in data analysis for unsupervised learning of relevant
features and other types of dimensionality reduction. We present a framework to
study the constrained low-rank matrix estimation for a general prior on the
factors, and a general output channel through which the matrix is observed. We
draw a paralel with the study of vector-spin glass models - presenting a
unifying way to study a number of problems considered previously in separate
statistical physics works. We present a number of applications for the problem
in data analysis. We derive in detail a general form of the low-rank
approximate message passing (Low- RAMP) algorithm, that is known in statistical
physics as the TAP equations. We thus unify the derivation of the TAP equations
for models as different as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, the restricted
Boltzmann machine, the Hopfield model or vector (xy, Heisenberg and other) spin
glasses. The state evolution of the Low-RAMP algorithm is also derived, and is
equivalent to the replica symmetric solution for the large class of vector-spin
glass models. In the section devoted to result we study in detail phase
diagrams and phase transitions for the Bayes-optimal inference in low-rank
matrix estimation. We present a typology of phase transitions and their
relation to performance of algorithms such as the Low-RAMP or commonly used
spectral methods.

 <dc:description>  To participate in the Outback Medical Express UAV Challenge 2016, a vehicle
was designed and tested that can hover precisely, take-off and land vertically,
fly fast forward efficiently and use computer vision to locate a person and a
suitable landing location. A rotor blade was designed that can deliver
sufficient thrust in hover, while still being efficient in fast forward flight.
Energy measurements and windtunnel tests were performed. A rotor-head and
corresponding control algorithms were developed to allow transitioning flight
with the non-conventional rotor dynamics. Dedicated electronics were designed
that meet vehicle needs and regulations to allow safe flight beyond visual line
of sight. Vision based search and guidance algorithms were developed and
tested. Flight tests and a competition participation illustrate the
applicability of the DelftaCopter concept.

 <dc:description>  The high variance issue in unbiased policy-gradient methods such as VPG and
REINFORCE is typically mitigated by adding a baseline. However, the baseline
fitting itself suffers from the underfitting or the overfitting problem. In
this paper, we develop a K-fold method for baseline estimation in policy
gradient algorithms. The parameter K is the baseline estimation hyperparameter
that can adjust the bias-variance trade-off in the baseline estimates. We
demonstrate the usefulness of our approach via two state-of-the-art policy
gradient algorithms on three MuJoCo locomotive control tasks.

 <dc:title>Neural Probabilistic Model for Non-projective MST Parsing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a probabilistic parsing model, which defines a
proper conditional probability distribution over non-projective dependency
trees for a given sentence, using neural representations as inputs. The neural
network architecture is based on bi-directional LSTM-CNNs which benefits from
both word- and character-level representations automatically, by using
combination of bidirectional LSTM and CNN. On top of the neural network, we
introduce a probabilistic structured layer, defining a conditional log-linear
model over non-projective trees. We evaluate our model on 17 different
datasets, across 14 different languages. By exploiting Kirchhoff's Matrix-Tree
Theorem (Tutte, 1984), the partition functions and marginals can be computed
efficiently, leading to a straight-forward end-to-end model training procedure
via back-propagation. Our parser achieves state-of-the-art parsing performance
on nine datasets.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the notion of probably approximately correct implication bases
from the literature and present a first formulation in the language of formal
concept analysis, with the goal to investigate whether such bases represent a
suitable substitute for exact implication bases in practical use-cases. To this
end, we quantitatively examine the behavior of probably approximately correct
implication bases on artificial and real-world data sets and compare their
precision and recall with respect to their corresponding exact implication
bases. Using a small example, we also provide qualitative insight that
implications from probably approximately correct bases can still represent
meaningful knowledge from a given data set.

 <dc:description>  Over the last three decades, a large number of evolutionary algorithms have
been developed for solving multiobjective optimization problems. However, there
lacks an up-to-date and comprehensive software platform for researchers to
properly benchmark existing algorithms and for practitioners to apply selected
algorithms to solve their real-world problems. The demand of such a common tool
becomes even more urgent, when the source code of many proposed algorithms has
not been made publicly available. To address these issues, we have developed a
MATLAB platform for evolutionary multi-objective optimization in this paper,
called PlatEMO, which includes more than 50 multi-objective evolutionary
algorithms and more than 100 multi-objective test problems, along with several
widely used performance indicators. With a user-friendly graphical user
interface, PlatEMO enables users to easily compare several evolutionary
algorithms at one time and collect statistical results in Excel or LaTeX files.
More importantly, PlatEMO is completely open source, such that users are able
to develop new algorithms on the basis of it. This paper introduces the main
features of PlatEMO and illustrates how to use it for performing comparative
experiments, embedding new algorithms, creating new test problems, and
developing performance indicators. Source code of PlatEMO is now available at:

 <dc:description>  We consider a supervisory control problem for discrete-event systems, in
which an attacker corrupts the symbols that are observed by the supervisor. We
show that existence of a supervisor enforcing a specification language, in the
presence of attacks, is completely characterized by controllability (in the
usual sense) and observability of the specification (in a new appropriately
defined sense). The new notion of observability takes into account the
attacker's ability to alter the symbols received by the attacker. For attacks
that correspond to arbitrary insertions/removals of symbols, the new notion of
observability can be tested by checking the usual notion of observability for a
set of discrete-event systems with appropriately redefined observation maps.
Focusing on attacks that replace and/or remove symbols from the output strings,
we construct observers that are robust against attacks and lead to an automaton
representation of the supervisor. We also develop a test for observability
under such replacement-removal attacks by using the so-called product automata.

 <dc:description>  Small cells deployment is one of the most significant long-term strategic
policies of the mobile network operators. In heterogeneous networks (HetNets),
small cells serve as offloading spots in the radio access network to offload
macro users (MUs) and their associated traffic from congested macrocells. In
this paper, we perform analytical analysis and investigate how the radio
propagation effects such as multipath and shadowing and small cell base station
density affect MUs' offloading to small cell network (SCN). In particular, we
exploit composite fading channels in our evaluation when an MU is offloaded to
SCN with varying small and macro cell densities in the stochastic HetNets
framework. We derive the expressions for outage probability (equivalently
success probability) of the MU in macro network and SCN for two different
cases, viz.: i) Nakagami-lognormal channel fading; ii) time-shared (combined)
shadowed/unshadowed channel fading. We propose efficient approximations for the
probability density functions of the channel fading (power) for the
above-mentioned fading distributions that do not have closed-form expressions
employing Gauss-Hermite integration and finite exponential series,
respectively. Finally, the outage probability performance of MU with and
without offloading options/services is analyzed for various settings of fading
channels.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a hierarchical image matting model is proposed to extract
blood vessels from fundus images. More specifically, a hierarchical strategy
utilizing the continuity and extendibility of retinal blood vessels is
integrated into the image matting model for blood vessel segmentation. Normally
the matting models require the user specified trimap, which separates the input
image into three regions manually: the foreground, background and unknown
regions. However, since creating a user specified trimap is a tedious and
time-consuming task, region features of blood vessels are used to generate the
trimap automatically in this paper. The proposed model has low computational
complexity and outperforms many other state-ofart supervised and unsupervised
methods in terms of accuracy, which achieves a vessel segmentation accuracy of
96:0%, 95:7% and 95:1% in an average time of 10:72s, 15:74s and 50:71s on
images from three publicly available fundus image datasets DRIVE, STARE, and
CHASE DB1, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Intruders detection in computer networks has some deficiencies from machine
learning approach, given by the nature of the application. The principal
problem is the modest display of detection systems based on learning algorithms
under the constraints imposed by real environments. This article focuses on the
machine learning approach for network intrusion detection in batch and data
stream environments. First, we propose and describe three variants of KDD99
dataset preprocessing including attribute selection. Secondly, a thoroughly
experimentation is performed from evaluating and comparing representative batch
learning algorithms on the variants obtained from KDD99 pre processing.
Finally, since network traffic is a constant data stream, which can present
concept drifting with high rate of false positive, along with the fact that
there are not many researches addressing intrusion detection on streaming
environments, lead us to make a comparison of various representative data
stream classification algorithms. This research allows determining the
algorithms that better perform on the proposed variants of KDD99 for both batch
and data stream environments.

 <dc:title>Double Link Failure Protection using a Single P-cycle</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this letter, we investigate survivability in optical networks for
protection from two simultaneous link failures. Failure probability of two
links with overlapping protection can be high if these links are geographically
close. In a network with deterministic single link protection, simultaneous
failure of two links may lead to partial or full loss of traffic on the failed
links. Two link failure protection will make the network more resilient by
protecting double failures having overlapping protection. A method for
achieving double fault tolerance is double cycle method (DB); it uses two
pre-configured cycles (p-cycles) to protect a link. Single p-cycle (SG) method,
which uses one p-cycle to protect a link from two simultaneous link failure is
introduced in this letter. Integer linear programs (ILP) are formulated for the
SG method as well as DB method. It has been observed that the SG method
provides a solution to bigger networks with lesser computational resources as
compared to the DB method.

 <dc:description>  Complex activity recognition is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty
and diversity of performing a complex activity. Normally, each instance of a
complex activity has its own configuration of atomic actions and their temporal
dependencies. We propose in this paper an atomic action-based Bayesian model
that constructs Allen's interval relation networks to characterize complex
activities with structural varieties in a probabilistic generative way: By
introducing latent variables from the Chinese restaurant process, our approach
is able to capture all possible styles of a particular complex activity as a
unique set of distributions over atomic actions and relations. We also show
that local temporal dependencies can be retained and are globally consistent in
the resulting interval network. Moreover, network structure can be learned from
empirical data. A new dataset of complex hand activities has been constructed
and made publicly available, which is much larger in size than any existing
datasets. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets as well as our in-house
dataset demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  In heterogeneous networks (HetNets), load balancing among different tiers can
be effectively achieved by a biased user association scheme with which each
user chooses to associate with one base station (BS) based on the biased
received power. In contrast to previous studies where a BS always has packets
to transmit, we assume in this paper that incoming packets intended for all the
associated users form a queue in the BS. In order to find the delay limit of
the network to support real-time service, we focus on the delay optimization
problem by properly tuning the biasing factor of each tier. By adopting a
thinned Poisson point process (PPP) model to characterize the locations of BSs
in the busy state, an explicit expression of the average traffic intensity of
each tier is obtained. On that basis, an optimization problem is formulated to
minimize a lower bound of the network mean queuing delay. By showing that the
optimization problem is convex, the optimal biasing factor of each tier can be
obtained numerically. When the mean packet arrival rate of each user is small,
a closed-form solution is derived. The simulation results demonstrate that the
network queuing performance can be significantly improved by properly tuning
the biasing factor. It is further shown that the network mean queuing delay
might be improved at the cost of a deterioration of the network
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) coverage, which indicates a performance
tradeoff between real-time and non-real-time traffic in HetNets.

 <dc:description>  Readability criteria have been addressed as a measurement of the quality of
graph visualizations. In this paper, we argue that readability criteria are
necessary but not sufficient. We propose a new kind of criteria, namely
faithfulness, to evaluate the quality of graph layouts. We introduce a general
model for quantify faithfulness, and contrast it with the well established
readability criteria. We show examples of common visualization techniques, such
as multidimensional scaling, edge bundling and several other visualization
metaphors for the study of faithfulness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study extensions to the Gaussian Processes (GPs) continuous
occupancy mapping problem. There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems
that we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under
pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map
inference. We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with
uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the
robot's perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach
allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the
possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed
techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy
mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into
account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by
modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the
map quality.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we determine the maximum number of distinct Lyndon factors
that a word of length $n$ can contain. We also derive formulas for the expected
total number of Lyndon factors in a word of length $n$ on an alphabet of size
$\sigma$, as well as the expected number of distinct Lyndon factors in such a
word. The minimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a word of length $n$ is
$1$ and the minimum total number is $n$, with both bounds being achieved by
$x^n$ where $x$ is a letter. A more interesting question to ask is what is the
minimum number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$? In
this direction, it is known (Saari, 2014) that an optimal lower bound for the
number of distinct Lyndon factors in a Lyndon word of length $n$ is
$\lceil\log_{\phi}(n) + 1\rceil$, where $\phi$ denotes the golden ratio $(1 +
\sqrt{5})/2$. Moreover, this lower bound is attained by the so-called finite
&quot;Fibonacci Lyndon words&quot;, which are precisely the Lyndon factors of the
well-known &quot;infinite Fibonacci word&quot; -- a special example of a &quot;infinite
Sturmian word&quot;. Saari (2014) conjectured that if $w$ is Lyndon word of length
$n$, $n\ne 6$, containing the least number of distinct Lyndon factors over all
Lyndon words of the same length, then $w$ is a Christoffel word (i.e., a Lyndon
factor of an infinite Sturmian word). We give a counterexample to this
conjecture. Furthermore, we generalise Saari's result on the number of distinct
Lyndon factors of a Fibonacci Lyndon word by determining the number of distinct
Lyndon factors of a given Christoffel word. We end with two open problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a software abstraction layer to simplify the design
and synthesis of whole-body controllers without making any preliminary
assumptions on the control law to be implemented. The main advantage of the
proposed library is the decoupling of the control software from implementation
details, which are related to the robotic platform. Furthermore, the resulting
code is more clean and concise than ad-hoc code, as it focuses only on the
implementation of the control law. In addition, we present a reference
implementation of the abstraction layer together with a Simulink interface to
provide support to Model-Driven based development. We also show the
implementation of a simple proportional-derivative plus gravity compensation
control together with a more complex momentum-based bipedal balance controller.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNN) trained in a supervised way suffer from two known
problems. First, the minima of the objective function used in learning
correspond to data points (also known as rubbish examples or fooling images)
that lack semantic similarity with the training data. Second, a clean input can
be changed by a small, and often imperceptible for human vision, perturbation,
so that the resulting deformed input is misclassified by the network. These
findings emphasize the differences between the ways DNN and humans classify
patterns, and raise a question of designing learning algorithms that more
accurately mimic human perception compared to the existing methods.
  Our paper examines these questions within the framework of Dense Associative
Memory (DAM) models. These models are defined by the energy function, with
higher order (higher than quadratic) interactions between the neurons. We show
that in the limit when the power of the interaction vertex in the energy
function is sufficiently large, these models have the following three
properties. First, the minima of the objective function are free from rubbish
images, so that each minimum is a semantically meaningful pattern. Second,
artificial patterns poised precisely at the decision boundary look ambiguous to
human subjects and share aspects of both classes that are separated by that
decision boundary. Third, adversarial images constructed by models with small
power of the interaction vertex, which are equivalent to DNN with rectified
linear units (ReLU), fail to transfer to and fool the models with higher order
interactions. This opens up a possibility to use higher order models for
detecting and stopping malicious adversarial attacks. The presented results
suggest that DAM with higher order energy functions are closer to human visual
perception than DNN with ReLUs.

 <dc:title>Joint Semantic Synthesis and Morphological Analysis of the Derived Word</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cotterell, Ryan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Much like sentences are composed of words, words themselves are composed of
smaller units. For example, the English word questionably can be analyzed as
question+able+ly. However, this structural decomposition of the word does not
directly give us a semantic representation of the word's meaning. Since
morphology obeys the principle of compositionality, the semantics of the word
can be systematically derived from the meaning of its parts. In this work, we
propose a novel probabilistic model of word formation that captures both the
analysis of a word w into its constituents segments and the synthesis of the
meaning of w from the meanings of those segments. Our model jointly learns to
segment words into morphemes and compose distributional semantic vectors of
those morphemes. We experiment with the model on English CELEX data and German
DerivBase (Zeller et al., 2013) data. We show that jointly modeling semantics
increases both segmentation accuracy and morpheme F1 by between 3% and 5%.
Additionally, we investigate different models of vector composition, showing
that recurrent neural networks yield an improvement over simple additive
models. Finally, we study the degree to which the representations correspond to
a linguist's notion of morphological productivity.

 <dc:description>  An abelian square is the concatenation of two words that are anagrams of one
another. A word of length $n$ can contain at most $\Theta(n^2)$ distinct
factors, and there exist words of length $n$ containing $\Theta(n^2)$ distinct
abelian-square factors, that is, distinct factors that are abelian squares.
This motivates us to study infinite words such that the number of distinct
abelian-square factors of length $n$ grows quadratically with $n$. More
precisely, we say that an infinite word $w$ is {\it abelian-square-rich} if,
for every $n$, every factor of $w$ of length $n$ contains, on average, a number
of distinct abelian-square factors that is quadratic in $n$; and {\it uniformly
abelian-square-rich} if every factor of $w$ contains a number of distinct
abelian-square factors that is proportional to the square of its length. Of
course, if a word is uniformly abelian-square-rich, then it is
abelian-square-rich, but we show that the converse is not true in general. We
prove that the Thue-Morse word is uniformly abelian-square-rich and that the
function counting the number of distinct abelian-square factors of length $2n$
of the Thue-Morse word is $2$-regular. As for Sturmian words, we prove that a
Sturmian word $s_{\alpha}$ of angle $\alpha$ is uniformly abelian-square-rich
if and only if the irrational $\alpha$ has bounded partial quotients, that is,
if and only if $s_{\alpha}$ has bounded exponent.

 <dc:title>A Concave Optimization Algorithm for Matching Partially Overlapping

 <dc:creator>Lian, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Lei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Point matching refers to the process of finding spatial transformation and
correspondences between two sets of points. In this paper, we focus on the case
that there is only partial overlap between two point sets. Following the
approach of the robust point matching method, we model point matching as a
mixed linear assignment-least square problem and show that after eliminating
the transformation variable, the resulting problem of minimization with respect
to point correspondence is a concave optimization problem. Furthermore, this
problem has the property that the objective function can be converted into a
form with few nonlinear terms via a linear transformation. Based on these
properties, we employ the branch-and-bound (BnB) algorithm to optimize the
resulting problem where the dimension of the search space is small. To further
improve efficiency of the BnB algorithm where computation of the lower bound is
the bottleneck, we propose a new lower bounding scheme which has a
k-cardinality linear assignment formulation and can be efficiently solved.
Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness to disturbances and point
matching accuracy.

and can also help stabilizing energy demand in the power grid. In V2G systems,
since the PEV users need to obtain system information (e.g., locations of
charging/discharging stations, current load and supply of the power grid) to
achieve the best charging and discharging performance, data communication plays
a crucial role. However, since the PEV users are highly mobile, information
from V2G systems is not always available for many reasons, e.g., wireless link
failures and cyber attacks. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a novel
concept using cyber insurance to &quot;transfer&quot; cyber risks, e.g., unavailable
information, of a PEV user to a third party, e.g., a cyber insurance company.
Under the insurance coverage, even without information about V2G systems, a PEV
user is always guaranteed the best price for charging/discharging. In
particular, we formulate the optimal energy cost problem for the PEV user by
adopting a Markov decision process framework. We then propose a learning
algorithm to help the PEV user make optimal decisions, e.g., to charge or
discharge and to buy or not to buy insurance, in an online fashion. Through
simulations, we show that cyber insurance is an efficient solution not only in
dealing with cyber risks, but also in maximizing revenue of the PEV user.

 <dc:description>  We propose an Event-B framework for modeling the underlying theoretical
foundations of Event-B. The aim of this framework is to reuse, for Event-B
itself, the refinement development process. This framework introduces first, a
functional kernel through an Event-B context, then, it defines Event-B
projects, their static and dynamic semantics through Event-B machines. We
intend to use this framework for the validation of Event-B plugins related to
distribution and for Event-B extensions related to composition and
decomposition.

 <dc:description>  To ensure proper functioning of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), it is
crucial that the network is able to detect anomalies in communication quality
(e.g., RSSI), which may cause performance degradation, so that the network can
react accordingly. In this paper, we introduce RADIUS, a lightweight system for
the purpose. The design of RADIUS is aimed at minimizing the detection error
(caused by normal randomness of RSSI) in discriminating good links from weak
links and at reaching high detection accuracy under diverse link conditions and
dynamic environment changes. Central to the design is a threshold-based
decision approach that has its foundation on the Bayes decision theory. In
RADIUS, various techniques are developed to address challenges inherent in
applying this approach. In addition, through extensive experiments, proper
configuration of the parameters involved in these techniques is identified for
an indoor environment. In a prototype implementation of the RADIUS system
deployed in an indoor testbed, the results show that RADIUS is accurate in
detecting anomalous link quality degradation for all links across the network,
maintaining a stable error rate of 6.13% on average.

 <dc:description>  Based on the observation that the correlation between observed traffic at two
measurement points or traffic stations may be time-varying, attributable to the
time-varying speed which subsequently causes variations in the time required to
travel between the two points, in this paper, we develop a modified Space-Time
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (STARIMA) model with time-varying lags
for short-term traffic flow prediction. Particularly, the temporal lags in the
modified STARIMA change with the time-varying speed at different time of the
day or equivalently change with the (time-varying) time required to travel
between two measurement points. Firstly, a technique is developed to evaluate
the temporal lag in the STARIMA model, where the temporal lag is formulated as
a function of the spatial lag (spatial distance) and the average speed.
Secondly, an unsupervised classification algorithm based on ISODATA algorithm
is designed to classify different time periods of the day according to the
variation of the speed. The classification helps to determine the appropriate
time lag to use in the STARIMA model. Finally, a STARIMA-based model with
time-varying lags is developed for short-term traffic prediction. Experimental
results using real traffic data show that the developed STARIMA-based model
with time-varying lags has superior accuracy compared with its counterpart
developed using the traditional cross-correlation function and without
employing time-varying lags.

 <dc:description>  Novel hardware-aided trusted execution environments, as provided by Intel's
Software Guard Extensions (SGX), enable to execute applications in a secure
context that enforces confidentiality and integrity of the application state
even when the host system is misbehaving. While this paves the way towards
secure and trustworthy cloud computing, essential system support to protect
persistent application state against rollback and forking attacks is missing.
  In this paper we present LCM - a lightweight protocol to establish a
collective memory amongst all clients of a remote application to detect
integrity and consistency violations. LCM enables the detection of rollback
attacks against the remote application, enforces the consistency notion of
fork-linearizability and notifies clients about operation stability. The
protocol exploits the trusted execution environment, complements it with simple
client-side operations, and maintains only small, constant storage at the
clients. This simplifies the solution compared to previous approaches, where
the clients had to verify all operations initiated by other clients. We have
implemented LCM and demonstrated its advantages with a key-value store
application. The evaluation shows that it introduces low network and
computation overhead; in particular, a LCM-protected key-value store achieves
0.72x - 0.98x of a SGX-secured key-value store throughput.

 <dc:title>Secrecy Outage Analysis for Downlink Transmissions in the Presence of

 <dc:description>  We analyze the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for wireless
networks with spatially (Poisson) distributed eavesdroppers (EDs) under the
assumption that the base station employs transmit antenna selection (TAS) to
enhance secrecy performance. We compare the cases where the receiving user
equipment (UE) operates in half-duplex (HD) mode and full-duplex (FD) mode. In
the latter case, the UE simultaneously receives the intended downlink message
and transmits a jamming signal to strengthen secrecy. We investigate two models
of (semi)passive eavesdropping: (1) EDs act independently and (2) EDs collude
to intercept the transmitted message. For both of these models, we obtain
expressions for the secrecy outage probability in the downlink for HD and FD UE
operation. The expressions for HD systems have very accurate approximate or
exact forms in terms of elementary and/or special functions for all path loss
exponents. Those related to the FD systems have exact integral forms for
general path loss exponents, while exact closed forms are given for specific
exponents. A closed-form approximation is also derived for the FD case with
colluding EDs. The resulting analysis shows that the reduction in the secrecy
outage probability is logarithmic in the number of antennas used for TAS and
identifies conditions under which HD operation should be used instead of FD
jamming at the UE. These performance trends and exact relations between system
parameters can be used to develop adaptive power allocation and duplex
operation methods in practice. Examples of such techniques are alluded to
herein.

 <dc:description>  Among the manifold takes on world literature, it is our goal to contribute to
the discussion from a digital point of view by analyzing the representation of
world literature in Wikipedia with its millions of articles in hundreds of
languages. As a preliminary, we introduce and compare three different
approaches to identify writers on Wikipedia using data from DBpedia, a
community project with the goal of extracting and providing structured
information from Wikipedia. Equipped with our basic set of writers, we analyze
how they are represented throughout the 15 biggest Wikipedia language versions.
We combine intrinsic measures (mostly examining the connectedness of articles)
with extrinsic ones (analyzing how often articles are frequented by readers)
and develop methods to evaluate our results. The better part of our findings
seems to convey a rather conservative, old-fashioned version of world
literature, but a version derived from reproducible facts revealing an implicit
literary canon based on the editing and reading behavior of millions of people.
While still having to solve some known issues, the introduced methods will help
us build an observatory of world literature to further investigate its
representativeness and biases.

 <dc:description>  As a contribution to reproducible research, this paper presents a framework
and a database to improve the development, evaluation and comparison of methods
for gait recognition from motion capture (MoCap) data. The evaluation framework
provides implementation details and source codes of state-of-the-art
human-interpretable geometric features as well as our own approaches where gait
features are learned by a modification of Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis
with the Maximum Margin Criterion, and by a combination of Principal Component
Analysis and Linear Discriminant Analysis. It includes a description and source
codes of a mechanism for evaluating four class separability coefficients of
feature space and four rank-based classifier performance metrics. This
framework also contains a tool for learning a custom classifier and for
classifying a custom query on a custom gallery. We provide an experimental
database along with source codes for its extraction from the general CMU MoCap
database.

 <dc:description>  Here, we present the concept of an open virtual prototyping framework for
maritime systems and operations that enables its users to develop re-usable
component or subsystem models, and combine them in full-system simulations for
prototyping, verification, training, and performance studies. This framework
consists of a set of guidelines for model coupling, high-level and low-level
coupling interfaces to guarantee interoperability, a full-system simulation
software, and example models and demonstrators. We discuss the requirements for
such a framework, address the challenges and the possibilities in fulfilling
them, and aim to give a list of best practices for modular and efficient
virtual prototyping and full-system simulation. The context of our work is
within maritime systems and operations, but the issues and solutions we present
here are general enough to be of interest to a much broader audience, both
industrial and scientific.

 <dc:title>Online Learning Sensing Matrix and Sparsifying Dictionary Simultaneously

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers simultaneously optimizing the Sensing Matrix and
Sparsifying Dictionary (SMSD) on a large training dataset. We propose an online
algorithm that consists of a closed-form solution for optimizing the sensing
matrix with a fixed sparsifying dictionary and a stochastic method for
optimizing the sparsifying dictionary on a large training dataset when the
sensing matrix is fixed. Benefiting from training on a large dataset, the
obtained compressive sensing system via the proposed algorithm yields a much
better performance in terms of signal recovery accuracy than the existing ones.
The simulation results on natural images demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed online algorithm compared with the existing methods.

 <dc:description>  We study finite alphabet channels with Unit Memory on the previous Channel
Outputs called UMCO channels. We identify necessary and sufficient conditions,
to test whether the capacity achieving channel input distributions with
feedback are time-invariant, and whether feedback capacity is characterized by
single letter, expressions, similar to that of memoryless channels. The method
is based on showing that a certain dynamic programming equation, which in
general, is a nested optimization problem over the sequence of channel input
distributions, reduces to a non-nested optimization problem. Moreover, for UMCO
channels, we give a simple expression for the ML error exponent, and we
identify sufficient conditions to test whether feedback does not increase
capacity. We derive similar results, when transmission cost constraints are
imposed. We apply the results to a special class of the UMCO channels, the
Binary State Symmetric Channel (BSSC) with and without transmission cost
constraints, to show that the optimization problem of feedback capacity is
non-nested, the capacity achieving channel input distribution and the
corresponding channel output transition probability distribution are
time-invariant, and feedback capacity is characterized by a single letter
formulae, precisely as Shannon's single letter characterization of capacity of
memoryless channels. Then we derive closed form expressions for the capacity
achieving channel input distribution and feedback capacity. We use the closed
form expressions to evaluate an error exponent for ML decoding.

 <dc:description>  Logarithmic score and information divergence appear in information theory,
statistics, statistical mechanics, and portfolio theory. We demonstrate that
all these topics involve some kind of optimization that leads directly to
regret functions and such regret functions are often given by a Bregman
divergence. If the regret function also fulfills a sufficiency condition it
must be proportional to information divergence. We will demonstrate that
sufficiency is equivalent to the apparently weaker notion of locality and it is
also equivalent to the apparently stronger notion of monotonicity. These
sufficiency conditions have quite different relevance in the different areas of
application, and often they are not fulfilled. Therefore sufficiency conditions
can be used to explain when results from one area can be transferred directly
to another and when one will experience differences.

 <dc:title>Path-following based Point Matching using Similarity Transformation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lian, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To address the problem of 3D point matching where the poses of two point sets
are unknown, we adapt a recently proposed path following based method to use
similarity transformation instead of the original affine transformation. The
reduced number of transformation parameters leads to more constrained and
desirable matching results. Experimental results demonstrate better robustness
of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Neural Style Transfer has recently demonstrated very exciting results which
catches eyes in both academia and industry. Despite the amazing results, the
principle of neural style transfer, especially why the Gram matrices could
represent style remains unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel
interpretation of neural style transfer by treating it as a domain adaptation
problem. Specifically, we theoretically show that matching the Gram matrices of
feature maps is equivalent to minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) with
the second order polynomial kernel. Thus, we argue that the essence of neural
style transfer is to match the feature distributions between the style images
and the generated images. To further support our standpoint, we experiment with
several other distribution alignment methods, and achieve appealing results. We
believe this novel interpretation connects these two important research fields,
and could enlighten future researches.

 <dc:title>A Generalization of Quasi-twisted Codes: Multi-twisted codes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cyclic codes and their various generalizations, such as quasi-twisted (QT)
codes, have a special place in algebraic coding theory. Among other things,
many of the best-known or optimal codes have been obtained from these classes.
In this work we introduce a new generalization of QT codes that we call
multi-twisted (MT) codes and study some of their basic properties. Presenting
several methods of constructing codes in this class and obtaining bounds on the
minimum distances, we show that there exist codes with good parameters in this
class that cannot be obtained as QT or constacyclic codes. This suggests that
considering this larger class in computer searches is promising for
constructing codes with better parameters than currently best-known linear
codes. Working with this new class of codes motivated us to consider a problem
about binomials over finite fields and to discover a result that is interesting
in its own right.

 <dc:description>  Complex systems in a wide variety of areas such as biological modeling, image
processing, and language recognition can be modeled using networks of very
simple machines called finite automata. Connecting subsystems modeled using
finite automata into a network allows for more computational power. One such
network, called a cellular automaton, consists of an n-dimensional array for n
&gt; 1 with a single finite automaton located at each point of the array. One of
the oldest problems associated with cellular automata is the firing
synchronization problem, originally proposed by John Myhill in 1957. As with
any long-standing problem, there are a large number of solutions to the firing
synchronization problem. Our goal, and the contribution of this work, is to
summarize recent solutions to the problem. We focus primarily on solutions to
the original problem, that is, the problem where the network is a
one-dimensional array and there is a single initiator located at one of the
ends. We summarize both minimal-time and non-minimal-time solutions, with an
emphasis on solutions that were published after 1998. We also focus on
solutions that minimize the number of states required by the finite automata.
In the process we also identify open problems that remain in terms of finding
minimal-state solutions to the firing synchronization problem.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Planning and Lifted Inference</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khardon, Roni</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lifted probabilistic inference (Poole, 2003) and symbolic dynamic programming
for lifted stochastic planning (Boutilier et al, 2001) were introduced around
the same time as algorithmic efforts to use abstraction in stochastic systems.
Over the years, these ideas evolved into two distinct lines of research, each
supported by a rich literature. Lifted probabilistic inference focused on
efficient arithmetic operations on template-based graphical models under a
finite domain assumption while symbolic dynamic programming focused on
supporting sequential decision-making in rich quantified logical action models
and on open domain reasoning. Given their common motivation but different focal
points, both lines of research have yielded highly complementary innovations.
In this chapter, we aim to help close the gap between these two research areas
by providing an overview of lifted stochastic planning from the perspective of
probabilistic inference, showing strong connections to other chapters in this
book. This also allows us to define Generalized Lifted Inference as a paradigm
that unifies these areas and elucidates open problems for future research that
can benefit both lifted inference and stochastic planning.

assumptions. The limiting distribution of the estimator is given. Some
simulations are conducted to illustrate our theoretical results.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Application security traditionally strongly relies upon security of the
underlying operating system. However, operating systems often fall victim to
software attacks, compromising security of applications as well. To overcome
this dependency, Intel introduced SGX, which allows to protect application code
against a subverted or malicious OS by running it in a hardware-protected
enclave. However, SGX lacks support for generic trusted I/O paths to protect
user input and output between enclaves and I/O devices.
  This work presents SGXIO, a generic trusted path architecture for SGX,
allowing user applications to run securely on top of an untrusted OS, while at
the same time supporting trusted paths to generic I/O devices. To achieve this,
SGXIO combines the benefits of SGX's easy programming model with traditional
hypervisor-based trusted path architectures. Moreover, SGXIO can tweak insecure
debug enclaves to behave like secure production enclaves. SGXIO surpasses
traditional use cases in cloud computing and makes SGX technology usable for
protecting user-centric, local applications against kernel-level keyloggers and
likewise. It is compatible to unmodified operating systems and works on a
modern commodity notebook out of the box. Hence, SGXIO is particularly
promising for the broad x86 community to which SGX is readily available.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art in
various computer vision tasks, but they are still premature for most sensor
data, especially in pervasive and wearable computing. A major reason for this
is the limited amount of annotated training data. In this paper, we propose the
idea of leveraging the discriminative power of pre-trained deep CNNs on
2-dimensional sensor data by transforming the sensor modality to the visual
domain. By three proposed strategies, 2D sensor output is converted into
pressure distribution imageries. Then we utilize a pre-trained CNN for transfer
learning on the converted imagery data. We evaluate our method on a gait
dataset of floor surface pressure mapping. We obtain a classification accuracy
of 87.66%, which outperforms the conventional machine learning methods by over
10%.

 <dc:description>  We introduce SalGAN, a deep convolutional neural network for visual saliency
prediction trained with adversarial examples. The first stage of the network
consists of a generator model whose weights are learned by back-propagation
computed from a binary cross entropy (BCE) loss over downsampled versions of
the saliency maps. The resulting prediction is processed by a discriminator
network trained to solve a binary classification task between the saliency maps
generated by the generative stage and the ground truth ones. Our experiments
show how adversarial training allows reaching state-of-the-art performance
across different metrics when combined with a widely-used loss function like
BCE.

 <dc:description>  Driven by the visions of Internet of Things and 5G communications, recent
years have seen a paradigm shift in mobile computing, from the centralized
Mobile Cloud Computing towards Mobile Edge Computing (MEC). The main feature of
MEC is to push mobile computing, network control and storage to the network
edges (e.g., base stations and access points) so as to enable
computation-intensive and latency-critical applications at the resource-limited
mobile devices. MEC promises dramatic reduction in latency and mobile energy
consumption, tackling the key challenges for materializing 5G vision. The
promised gains of MEC have motivated extensive efforts in both academia and
industry on developing the technology. A main thrust of MEC research is to
seamlessly merge the two disciplines of wireless communications and mobile
computing, resulting in a wide-range of new designs ranging from techniques for
computation offloading to network architectures. This paper provides a
comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art MEC research with a focus on joint
radio-and-computational resource management. We also present a research outlook
consisting of a set of promising directions for MEC research, including MEC
system deployment, cache-enabled MEC, mobility management for MEC, green MEC,
as well as privacy-aware MEC. Advancements in these directions will facilitate
the transformation of MEC from theory to practice. Finally, we introduce recent
standardization efforts on MEC as well as some typical MEC application
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Data is continuously generated by modern data sources, and a recent challenge
in machine learning has been to develop techniques that perform well in an
incremental (streaming) setting. In this paper, we investigate the problem of
private machine learning, where as common in practice, the data is not given at
once, but rather arrives incrementally over time.
  We introduce the problems of private incremental ERM and private incremental
regression where the general goal is to always maintain a good empirical risk
minimizer for the history observed under differential privacy. Our first
contribution is a generic transformation of private batch ERM mechanisms into
private incremental ERM mechanisms, based on a simple idea of invoking the
private batch ERM procedure at some regular time intervals. We take this
construction as a baseline for comparison. We then provide two mechanisms for
the private incremental regression problem. Our first mechanism is based on
privately constructing a noisy incremental gradient function, which is then
used in a modified projected gradient procedure at every timestep. This
mechanism has an excess empirical risk of $\approx\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the
dimensionality of the data. While from the results of [Bassily et al. 2014]
this bound is tight in the worst-case, we show that certain geometric
properties of the input and constraint set can be used to derive significantly
better results for certain interesting regression problems.

 <dc:description>  Aggregate analysis, such as comparing country-wise sales versus global market
share across product categories, is often complicated by the unavailability of
common join attributes, e.g., category, across diverse datasets from different
geographies or retail chains, even after disparate data is technically ingested
into a common data lake. Sometimes this is a missing data issue, while in other
cases it may be inherent, e.g., the records in different geographical databases
may actually describe different product 'SKUs', or follow different norms for
categorization. Record linkage techniques can be used to automatically map
products in different data sources to a common set of global attributes,
thereby enabling federated aggregation joins to be performed. Traditional
record-linkage techniques are typically unsupervised, relying textual
similarity features across attributes to estimate matches. In this paper, we
present an ensemble model combining minimal supervision using Bayesian network
models together with unsupervised textual matching for automating such
'attribute fusion'. We present results of our approach on a large volume of
real-life data from a market-research scenario and compare with a standard
record matching algorithm. Finally we illustrate how attribute fusion using
machine learning could be included as a data-lake management feature,
especially as our approach also provides confidence values for matches,
enabling human intervention, if required.

 <dc:title>Estimating Quality in Multi-Objective Bandits Optimization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many real-world applications are characterized by a number of conflicting
performance measures. As optimizing in a multi-objective setting leads to a set
of non-dominated solutions, a preference function is required for selecting the
solution with the appropriate trade-off between the objectives. The question
is: how good do estimations of these objectives have to be in order for the
solution maximizing the preference function to remain unchanged? In this paper,
we introduce the concept of preference radius to characterize the robustness of
the preference function and provide guidelines for controlling the quality of
estimations in the multi-objective setting. More specifically, we provide a
general formulation of multi-objective optimization under the bandits setting.
We show how the preference radius relates to the optimal gap and we use this
concept to provide a theoretical analysis of the Thompson sampling algorithm
from multivariate normal priors. We finally present experiments to support the
theoretical results and highlight the fact that one cannot simply scalarize
multi-objective problems into single-objective problems.

 <dc:description>  We proposed a probabilistic approach to joint modeling of participants'
reliability and humans' regularity in crowdsourced affective studies.
Reliability measures how likely a subject will respond to a question seriously;
and regularity measures how often a human will agree with other
seriously-entered responses coming from a targeted population.
Crowdsourcing-based studies or experiments, which rely on human self-reported
affect, pose additional challenges as compared with typical crowdsourcing
studies that attempt to acquire concrete non-affective labels of objects. The
reliability of participants has been massively pursued for typical
non-affective crowdsourcing studies, whereas the regularity of humans in an
affective experiment in its own right has not been thoroughly considered. It
has been often observed that different individuals exhibit different feelings
on the same test question, which does not have a sole correct response in the
first place. High reliability of responses from one individual thus cannot
conclusively result in high consensus across individuals. Instead, globally
testing consensus of a population is of interest to investigators. Built upon
the agreement multigraph among tasks and workers, our probabilistic model
differentiates subject regularity from population reliability. We demonstrate
the method's effectiveness for in-depth robust analysis of large-scale
crowdsourced affective data, including emotion and aesthetic assessments
collected by presenting visual stimuli to human subjects.

 <dc:title>Graph Product Multilayer Networks: Spectral Properties and Applications</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper aims to establish theoretical foundations of graph product
multilayer networks (GPMNs), a family of multilayer networks that can be
obtained as a graph product of two or more factor networks. Cartesian, direct
(tensor), and strong product operators are considered, and then generalized. We
first describe mathematical relationships between GPMNs and their factor
networks regarding their degree/strength, adjacency, and Laplacian spectra, and
then show that those relationships can still hold for nonsimple and generalized
GPMNs. Applications of GPMNs are discussed in three areas: predicting epidemic
thresholds, modeling propagation in nontrivial space and time, and analyzing
higher-order properties of self-similar networks. Directions of future research
are also discussed.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep learning techniques are increasingly popular in the textual entailment
task, overcoming the fragility of traditional discrete models with hard
alignments and logics. In particular, the recently proposed attention models
(Rockt\&quot;aschel et al., 2015; Wang and Jiang, 2015) achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy by computing soft word alignments between the premise and hypothesis
sentences. However, there remains a major limitation: this line of work
completely ignores syntax and recursion, which is helpful in many traditional
efforts. We show that it is beneficial to extend the attention model to tree
nodes between premise and hypothesis. More importantly, this subtree-level
attention reveals information about entailment relation. We study the recursive
composition of this subtree-level entailment relation, which can be viewed as a
soft version of the Natural Logic framework (MacCartney and Manning, 2009).
Experiments show that our structured attention and entailment composition model
can correctly identify and infer entailment relations from the bottom up, and
bring significant improvements in accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Technological developments alongside VLSI achievements enable mobile devices
to be equipped with multiple radio interfaces which is known as multihoming. On
the other hand, the combination of various wireless access technologies, known
as Next Generation Wireless Networks (NGWNs) has been introduced to provide
continuous connection to mobile devices in any time and location. Cognitive
radio networks as a part of NGWNs aroused to overcome spectrum inefficiency and
spectrum scarcity issues. In order to provide seamless and ubiquitous
connection across heterogeneous wireless access networks in the context of
cognitive radio networks, utilizing Mobile IPv6 is beneficial. In this paper, a
mobile device equipped with two radio interfaces is considered in order to
evaluate performance of spectrum handover in terms of handover latency. The
analytical results show that the proposed model can achieve better performance
compared to other related mobility management protocols mainly in terms of
handover latency.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a real-time software defined
multiple input multiple output (MIMO) visible light communication (VLC) system
employing link adaptation of spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity.
Real-time MIMO signal processing is implemented by using the Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) based Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices.
Software defined implantation of MIMO VLC can assist in enabling an adaptive
and reconfigurable communication system without hardware changes. We measured
the error vector magnitude (EVM), bit error rate (BER) and spectral efficiency
performance for single carrier M-QAM MIMO VLC using spatial diversity and
spatial multiplexing. Results show that spatial diversity MIMO VLC improves
error performance at the cost of spectral efficiency that spatial multiplexing
should enhance. We propose the adaptive MIMO solution that both modulation
schema and MIMO schema are dynamically adapted to the changing channel
conditions for enhancing the error performance and spectral efficiency. The
average error-free spectral efficiency of adaptive 2x2 MIMO VLC achieved 12
b/s/Hz over 2 meters indoor dynamic transmission.

 <dc:description>  This paper sets up a framework for designing a massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) testbed by investigating hardware (HW) and system-level
requirements such as processing complexity, duplexing mode and frame structure.
Taking these into account, a generic system and processing partitioning is
proposed which allows flexible scaling and processing distribution onto a
multitude of physically separated devices. Based on the given HW constraints
such as maximum number of links and maximum throughput for peer-to-peer
interconnections combined with processing capabilities, the framework allows to
evaluate modular HW components. To verify our design approach, we present the
LuMaMi (Lund University Massive MIMO) testbed which constitutes the first
reconfigurable real-time HW platform for prototyping massive MIMO. Utilizing up
to 100 base station antennas and more than 50 Field Programmable Gate Arrays,
up to 12 user equipments are served on the same time/frequency resource using
an LTE-like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing time-division
duplex-based transmission scheme. Proof-of-concept tests with this system show
that massive MIMO can simultaneously serve a multitude of users in a static
indoor and static outdoor environment utilizing the same time/frequency

 <dc:title>Effect of Cell-Selection on the Effective Fading Distribution in a

 <dc:description>  This paper characterizes the statistics of effective fading gain in
multi-tier cellular networks with strongest base station (BS) cell association
policy. First, we derive the probability of association with the $n$-th nearest
BS in the $k$-th tier. Next, we use this result to derive the probability
density function (PDF) of the channel fading gain (effective fading)
experienced by the user when associating with the strongest BS. Interestingly,
our results show that the effective channel gain distribution solely depends
upon the original channel fading and the path-loss exponent. Moreover, we show
that in the case of Nakagami-$m$ fading channels (Gamma distribution), the
distribution of the effective fading is also Gamma but with a gain of
$\frac{\alpha}{2}$ in the shape parameter, where $\alpha$ is the path-loss
exponent.

 <dc:title>Efficient Multi-Dimensional Mapping Using QAM Constellations for BICM-ID</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Navazi, Hassan M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hossain, Md. Jahangir</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bit-interleaved coded modulation with iterative decoding (BICM-ID) offers
very good error performance over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and
fading channels if it uses a wisely designed signal mapping. Further, error
performance of BICM-ID can significantly be improved by employing
multi-dimensional (MD) modulation. However, suitable MD mappings are obtained
by computer search techniques except for MD modulations that use smaller
constellation e.g., binary phase shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase shift
keying (QPSK) and $8$-ary phase shift keying ($8$-PSK) as basic modulation. The
alphabet size of MD modulations increases exponentially as the order of the
basic modulation increases and computer search becomes intractable. In this
paper, we propose a systematic mapping method for MD modulations. The
innovativeness of our proposed method is that it generates MD mappings using
$16$- and $64$-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) very efficiently. The
presented numerical results show that the proposed method improves bit error
rate (BER) of BICM-ID.

 <dc:description>  For large-scale graph analytics on the GPU, the irregularity of data access
and control flow, and the complexity of programming GPUs, have presented two
significant challenges to developing a programmable high-performance graph
library. &quot;Gunrock&quot;, our graph-processing system designed specifically for the
GPU, uses a high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric abstraction focused on
operations on a vertex or edge frontier. Gunrock achieves a balance between
performance and expressiveness by coupling high performance GPU computing
primitives and optimization strategies with a high-level programming model that
allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives with small code size
and minimal GPU programming knowledge. We characterize the performance of
various optimization strategies and evaluate Gunrock's overall performance on
different GPU architectures on a wide range of graph primitives that span from
traversal-based algorithms and ranking algorithms, to triangle counting and
bipartite-graph-based algorithms. The results show that on a single GPU,
Gunrock has on average at least an order of magnitude speedup over Boost and
PowerGraph, comparable performance to the fastest GPU hardwired primitives and
CPU shared-memory graph libraries such as Ligra and Galois, and better
performance than any other GPU high-level graph library.

 <dc:description>  Multisplit is a broadly useful parallel primitive that permutes its input
data into contiguous buckets or bins, where the function that categorizes an
element into a bucket is provided by the programmer. Due to the lack of an
efficient multisplit on GPUs, programmers often choose to implement multisplit
with a sort. One way is to first generate an auxiliary array of bucket IDs and
then sort input data based on it. In case smaller indexed buckets possess
smaller valued keys, another way for multisplit is to directly sort input data.
Both methods are inefficient and require more work than necessary: the former
requires more expensive data movements while the latter spends unnecessary
effort in sorting elements within each bucket. In this work, we provide a
parallel model and multiple implementations for the multisplit problem. Our
principal focus is multisplit for a small (up to 256) number of buckets. We use
warp-synchronous programming models and emphasize warp-wide communications to
avoid branch divergence and reduce memory usage. We also hierarchically reorder
input elements to achieve better coalescing of global memory accesses. On a
GeForce GTX 1080 GPU, we can reach a peak throughput of 18.93 Gkeys/s (or 11.68
Gpairs/s) for a key-only (or key-value) multisplit. Finally, we demonstrate how
multisplit can be used as a building block for radix sort. In our
multisplit-based sort implementation, we achieve comparable performance to the
fastest GPU sort routines, sorting 32-bit keys (and key-value pairs) with a
throughput of 3.0 G keys/s (and 2.1 Gpair/s).

 <dc:description>  Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) scheme is considered to be one promising
non-orthogonal multiple access technology for the future fifth generation (5G)
communications. Due to the sparse nature, message passing algorithm (MPA) has
been used as the receiver to achieve close to maximum likelihood (ML) detection
performance with much lower complexity. However, the complexity order of MPA is
still exponential with the size of codebook and the degree of signal
superposition on a given resource element. In this paper, we propose a novel
low complexity iterative receiver based on expectation propagation algorithm
(EPA), which reduces the complexity order from exponential to linear.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EPA receiver achieves nearly
the same block error rate (BLER) performance as the conventional message
passing algorithm (MPA) receiver with orders less complexity.

 <dc:title>A Matrix Factorization Approach for Learning Semidefinite-Representable

 <dc:description>  Regularization techniques are widely employed in optimization-based
approaches for solving ill-posed inverse problems in data analysis and
scientific computing. These methods are based on augmenting the objective with
a penalty function, which is specified based on prior domain-specific expertise
to induce a desired structure in the solution. We consider the problem of
learning suitable regularization functions from data in settings in which
precise domain knowledge is not directly available. Previous work under the
title of `dictionary learning' or `sparse coding' may be viewed as learning a
regularization function that can be computed via linear programming. We
describe generalizations of these methods to learn regularizers that can be
computed and optimized via semidefinite programming. Our framework for learning
such semidefinite regularizers is based on obtaining structured factorizations
of data matrices, and our algorithmic approach for computing these
factorizations combines recent techniques for rank minimization problems along
with an operator analog of Sinkhorn scaling. Under suitable conditions on the
input data, our algorithm provides a locally linearly convergent method for
identifying the correct regularizer that promotes the type of structure
contained in the data. Our analysis is based on the stability properties of
Operator Sinkhorn scaling and their relation to geometric aspects of
determinantal varieties (in particular tangent spaces with respect to these
varieties). The regularizers obtained using our framework can be employed
effectively in semidefinite programming relaxations for solving inverse
problems.

 <dc:description>  We draw a random subset of $k$ rows from a frame with $n$ rows (vectors) and
$m$ columns (dimensions), where $k$ and $m$ are proportional to $n$. For a
variety of important deterministic equiangular tight frames (ETFs) and tight
non-ETF frames, we consider the distribution of singular values of the
$k$-subset matrix. We observe that for large $n$ they can be precisely
described by a known probability distribution -- Wachter's MANOVA spectral
distribution, a phenomenon that was previously known only for two types of
random frames. In terms of convergence to this limit, the $k$-subset matrix
from all these frames is shown to be empirically indistinguishable from the
classical MANOVA (Jacobi) random matrix ensemble. Thus empirically the MANOVA
ensemble offers a universal description of the spectra of randomly selected
$k$-subframes, even those taken from deterministic frames. The same
universality phenomena is shown to hold for notable random frames as well. This
description enables exact calculations of properties of solutions for systems
of linear equations based on a random choice of $k$ frame vectors out of $n$
possible vectors, and has a variety of implications for erasure coding,
compressed sensing, and sparse recovery. When the aspect ratio $m/n$ is small,
the MANOVA spectrum tends to the well known Marcenko-Pastur distribution of the
singular values of a Gaussian matrix, in agreement with previous work on highly
redundant frames. Our results are empirical, but they are exhaustive, precise
and fully reproducible.

 <dc:title>Downlink Coverage Analysis for a Finite 3D Wireless Network of Unmanned
  Aerial Vehicles</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a finite network of unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) serving a given region. Modeling this network as a uniform binomial
point process (BPP), we derive the downlink coverage probability of a reference
receiver located at an arbitrary position on the ground assuming Nakagami-$m$
fading for all wireless links. The reference receiver is assumed to connect to
its closest transmitting node as is usually the case in cellular systems. After
deriving the distribution of distances from the reference receiver to the
serving and interfering nodes, we derive an exact expression for downlink
coverage probability in terms of the derivative of Laplace transform of
interference power distribution. In the downlink of this system, it is not
unusual to encounter scenarios in which the line-of-sight (LOS) component is
significantly stronger than the reflected multipath components. To emulate such
scenarios, we also derive the coverage probability in the absence of fading
from the results of Nakagami-$m$ fading by taking the limit $m \to \infty$.
Using asymptotic expansion of incomplete gamma function, we concretely show
that this limit reduces to a redundant condition. Consequently, we derive an
accurate coverage probability approximation for this case using dominant
interferer-based approach in which the effect of dominant interferer is exactly
captured and the residual interference from other interferers is carefully
approximated. We then derive the bounds of the approximate coverage probability
using Berry-Esseen theorem. Our analyses reveal several useful trends in
coverage probability as a function of height of the transmitting nodes and the
location of reference receiver on the ground.

 <dc:description>  This paper reviews the current status and challenges of Neural Networks (NNs)
based machine learning approaches for modern power grid stability control
including their design and implementation methodologies. NNs are widely
accepted as Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches offering an alternative way
to control complex and ill-defined problems. In this paper various application
of NNs for power system rotor angle stabilization and control problem is
discussed. The main focus of this paper is on the use of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) and Supervised Learning (SL) algorithms in power system wide-area control
(WAC). Generally, these algorithms due to their capability in modeling
nonlinearities and uncertainties are used for transient classification,
neuro-control, wide-area monitoring and control, renewable energy management
and control, and so on. The works of researchers in the field of conventional
and renewable energy systems are reported and categorized. Paper concludes by
presenting, comparing and evaluating various learning techniques and
infrastructure configurations based on efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Incentive mechanisms for crowdsourcing have been extensively studied under
the framework of all-pay auctions. Along a distinct line, this paper proposes
to use Tullock contests as an alternative tool to design incentive mechanisms
for crowdsourcing. We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to
attracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.
In this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by
superseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock
contests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's
contribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility. We show that
this approach leads to attractive practical advantages: (a) it is well-suited
for rapid prototyping in fully distributed web agents and smartphone apps; (b)
it overcomes the disincentive to participate caused by players' antagonism to
an increasing number of rivals. Furthermore, we optimize conventional,
fixed-prize Tullock contests to construct the most superior benchmark to
compare against our mechanism. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our
mechanism significantly outperforms the optimal benchmark, by over three folds
on the crowdsourcer's utility cum profit and up to nine folds on the players'
social welfare.

 <dc:description>  We present the Overlapping Domain Cover (ODC) notion for kernel machines, as
a set of overlapping subsets of the data that covers the entire training set
and optimized to be spatially cohesive as possible. We show how this notion
benefit the speed of local kernel machines for regression in terms of both
speed while achieving while minimizing the prediction error. We propose an
efficient ODC framework, which is applicable to various regression models and
in particular reduces the complexity of Twin Gaussian Processes (TGP)
regression from cubic to quadratic. Our notion is also applicable to several
kernel methods (e.g., Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) and IWTGP regression, as
shown in our experiments). We also theoretically justified the idea behind our
method to improve local prediction by the overlapping cover. We validated and
analyzed our method on three benchmark human pose estimation datasets and
interesting findings are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Consensus formation in a social network is modeled by a dynamic game of a
prescribed duration played by members of the network. Each member independently
minimizes a cost function that represents his/her motive. An integral cost
function penalizes a member's differences of opinion from the others as well as
from his/her own initial opinion, weighted by influence and stubbornness
parameters. Each member uses its rate of change of opinion as a control input.
This defines a dynamic non-cooperative game that turns out to have a unique
Nash equilibrium. Analytic explicit expressions are derived for the opinion
trajectory of each member for two representative cases obtained by suitable
assumptions on the graph topology of the network. These trajectories are then
examined under different assumptions on the relative sizes of the influence and
stubbornness parameters that appear in the cost functions.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Questionnaires for Direct Identification of Optimal Product

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of identifying the most profitable product design
from a finite set of candidates under unknown consumer preference. A standard
approach to this problem follows a two-step strategy: First, estimate the
preference of the consumer population, represented as a point in part-worth
space, using an adaptive discrete-choice questionnaire. Second, integrate the
estimated part-worth vector with engineering feasibility and cost models to
determine the optimal design. In this work, we (1) demonstrate that accurate
preference estimation is neither necessary nor sufficient for identifying the
optimal design, (2) introduce a novel adaptive questionnaire that leverages
knowledge about engineering feasibility and manufacturing costs to directly
determine the optimal design, and (3) interpret product design in terms of a
nonlinear segmentation of part-worth space, and use this interpretation to
illuminate the intrinsic difficulty of optimal design in the presence of noisy
questionnaire responses. We establish the superiority of the proposed approach
using a well-documented optimal product design task. This study demonstrates
how the identification of optimal product design can be accelerated by
integrating marketing and manufacturing knowledge into the adaptive
questionnaire.

 <dc:description>  Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) aims at integrating sensitive
information from multiple disparate databases of different organizations. PPRL
approaches are increasingly required in real-world application areas such as
healthcare, national security, and business. Previous approaches have mostly
focused on linking only two databases as well as the use of a dedicated linkage
unit. Scaling PPRL to more databases (multi-party PPRL) is an open challenge
since privacy threats as well as the computation and communication costs for
record linkage increase significantly with the number of databases. We thus
propose the use of a new encoding method of sensitive data based on Counting
Bloom Filters (CBF) to improve privacy for multi-party PPRL. We also
investigate optimizations to reduce communication and computation costs for
CBF-based multi-party PPRL with and without the use of a dedicated linkage
unit. Empirical evaluations conducted with real datasets show the viability of
the proposed approaches and demonstrate their scalability, linkage quality, and
privacy protection.

 <dc:description>  Cyclic codes have efficient encoding and decoding algorithms over finite
fields, so that they have practical applications in communication systems,
consumer electronics and data storage systems. The objective of this paper is
to give eight new classes of optimal ternary cyclic codes with parameters
$[3^m-1,3^m-1-2m,4]$, according to a result on the non-existence of solutions
to a certain equation over $F_{3^m}$. It is worth noticing that some recent
conclusions on such optimal ternary cyclic codes are some special cases of our
work. More importantly, three of the nine open problems proposed by Ding and
Helleseth in [8] are solved completely. In addition, another one among the nine
open problems is also promoted.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Probabilistic graphic model is an elegant framework to compactly present
complex real-world observations by modeling uncertainty and logical flow
(conditionally independent factors). In this paper, we present a probabilistic
framework of neighborhood-based recommendation methods (PNBM) in which
similarity is regarded as an unobserved factor. Thus, PNBM leads the estimation
of user preference to maximizing a posterior over similarity. We further
introduce a novel multi-layer similarity descriptor which models and learns the
joint influence of various features under PNBM, and name the new framework
MPNBM. Empirical results on real-world datasets show that MPNBM allows very
accurate estimation of user preferences.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication operated in frequency bands between 30
and 300 GHz has attracted extensive attention due to the potential ability of
offering orders of magnitude greater bandwidths combined with further gains via
beamforming and spatial multiplexing from multi-element antenna arrays. MmWave
system may exploit the hybrid analog and digital precoding to achieve
simultaneously the diversity, array and multiplexing gain with a lower cost of
implementation. Motivated by this, in this paper, we investigate the design of
hybrid precoder and combiner with sub-connected architecture, where each radio
frequency chain is connected to only a subset of base station (BS) antennas
from the perspective of energy efficient transmission. The problem of interest
is a non-convex and NP-hard problem that is difficult to solve directly. In
order to address it, we resort to design a two-layer optimization method to
solve the problem of interest by exploiting jointly the interference alignment
and fractional programming. First, the analog precoder and combiner are
optimized via the alternating-direction optimization method (ADOM) where the
phase shifter can be easily adjusted with an analytical structure. Then, we
optimize the digital precoder and combiner based on an effective multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) channel coefficient. The convergence of the proposed
algorithms is proved using the monotonic boundary theorem and fractional
programming theory. Extensive simulation results are given to validate the
effectiveness of the presented method and to evaluate the energy efficiency
performance under various system configurations.

 <dc:title>Subpopulation Diversity Based Selecting Migration Moment in Distributed

 <dc:creator>Li, Chengjun</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In distributed evolutionary algorithms, migration interval is used to decide
migration moments. Nevertheless, migration moments predetermined by intervals
cannot match the dynamic situation of evolution. In this paper, a scheme of
setting the success rate of migration based on subpopulation diversity at each
interval is proposed. With the scheme, migration still occurs at intervals, but
the probability of immigrants entering the target subpopulation will be
determined by the diversity of this subpopulation according to a proposed
formula. An analysis shows that the time consumption of our scheme is
acceptable. In our experiments, the basement of parallelism is an evolutionary
algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. Under different value
combinations of parameters for the formula, outcomes for eight benchmark
instances of the distributed evolutionary algorithm with the proposed scheme
are compared with those of a traditional one, respectively. Results show that
the distributed evolutionary algorithm based on our scheme has a significant
advantage on solutions especially for high difficulty instances. Moreover, it
can be seen that the algorithm with the scheme has the most outstanding
performance under three value combinations of above-mentioned parameters for
the formula.

from automobile GPS trip data. We propose a novel Autoencoder Regularized deep
neural Network (ARNet) and a trip encoding framework trip2vec to learn drivers'
driving styles directly from GPS records, by combining supervised and
unsupervised feature learning in a unified architecture. Experiments on a
challenging driver number estimation problem and the driver identification
problem show that ARNet can learn a good generalized driving style
representation: It significantly outperforms existing methods and alternative
architectures by reaching the least estimation error on average (0.68, less
than one driver) and the highest identification accuracy (by at least 3%
improvement) compared with traditional supervised learning methods.

 <dc:description>  The analysis of networks affects the research of many real phenomena. The
complex network structure can be viewed as a network's state at the time of the
analysis or as a result of the process through which the network arises.
Research activities focus on both and, thanks to them, we know not only many
measurable properties of networks but also the essence of some phenomena that
occur during the evolution of networks. One typical research area is the
analysis of co-authorship networks and their evolution. In our paper, the
analysis of one real-world co-authorship network and inspiration from existing
models form the basis of the hypothesis from which we derive new 3-lambda
network model. This hypothesis works with the assumption that regular behavior
of nodes revolves around an average. However, some anomalies may occur. The
3-lambda model is stochastic and uses the three parameters associated with the
average behavior of the nodes. The growth of the network based on this model
assumes that one step of the growth is an interaction in which both new and
existing nodes are participating. In the paper we present the results of the
analysis of a co-authorship network and formulate a hypothesis and a model
based on this hypothesis. Later in the paper, we examine the outputs from the
network generator based on the 3-lambda model and show that generated networks
have characteristics known from the environment of real-world networks.

 <dc:title>Temporal Effects on Hashtag Reuse in Twitter: A Cognitive-Inspired
  Hashtag Recommendation Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kowald, Dominik</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Hashtags have become a powerful tool in social platforms such as Twitter to
categorize and search for content, and to spread short messages across members
of the social network. In this paper, we study temporal hashtag usage practices
in Twitter with the aim of designing a cognitive-inspired hashtag
recommendation algorithm we call BLLi,s. Our main idea is to incorporate the
effect of time on (i) individual hashtag reuse (i.e., reusing own hashtags),
and (ii) social hashtag reuse (i.e., reusing hashtags, which has been
previously used by a followee) into a predictive model. For this, we turn to
the Base-Level Learning (BLL) equation from the cognitive architecture ACT-R,
which accounts for the time-dependent decay of item exposure in human memory.
We validate BLLi,s using two crawled Twitter datasets in two evaluation
scenarios: firstly, only temporal usage patterns of past hashtag assignments
are utilized and secondly, these patterns are combined with a content-based
analysis of the current tweet. In both scenarios, we find not only that
temporal effects play an important role for both individual and social hashtag
reuse but also that BLLi,s provides significantly better prediction accuracy
and ranking results than current state-of-the-art hashtag recommendation
methods.

 <dc:description>  Multi-agent systems (MAS) is able to characterize the behavior of individual
agent and the interaction between agents. Thus, it motivates us to leverage the
distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP), a framework of modeling
MAS, to solve the user association problem in heterogeneous networks (HetNets).
Two issues we have to consider when we take DCOP into the application of HetNet
including: (i) How to set up an effective model by DCOP taking account of the
negtive impact of the increment of users on the modeling process (ii) Which
kind of algorithms is more suitable to balance the time consumption and the
quality of soltuion. Aiming to overcome these issues, we firstly come up with
an ECAV-$\eta$ (Each Connection As Variable) model in which a parameter $\eta$
with an adequate assignment ($\eta=3$ in this paper) is able to control the
scale of the model. After that, a Markov chain (MC) based algorithm is proposed
on the basis of log-sum-exp function. Experimental results show that the
solution obtained by DCOP framework is better than the one obtained by the
Max-SINR algorithm. Comparing with the Lagrange dual decomposition based method
(LDD), the solution performance has been improved since there is no need to
transform original problem into a satisfied one. In addition, it is also
apparent that the DCOP based method has better robustness than LDD when the
number of users increases but the available resource at base stations are
limited.

 <dc:description>  We consider large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with a risk measure
of variability in cost, under the risk-aware MDPs paradigm. Previous studies
showed that risk-aware MDPs, based on a minimax approach to handling risk, can
be solved using dynamic programming for small to medium sized problems.
However, due to the &quot;curse of dimensionality&quot;, MDPs that model real-life
problems are typically prohibitively large for such approaches. In this paper,
we employ an approximate dynamic programming approach, and develop a family of
simulation-based algorithms to approximately solve large-scale risk-aware MDPs.
In parallel, we develop a unified convergence analysis technique to derive
sample complexity bounds for this new family of algorithms.

 <dc:description>  OpenML is an online machine learning platform where researchers can easily
share data, machine learning tasks and experiments as well as organize them
online to work and collaborate more efficiently. In this paper, we present an R
package to interface with the OpenML platform and illustrate its usage in
combination with the machine learning R package mlr. We show how the OpenML
package allows R users to easily search, download and upload data sets and
machine learning tasks. Furthermore, we also show how to upload results of
experiments, share them with others and download results from other users.
Beyond ensuring reproducibility of results, the OpenML platform automates much
of the drudge work, speeds up research, facilitates collaboration and increases
the users' visibility online.

 <dc:title>Toward negotiable reinforcement learning: shifting priorities in Pareto

 <dc:description>  Existing multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) algorithms do not
account for objectives that arise from players with differing beliefs.
Concretely, consider two players with different beliefs and utility functions
who may cooperate to build a machine that takes actions on their behalf. A
representation is needed for how much the machine's policy will prioritize each
player's interests over time. Assuming the players have reached common
knowledge of their situation, this paper derives a recursion that any Pareto
optimal policy must satisfy. Two qualitative observations can be made from the
recursion: the machine must (1) use each player's own beliefs in evaluating how
well an action will serve that player's utility function, and (2) shift the
relative priority it assigns to each player's expected utilities over time, by
a factor proportional to how well that player's beliefs predict the machine's
inputs. Observation (2) represents a substantial divergence from na\&quot;{i}ve
linear utility aggregation (as in Harsanyi's utilitarian theorem, and existing
MORL algorithms), which is shown here to be inadequate for Pareto optimal
sequential decision-making on behalf of players with different beliefs.

 <dc:description>  Finding the common structural brain connectivity network for a given
population is an open problem, crucial for current neuro-science. Recent
evidence suggests there's a tightly connected network shared between humans.
Obtaining this network will, among many advantages , allow us to focus
cognitive and clinical analyses on common connections, thus increasing their
statistical power. In turn, knowledge about the common network will facilitate
novel analyses to understand the structure-function relationship in the brain.
In this work, we present a new algorithm for computing the core structural
connectivity network of a subject sample combining graph theory and statistics.
Our algorithm works in accordance with novel evidence on brain topology. We
analyze the problem theoretically and prove its complexity. Using 309 subjects,
we show its advantages when used as a feature selection for connectivity
analysis on populations, outperforming the current approaches.

 <dc:description>  Software-defined networking (SDN) is the concept of decoupling the control
and data planes to create a flexible and agile network, assisted by a central
controller. However, the performance of SDN highly depends on the limitations
in the fronthaul which are inadequately discussed in the existing literature.
In this paper, a fronthaul-aware software-defined resource allocation mechanism
is proposed for 5G wireless networks with in-band wireless fronthaul
constraints. Considering the fronthaul capacity, the controller maximizes the
time-averaged network throughput by enforcing a coarse correlated equilibrium
(CCE) and incentivizing base stations (BSs) to locally optimize their decisions
to ensure mobile users' (MUs) quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. By
marrying tools from Lyapunov stochastic optimization and game theory, we
propose a two-timescale approach where the controller gives recommendations,
i.e., sub-carriers with low interference, in a long-timescale whereas BSs
schedule their own MUs and allocate the available resources in every time slot.
Numerical results show considerable throughput enhancements and delay
reductions over a non-SDN network baseline.

 <dc:description>  Cellular operators are increasingly turning towards renewable energy (RE) as
an alternative to using traditional electricity in order to reduce operational
expenditure and carbon footprint. Due to the randomness in both RE generation
and mobile traffic at each base station (BS), a surplus or shortfall of energy
may occur at any given time. To increase energy self-reliance and minimize the
network's energy cost, the operator needs to efficiently exploit the RE
generated across all BSs. In this paper, a hybrid energy sharing framework for
cellular network is proposed, where a combination of physical power lines and
energy trading with other BSs using smart grid is used. Algorithms for physical
power lines deployment between BSs, based on average and complete statistics of
the net RE available, are developed. Afterwards, an energy management framework
is formulated to optimally determine the quantities of electricity and RE to be
procured and exchanged among BSs, respectively, while considering battery
capacities and real-time energy pricing. Three cases are investigated where RE
generation is unknown, perfectly known, and partially known ahead of time.
Results investigate the time varying energy management of BSs and demonstrate
considerable reduction in average energy cost thanks to the hybrid energy
sharing scheme.

 <dc:description>  The problem of outlier detection is extremely challenging in many domains
such as text, in which the attribute values are typically non-negative, and
most values are zero. In such cases, it often becomes difficult to separate the
outliers from the natural variations in the patterns in the underlying data. In
this paper, we present a matrix factorization method, which is naturally able
to distinguish the anomalies with the use of low rank approximations of the
underlying data. Our iterative algorithm TONMF is based on block coordinate
descent (BCD) framework. We define blocks over the term-document matrix such
that the function becomes solvable. Given most recently updated values of other
matrix blocks, we always update one block at a time to its optimal. Our
approach has significant advantages over traditional methods for text outlier
detection. Finally, we present experimental results illustrating the
effectiveness of our method over competing methods.

 <dc:description>  The context transformation and generalized context transformation methods, we
introduced recently, were able to reduce zero order entropy by exchanging
digrams, and as a consequence, they were removing mutual information between
consecutive symbols of the input message. These transformations were intended
to be used as a preprocessor for zero-order entropy coding algorithms like
Arithmetic or Huffman coding, since we know, that especially Arithmetic coding
can achieve a compression rate almost of the size of Shannon's entropy.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm based on the concept of generalized
context transformation, that allows transformation of words longer than simple
digrams. The higher order contexts are exploited using recursive form of a
generalized context transformation. It is shown that the zero order entropy of
transformed data drops significantly, but on the other hand, the overhead given
by a description of individual transformations increases and it has become a
limiting factor in a successful transformation of smaller files.

 <dc:description>  We consider a Markovian many server queueing system in which customers are
preemptively scheduled according to exogenously assigned priority levels. The
priority levels are randomly assigned from a continuous probability measure
rather than a discrete one and hence, the queue is modeled by an infinite
dimensional stochastic process. We analyze the equilibrium behavior of the
system and provide several results. We derive the Radon-Nikodym derivative
(with respect to Lebesgue measure) of the measure that describes the average
distribution of customer priority levels in the system; we provide a formula
for the expected sojourn time of a customer as a function of his priority
level; and we provide a formula for the expected waiting time of a customer as
a function of his priority level. We verify our theoretical analysis with
discrete-event simulations. We discuss how each of our results generalizes
previous work on infinite dimensional models for single server priority queues.

 <dc:description>  In de novo drug design, computational strategies are used to generate novel
molecules with good affinity to the desired biological target. In this work, we
show that recurrent neural networks can be trained as generative models for
molecular structures, similar to statistical language models in natural
language processing. We demonstrate that the properties of the generated
molecules correlate very well with the properties of the molecules used to
train the model. In order to enrich libraries with molecules active towards a
given biological target, we propose to fine-tune the model with small sets of
molecules, which are known to be active against that target.
  Against Staphylococcus aureus, the model reproduced 14% of 6051 hold-out test
molecules that medicinal chemists designed, whereas against Plasmodium
falciparum (Malaria) it reproduced 28% of 1240 test molecules. When coupled
with a scoring function, our model can perform the complete de novo drug design
cycle to generate large sets of novel molecules for drug discovery.

which belongs to one of the most prominent methods of this type. It is well
known that the algorithm works well in the random \emph{planted bisection
model} -- the standard class of graphs for analysis minimum bisection and
relevant problems. In 2001 Feige and Kilian posed the question if Boppana's
algorithm works well in the semirandom model by Blum and Spencer. In our paper
we answer this question affirmatively. We show also that the algorithm achieves
similar performance on graph classes which extend the semirandom model.
  Since the behavior of Boppana's algorithm on the semirandom graphs remained
unknown, Feige and Kilian proposed a new semidefinite programming (SDP) based
approach and proved that it works on this model. The relationship between the
performance of the SDP based algorithm and Boppana's approach was left as an
open problem. In this paper we solve the problem in a complete way by proving
that the bisection algorithm of Feige and Kilian provides exactly the same
results as Boppana's algorithm. As a consequence we get that Boppana's
algorithm achieves the optimal threshold for exact cluster recovery in the
\emph{stochastic block model}. On the other hand we prove some limitations of
Boppana's approach: we show that if the density difference on the parameters of
the planted bisection model is too small then the algorithm fails with high
probability in the model.

 <dc:description>  Detection with high dimensional multimodal data is a challenging problem when
there are complex inter- and intra- modal dependencies. While several
approaches have been proposed for dependent data fusion (e.g., based on copula
theory), their advantages come at a high price in terms of computational
complexity. In this paper, we treat the detection problem with compressive
sensing (CS) where compression at each sensor is achieved via low dimensional
random projections. CS has recently been exploited to solve detection problems
under various assumptions on the signals of interest, however, its potential
for dependent data fusion has not been explored adequately. We exploit the
capability of CS to capture statistical properties of uncompressed data in
order to compute decision statistics for detection in the compressed domain.
First, a Gaussian approximation is employed to perform likelihood ratio (LR)
based detection with compressed data. In this approach, inter-modal dependence
is captured via a compressed version of the covariance matrix of the
concatenated (temporally and spatially) uncompressed data vector. We show that,
under certain conditions, this approach with a small number of compressed
measurements per node leads to enhanced performance compared to detection with
uncompressed data using widely considered suboptimal approaches. Second, we
develop a nonparametric approach where a decision statistic based on the second
order statistics of uncompressed data is computed in the compressed domain. The
second approach is promising over other related nonparametric approaches and
the first approach when multimodal data is highly correlated at the expense of
slightly increased computational complexity.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classification, which involves finding rules that partition a given data set
into disjoint groups, is one class of data mining problems. Approaches proposed
so far for mining classification rules for large databases are mainly decision
tree based symbolic learning methods. The connectionist approach based on
neural networks has been thought not well suited for data mining. One of the
major reasons cited is that knowledge generated by neural networks is not
explicitly represented in the form of rules suitable for verification or
interpretation by humans. This paper examines this issue. With our newly
developed algorithms, rules which are similar to, or more concise than those
generated by the symbolic methods can be extracted from the neural networks.
The data mining process using neural networks with the emphasis on rule
extraction is described. Experimental results and comparison with previously
published works are presented.

 <dc:description>  The paper derives and analyses the (semi-)discrete dispersion relation of the
Parareal parallel-in-time integration method. It investigates Parareal's wave
propagation characteristics with the aim to better understand what causes the
well documented stability problems for hyperbolic equations. The analysis shows
that the instability is caused by convergence of the amplification factor to
the exact value from above for medium to high wave numbers. Phase errors in the
coarse propagator are identified as the culprit, which suggests that
specifically tailored coarse level methods could provide a remedy.

 <dc:description>  Complex systems are often characterized by distinct types of interactions
between the same entities. These can be described as a multilayer network where
each layer represents one type of interaction. These layers may be
interdependent in complicated ways, revealing different kinds of structure in
the network. In this work we present a generative model, and an efficient
expectation-maximization algorithm, which allows us to perform inference tasks
such as community detection and link prediction in this setting. Our model
assumes overlapping communities that are common between the layers, while
allowing these communities to affect each layer in a different way, including
arbitrary mixtures of assortative, disassortative, or directed structure. It
also gives us a mathematically principled way to define the interdependence
between layers, by measuring how much information about one layer helps us
predict links in another layer. In particular, this allows us to bundle layers
together to compress redundant information, and identify small groups of layers
which suffice to predict the remaining layers accurately. We illustrate these
findings by analyzing synthetic data and two real multilayer networks, one
representing social support relationships among villagers in South India and
the other representing shared genetic substrings material between genes of the
malaria parasite.

 <dc:description>  Estimating human pose, shape, and motion from images and videos are
fundamental challenges with many applications. Recent advances in 2D human pose
estimation use large amounts of manually-labeled training data for learning
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Such data is time consuming to acquire
and difficult to extend. Moreover, manual labeling of 3D pose, depth and motion
is impractical. In this work we present SURREAL (Synthetic hUmans foR REAL
tasks): a new large-scale dataset with synthetically-generated but realistic
images of people rendered from 3D sequences of human motion capture data. We
generate more than 6 million frames together with ground truth pose, depth
maps, and segmentation masks. We show that CNNs trained on our synthetic
dataset allow for accurate human depth estimation and human part segmentation
in real RGB images. Our results and the new dataset open up new possibilities
for advancing person analysis using cheap and large-scale synthetic data.

 <dc:description>  Platooning allows vehicles to travel with small intervehicle distance in a
coordinated fashion thanks to vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity. When applied at
a larger scale, platooning will create significant opportunities for energy
savings due to reduced aerodynamic drag, as well as increased road capacity and
congestion reduction resulting from shorter vehicle headways. However, these
potential savings are maximized if platooning-capable vehicles spend most of
their travel time within platoons. Ad hoc platoon formation may not ensure a
high rate of platoon driving. In this paper we consider the problem of central
coordination of platooning-capable vehicles. By coordinating their routes and
departure times, we can maximize the fuel savings afforded by platooning
vehicles. The resulting problem is a combinatorial optimization problem that
considers the platoon coordination and vehicle routing problems simultaneously.
We demonstrate our methodology by evaluating the benefits of a coordinated
solution and comparing it with the uncoordinated case when platoons form only
in an ad hoc manner. We compare the coordinated and uncoordinated scenarios on
a grid network with different assumptions about demand and the time vehicles
are willing to wait.

 <dc:description>  HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) has become the universal technology for video
streaming over the Internet. Many HAS system designs aim at sharing the network
bandwidth in a rate-fair manner. However, rate fairness is in general not
equivalent to quality fairness as different video sequences might have
different characteristics and resource requirements. In this work, we focus on
this limitation and propose a novel controller for HAS clients that is able to
reach quality fairness while preserving the main characteristics of HAS systems
and with a limited support from the network devices. In particular, we adopt a
price-based mechanism in order to build a controller that maximizes the
aggregate video quality for a set of HAS clients that share a common
bottleneck. When network resources are scarce, the clients with simple video
sequences reduce the requested bitrate in favor of users that subscribe to more
complex video sequences, leading to a more efficient network usage. The
proposed controller has been implemented in a network simulator, and the
simulation results demonstrate its ability to share the available bandwidth
among the HAS users in a quality-fair manner.

 <dc:description>  Classical spectral clustering is based on a spectral decomposition of a graph
Laplacian, obtained from a graph adjacency matrix representing positive graph
edge weights describing similarities of graph vertices. In signed graphs, the
graph edge weights can be negative to describe disparities of graph vertices,
for example, negative correlations in the data. Negative weights lead to
possible negative spectrum of the standard graph Laplacian, which is cured by
defining a signed Laplacian. We revisit comparing the standard and signed
Laplacians and argue that the former is more natural than the latter, also
showing that the negative spectrum is actually beneficial, for spectral
clustering of signed graphs.

 <dc:title>Paths-based criteria and application to linear logic subsystems

 <dc:creator>Perrinel, Matthieu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Several variants of linear logic have been proposed to characterize
complexity classes in the proofs-as-programs correspondence. Light linear logic
(LLL) ensures a polynomial bound on reduction time, and characterizes in this
way polynomial time (Ptime). In this paper we study the complexity of linear
logic proof-nets and propose three semantic criteria based on context
semantics: stratification, dependence control and nesting. Stratification alone
entails an elementary time bound, the three criteria entail together a
polynomial time bound.
  These criteria can be used to prove the complexity soundness of several
existing variants of linear logic. We define a decidable syntactic subsystem of
linear logic: SDNLL. We prove that the proof-nets of SDNLL satisfy the three
criteria, which implies that SDNLL is sound for Ptime. Several previous
subsystems of linear logic characterizing polynomial time (LLL, mL^4, maximal
system of MS) are embedded in SDNLL, proving its Ptime completeness.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, several convex programming relaxations have been proposed to
estimate the permanent of a non-negative matrix, notably in the works of
Gurvits and Samorodnitsky. However, the origins of these relaxations and their
relationships to each other have remained somewhat mysterious. We present a
conceptual framework, implicit in the belief propagation literature, to
systematically arrive at these convex programming relaxations for estimating
the permanent -- as approximations to an exponential-sized max-entropy convex
program for computing the permanent. Further, using standard convex programming
techniques such as duality, we establish equivalence of these aforementioned
relaxations to those based on capacity-like quantities studied by Gurvits and
Anari et al.

 <dc:description>  A high-resolution finite volume method approach to incorporating
time-dependent slip across rectangular subfaults when modeling general fault
geometry is presented. The fault slip is induced by a modification of the
Riemann problem to the linear elasticity equations across cell interfaces
aligned with the subfaults. This is illustrated in the context of the
high-resolution wave-propagation algorithms that are implemented in the open
source Clawpack software (www.clawpack.org), but this approach could be easily
incorporated into other Riemann solver based numerical methods. Surface
deformation results are obtained in both two and three dimensions and compared
to those given by the steady-state, homogeneous half-space Okada solution.

 <dc:description>  Many social networks exhibit some underlying community structure. In
particular, in the context of historical research, clustering of different
groups into warring or friendly factions can lead to a better understanding of
how conflicts may arise, and whether they could be avoided or not. In this work
we study the crisis that started in 1225 when the Emperor of the Holy Roman
Empire, Frederick II and his son Henry VII got into a conflict which almost led
to the rupture and dissolution of the Empire. We use a spin-glass-based
community detection algorithm to see how good this method is in detecting this
rift and compare the results with an analysis performed by one of the authors
(Gramsch) using standard social balance theory applied to History.

 <dc:title>Understanding the complexity of #SAT using knowledge compilation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Capelli, Florent</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Two main techniques have been used so far to solve the #P-hard problem #SAT.
The first one, used in practice, is based on an extension of DPLL for model
counting called exhaustive DPLL. The second approach, more theoretical,
exploits the structure of the input to compute the number of satisfying
assignments by usually using a dynamic programming scheme on a decomposition of
the formula. In this paper, we make a first step toward the separation of these
two techniques by exhibiting a family of formulas that can be solved in
polynomial time with the first technique but needs an exponential time with the
second one. We show this by observing that both techniques implicitely
construct a very specific boolean circuit equivalent to the input formula. We
then show that every beta-acyclic formula can be represented by a polynomial
size circuit corresponding to the first method and exhibit a family of
beta-acyclic formulas which cannot be represented by polynomial size circuits
corresponding to the second method. This result shed a new light on the
complexity of #SAT and related problems on beta-acyclic formulas. As a
byproduct, we give new handy tools to design algorithms on beta-acyclic
hypergraphs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, there have been increasing concerns about how geomagnetic
disturbances (GMDs) impact electrical power systems. Geomagnetically-induced
currents (GICs) can saturate transformers, induce hot spot heating and increase
reactive power losses. These effects can potentially cause catastrophic damage
to transformers and severely impact the ability of a power system to deliver
power. To address this problem, we develop a model of GIC impacts to power
systems that includes 1) GIC thermal capacity of transformers as a function of
normal Alternating Current (AC) and 2) reactive power losses as a function of
GIC. We use this model to derive an optimization problem that protects power
systems from GIC impacts through line switching, generator redispatch, and load
shedding. We employ state-of-the-art convex relaxations of AC power flow
equations to lower bound the objective. We demonstrate the approach on a
modified RTS96 system and the UIUC 150-bus system and show that line switching
is an effective means to mitigate GIC impacts. We also provide a sensitivity
analysis of optimal switching decisions with respect to GMD direction.

 <dc:title>Graph Structure Learning from Unlabeled Data for Event Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Processes such as disease propagation and information diffusion often spread
over some latent network structure which must be learned from observation.
Given a set of unlabeled training examples representing occurrences of an event
type of interest (e.g., a disease outbreak), our goal is to learn a graph
structure that can be used to accurately detect future events of that type.
Motivated by new theoretical results on the consistency of constrained and
unconstrained subset scans, we propose a novel framework for learning graph
structure from unlabeled data by comparing the most anomalous subsets detected
with and without the graph constraints. Our framework uses the mean normalized
log-likelihood ratio score to measure the quality of a graph structure, and
efficiently searches for the highest-scoring graph structure. Using simulated
disease outbreaks injected into real-world Emergency Department data from
Allegheny County, we show that our method learns a structure similar to the
true underlying graph, but enables faster and more accurate detection.

 <dc:title>Communication over a Channel that Wears Out</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work investigates the limits of communication over a noisy channel that
wears out, in the sense of signal-dependent catastrophic failure. In
particular, we consider a channel that starts as a memoryless binary-input
channel and when the number of transmitted ones causes a sufficient amount of
damage, the channel ceases to convey signals. We restrict attention to constant
composition codes. Since infinite blocklength codes will always wear out the
channel for any finite threshold of failure and therefore convey no
information, we make use of finite blocklength codes to determine the maximum
expected transmission volume at a given level of average error probability. We
show that this maximization problem has a recursive form and can be solved by
dynamic programming. A discussion of damage state feedback in channels that
wear out is also provided. Numerical results show that a sequence of block
codes is preferred to a single block code for streaming sources.

 <dc:title>Unconstrained inverse quadratic programming problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abramov, E. G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper covers a formulation of the inverse quadratic programming problem
in terms of unconstrained optimization where it is required to find the unknown
parameters (the matrix of the quadratic form and the vector of the quasi-linear
part of the quadratic form) provided that approximate estimates of the optimal
solution of the direct problem and those of the target function to be minimized
in the form of pairs of values lying in the corresponding neighborhoods are
only known. The formulation of the inverse problem and its solution are based
on the least squares method. In the explicit form the inverse problem solution
has been derived in the form a system of linear equations. The parameters
obtained can be used for reconstruction of the direct quadratic programming
problem and determination of the optimal solution and the extreme value of the
target function, which were not known formerly. It is possible this approach
opens new ways in over applications, for example, in neurocomputing and quadric
surfaces fitting. Simple numerical examples have been demonstrated. A scenario
in the Octave/MATLAB programming language has been proposed for practical
implementation of the method.

 <dc:description>  Automatic photo cropping is an important tool for improving visual quality of
digital photos without resorting to tedious manual selection. Traditionally,
photo cropping is accomplished by determining the best proposal window through
visual quality assessment or saliency detection. In essence, the performance of
an image cropper highly depends on the ability to correctly rank a number of
visually similar proposal windows. Despite the ranking nature of automatic
photo cropping, little attention has been paid to learning-to-rank algorithms
in tackling such a problem. In this work, we conduct an extensive study on
traditional approaches as well as ranking-based croppers trained on various
image features. In addition, a new dataset consisting of high quality cropping
and pairwise ranking annotations is presented to evaluate the performance of
various baselines. The experimental results on the new dataset provide useful
insights into the design of better photo cropping algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Questions of noise stability play an important role in hardness of
approximation in computer science as well as in the theory of voting. In many
applications, the goal is to find an optimizer of noise stability among all
possible partitions of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 1$ to $k$ parts with given
Gaussian measures $\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_k$. We call a partition $\epsilon$-optimal,
if its noise stability is optimal up to an additive $\epsilon$. In this paper,
we give an explicit, computable function $n(\epsilon)$ such that an
$\epsilon$-optimal partition exists in $\mathbb{R}^{n(\epsilon)}$. This result
has implications for the computability of certain problems in non-interactive
simulation, which are addressed in a subsequent work.

 <dc:description>  A basic problem in information theory is the following: Let $\mathbf{P} =
(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y})$ be an arbitrary distribution where the marginals
$\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ are (potentially) correlated. Let Alice and Bob
be two players where Alice gets samples $\{x_i\}_{i \ge 1}$ and Bob gets
samples $\{y_i\}_{i \ge 1}$ and for all $i$, $(x_i, y_i) \sim \mathbf{P}$. What
joint distributions $\mathbf{Q}$ can be simulated by Alice and Bob without any
interaction?
  Classical works in information theory by G{\'a}cs-K{\&quot;o}rner and Wyner answer
this question when at least one of $\mathbf{P}$ or $\mathbf{Q}$ is the
distribution on $\{0,1\} \times \{0,1\}$ where each marginal is unbiased and
identical. However, other than this special case, the answer to this question
is understood in very few cases. Recently, Ghazi, Kamath and Sudan showed that
this problem is decidable for $\mathbf{Q}$ supported on $\{0,1\} \times
\{0,1\}$. We extend their result to $\mathbf{Q}$ supported on any finite
alphabet.
  We rely on recent results in Gaussian geometry (by the authors) as well as a
new \emph{smoothing argument} inspired by the method of \emph{boosting} from
learning theory and potential function arguments from complexity theory and
additive combinatorics.

 <dc:description>  The task of image deblurring is a very ill-posed problem as both the image
and the blur are unknown. Moreover, when pictures are taken in the wild, this
task becomes even more challenging due to the blur varying spatially and the
occlusions between the object. Due to the complexity of the general image model
we propose a novel convolutional network architecture which directly generates
the sharp image.This network is built in three stages, and exploits the
benefits of pyramid schemes often used in blind deconvolution. One of the main
difficulties in training such a network is to design a suitable dataset. While
useful data can be obtained by synthetically blurring a collection of images,
more realistic data must be collected in the wild. To obtain such data we use a
high frame rate video camera and keep one frame as the sharp image and frame
average as the corresponding blurred image. We show that this realistic dataset
is key in achieving state-of-the-art performance and dealing with occlusions.

 <dc:title>Designing a Safe Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agent based on Human

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There is a growing focus on how to design safe artificial intelligent (AI)
agents. As systems become more complex, poorly specified goals or control
mechanisms may cause AI agents to engage in unwanted and harmful outcomes. Thus
it is necessary to design AI agents that follow initial programming intentions
as the program grows in complexity. How to specify these initial intentions has
also been an obstacle to designing safe AI agents. Finally, there is a need for
the AI agent to have redundant safety mechanisms to ensure that any programming
errors do not cascade into major problems. Humans are autonomous intelligent
agents that have avoided these problems and the present manuscript argues that
by understanding human self-regulation and goal setting, we may be better able
to design safe AI agents. Some general principles of human self-regulation are
outlined and specific guidance for AI design is given.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the use of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes to cache
popular content to reduce the download delay of wireless content delivery. In
particular, we consider a cellular system where devices roam in an out of a
cell according to a Poisson random process. Popular content is cached in a
limited number of the mobile devices using an MDS code and can be downloaded
from the mobile devices using device-to-device communication. We derive an
analytical expression for the delay incurred in downloading content from the
wireless network and show that distributed caching using MDS codes can
dramatically reduce the download delay with respect to the scenario where
content is always downloaded from the base station and to the case of uncoded
distributed caching.

 <dc:description>  Several learning rules for synaptic plasticity, that depend on either spike
timing or internal state variables, have been proposed in the past imparting
varying computational capabilities to Spiking Neural Networks. Due to design
complications these learning rules are typically not implemented on
neuromorphic devices leaving the devices to be only capable of inference. In
this work we propose a unidirectional post-synaptic potential dependent
learning rule that is only triggered by pre-synaptic spikes, and easy to
implement on hardware. We demonstrate that such a learning rule is functionally
capable of replicating computational capabilities of pairwise STDP. Further
more, we demonstrate that this learning rule can be used to learn and classify
spatio-temporal spike patterns in an unsupervised manner using individual
neurons. We argue that this learning rule is computationally powerful and also
ideal for hardware implementations due to its unidirectional memory access.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents several test cases intended to be benchmarks for
numerical schemes for single-phase fluid flow in fractured porous media. A
number of solution strategies are compared, including a vertex and a
cell-centered finite volume method, a non-conforming embedded discrete fracture
model, a primal and a dual extended finite element formulation, and a mortar
discrete fracture model. The proposed benchmarks test the schemes by increasing
the difficulties in terms of network geometry, e.g. intersecting fractures, and
physical parameters, e.g. low and high fracture-matrix permeability ratio as
well as heterogeneous fracture permeabilities. For each problem, the results
presented by the participants are the number of unknowns, the approximation
errors in the porous matrix and in the fractures with respect to a reference
solution, and the sparsity and condition number of the discretized linear
system. All data and meshes used in this study are publicly available for
further comparisons.

 <dc:description>  To ease the development of robot learning in industry, two conditions need to
be fulfilled. Manipulators must be able to learn high accuracy and precision
tasks while being safe for workers in the factory. In this paper, we extend
previously submitted work which consists in rapid learning of local high
accuracy behaviors. By exploration and regression, linear and quadratic models
are learnt for respectively the dynamics and cost function. Iterative Linear
Quadratic Gaussian Regulator combined with cost quadratic regression can
converge rapidly in the final stages towards high accuracy behavior as the cost
function is modelled quite precisely. In this paper, both a different cost
function and a second order improvement method are implemented within this
framework. We also propose an analysis of the algorithm parameters through
simulation for a positioning task. Finally, an experimental validation on a
KUKA LBR iiwa robot is carried out. This collaborative robot manipulator can be
easily programmed into safety mode, which makes it qualified for the second
industry constraint stated above.

 <dc:description>  A new methodology to measure coded image/video quality using the
just-noticeable-difference (JND) idea was proposed. Several small JND-based
image/video quality datasets were released by the Media Communications Lab at
the University of Southern California. In this work, we present an effort to
build a large-scale JND-based coded video quality dataset. The dataset consists
of 220 5-second sequences in four resolutions (i.e., $1920 \times 1080$, $1280
\times 720$, $960 \times 540$ and $640 \times 360$). For each of the 880 video
clips, we encode it using the H.264 codec with $QP=1, \cdots, 51$ and measure
the first three JND points with 30+ subjects. The dataset is called the
&quot;VideoSet&quot;, which is an acronym for &quot;Video Subject Evaluation Test (SET)&quot;. This
work describes the subjective test procedure, detection and removal of outlying
measured data, and the properties of collected JND data. Finally, the
significance and implications of the VideoSet to future video coding research
and standardization efforts are pointed out. All source/coded video clips as
well as measured JND data included in the VideoSet are available to the public
in the IEEE DataPort.

 <dc:description>  The classification of crime into discrete categories entails a massive loss
of information. Crimes emerge out of a complex mix of behaviors and situations,
yet most of these details cannot be captured by singular crime type labels.
This information loss impacts our ability to not only understand the causes of
crime, but also how to develop optimal crime prevention strategies. We apply
machine learning methods to short narrative text descriptions accompanying
crime records with the goal of discovering ecologically more meaningful latent
crime classes. We term these latent classes &quot;crime topics&quot; in reference to
text-based topic modeling methods that produce them. We use topic distributions
to measure clustering among formally recognized crime types. Crime topics
replicate broad distinctions between violent and property crime, but also
reveal nuances linked to target characteristics, situational conditions and the
tools and methods of attack. Formal crime types are not discrete in topic
space. Rather, crime types are distributed across a range of crime topics.
Similarly, individual crime topics are distributed across a range of formal
crime types. Key ecological groups include identity theft, shoplifting,
burglary and theft, car crimes and vandalism, criminal threats and confidence
crimes, and violent crimes. Crime topic modeling positions behavioral
situations as the focal unit of analysis for crime events. Though unlikely to
replace formal legal crime classifications, crime topics provide a unique
window into the heterogeneous causal processes underlying crime. We discuss
whether automated procedures could be used to cross-check the quality of
official crime classifications.

 <dc:description>  Thanks to the recent advancements in drone technology, it has become viable
and cost-effective to quickly deploy small cells in areas of urgent needs by
using a drone as a cellular base station. In this paper, we explore the benefit
of dynamically repositioning the drone base station in the air to reduce the
distance between the BS and the mobile user equipment, thereby improving the
spectral efficiency of the small cell. In particular, we propose algorithms to
autonomously control the repositioning of the drone in response to users
activities and movements. We demonstrate that, compared to a drone hovering at
a fixed location, dynamic repositioning of the drone moving with high speed can
increase spectral efficiency by 15\%. However, considering the tradeoff between
spectral efficiency and energy efficiency of the drone, we show that 10.5\%
spectral efficiency gain can be obtained without negatively affecting energy
consumption of the drone.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionarize ground transport and take a
substantial role in the future transportation system. Most AVs are likely to be
electric vehicles (EVs) and they can participate in the vehicle-to-grid (V2G)
system to support various V2G services. Although it is generally infeasible for
EVs to dictate their routes, we can design AV travel plans to fulfill certain
system-wide objectives. In this paper, we focus on the AVs looking for parking
and study how they can be led to appropriate parking facilities to support V2G
services. We formulate the Coordinated Parking Problem (CPP), which can be
solved by a standard integer linear program solver but requires long
computational time. To make it more practical, we develop a distributed
algorithm to address CPP based on dual decomposition. We carry out a series of
simulations to evaluate the proposed solution methods. Our results show that
the distributed algorithm can produce nearly optimal solutions with
substantially less computational time. A coarser time scale can improve
computational time but degrade the solution quality resulting in possible
infeasible solution. Even with communication loss, the distributed algorithm
can still perform well and converge with only little degradation in speed.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problems of simultaneously detecting and localizing
multiple targets are considered for noncoherent multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) radar with widely separated antennas. By assuming a prior knowledge of
target number, an optimal solution to this problem is presented first. It is
essentially a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator searching parameters of
interest in a high dimensional space. However, the complexity of this method
increases exponentially with the number G of targets.Besides, without the prior
information of the number of targets, a multi-hypothesis testing strategy to
determine the number of targets is required, which further complicates this
method. Therefore, we split the joint maximization into G disjoint optimization
problems by clearing the interference from previously declared targets. In this
way, we derive two fast and robust suboptimal solutions which allow trading
performance for a much lower implementation complexity which is almost
independent of the number of targets. In addition, the multi-hypothesis testing
is no longer required when target number is unknown. Simulation results show
the proposed algorithms can correctly detect and accurately localize multiple
targets even when targets share common range bins in some paths.

 <dc:description>  The recent proliferation of increasingly capable mobile devices has given
rise to mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems that outsource the collection of
sensory data to a crowd of participating workers that carry various mobile
devices. Aware of the paramount importance of effectively incentivizing
participation in such systems, the research community has proposed a wide
variety of incentive mechanisms. However, different from most of these existing
mechanisms which assume the existence of only one data requester, we consider
MCS systems with multiple data requesters, which are actually more common in
practice. Specifically, our incentive mechanism is based on double auction, and
is able to stimulate the participation of both data requesters and workers. In
real practice, the incentive mechanism is typically not an isolated module, but
interacts with the data aggregation mechanism that aggregates workers' data.
For this reason, we propose CENTURION, a novel integrated framework for
multi-requester MCS systems, consisting of the aforementioned incentive and
data aggregation mechanism. CENTURION's incentive mechanism satisfies
truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, as well as
guaranteeing non-negative social welfare, and its data aggregation mechanism
generates highly accurate aggregated results. The desirable properties of
CENTURION are validated through both theoretical analysis and extensive
simulations.

 <dc:description>  Separation kernels provide temporal/spatial separation and controlled
information flow to their hosted applications. They are introduced to decouple
the analysis of applications in partitions from the analysis of the kernel
itself. More than 20 implementations of separation kernels have been developed
and widely applied in critical domains, e.g., avionics/aerospace,
military/defense, and medical devices. Formal methods are mandated by the
security/safety certification of separation kernels and have been carried out
since this concept emerged. However, this field lacks a survey to
systematically study, compare, and analyze related work. On the other hand,
high-assurance separation kernels by formal methods still face big challenges.
In this paper, an analytical framework is first proposed to clarify the
functionalities, implementations, properties and standards, and formal methods
application of separation kernels. Based on the proposed analytical framework,
a taxonomy is designed according to formal methods application,
functionalities, and properties of separation kernels. Research works in the
literature are then categorized and overviewed by the taxonomy. In accordance
with the analytical framework, a comprehensive analysis and discussion of
related work are presented. Finally, four challenges and their possible
technical directions for future research are identified, e.g. specification
bottleneck, multicore and concurrency, and automation of full formal
verification.

 <dc:description>  In data centers, data replication is the primary method used to ensure
availability of customer data. To avoid correlated failure, cloud storage
infrastructure providers model hierarchical failure domains using a tree, and
avoid placing a large number of data replicas within the same failure domain
(i.e. on the same branch of the tree). Typical best practices ensure that
replicas are distributed across failure domains, but relatively little is known
concerning optimization algorithms for distributing data replicas. Using a
hierarchical model, we answer how to distribute replicas across failure domains
optimally. We formulate a novel optimization problem for replica placement in
data centers. As part of our problem, we formalize and explain a new criterion
for optimizing a replica placement. Our overall goal is to choose placements in
which correlated failures disable as few replicas as possible. We provide two
optimization algorithms for dependency models represented by trees. We first
present an $O(n + \rho \log \rho)$ time dynamic programming algorithm for
placing $\rho$ replicas of a single file on the leaves (representing servers)
of a tree with $n$ vertices. We next consider the problem of placing replicas
of $m$ blocks of data, where each block may have different replication factors.
For this problem, we give an exact algorithm which runs in polynomial time when
the skew, the difference in the number of replicas between the largest and
smallest blocks of data, is constant.

 <dc:description>  Evaluating influence spread in social networks is a fundamental procedure to
estimate the word-of-mouth effect in viral marketing. There are enormous
studies about this topic; however, under the standard stochastic cascade
models, the exact computation of influence spread is known to be #P-hard. Thus,
the existing studies have used Monte-Carlo simulation-based approximations to
avoid exact computation.
  We propose the first algorithm to compute influence spread exactly under the
independent cascade model. The algorithm first constructs binary decision
diagrams (BDDs) for all possible realizations of influence spread, then
computes influence spread by dynamic programming on the constructed BDDs. To
construct the BDDs efficiently, we designed a new frontier-based search-type
procedure. The constructed BDDs can also be used to solve other
influence-spread related problems, such as random sampling without rejection,
conditional influence spread evaluation, dynamic probability update, and
gradient computation for probability optimization problems.
  We conducted computational experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithm.
The algorithm successfully computed influence spread on real-world networks
with a hundred edges in a reasonable time, which is quite impossible by the
naive algorithm. We also conducted an experiment to evaluate the accuracy of
the Monte-Carlo simulation-based approximation by comparing exact influence
spread obtained by the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Considering both non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and line-of-sight (LoS)
transmissions, the transitional behaviors from noise-limited regime to dense
interference-limited regime have been investigated for the fifth generation
(5G) small cell networks (SCNs). Besides, we identify four performance regimes
based on base station (BS) density, i.e., (i) the noise-limited regime, (ii)
the signal-dominated regime, (iii) the interference-dominated regime, and (iv)
the interference-limited regime. To characterize the performance regime, we
propose a unified framework analyzing the future 5G wireless networks over
generalized shadowing/fading channels, in which the user association schemes
based on the strongest instantaneous received power (SIRP) and the strongest
average received power (SARP) can be studied, while NLoS/LoS transmissions and
multi-slop path loss model are considered. Simulation results indicate that
different factors, i.e., noise, desired signal, and interference, successively
and separately dominate the network performance with the increase of BS
density. Hence, our results shed new light on the design and management of SCNs
in urban and rural areas with different BS deployment densities.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient method for detecting anomalies in videos. Recent
applications of convolutional neural networks have shown promises of
convolutional layers for object detection and recognition, especially in
images. However, convolutional neural networks are supervised and require
labels as learning signals. We propose a spatiotemporal architecture for
anomaly detection in videos including crowded scenes. Our architecture includes
two main components, one for spatial feature representation, and one for
learning the temporal evolution of the spatial features. Experimental results
on Avenue, Subway and UCSD benchmarks confirm that the detection accuracy of
our method is comparable to state-of-the-art methods at a considerable speed of
up to 140 fps.

 <dc:description>  In many human-in-the-loop robotic applications such as robot-assisted surgery
and remote teleoperation, predicting the intended motion of the human operator
may be useful for successful implementation of shared control, guidance virtual
fixtures, and predictive control. Developing computational models of human
movements is a critical foundation for such motion prediction frameworks. With
this motivation, we present a computational framework for modeling reaching
movements in the presence of obstacles. We propose a stochastic optimal control
framework that consists of probabilistic collision avoidance constraints and a
cost function that trades-off between effort and end-state variance in the
presence of a signal-dependent noise. First, we present a series of
reformulations to convert the original non-linear and non-convex optimal
control into a parametric quadratic programming problem. We show that the
parameters can be tuned to model various collision avoidance strategies,
thereby capturing the quintessential variability associated with human motion.
Then, we present a simulation study that demonstrates the complex interaction
between avoidance strategies, control cost, and the probability of collision
avoidance. The proposed framework can benefit a variety of applications that
require teleoperation in cluttered spaces, including robot-assisted surgery. In
addition, it can also be viewed as a new optimizer which produces smooth and
probabilistically-safe trajectories under signal dependent noise.

 <dc:title>Asymptotically Locally Optimal Weight Vector Design for a Tighter
  Correlation Lower Bound of Quasi-Complementary Sequence Sets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Zilong</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A quasi-complementary sequence set (QCSS) refers to a set of two-dimensional
matrices with low non-trivial aperiodic auto- and cross- correlation sums. For
multicarrier code-division multiple-access applications, the availability of
large QCSSs with low correlation sums is desirable. The generalized Levenshtein
bound (GLB) is a lower bound on the maximum aperiodic correlation sum of QCSSs.
The bounding expression of GLB is a fractional quadratic function of a weight
vector $\mathbf{w}$ and is expressed in terms of three additional parameters
associated with QCSS: the set size $K$, the number of channels $M$, and the
sequence length $N$. It is known that a tighter GLB (compared to the Welch
bound) is possible only if the condition $M\geq2$ and $K\geq \overline{K}+1$,
where $\overline{K}$ is a certain function of $M$ and $N$, is satisfied. A
challenging research problem is to determine if there exists a weight vector
which gives rise to a tighter GLB for \textit{all} (not just \textit{some})
$K\geq \overline{K}+1$ and $M\geq2$, especially for large $N$, i.e., the
condition is {asymptotically} both necessary and sufficient. To achieve this,
we \textit{analytically} optimize the GLB which is (in general) non-convex as
the numerator term is an indefinite quadratic function of the weight vector.
Our key idea is to apply the frequency domain decomposition of the circulant
matrix (in the numerator term) to convert the non-convex problem into a convex
one. Following this optimization approach, we derive a new weight vector
meeting the aforementioned objective and prove that it is a local minimizer of
the GLB under certain conditions.

 <dc:description>  Reproducing experiments is an important instrument to validate previous work
and build upon existing approaches. It has been tackled numerous times in
different areas of science. In this paper, we introduce an empirical
replicability study of three well-known algorithms for syntactic centric
aspect-based opinion mining. We show that reproducing results continues to be a
difficult endeavor, mainly due to the lack of details regarding preprocessing
and parameter setting, as well as due to the absence of available
implementations that clarify these details. We consider these are important
threats to validity of the research on the field, specifically when compared to
other problems in NLP where public datasets and code availability are critical
validity components. We conclude by encouraging code-based research, which we
think has a key role in helping researchers to understand the meaning of the
state-of-the-art better and to generate continuous advances.

 <dc:title>Alternating Minimization for Hybrid Precoding in Multiuser OFDM mmWave

 <dc:description>  Hybrid precoding is a cost-effective approach to support directional
transmissions for millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. While existing works
on hybrid precoding mainly focus on single-user single-carrier transmission, in
practice multicarrier transmission is needed to combat the much increased
bandwidth, and multiuser MIMO can provide additional spatial multiplexing
gains. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid precoding structure for multiuser
OFDM mmWave systems, which greatly simplifies the hybrid precoder design and is
able to approach the performance of the fully digital precoder. In particular,
two groups of phase shifters are combined to map the signals from radio
frequency (RF) chains to antennas. Then an effective hybrid precoding algorithm
based on alternating minimization (AltMin) is proposed, which will alternately
optimize the digital and analog precoders. A major algorithmic innovation is a
LASSO formulation for the analog precoder, which yields computationally
efficient algorithms. Simulation results will show the performance gain of the
proposed algorithm. Moreover, it will reveal that canceling the interuser
interference is critical in multiuser OFDM hybrid precoding systems.

 <dc:description>  Smile is one of the key elements in identifying emotions and present state of
mind of an individual. In this work, we propose a cluster of approaches to
classify posed and spontaneous smiles using deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) face features, local phase quantization (LPQ), dense optical flow and
histogram of gradient (HOG). Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) is used for
micro-expression smile amplification along with three normalization procedures
for distinguishing posed and spontaneous smiles. Although the deep CNN face
model is trained with large number of face images, HOG features outperforms
this model for overall face smile classification task. Using EVM to amplify
micro-expressions did not have a significant impact on classification accuracy,
while the normalizing facial features improved classification accuracy. Unlike
many manual or semi-automatic methodologies, our approach aims to automatically
classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using
support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large UvA-NEMO smile
database show promising results as compared to other relevant methods.

 <dc:description>  Previous researches have shown that learning multiple representations for
polysemous words can improve the performance of word embeddings on many tasks.
However, this leads to another problem. Several vectors of a word may actually
point to the same meaning, namely pseudo multi-sense. In this paper, we
introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to
detect such cases. With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense
cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence
of pseudo multi-sense. Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released
multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks
and the analogy task. The result of the experiments shows that diminishing
pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations. Thus, our
method is actually an efficient way to reduce linguistic complexity.

 <dc:description>  Sequence alignment algorithms are a basic and critical component of many
bioinformatics fields. With rapid development of sequencing technology, the
fast growing reference database volumes and longer length of query sequence
become new challenges for sequence alignment. However, the algorithm is
prohibitively high in terms of time and space complexity. In this paper, we
present DSA, a scalable distributed sequence alignment system that employs
Spark to process sequences data in a horizontally scalable distributed
environment, and leverages data parallel strategy based on Single Instruction
Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction to parallelize the algorithm in each core of
worker node. The experimental results demonstrate that 1) DSA has outstanding
performance and achieves up to 201x speedup over SparkSW. 2) DSA has excellent
scalability and achieves near linear speedup when increasing the number of
nodes in cluster.

 <dc:description>  A finite word is closed if it contains a factor that occurs both as a prefix
and as a suffix but does not have internal occurrences, otherwise it is open.
We are interested in the {\it oc-sequence} of a word, which is the binary
sequence whose $n$-th element is $0$ if the prefix of length $n$ of the word is
open, or $1$ if it is closed. We exhibit results showing that this sequence is
deeply related to the combinatorial and periodic structure of a word. In the
case of Sturmian words, we show that these are uniquely determined (up to
renaming letters) by their oc-sequence. Moreover, we prove that the class of
finite Sturmian words is a maximal element with this property in the class of
binary factorial languages. We then discuss several aspects of Sturmian words
that can be expressed through this sequence. Finally, we provide a linear-time
algorithm that computes the oc-sequence of a finite word, and a linear-time
algorithm that reconstructs a finite Sturmian word from its oc-sequence.

 <dc:description>  We present a randomized distributed algorithm that in radio networks with
collision detection broadcasts a single message in $O(D+\log^2 n)$ time slots,
with high probability. In view of the lower-bound $\Omega(D+\log^2 n)$, our
algorithm is optimal in the considered model answering the decades-old question
of Alon, Bar-Noy, Linial and Peleg [JCSS 1991].

 <dc:title>Detecting Arbitrary Attacks Using Continuous Secured Side Information in
  Wireless Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cao, Ruohan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on Byzantine attack detection for Gaussian two-hop one-way
relay network, where an amplify-and-forward relay may conduct Byzantine attacks
by forwarding altered symbols to the destination. For facilitating attack
detection, we utilize the openness of wireless medium to make the destination
observe some secured signals that are not attacked. Then, a detection scheme is
developed for the destination by using its secured observations to
statistically check other observations from the relay. On the other hand,
notice the Gaussian channel is continuous, which allows the possible Byzantine
attacks to be conducted within continuous alphabet(s). The existing work on
discrete channel is not applicable for investigating the performance of the
proposed scheme. The main contribution of this paper is to prove that if and
only if the wireless relay network satisfies a non-manipulable channel
condition, the proposed detection scheme achieves asymptotic errorless
performance against arbitrary attacks that allow the stochastic distributions
of altered symbols to vary arbitrarily and depend on each other. No pre-shared
secret or secret transmission is needed for the detection. Furthermore, we also
prove that the relay network is non-manipulable as long as all channel
coefficients are non-zero, which is not essential restrict for many practical
systems.

when the framelets are tight. We give an example of construction of framelets
and show that the framelet transforms can be computed as fast as FFT.

 <dc:description>  A gambler moves on the vertices $1, \ldots, n$ of a graph using the
probability distribution $p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}$. A cop pursues the gambler on
the graph, only being able to move between adjacent vertices. What is the
expected number of moves that the gambler can make until the cop catches them?
  Komarov and Winkler proved an upper bound of approximately $1.97n$ for the
expected capture time on any connected $n$-vertex graph when the cop does not
know the gambler's distribution. We improve this upper bound to approximately
$1.95n$ by modifying the cop's pursuit algorithm.

 <dc:description>  To analyze the limitations and the future directions of the extractive
summarization paradigm, this paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
formulation to obtain extractive oracle summaries in terms of ROUGE-N. We also
propose an algorithm that enumerates all of the oracle summaries for a set of
reference summaries to exploit F-measures that evaluate which system summaries
contain how many sentences that are extracted as an oracle summary. Our
experimental results obtained from Document Understanding Conference (DUC)
corpora demonstrated the following: (1) room still exists to improve the
performance of extractive summarization; (2) the F-measures derived from the
enumerated oracle summaries have significantly stronger correlations with human
judgment than those derived from single oracle summaries.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to effectively use millions of images with noisy
annotations in conjunction with a small subset of cleanly-annotated images to
learn powerful image representations. One common approach to combine clean and
noisy data is to first pre-train a network using the large noisy dataset and
then fine-tune with the clean dataset. We show this approach does not fully
leverage the information contained in the clean set. Thus, we demonstrate how
to use the clean annotations to reduce the noise in the large dataset before
fine-tuning the network using both the clean set and the full set with reduced
noise. The approach comprises a multi-task network that jointly learns to clean
noisy annotations and to accurately classify images. We evaluate our approach
on the recently released Open Images dataset, containing ~9 million images,
multiple annotations per image and over 6000 unique classes. For the small
clean set of annotations we use a quarter of the validation set with ~40k
images. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach clearly outperforms
direct fine-tuning across all major categories of classes in the Open Image
dataset. Further, our approach is particularly effective for a large number of
classes with wide range of noise in annotations (20-80% false positive
annotations).

 <dc:description>  In cross-lingual dependency annotation projection, information is often lost
during transfer because of early decoding. We present an end-to-end graph-based
neural network dependency parser that can be trained to reproduce matrices of
edge scores, which can be directly projected across word alignments. We show
that our approach to cross-lingual dependency parsing is not only simpler, but
also achieves an absolute improvement of 2.25% averaged across 10 languages
compared to the previous state of the art.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an opportunistic downlink interference alignment
(ODIA) for interference-limited cellular downlink, which intelligently combines
user scheduling and downlink IA techniques. The proposed ODIA not only
efficiently reduces the effect of inter-cell interference from other-cell base
stations (BSs) but also eliminates intra-cell interference among spatial
streams in the same cell. We show that the minimum number of users required to
achieve a target degrees-of-freedom (DoF) can be fundamentally reduced, i.e.,
the fundamental user scaling law can be improved by using the ODIA, compared
with the existing downlink IA schemes. In addition, we adopt a limited feedback
strategy in the ODIA framework, and then analyze the number of feedback bits
required for the system with limited feedback to achieve the same user scaling
law of the ODIA as the system with perfect CSI. We also modify the original
ODIA in order to further improve sum-rate, which achieves the optimal multiuser
diversity gain, i.e., $\log\log N$, per spatial stream even in the presence of
downlink inter-cell interference, where $N$ denotes the number of users in a
cell. Simulation results show that the ODIA significantly outperforms existing
interference management techniques in terms of sum-rate in realistic cellular
environments. Note that the ODIA operates in a non-collaborative and decoupled
manner, i.e., it requires no information exchange among BSs and no iterative
beamformer optimization between BSs and users, thus leading to an easier
implementation.

 <dc:title>A Lower Bound on the Probability of Error of Polar Codes over BMS
  Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shuval, Boaz</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tal, Ido</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Polar codes are a family of capacity-achieving codes that have explicit and
low-complexity construction, encoding, and decoding algorithms. Decoding of
polar codes is based on the successive-cancellation decoder, which decodes in a
bit-wise manner. A decoding error occurs when at least one bit is erroneously
decoded. The various codeword bits are correlated, yet performance analysis of
polar codes ignores this dependence: the upper bound is based on the union
bound, and the lower bound is based on the worst-performing bit.
  Improvement of the lower bound is afforded by considering error probabilities
of two bits simultaneously. These are difficult to compute explicitly due to
the large alphabet size inherent to polar codes. In this research we propose a
method to lower-bound the error probabilities of bit pairs. We develop several
transformations on pairs of synthetic channels that make the resultant
synthetic channels amenable to alphabet reduction. Our method improves upon
currently known lower bounds for polar codes under successive-cancellation
decoding.

 <dc:description>  The increasing number of threads inside the cores of a multicore processor,
and competitive access to the shared cache memory, become the main reasons for
an increased number of competitive cache misses and performance decline.
Inevitably, the development of modern processor architectures leads to an
increased number of cache misses. In this paper, we make an attempt to
implement a technique for decreasing the number of competitive cache misses in
the first level of cache memory. This technique enables competitive access to
the entire cache memory when there is a hit - but, if there are cache misses,
memory data (by using replacement techniques) is put in a virtual part given to
threads, so that competitive cache misses are avoided. By using a simulator
tool, the results show a decrease in the number of cache misses and performance
increase for up to 15%. The conclusion that comes out of this research is that
cache misses are a real challenge for future processor designers, in order to
hide memory latency.

 <dc:description>  Technologies have become important part of our lives. The steps for
introducing ICTs in education vary from country to country. The Republic of
Macedonia has invested with a lot in installment of hardware and software in
education and in teacher training. This research was aiming to determine the
situation of usage of databases of digital educational materials and to define
recommendation for future improvements. Teachers from urban schools were
interviewed with a questionnaire. The findings are several: only part of the
interviewed teachers had experience with databases of educational materials;
all teachers still need capacity building activities focusing exactly on the
use and benefits from databases of educational materials; preferably capacity
building materials to be in Macedonian language; technical support and
upgrading of software and materials should be performed on a regular basis.
Most of the findings can be applied at both national and international level -
with all this implemented, application of ICT in education will have much
bigger positive impact.

 <dc:description>  The Web 2.0 paradigm has radically changed the way businesses are run all
around the world. Moreover, e-Commerce has overcome in daily shopping
activities. For management teams, the assessment, evaluation, and forecasting
of online incomes and other business-oriented performance measures have become
'a holy grail', the ultimate question imposing their current and future
e-Commerce projects. Within the paper, we describe the development of a
Web-based simulation model, suitable for their estimation, taking into account
multiple operation profiles and scenarios. Specifically, we put focus on
introducing specific classes of e-Customers, as well as the workload
characterization of an arbitrary e-Commerce website. On the other hand, we
employ and embed the principles of the system thinking approach and the system
dynamics into the proposed solution. As a result, a complete simulation model
has been developed, available online. The model, which includes numerous
adjustable input variables, can be successfully utilized in making
'what-if'-like insights into a plethora of business-oriented performance
metrics for an arbitrary e-Commerce website. This project is, also, a great
example of the power delivered by InsightMaker, free-of-charge Web-based
software, suitable for a collaborative online development of models following
the systems thinking paradigm.

 <dc:description>  Navigation behaviour can be considered as one of the most crucial aspects of
user behaviour in an electronic commerce environment, which is very good
indicator of user's interests either in the process of browsing or purchasing.
Revealing user navigation patterns is very helpful in finding out a way for
increasing sale, turning the most browsers into buyers, keeping costumer's
attention, loyalty, adjusting and improving the interface in order to boost the
user experience and interaction with the system. In this regard, this research
has identified the most common user navigation patterns across information
networks, illustrated through the example of an electronic bookstore. A
behavioural-based model that provides profound knowledge about the processes of
navigation is proposed, specifically examined for different types of users,
automatically identified and clustered into two clusters according to their
navigational behaviour. The developed model is based on stochastic modelling
using the concept of Generalized Stochastic Petri Nets which complex solution
relies on Continuous Time Markov Chain. As a result, calculation of several
performance measures is performed, such as: expected time spent in a transient
tangible marking, cumulative sojourn time spent in a transient tangible
marking, total number of visits in a transient tangible marking etc.

 <dc:description>  This bachelor's thesis describes the conception and implementation of an
augmented reality application for the Android platform. The intention is to
demonstrate some possibilities of interaction within an augmented reality
environment on mobile devices. For that purpose, a 3D-model is displayed on the
devices' touchscreen using marker-based tracking. This enables the user to
translate, rotate or scale the model as he wishes. He can additionally select
and highlight preassigned parts of the model to display specific information
for that element. To assist developers in modifying the application for
changing requirements without re-writing large portions of the source code, the
information for each part have been encapsulated into its own data type. After
an introduction to augmented reality, its underlying technology and the Android
platform, some possible usage scenarios and the resulting functionalities are
outlined. Finally, the design as well as the developed implementation are
described.

 <dc:title>Sharing Means Renting?: An Entire-marketplace Analysis of Airbnb</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ke, Qing</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Airbnb, an online marketplace for accommodations, has experienced a
staggering growth accompanied by intense debates and scattered regulations
around the world. Current discourses, however, are largely focused on opinions
rather than empirical evidences. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting
the first large-scale measurement study on Airbnb, using a crawled data set
containing 2.3 million listings, 1.3 million hosts, and 19.3 million reviews.
We measure several key characteristics at the heart of the ongoing debate and
the sharing economy. Among others, we find that Airbnb has reached a global yet
heterogeneous coverage. The majority of its listings across many countries are
entire homes, suggesting that Airbnb is actually more like a rental marketplace
rather than a spare-room sharing platform. Analysis on star-ratings reveals
that there is a bias toward positive ratings, amplified by a bias toward using
positive words in reviews. The extent of such bias is greater than Yelp
reviews, which were already shown to exhibit a positive bias. We investigate a
key issue---commercial hosts who own multiple listings on Airbnb---repeatedly
discussed in the current debate. We find that their existence is prevalent,
they are early-movers towards joining Airbnb, and their listings are
disproportionately entire homes and located in the US. Our work advances the
current understanding of how Airbnb is being used and may serve as an
independent and empirical reference to inform the debate.

 <dc:description>  Cloud Computing (CC) is a model for enabling on-demand access to a shared
pool of configurable computing resources. Testing and evaluating the
performance of the cloud environment for allocating, provisioning, scheduling,
and data allocation policy have great attention to be achieved. Therefore,
using cloud simulator would save time and money, and provide a flexible
environment to evaluate new research work. Unfortunately, the current
simulators (e.g., CloudSim, NetworkCloudSim, GreenCloud, etc..) deal with the
data as for size only without any consideration about the data allocation
policy and locality. On the other hand, the NetworkCloudSim simulator is
considered one of the most common used simulators because it includes different
modules which support needed functions to a simulated cloud environment, and it
could be extended to include new extra modules. According to work in this
paper, the NetworkCloudSim simulator has been extended and modified to support
data locality. The modified simulator is called LocalitySim. The accuracy of
the proposed LocalitySim simulator has been proved by building a mathematical
model. Also, the proposed simulator has been used to test the performance of
the three-tire data center as a case study with considering the data locality
feature.

 <dc:title>Application of Fuzzy Logic in Design of Smart Washing Machine</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Masood, Rao Farhat</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Washing machine is of great domestic necessity as it frees us from the burden
of washing our clothes and saves ample of our time. This paper will cover the
aspect of designing and developing of Fuzzy Logic based, Smart Washing Machine.
The regular washing machine (timer based) makes use of multi-turned timer based
start-stop mechanism which is mechanical as is prone to breakage. In addition
to its starting and stopping issues, the mechanical timers are not efficient
with respect of maintenance and electricity usage. Recent developments have
shown that merger of digital electronics in optimal functionality of this
machine is possible and nowadays in practice. A number of international
renowned companies have developed the machine with the introduction of smart
artificial intelligence. Such a machine makes use of sensors and smartly
calculates the amount of run-time (washing time) for the main machine motor.
Realtime calculations and processes are also catered in optimizing the run-time
of the machine. The obvious result is smart time management, better economy of
electricity and efficiency of work. This paper deals with the indigenization of
FLC (Fuzzy Logic Controller) based Washing Machine, which is capable of
automating the inputs and getting the desired output (wash-time).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a control approach called Artificial Neural Tissue (ANT) is
applied to multirobot excavation for lunar base preparation tasks including
clearing landing pads and burying of habitat modules. We show for the first
time, a team of autonomous robots excavating a terrain to match a given 3D
blueprint. Constructing mounds around landing pads will provide physical
shielding from debris during launch/landing. Burying a human habitat modules
under 0.5 m of lunar regolith is expected to provide both radiation shielding
and maintain temperatures of -25 $^{o}$C. This minimizes base life-support
complexity and reduces launch mass. ANT is compelling for a lunar mission
because it doesn't require a team of astronauts for excavation and it requires
minimal supervision. The robot teams are shown to autonomously interpret
blueprints, excavate and prepare sites for a lunar base. Because little
pre-programmed knowledge is provided, the controllers discover creative
techniques. ANT evolves techniques such as slot-dozing that would otherwise
require excavation experts. This is critical in making an excavation mission
feasible when it is prohibitively expensive to send astronauts. The controllers
evolve elaborate negotiation behaviors to work in close quarters. These and
other techniques such as concurrent evolution of the controller and team size
are shown to tackle problem of antagonism, when too many robots interfere
reducing the overall efficiency or worse, resulting in gridlock. While many
challenges remain with this technology our work shows a compelling pathway for
field testing this approach.

 <dc:description>  Projective Reed-Muller codes were introduced by Lachaud, in 1988 and their
dimension and minimum distance were determined by Serre and S{\o}rensen in
1991. In coding theory one is also interested in the higher Hamming weights, to
study the code performance. Yet, not many values of the higher Hamming weights
are known for these codes, not even the second lowest weight (also known as
next-to-minimal weight) is completely determined. In this paper we determine
all the values of the next-to-minimal weight for the binary projective
Reed-Muller codes, which we show to be equal to the next-to-minimal weight of
Reed-Muller codes in most, but not all, cases.

 <dc:description>  Risk management is today a major steering tool for any organization wanting
to deal with Information System (IS) security. However, IS Security Risk
Management (ISSRM) remains difficult to establish and maintain, mainly in a
context of multi-regulations with complex and inter-connected IS. We claim that
a connection with Enterprise Architecture Management (EAM) contributes to deal
with these issues. A first step towards a better integration of both domains is
to define an integrated EAM-ISSRM conceptual model. Among the steps of the
research method followed to define such an integrated EAM-ISSRM conceptual,
this technical report presents the whole outputs (through alignment tables) of
the conceptual alignment between concepts used to model EA (based on ArchiMate,
TOGAF, IAF and DoDAF) and concepts of the ISSRM domain model.

 <dc:title>Diffusion of new products with recovering consumers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fibich, Gadi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the diffusion of new products in the discrete Bass-SIR model, in
which consumers who adopt the product can later &quot;recover&quot; and stop influencing
their peers to adopt the product. To gain insight into the effect of the social
network structure on the diffusion, we focus on two extreme cases. In the
&quot;most-connected&quot; configuration where all consumers are inter-connected
(complete network), averaging over all consumers leads to an aggregate model,
which combines the Bass model for diffusion of new products with the SIR model
for epidemics. In the &quot;least-connected&quot; configuration where consumers are
arranged on a circle and each consumer can only be influenced by his left
neighbor (one-sided 1D network), averaging over all consumers leads to a
different aggregate model which is linear, and can be solved explicitly. We
conjecture that for any other network, the diffusion is bounded from below and
from above by that on a one-sided 1D network and on a complete network,
respectively. When consumers are arranged on a circle and each consumer can be
influenced by his left and right neighbors (two-sided 1D network), the
diffusion is strictly faster than on a one-sided 1D network. This is different
from the case of non-recovering adopters, where the diffusion on one-sided and
on two-sided 1D networks is identical. We also propose a nonlinear model for
recoveries, and show that consumers' heterogeneity has a negligible effect on
the aggregate diffusion.

 <dc:title>Formal Proof of the Weak Goodstein Theorem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>D.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For many years, I have been interested in introducing students to the
development of complex systems by means of modelling and refinement. To this
end, I did not find anything better than presenting many examples of system
developments. However, I figured out that my examples were not explicit enough
on how (mechanical) proofs are performed. So, besides courses presenting these
examples and also some courses in various forms of proofs (propositional
calculus, first order predicate calculus, set theory), I decided to study the
work of professional mathematicians, thinking that it could be good examples
for students. Among the works I already studied and reconstructed are the
theorem of Zermelo, the theorem of Cantor-Bernstein, the planar graph theorem
of Kuratowski, the topological proof of the infinity of primes of Furstenberg,
the intermediate value theorem of Bolzano, the Archimedean property of the set
of Real numbers, and others. More recently, I found that the Goodstein theorem
was also very interesting. The purpose of this short note is to give some
information about this theorem and the way I introduce a weak form of it to
students.

 <dc:description>  Analogy Based Effort Estimation (ABE) is one of the prominent methods for
software effort estimation. The fundamental concept of ABE is closer to the
mentality of expert estimation but with an automated procedure in which the
final estimate is generated by reusing similar historical projects. The main
key issue when using ABE is how to adapt the effort of the retrieved nearest
neighbors. The adaptation process is an essential part of ABE to generate more
successful accurate estimation based on tuning the selected raw solutions,
using some adaptation strategy. In this study we show that there are three
interrelated decision variables that have great impact on the success of
adaptation method: (1) number of nearest analogies (k), (2) optimum feature set
needed for adaptation, and (3) adaptation weights. To find the right decision
regarding these variables, one need to study all possible combinations and
evaluate them individually to select the one that can improve all prediction
evaluation measures. The existing evaluation measures usually behave
differently, presenting sometimes opposite trends in evaluating prediction
methods. This means that changing one decision variable could improve one
evaluation measure while it is decreasing the others. Therefore, the main theme
of this research is how to come up with best decision variables that improve
adaptation strategy and thus, the overall evaluation measures without degrading
the others. The impact of these decisions together has not been investigated
before, therefore we propose to view the building of adaptation procedure as a
multi-objective optimization problem. The Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm
(PSO) is utilized to find the optimum solutions for such decision variables
based on optimizing multiple evaluation measures

 <dc:description>  Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) revolutionize various application domains with
integration and interoperability of networking, computing systems, and
mechanical devices. Due to its scale and variety, CPS faces a number of
challenges and opens up a few research questions in terms of management,
fault-tolerance, and scalability. We propose a software-defined approach
inspired by Software-Defined Networking (SDN), to address the challenges for a
wider CPS adoption. We thus design a middleware architecture for the correct
and resilient operation of CPS, to manage and coordinate the interacting
devices centrally in the cyberspace whilst not sacrificing the functionality
and performance benefits inherent to a distributed execution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper the Shapley value of digraph (directed graph) games are
considered. Digraph games are transferable utility (TU) games with limited
cooperation among players, where players are represented by nodes. A
restrictive relation between two adjacent players is established by a directed
line segment. Directed path, connecting the initial player with the terminal
player, form the coalition among players. A dominance relation is established
between players and this relation determines whether or not a player wants to
cooperate. To cooperate, we assume that a player joins a coalition where he/she
is not dominated by any other players.The Shapley value is defined as the
average of marginal contribution vectors corresponding to all permutations that
do not violate the subordination of players. The Shapley value for cyclic
digraph games is calculated and analyzed. For a given family of characteristic
functions, a quick way to calculate Shapley values is formulated.

 <dc:description>  How large is a network flow? Traditionally this question has been addressed
by using metrics such as the number of bytes, the transmission rate or the
duration of a flow. We reason that a formal mathematical definition of flow
size should account for the impact a flow has on the performance of a network:
flows that have the largest impact, should have the largest size. In this paper
we present a theory of flow ordering that reveals the connection between the
abstract concept of flow size and the QoS properties of a network. The theory
is generalized to accommodate for the case of partial information, allowing us
to model real computer network scenarios such as those found in involuntary
lossy environments or voluntary packet sampling protocols (e.g., sFlow). We
explore one application of this theory to address the problem of elephant flow
detection at very high speed rates. The algorithm uses the information
theoretic properties of the problem to help reduce the computational cost by a
factor of one thousand.

 <dc:description>  Poisson distribution is used for modeling noise in photon-limited imaging.
While canonical examples include relatively exotic types of sensing like
spectral imaging or astronomy, the problem is relevant to regular photography
now more than ever due to the booming market for mobile cameras. Restricted
form factor limits the amount of absorbed light, thus computational
post-processing is called for. In this paper, we make use of the powerful
framework of deep convolutional neural networks for Poisson denoising. We
demonstrate how by training the same network with images having a specific peak
value, our denoiser outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin
both visually and quantitatively. Being flexible and data-driven, our solution
resolves the heavy ad hoc engineering used in previous methods and is an order
of magnitude faster. We further show that by adding a reasonable prior on the
class of the image being processed, another significant boost in performance is
achieved.

 <dc:description>  We aim to study the modeling limitations of the commonly employed boosted
decision trees classifier. Inspired by the success of large, data-hungry visual
recognition models (e.g. deep convolutional neural networks), this paper
focuses on the relationship between modeling capacity of the weak learners,
dataset size, and dataset properties. A set of novel experiments on the Caltech
Pedestrian Detection benchmark results in the best known performance among
non-CNN techniques while operating at fast run-time speed. Furthermore, the
performance is on par with deep architectures (9.71% log-average miss rate),
while using only HOG+LUV channels as features. The conclusions from this study
are shown to generalize over different object detection domains as demonstrated
on the FDDB face detection benchmark (93.37% accuracy). Despite the impressive
performance, this study reveals the limited modeling capacity of the common
boosted trees model, motivating a need for architectural changes in order to
compete with multi-level and very deep architectures.

 <dc:description>  The increasing demand for high image quality in mobile devices brings forth
the need for better computational enhancement techniques, and image denoising
in particular. At the same time, the images captured by these devices can be
categorized into a small set of semantic classes. However simple, this
observation has not been exploited in image denoising until now. In this paper,
we demonstrate how the reconstruction quality improves when a denoiser is aware
of the type of content in the image. To this end, we first propose a new fully
convolutional deep neural network architecture which is simple yet powerful as
it achieves state-of-the-art performance even without being class-aware. We
further show that a significant boost in performance of up to $0.4$ dB PSNR can
be achieved by making our network class-aware, namely, by fine-tuning it for
images belonging to a specific semantic class. Relying on the hugely successful
existing image classifiers, this research advocates for using a class-aware
approach in all image enhancement tasks.

 <dc:description>  A virtual network (VN) contains a collection of virtual nodes and links
assigned to underlying physical resources in a network substrate. VN migration
is the process of remapping a VN's logical topology to a new set of physical
resources to provide failure recovery, energy savings, or defense against
attack. Providing VN migration that is transparent to running applications is a
significant challenge. Efficient migration mechanisms are highly dependent on
the technology deployed in the physical substrate. Prior work has considered
migration in data centers and in the PlanetLab infrastructure. However, there
has been little effort targeting an SDN-enabled wide-area networking
environment - an important building block of future networking infrastructure.
In this work, we are interested in the design, implementation and evaluation of
VN migration in GENI as a working example of such a future network. We identify
and propose techniques to address key challenges: the dynamic allocation of
resources during migration, managing hosts connected to the VN, and flow table
migration sequences to minimize packet loss. We find that GENI's virtualization
architecture makes transparent and efficient migration challenging. We suggest
alternatives that might be adopted in GENI and are worthy of adoption by
virtual network providers to facilitate migration.

 <dc:description>  We observe that a certain kind of algebraic proof - which covers essentially
all known algebraic circuit lower bounds to date - cannot be used to prove
lower bounds against VP if and only if what we call succinct hitting sets exist
for VP. This is analogous to the Razborov-Rudich natural proofs barrier in
Boolean circuit complexity, in that we rule out a large class of lower bound
techniques under a derandomization assumption. We also discuss connections
between this algebraic natural proofs barrier, geometric complexity theory, and
(algebraic) proof complexity.

 <dc:description>  The online problem of computing the top eigenvector is fundamental to machine
learning. In both adversarial and stochastic settings, previous results (such
as matrix multiplicative weight update, follow the regularized leader, follow
the compressed leader, block power method) either achieve optimal regret but
run slow, or run fast at the expense of loosing a $\sqrt{d}$ factor in total
regret where $d$ is the matrix dimension.
  We propose a $\textit{follow-the-compressed-leader (FTCL)}$ framework which
achieves optimal regret without sacrificing the running time. Our idea is to
&quot;compress&quot; the matrix strategy to dimension 3 in the adversarial setting, or
dimension 1 in the stochastic setting. These respectively resolve two open
questions regarding the design of optimal and efficient algorithms for the
online eigenvector problem.

 <dc:description>  Artificial intelligence has seen several breakthroughs in recent years, with
games often serving as milestones. A common feature of these games is that
players have perfect information. Poker is the quintessential game of imperfect
information, and a longstanding challenge problem in artificial intelligence.
We introduce DeepStack, an algorithm for imperfect information settings. It
combines recursive reasoning to handle information asymmetry, decomposition to
focus computation on the relevant decision, and a form of intuition that is
automatically learned from self-play using deep learning. In a study involving
44,000 hands of poker, DeepStack defeated with statistical significance
professional poker players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em. The approach is
theoretically sound and is shown to produce more difficult to exploit
strategies than prior approaches.

While the topical demographic of Western Media was subjects of studies in the
past, less is known about Chinese Media. In this paper, we apply event
detection and tracking technology to examine the information overlap and
differences between Chinese and Western - Traditional Media and Social Media.
Our experiments reveal a biased interest of China towards the West, which
becomes particularly apparent when comparing the interest in celebrities.

 <dc:description>  The miniaturization of electronics, sensors and actuators has enabled the
growing use of CubeSats and sub-20 kg spacecraft. Their reduced mass and volume
has the potential to translate into significant reductions in required
propellant and launch mass for interplanetary missions, earth observation and
for astrophysics applications. There is an important need to optimize the
design of these spacecraft to better ascertain their maximal capabilities by
finding optimized solution, where mass, volume and power is a premium. Current
spacecraft design methods require a team of experts, who use their engineering
experience and judgement to develop a spacecraft design. Such an approach can
miss innovative designs not thought of by a human design team. In this work we
present a compelling alternative approach that extends the capabilities of a
spacecraft engineering design team to search for and identify near-optimal
solutions using machine learning. The approach enables automated design of a
spacecraft that requires specifying quantitative goals, requiring reaching a
target location or operating at a predetermined orbit for a required time. Next
a virtual warehouse of components is specified that be selected to produce a
candidate design. Candidate designs are produced using an artificial Darwinian
approach, where fittest design survives and reproduce, while unfit individuals
are culled off. Our past work in space robotic has produced systems designs and
controllers that are human competitive. Finding a near-optimal solution
presents vast improvements over a solution obtained through engineering
judgment and point design alone. The approach shows a credible pathway to
identify and evaluate many more candidate designs than it would be otherwise
possible with a human design team alone.

 <dc:description>  A map-guided superpixel segmentation method for hyperspectral imagery is
developed and introduced. The proposed approach develops a
hyperspectral-appropriate version of the SLIC superpixel segmentation
algorithm, leverages map information to guide segmentation, and incorporates
the semi-supervised Partial Membership Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sPM-LDA) to
obtain a final superpixel segmentation. The proposed method is applied to two
real hyperspectral data sets and quantitative cluster validity metrics indicate
that the proposed approach outperforms existing hyperspectral superpixel
segmentation methods.

 <dc:description>  Graphlets are induced subgraphs of a large network and are important for
understanding and modeling complex networks. Despite their practical
importance, graphlets have been severely limited to applications and domains
with relatively small graphs. Most previous work has focused on exact
algorithms, however, it is often too expensive to compute graphlets exactly in
massive networks with billions of edges, and finding an approximate count is
usually sufficient for many applications. In this work, we propose an unbiased
graphlet estimation framework that is (a) fast with significant speedups
compared to the state-of-the-art, (b) parallel with nearly linear-speedups, (c)
accurate with &lt;1% relative error, (d) scalable and space-efficient for massive
networks with billions of edges, and (e) flexible for a variety of real-world
settings, as well as estimating macro and micro-level graphlet statistics
(e.g., counts) of both connected and disconnected graphlets. In addition, an
adaptive approach is introduced that finds the smallest sample size required to
obtain estimates within a given user-defined error bound. On 300 networks from
20 domains, we obtain &lt;1% relative error for all graphlets. This is
significantly more accurate than existing methods while using less data.
Moreover, it takes a few seconds on billion edge graphs (as opposed to
days/weeks). These are by far the largest graphlet computations to date.

 <dc:description>  A probabilistic framework is proposed for the optimization of efficient
switched control strategies for physical systems dominated by stochastic
excitation. In this framework, the equation for the state trajectory is
replaced with an equivalent equation for its probability distribution function
in the constrained optimization setting. This allows for a large class of
control rules to be considered, including hysteresis and a mix of continuous
and discrete random variables. The problem of steering atmospheric balloons
within a stratified flowfield is a motivating application; the same approach
can be extended to a variety of mixed-variable stochastic systems and to new
classes of control rules.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for multi-person detection and 2-D pose estimation that
achieves state-of-art results on the challenging COCO keypoints task. It is a
simple, yet powerful, top-down approach consisting of two stages.
  In the first stage, we predict the location and scale of boxes which are
likely to contain people; for this we use the Faster RCNN detector. In the
second stage, we estimate the keypoints of the person potentially contained in
each proposed bounding box. For each keypoint type we predict dense heatmaps
and offsets using a fully convolutional ResNet. To combine these outputs we
introduce a novel aggregation procedure to obtain highly localized keypoint
predictions. We also use a novel form of keypoint-based Non-Maximum-Suppression
(NMS), instead of the cruder box-level NMS, and a novel form of keypoint-based
confidence score estimation, instead of box-level scoring.
  Trained on COCO data alone, our final system achieves average precision of
0.649 on the COCO test-dev set and the 0.643 test-standard sets, outperforming
the winner of the 2016 COCO keypoints challenge and other recent state-of-art.
Further, by using additional in-house labeled data we obtain an even higher
average precision of 0.685 on the test-dev set and 0.673 on the test-standard
set, more than 5% absolute improvement compared to the previous best performing
method on the same dataset.

 <dc:title>Spectral Statistics of Lattice Graph Structured, Non-uniform
  Percolations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kruzick, Stephen</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Moura, Jos&#xe9; M. F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Design of filters for graph signal processing benefits from knowledge of the
spectral decomposition of matrices that encode graphs, such as the adjacency
matrix and the Laplacian matrix, used to define the shift operator. For shift
matrices with real eigenvalues, which arise for symmetric graphs, the empirical
spectral distribution captures the eigenvalue locations. Under realistic
circumstances, stochastic influences often affect the network structure and,
consequently, the shift matrix empirical spectral distribution. Nevertheless,
deterministic functions may often be found to approximate the asymptotic
behavior of empirical spectral distributions of random matrices. This paper
uses stochastic canonical equation methods developed by Girko to derive such
deterministic equivalent distributions for the empirical spectral distributions
of random graphs formed by structured, non-uniform percolation of a
D-dimensional lattice supergraph. Included simulations demonstrate the results
for sample parameters.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new concurrent model for imperative languages where concurrency
occurs at a subprogram level. This model introduces a new {\it block
sequential} statement of the form $#(G_1,\ldots,G_n)$ where each $G_i$ is a
statement. This statement tells the machine to execute $G_1,\ldots,G_n$
sequentially and atomically (\ie, without interleaving). It therefore enhances
atomicity and predictability in concurrent programming. We illustrate our idea
via $C^{\|}$, an extension of the core concurrent C with the new block
sequential statement.

 <dc:description>  Brain inspired neuromorphic computing has demonstrated remarkable advantages
over traditional von Neumann architecture for its high energy efficiency and
parallel data processing. However, the limited resolution of synaptic weights
degrades system accuracy and thus impedes the use of neuromorphic systems. In
this work, we propose three orthogonal methods to learn synapses with one-level
precision, namely, distribution-aware quantization, quantization regularization
and bias tuning, to make image classification accuracy comparable to the
state-of-the-art. Experiments on both multi-layer perception and convolutional
neural networks show that the accuracy drop can be well controlled within 0.19%
(5.53%) for MNIST (CIFAR-10) database, compared to an ideal system without
quantization.

received in the past, and ran them through CrowdTone. Participants and
professional writers assessed the quality of improvements finding a substantial
increase in the percentage of emails deemed &quot;appropriate&quot; or &quot;very appropriate&quot;

 <dc:description>  Strong external difference family (SEDF) and its generalizations GSEDF,
BGSEDF in a finite abelian group $G$ are combinatorial designs raised by
Paterson and Stinson [7] in 2016 and have applications in communication theory
to construct optimal strong algebraic manipulation detection codes. In this
paper we firstly present some general constructions of these combinatorial
designs by using difference sets and partial difference sets in $G$. Then, as
applications of the general constructions, we construct series of SEDF, GSEDF
and BGSEDF in finite fields by using cyclotomic classes.

 <dc:description>  This project is about EnHANTs networks. These networks have self-sustainable
energy devices and the communication is performed over wireless links between
neighboring devices. Since the devices are very limited in terms of energy,
sending the data in these networks has to be as effective as possible and must
take into consideration the available amount of energy. Therefore, it is
necessary to use algorithms that are specifically designed for this type of
networks. In this book we propose strategies for a specific case of these
networks. The main part of this project is a MATLAB simulation built in order
to examine the behavior of such networks. In the last section of this book, we
describe a set of runs of different topologies, in order to test the influence
of certain strategy parameters on the behavior of the system.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of variable-length lossy source coding.
We deal with the case where both the excess distortion probability and the
overflow probability of codeword length are less than or equal to positive
constants. The infimum of the thresholds on the overflow probability is
characterized by a smooth max entropy-based quantity. Both non-asymptotic and
asymptotic cases are analyzed. To show the achievability results, we do not
utilize the random coding argument but give an explicit code construction.

 <dc:description>  The Urban Rail Transit (URT) has been one of the major trip modes in cities
worldwide. As the passengers arrive at variable rates in different time slots,
e.g., rush and non-rush hours, the departure frequency at a site directly
relates to perceived service quality of passengers; the high departure
frequency, however, incurs more operation cost to URT. Therefore, a tradeoff
between the interest of railway operator and the service quality of passengers
needs to be addressed. In this paper, we develop a model on the operation
method of train operation scheduling using a Stackelberg game model. The
railway operator is modeled as the game leader and the passengers as the game
follower, and an optimal departure frequency can be determine the tradeoff
between passengers' service quality and operation cost. We present several
numerical examples based on the operation data from Nanjing transit subway at
China. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can significantly
improve the traffic efficiency.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a tree-structured attention neural network for sentences and
small phrases and apply it to the problem of sentiment classification. Our
model expands the current recursive models by incorporating structural
information around a node of a syntactic tree using both bottom-up and top-down
information propagation. Also, the model utilizes structural attention to
identify the most salient representations during the construction of the
syntactic tree. To our knowledge, the proposed models achieve state of the art
performance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes three simple, compact yet effective representations of
depth sequences, referred to respectively as Dynamic Depth Images (DDI),
Dynamic Depth Normal Images (DDNI) and Dynamic Depth Motion Normal Images
(DDMNI). These dynamic images are constructed from a sequence of depth maps
using bidirectional rank pooling to effectively capture the spatial-temporal
information. Such image-based representations enable us to fine-tune the
existing ConvNets models trained on image data for classification of depth
sequences, without introducing large parameters to learn. Upon the proposed
representations, a convolutional Neural networks (ConvNets) based method is
developed for gesture recognition and evaluated on the Large-scale Isolated
Gesture Recognition at the ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) challenge 2016. The
method achieved 55.57\% classification accuracy and ranked $2^{nd}$ place in
this challenge but was very close to the best performance even though we only
used depth data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we examine the physical layer security for cooperative
wireless networks with multiple intermediate nodes, where the
decode-and-forward (DF) protocol is considered. We propose a new joint relay
and jammer selection (JRJS) scheme for protecting wireless communications
against eavesdropping, where an intermediate node is selected as the relay for
the sake of forwarding the source signal to the destination and meanwhile, the
remaining intermediate nodes are employed to act as friendly jammers which
broadcast the artificial noise for disturbing the eavesdropper. We further
investigate the power allocation among the source, relay and friendly jammers
for maximizing the secrecy rate of proposed JRJS scheme and derive a
closed-form sub-optimal solution. Specificially, all the intermediate nodes
which successfully decode the source signal are considered as relay candidates.
For each candidate, we derive the sub-optimal closed-form power allocation
solution and obtain the secrecy rate result of the corresponding JRJS scheme.
Then, the candidate which is capable of achieving the highest secrecy rate is
selected as the relay. Two assumptions about the channel state information
(CSI), namely the full CSI (FCSI) and partial CSI (PCSI), are considered.
Simulation results show that the proposed JRJS scheme outperforms the
conventional pure relay selection, pure jamming and GSVD based beamforming
schemes in terms of secrecy rate. Additionally, the proposed FCSI based power
allocation (FCSI-PA) and PCSI based power allocation (PCSI-PA) schemes both
achieve higher secrecy rates than the equal power allocation (EPA) scheme.

 <dc:description>  We present an unsupervised representation learning approach that compactly
encodes the motion dependencies in videos. Given a pair of images from a video
clip, our framework learns to predict the long-term 3D motions. To reduce the
complexity of the learning framework, we propose to describe the motion as a
sequence of atomic 3D flows computed with RGB-D modality. We use a Recurrent
Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder framework to predict these sequences of
flows. We argue that in order for the decoder to reconstruct these sequences,
the encoder must learn a robust video representation that captures long-term
motion dependencies and spatial-temporal relations. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our learned temporal representations on activity
classification across multiple modalities and datasets such as NTU RGB+D and
MSR Daily Activity 3D. Our framework is generic to any input modality, i.e.,
RGB, Depth, and RGB-D videos.

 <dc:description>  Deep Convolution Neural Networks (DCNNs) are capable of learning
unprecedentedly effective image representations. However, their ability in
handling significant local and global image rotations remains limited. In this
paper, we propose Active Rotating Filters (ARFs) that actively rotate during
convolution and produce feature maps with location and orientation explicitly
encoded. An ARF acts as a virtual filter bank containing the filter itself and
its multiple unmaterialised rotated versions. During back-propagation, an ARF
is collectively updated using errors from all its rotated versions. DCNNs using
ARFs, referred to as Oriented Response Networks (ORNs), can produce
within-class rotation-invariant deep features while maintaining inter-class
discrimination for classification tasks. The oriented response produced by ORNs
can also be used for image and object orientation estimation tasks. Over
multiple state-of-the-art DCNN architectures, such as VGG, ResNet, and STN, we
consistently observe that replacing regular filters with the proposed ARFs
leads to significant reduction in the number of network parameters and
improvement in classification performance. We report the best results on
several commonly used benchmarks.

 <dc:title>Analysis of equivalence relation in joint sparse recovery</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The joint sparse recovery problem is a generalization of the single
measurement vector problem which is widely studied in Compressed Sensing and it
aims to recovery a set of jointly sparse vectors. i.e. have nonzero entries
concentrated at common location. Meanwhile l_p-minimization subject to matrices
is widely used in a large number of algorithms designed for this problem.
Therefore the main contribution in this paper is two theoretical results about
this technique. The first one is to prove that in every multiple systems of
linear equation, there exists a constant p* such that the original unique
sparse solution also can be recovered from a minimization in l_p quasi-norm
subject to matrices whenever 0&lt; p&lt;p*. The other one is to show an analysis
expression of such p*. Finally, we display the results of one example to
confirm the validity of our conclusions.

 <dc:description>  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a new approach for Machine Translation
(MT), and due to its success, it has absorbed the attention of many researchers
in the field. In this paper, we study NMT model on Persian-English language
pairs, to analyze the model and investigate the appropriateness of the model
for scarce-resourced scenarios, the situation that exists for Persian-centered
translation systems. We adjust the model for the Persian language and find the
best parameters and hyper parameters for two tasks: translation and
transliteration. We also apply some preprocessing task on the Persian dataset
which yields to increase for about one point in terms of BLEU score. Also, we
have modified the loss function to enhance the word alignment of the model.
This new loss function yields a total of 1.87 point improvements in terms of
BLEU score in the translation quality.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new way to increase interconnectivity in small
Wikipedias (fewer than a 100,000 articles), by automatically linking articles
based on interlanguage links. Many small Wikipedias have many articles with
very few links, this is mainly due to the short article length. This makes it
difficult to navigate between the articles. In many cases the article does
exist for a small Wikipedia, however the article is just missing a link. Due to
the fact that Wikipedias are translated in to many languages, it allows us to
generate new links for small Wikipedias using the links from a large Wikipedia
(more than a 100,000 articles).

 <dc:description>  Devices like the Myo armband available in the market today enable us to
collect data about the position of a user's hands and fingers over time. We can
use these technologies for sign language translation since each sign is roughly
a combination of gestures across time. In this work, we utilize a dataset
collected by a group at the University of South Wales, which contains
parameters, such as hand position, hand rotation, and finger bend, for 95
unique signs. For each input stream representing a sign, we predict which sign
class this stream falls into. We begin by implementing baseline SVM and
logistic regression models, which perform reasonably well on high quality data.
Lower quality data requires a more sophisticated approach, so we explore
different methods in temporal classification, including long short term memory
architectures and sequential pattern mining methods.

variety of different facial attributes and generates new faces given a set of
desired facial characteristics. After introducing the problem and providing
context in the first section, we discuss recent work related to image
generation in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the methods used to
fine-tune our CNN and generate new images using a novel approach inspired by a
Gaussian mixture model. In Section 4, we discuss our working dataset and
describe our preprocessing steps and handling of facial attributes. Finally, in
Sections 5, 6 and 7, we explain our experiments and results and conclude in the
following section. Our classification system has 82\% test accuracy.
Furthermore, our generation pipeline successfully creates well-formed faces.

 <dc:description>  Facial expression recognition methods use a combination of geometric and
appearance-based features. Spatial features are derived from displacements of
facial landmarks, and carry geometric information. These features are either
selected based on prior knowledge, or dimension-reduced from a large pool. In
this study, we produce a large number of potential spatial features using two
combinations of facial landmarks. Among these, we search for a descriptive
subset of features using sequential forward selection. The chosen feature
subset is used to classify facial expressions in the extended Cohn-Kanade
dataset (CK+), and delivered 88.7% recognition accuracy without using any
appearance-based features.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory optimization considers the problem of deciding how to control a
dynamical system to move along a trajectory which minimizes some cost function.
Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an optimal control method which
utilizes a second-order approximation of the problem to find the control. It is
fast enough to allow real-time control and has been shown to work well for
trajectory optimization in robotic systems. Here we extend classic DDP to
systems with multiple time-delays in the state. Being able to find optimal
trajectories for time-delayed systems with DDP opens up the possibility to use
richer models for system identification and control, including recurrent neural
networks with multiple timesteps in the state. We demonstrate the algorithm on
a two-tank continuous stirred tank reactor. We also demonstrate the algorithm
on a recurrent neural network trained to model an inverted pendulum with
position information only.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a framework for classifying images according to
high-level sentiment. We subdivide the task into three primary problems:
emotion classification on faces, human pose estimation, and 3D estimation and
clustering of groups of people. We introduce novel algorithms for matching body
parts to a common individual and clustering people in images based on physical
location and orientation. Our results outperform several baseline approaches.

 <dc:title>Deep Learning for Time-Series Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gamboa, John Cristian Borges</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many real-world application, e.g., speech recognition or sleep stage
classification, data are captured over the course of time, constituting a
Time-Series. Time-Series often contain temporal dependencies that cause two
otherwise identical points of time to belong to different classes or predict
different behavior. This characteristic generally increases the difficulty of
analysing them. Existing techniques often depended on hand-crafted features
that were expensive to create and required expert knowledge of the field. With
the advent of Deep Learning new models of unsupervised learning of features for
Time-series analysis and forecast have been developed. Such new developments
are the topic of this paper: a review of the main Deep Learning techniques is
presented, and some applications on Time-Series analysis are summaried. The
results make it clear that Deep Learning has a lot to contribute to the field.

 <dc:description>  Robots typically possess sensors of different modalities, such as colour
cameras, inertial measurement units, and 3D laser scanners. Often, solving a
particular problem becomes easier when more than one modality is used. However,
while there are undeniable benefits to combine sensors of different modalities
the process tends to be complicated. Segmenting scenes observed by the robot
into a discrete set of classes is a central requirement for autonomy as
understanding the scene is the first step to reason about future situations.
Scene segmentation is commonly performed using either image data or 3D point
cloud data. In computer vision many successful methods for scene segmentation
are based on conditional random fields (CRF) where the maximum a posteriori
(MAP) solution to the segmentation can be obtained by inference. In this paper
we devise a new CRF inference method for scene segmentation that incorporates
global constraints, enforcing the sets of nodes are assigned the same class
label. To do this efficiently, the CRF is formulated as a relaxed quadratic
program whose MAP solution is found using a gradient-based optimisation
approach. The proposed method is evaluated on images and 3D point cloud data
gathered in urban environments where image data provides the appearance
features needed by the CRF, while the 3D point cloud data provides global
spatial constraints over sets of nodes. Comparisons with belief propagation,
conventional quadratic programming relaxation, and higher order potential CRF
show the benefits of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) promises to bring ease of monitoring, better
efficiency and innovative services across many domains with connected devices
around us. With information from critical parts of infrastructure and powerful
cloud-based data analytics, many applications can be developed to gain insights
about IoT systems as well as transform their capabilities. Actuation
applications form an essential part of these IoT systems, as they enable
automation as well as fast low-level decision making. However, modern IoT
systems are designed for data acquisition, and actuation applications are
implemented in an ad-hoc manner. We identify modeling constraints in a
systematic manner as indispensable to support actuation applications because
constraints encompass high-level policies dictated by laws of physics, legal
policies, user preferences. We explore data models for constraints inIoT system
with the example of a home heating system and illustrate the challenges in
enforcing these constraints in theIoT system architecture.

 <dc:description>  The increasing popularity of online social network brings huge privacy threat
for the end users. While existing work focus on inferring sensitive attributes
from the social network such as age, location and gender, little has been done
on how to protect the users' privacy by preventing the malicious inference. In
this paper we investigated the privacy vulnerability of the existing social
network and designed a privacy-preserving framework. We evaluated the
framework's privacy and usefulness guarantees, demonstrated its effectiveness
on classification and the defense against the privacy attack.

 <dc:description>  Identifying the different varieties of the same language is more challenging
than unrelated languages identification. In this paper, we propose an approach
to discriminate language varieties or dialects of Mandarin Chinese for the
Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macao, Malaysia and Singapore, a.k.a., the
Greater China Region (GCR). When applied to the dialects identification of the
GCR, we find that the commonly used character-level or word-level uni-gram
feature is not very efficient since there exist several specific problems such
as the ambiguity and context-dependent characteristic of words in the dialects
of the GCR. To overcome these challenges, we use not only the general features
like character-level n-gram, but also many new word-level features, including
PMI-based and word alignment-based features. A series of evaluation results on
both the news and open-domain dataset from Wikipedia show the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  The majority of existing solutions to the Multi-Target Tracking (MTT) problem
do not combine cues in a coherent end-to-end fashion over a long period of
time. However, we present an online method that encodes long-term temporal
dependencies across multiple cues. One key challenge of tracking methods is to
accurately track occluded targets or those which share similar appearance
properties with surrounding objects. To address this challenge, we present a
structure of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that jointly reasons on multiple
cues over a temporal window. We are able to correct many data association
errors and recover observations from an occluded state. We demonstrate the
robustness of our data-driven approach by tracking multiple targets using their
appearance, motion, and even interactions. Our method outperforms previous
works on multiple publicly available datasets including the challenging MOT
benchmark.

 <dc:description>  Exemplar-based face sketch synthesis plays an important role in both digital
entertainment and law enforcement. It generally consists of two parts: neighbor
selection and reconstruction weight representation. The most time-consuming or
main computation complexity for exemplar-based face sketch synthesis methods
lies in the neighbor selection process. State-of-the-art face sketch synthesis
methods perform neighbor selection online in a data-driven manner by $K$
nearest neighbor ($K$-NN) searching. Actually, the online search increases the
time consuming for synthesis. Moreover, since these methods need to traverse
the whole training dataset for neighbor selection, the computational complexity
increases with the scale of the training database and hence these methods have
limited scalability. In this paper, we proposed a simple but effective offline
random sampling in place of online $K$-NN search to improve the synthesis
efficiency. Extensive experiments on public face sketch databases demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art
methods, in terms of both synthesis quality and time consumption. The proposed
method could be extended to other heterogeneous face image transformation
problems such as face hallucination. We release the source codes of our
proposed methods and the evaluation metrics for future study online:

 <dc:description>  The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) targets to a coordinated traffic
system by applying the advanced wireless communication technologies for road
traffic scheduling. Towards an accurate road traffic control, the short-term
traffic forecasting to predict the road traffic at the particular site in a
short period is often useful and important. In existing works, Seasonal
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is a popular approach.
The scheme however encounters two challenges: 1) the analysis on related data
is insufficient whereas some important features of data may be neglected; and
2) with data presenting different features, it is unlikely to have one
predictive model that can fit all situations. To tackle above issues, in this
work, we develop a hybrid model to improve accuracy of SARIMA. In specific, we
first explore the autocorrelation and distribution features existed in traffic
flow to revise structure of the time series model. Based on the Gaussian
distribution of traffic flow, a hybrid model with a Bayesian learning algorithm
is developed which can effectively expand the application scenarios of SARIMA.
We show the efficiency and accuracy of our proposal using both analysis and
experimental studies. Using the real-world trace data, we show that the
proposed predicting approach can achieve satisfactory performance in practice.

In this paper, we systematically study the effect of image distortions on the
deep neural network (DNN) image classifiers. First, we examine the DNN
classifier performance under four types of distortions. Second, we propose two
approaches to alleviate the effect of image distortion: re-training and
fine-tuning with noisy images. Our results suggest that, under certain
conditions, fine-tuning with noisy images can alleviate much effect due to
distorted inputs, and is more practical than re-training.

 <dc:description>  Mobile Crowdsourcing is a promising service paradigm utilizing ubiquitous
mobile devices to facilitate largescale crowdsourcing tasks (e.g. urban sensing
and collaborative computing). Many applications in this domain require
Device-to-Device (D2D) communications between participating devices for
interactive operations such as task collaborations and file transmissions.
Considering the private participating devices and their opportunistic
encountering behaviors, it is highly desired to establish secure and
trustworthy D2D connections in a fast and autonomous way, which is vital for
implementing practical Mobile Crowdsourcing Systems (MCSs). In this paper, we
develop an efficient scheme, Trustworthy Device Pairing (TDP), which achieves
user-transparent secure D2D connections and reliable peer device selections for
trustworthy D2D communications. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and security intensity of TDP in theory. The performance of TDP
is evaluated based on both real-world prototype experiments and extensive
trace-driven simulations. Evaluation results verify our theoretical analysis
and show that TDP significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of
pairing speed, stability, and security.

 <dc:description>  Schoof's classic algorithm allows point-counting for elliptic curves over
finite fields in polynomial time. This algorithm was subsequently improved by
Atkin, using factorizations of modular polynomials, and by Elkies, using a
theory of explicit isogenies. Moving to Jacobians of genus-2 curves, the
current state of the art for point counting is a generalization of Schoof's
algorithm. While we are currently missing the tools we need to generalize
Elkies' methods to genus 2, recently Martindale and Milio have computed
analogues of modular polynomials for genus-2 curves whose Jacobians have real
multiplication by maximal orders of small discriminant. In this article, we
prove Atkin-style results for genus-2 Jacobians with real multiplication by
maximal orders, with a view to using these new modular polynomials to improve
the practicality of point-counting algorithms for these curves.

 <dc:description>  Mobile Crowdsensing is a promising paradigm for ubiquitous sensing, which
explores the tremendous data collected by mobile smart devices with prominent
spatial-temporal coverage. As a fundamental property of Mobile Crowdsensing
Systems, temporally recruited mobile users can provide agile, fine-grained, and
economical sensing labors, however their self-interest cannot guarantee the
quality of the sensing data, even when there is a fair return. Therefore, a
mechanism is required for the system server to recruit well-behaving users for
credible sensing, and to stimulate and reward more contributive users based on
sensing truth discovery to further increase credible reporting. In this paper,
we develop a novel Cheating-Resilient Incentive (CRI) scheme for Mobile
Crowdsensing Systems, which achieves credibility-driven user recruitment and
payback maximization for honest users with quality data. Via theoretical
analysis, we demonstrate the correctness of our design. The performance of our
scheme is evaluated based on extensive realworld trace-driven simulations. Our
evaluation results show that our scheme is proven to be effective in terms of
both guaranteeing sensing accuracy and resisting potential cheating behaviors,
as demonstrated in practical scenarios, as well as those that are intentionally
harsher.

 <dc:description>  The European Space Agency (ESA) defines an Earth Observation (EO) Level 2
product as a multispectral (MS) image corrected for geometric, atmospheric,
adjacency and topographic effects, stacked with its scene classification map
(SCM), whose legend includes quality layers such as cloud and cloud-shadow. No
ESA EO Level 2 product has ever been systematically generated at the ground
segment. To contribute toward filling an information gap from EO big data to
the ESA EO Level 2 product, an original Stage 4 validation (Val) of the
Satellite Image Automatic Mapper (SIAM) lightweight computer program was
conducted by independent means on an annual Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD)
image composite time-series of the conterminous U.S. The core of SIAM is a one
pass prior knowledge based decision tree for MS reflectance space
hyperpolyhedralization into static color names presented in literature in
recent years. For the sake of readability this paper is split into two. The
present Part 1 Theory provides the multidisciplinary background of a priori
color naming in cognitive science, from linguistics to computer vision. To cope
with dictionaries of MS color names and land cover class names that do not
coincide and must be harmonized, an original hybrid guideline is proposed to
identify a categorical variable pair relationship. An original quantitative
measure of categorical variable pair association is also proposed. The
subsequent Part 2 Validation discusses Stage 4 Val results collected by an
original protocol for wall-to-wall thematic map quality assessment without
sampling where the test and reference map legends can differ. Conclusions are
that the SIAM-WELD maps instantiate a Level 2 SCM product whose legend is the 4
class taxonomy of the FAO Land Cover Classification System at the Dichotomous
Phase Level 1 vegetation/nonvegetation and Level 2 terrestrial/aquatic.

 <dc:description>  Effective file transfer between vehicles is fundamental to many emerging
vehicular infotainment applications in the highway Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
(VANETs), such as content distribution and social networking. However, due to
fast mobility, the connection between vehicles tends to be short-lived and
lossy, which makes intact file transfer extremely challenging. To tackle this
problem, we presents a novel Cluster-based File Transfer (CFT) scheme for
highway VANETs in this paper. With CFT, when a vehicle requests a file, the
transmission capacity between the resource vehicle and the destination vehicle
is evaluated. If the requested file can be successfully transferred over the
direct Vehicular-to-Vehicular (V2V) connection, the file transfer will be
completed by the resource and the destination themselves. Otherwise, a cluster
will be formed to help the file transfer. As a fully-distributed scheme that
relies on the collaboration of cluster members, CFT does not require any
assistance from roadside units or access points. Our experimental results
indicate that CFT outperforms the existing file transfer schemes for highway
VANETs.

 <dc:description>  We consider a multi-level aggregation problem in a weighted rooted tree,
studied recently by Bienkowski et al. (2015). In this problem requests arrive
over time at the nodes of the tree, and each request specifies a deadline. A
request is served by sending it to the root before its deadline at a cost equal
to the weight of the path from the node in which it resides to the root.
However, requests from different nodes can be aggregated, and served together,
so as to save on cost. The cost of serving an aggregated set of requests is
equal to the weight of the subtree spanning the nodes in which the requests
reside. Thus, the problem is to find a competitive online aggregation algorithm
that minimizes the total cost of the aggregated requests. This problem arises
naturally in many scenarios, including multicasting, supply-chain management
and sensor networks. It is also related to the well studied TCP-acknowledgement
problem and the online joint replenishment problem.
  We present an online $O(D)$-competitive algorithm for the problem, where $D$
is the depth, or number of levels, of the aggregation tree. This result
improves upon the $D^2 2^D$-competitive algorithm obtained recently by
Bienkowski et al. (2015).

 <dc:description>  We study the application of polar codes in deletion channels by analyzing the
cascade of a binary erasure channel (BEC) and a deletion channel. We show how
polar codes can be used effectively on a BEC with a single deletion, and
propose a list decoding algorithm with a cyclic redundancy check for this case.
The decoding complexity is $O(N^2\log N)$, where $N$ is the blocklength of the
code. An important contribution is an optimization of the amount of redundancy
added to minimize the overall error probability. Our theoretical results are
corroborated by numerical simulations which show that the list size can be
reduced to one and the original message can be recovered with high probability
as the length of the code grows.

 <dc:title>On the Complexity of Restoring Corrupted Colorings</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the \probrFix problem, we are given a graph $G$, a (non-proper)
vertex-coloring $c : V(G) \to [r]$, and a positive integer $k$. The goal is to
decide whether a proper $r$-coloring $c'$ is obtainable from $c$ by recoloring
at most $k$ vertices of $G$. Recently, Junosza-Szaniawski, Liedloff, and
Rz{\k{a}}{\.z}ewski [SOFSEM 2015] asked whether the problem has a polynomial
kernel parameterized by the number of recolorings $k$. In a full version of the
manuscript, the authors together with Garnero and Montealegre, answered the
question in the negative: for every $r \geq 3$, the problem \probrFix does not
admit a polynomial kernel unless $\NP \subseteq \coNP / \poly$. Independently
of their work, we give an alternative proof of the theorem. Furthermore, we
study the complexity of \probrFixSwap, where the only difference from \probrFix
is that instead of $k$ recolorings we have a budget of $k$ color swaps. We show
that for every $r \geq 3$, the problem \probrFixSwap is $\W[1]$-hard whereas
\probrFix is known to be FPT. Moreover, when $r$ is part of the input, we
observe both \probFix and \probFixSwap are $\W[1]$-hard parameterized by
treewidth. We also study promise variants of the problems, where we are
guaranteed that a proper $r$-coloring $c'$ is indeed obtainable from $c$ by
some finite number of swaps. For instance, we prove that for $r=3$, the
problems \probrFixPromise and \probrFixSwapPromise are $\NP$-hard for planar
graphs. As a consequence of our reduction, the problems cannot be solved in
$2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ time unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails.

 <dc:description>  Capable of automated near real time superpixel detection and quality
assessment in an uncalibrated monitor typical red green blue (RGB) image,
depicted in either true or false colors, an original low level computer vision
(CV) lightweight computer program, called RGB Image Automatic Mapper (RGBIAM),
is designed and implemented. Constrained by the Calibration Validation (CalVal)
requirements of the Quality Assurance Framework for Earth Observation (QA4EO)
guidelines, RGBIAM requires as mandatory an uncalibrated RGB image pre
processing first stage, consisting of an automated statistical model based
color constancy algorithm. The RGBIAM hybrid inference pipeline comprises: (I)
a direct quantitative to nominal (QN) RGB variable transform, where RGB pixel
values are mapped onto a prior dictionary of color names, equivalent to a
static polyhedralization of the RGB cube. Prior color naming is the deductive
counterpart of inductive vector quantization (VQ), whose typical VQ error
function to minimize is a root mean square error (RMSE). In the output multi
level color map domain, superpixels are automatically detected in linear time
as connected sets of pixels featuring the same color label. (II) An inverse
nominal to quantitative (NQ) RGB variable transform, where a superpixelwise
constant RGB image approximation is generated in linear time to assess a VQ
error image. The hybrid direct and inverse RGBIAM QNQ transform is: (i) general
purpose, data and application independent. (ii) Automated, i.e., it requires no
user machine interaction. (iii) Near real time, with a computational complexity
increasing linearly with the image size. (iv) Implemented in tile streaming
mode, to cope with massive images. Collected outcome and process quality
indicators, including degree of automation, computational efficiency, VQ rate
and VQ error, are consistent with theoretical expectations.

 <dc:title>Multi-Objective Software Suite of Two-Dimensional Shape Descriptors for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years two sets of planar (2D) shape attributes, provided with an
intuitive physical meaning, were proposed to the remote sensing community by,
respectively, Nagao &amp; Matsuyama and Shackelford &amp; Davis in their seminal works
on the increasingly popular geographic object based image analysis (GEOBIA)
paradigm. These two published sets of intuitive geometric features were
selected as initial conditions by the present R&amp;D software project, whose
multi-objective goal was to accomplish: (i) a minimally dependent and maximally
informative design (knowledge/information representation) of a general purpose,
user and application independent dictionary of 2D shape terms provided with a
physical meaning intuitive to understand by human end users and (ii) an
effective (accurate, scale invariant, easy to use) and efficient implementation
of 2D shape descriptors. To comply with the Quality Assurance Framework for
Earth Observation guidelines, the proposed suite of geometric functions is
validated by means of a novel quantitative quality assurance policy, centered
on inter feature dependence (causality) assessment. This innovative
multivariate feature validation strategy is alternative to traditional feature
selection procedures based on either inductive data learning classification
accuracy estimation, which is inherently case specific, or cross correlation
estimation, because statistical cross correlation does not imply causation. The
project deliverable is an original general purpose software suite of seven
validated off the shelf 2D shape descriptors intuitive to use. Alternative to
existing commercial or open source software libraries of tens of planar shape
functions whose informativeness remains unknown, it is eligible for use in
(GE)OBIA systems in operating mode, expected to mimic human reasoning based on
a convergence of evidence approach.

 <dc:description>  Multispectral (MS) image panchromatic (PAN) sharpening algorithms proposed to
the remote sensing community are ever increasing in number and variety. Their
aim is to sharpen a coarse spatial resolution MS image with a fine spatial
resolution PAN image acquired simultaneously by a spaceborne or airborne Earth
observation (EO) optical imaging sensor pair. Unfortunately, to date, no
standard evaluation procedure for MS image PAN sharpening outcome and process
is community agreed upon, in contrast with the Quality Assurance Framework for
Earth Observation (QA4EO) guidelines proposed by the intergovernmental Group on
Earth Observations (GEO). In general, process is easier to measure, outcome is
more important. The original contribution of the present study is fourfold.
First, existing procedures for quantitative quality assessment (Q2A) of the
(sole) PAN sharpened MS product are critically reviewed. Their conceptual and
implementation drawbacks are highlighted to be overcome for quality
improvement. Second, a novel (to the best of these authors' knowledge, the
first) protocol for Q2A of MS image PAN sharpening product and process is
designed, implemented and validated by independent means. Third, within this
protocol, an innovative categorization of spectral and spatial image quality
indicators and metrics is presented. Fourth, according to this new taxonomy, an
original third order isotropic multi scale gray level co occurrence matrix
(TIMS GLCM) calculator and a TIMS GLCM texture feature extractor are proposed
to replace popular second order GLCMs.

 <dc:description>  We propose a unifying framework for generalising the Wasserstein-1 metric to
a discrepancy measure between nonnegative measures of different mass. This
generalization inherits the convexity and computational efficiency from the
Wasserstein-1 metric, and it includes several previous approaches from the
literature as special cases. For various specific instances of the generalized
Wasserstein-1 metric we furthermore demonstrate their usefulness in
applications by numerical experiments.

 <dc:title>Joint Optimization of Power Splitting and Allocation for SWIPT in
  Interference Alignment Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Nan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Interference alignment (IA) is a promising solution for interference
management in wireless networks. On the other hand, simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) has become an emerging technique.
Although some works have been done on IA and SWIPT, these two important areas
have traditionally been addressed separately in the literature. In this paper,
we propose to use a common framework to jointly study IA and SWIPT. We analyze
the performance of SWIPT in IA networks. Specifically, we derive the upper
bound of the power that can be harvested in IA networks. In addition, we show
that, to improve the performance of wireless power transfer and information
transmission, users should be dynamically selected as energy harvesting (EH) or
information decoding (ID) terminals. Furthermore, we design two
easy-implemented SWIPT-user selection (SWIPT-US) algorithms in IA networks. To
optimize the ID and EH performance of SWIPT in IA networks, a power-splitting
optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed when power splitters are available,
and its closed-form optimal solutions are derived. Power allocation in the PSO
algorithm is also studied to further optimize the performance. Simulation
results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The paper provides results for the application of boundary feedback control
with Zero-Order-Hold (ZOH) to 1-D linear parabolic systems on bounded domains.
It is shown that the continuous-time boundary feedback applied in a
sample-and-hold fashion guarantees closed-loop exponential stability, provided
that the sampling period is sufficiently small. Two different continuous-time
feedback designs are considered: the reduced model design and the backstepping
design. The obtained results provide stability estimates for weighted 2-norms
of the state and robustness with respect to perturbations of the sampling
schedule is guaranteed.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we consider the joint power and admission control (JPAC)
problem by assuming that only the channel distribution information (CDI) is
available. Under this assumption, we formulate a new chance (probabilistic)
constrained JPAC problem, where the signal to interference plus noise ratio
(SINR) outage probability of the supported links is enforced to be not greater
than a prespecified tolerance. To efficiently deal with the chance SINR
constraint, we employ the sample approximation method to convert them into
finitely many linear constraints. Then, we propose a convex approximation based
deflation algorithm for solving the sample approximation JPAC problem. Compared
to the existing works, this letter proposes a novel two-timescale JPAC
approach, where admission control is performed by the proposed deflation
algorithm based on the CDI in a large timescale and transmission power is
adapted instantly with fast fadings in a small timescale. The effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulations.

 <dc:title>Randomness Evaluation with the Discrete Fourier Transform Test Based on

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problems in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT)
test included in NIST SP 800-22 released by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), which is a collection of tests for evaluating both
physical and pseudo-random number generators for cryptographic applications.
The most crucial problem in the DFT test is that its reference distribution of
the test statistic is not derived mathematically but rather numerically
estimated, the DFT test for randomness is based on a pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG). Therefore, the present DFT test should not be used unless the
reference distribution is mathematically derived. Here, we prove that a power
spectrum, which is a component of the test statistic, follows a chi-squared
distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Based on this fact, we propose a test
whose reference distribution of the test statistic is mathematically derived.
Furthermore, the results of testing non-random sequences and several PRNGs
showed that the proposed test is more reliable and definitely more sensitive
than the present DFT test.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of
economic and pricing models for resource management in cloud networking. To
achieve sustainable profit advantage, cost reduction, and flexibility in
provisioning of cloud resources, resource management in cloud networking
requires adaptive and robust designs to address many issues, e.g., resource
allocation, bandwidth reservation, request allocation, and workload allocation.
Economic and pricing models have received a lot of attention as they can lead
to desirable performance in terms of social welfare, fairness, truthfulness,
profit, user satisfaction, and resource utilization. This paper reviews
applications of the economic and pricing models to develop adaptive algorithms
and protocols for resource management in cloud networking. Besides, we survey a
variety of incentive mechanisms using the pricing strategies in sharing
resources in edge computing. In addition, we consider using pricing models in
cloud-based Software Defined Wireless Networking (cloud-based SDWN). Finally,
we highlight important challenges, open issues and future research directions
of applying economic and pricing models to cloud networking

$\omega$-automata.

 <dc:description>  This paper gives upper and lower bounds on the minimum error probability of
Bayesian $M$-ary hypothesis testing in terms of the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional
entropy of an arbitrary order $\alpha$. The improved tightness of these bounds
over their specialized versions with the Shannon conditional entropy
($\alpha=1$) is demonstrated. In particular, in the case where $M$ is finite,
we show how to generalize Fano's inequality under both the conventional and
list-decision settings. As a counterpart to the generalized Fano's inequality,
allowing $M$ to be infinite, a lower bound on the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional
entropy is derived as a function of the minimum error probability. Explicit
upper and lower bounds on the minimum error probability are obtained as a
function of the Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional entropy for both positive and
negative $\alpha$. Furthermore, we give upper bounds on the minimum error
probability as functions of the R\'enyi divergence. In the setup of discrete
memoryless channels, we analyze the exponentially vanishing decay of the
Arimoto-R\'enyi conditional entropy of the transmitted codeword given the
channel output when averaged over a random coding ensemble.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The secrecy of a distributed-storage system for passwords is studied. The
encoder, Alice, observes a length-n password and describes it using two hints,
which she stores in different locations. The legitimate receiver, Bob, observes
both hints. In one scenario the requirement is that the expected number of
guesses it takes Bob to guess the password approach one as n tends to infinity,
and in the other that the expected size of the shortest list that Bob must form
to guarantee that it contain the password approach one. The eavesdropper, Eve,
sees only one of the hints. Assuming that Alice cannot control which hints Eve
observes, the largest normalized (by n) exponent that can be guaranteed for the
expected number of guesses it takes Eve to guess the password is characterized
for each scenario. Key to the proof are new results on Arikan's guessing and
Bunte and Lapidoth's task-encoding problem; in particular, the paper
establishes a close relation between the two problems. A rate-distortion
version of the model is also discussed, as is a generalization that allows for
Alice to produce {\delta} (not necessarily two) hints, for Bob to observe {\nu}
(not necessarily two) of the hints, and for Eve to observe {\eta} (not
necessarily one) of the hints. The generalized model is robust against {\delta}
- {\nu} disk failures.

 <dc:description>  Differential (Ore) type polynomials with &quot;approximate&quot; polynomial
coefficients are introduced. These provide an effective notion of approximate
differential operators, with a strong algebraic structure. We introduce the
approximate Greatest Common Right Divisor Problem (GCRD) of differential
polynomials, as a non-commutative generalization of the well-studied
approximate GCD problem.
  Given two differential polynomials, we present an algorithm to find nearby
differential polynomials with a non-trivial GCRD, where nearby is defined with
respect to a suitable coefficient norm. Intuitively, given two linear
differential polynomials as input, the (approximate) GCRD problem corresponds
to finding the (approximate) differential polynomial whose solution space is
the intersection of the solution spaces of the two inputs.
  The approximate GCRD problem is proven to be locally well-posed. A method
based on the singular value decomposition of a differential Sylvester matrix is
developed to produce an initial approximation of the GCRD. With a sufficiently
good initial approximation, Newton iteration is shown to converge quadratically
to an optimal solution. Finally, sufficient conditions for existence of a
solution to the global problem are presented along with examples demonstrating
that no solution exists when these conditions are not satisfied.

 <dc:title>MS and PAN image fusion by combining Brovey and wavelet methods</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>68U10</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Among the existing fusion algorithms, the wavelet fusion method is the most
frequently discussed one in recent publications because the wavelet approach
preserves the spectral characteristics of the multispectral image better than
other methods. The Brovey is also a popular fusion method used for its ability
in preserving the spatial information of the PAN image. This study presents a
new fusion approach that integrates the advantages of both the Brovey (which
preserves a high degree of spatial information) and the wavelet (which
preserves a high degree of spectral information) techniques to reduce the
colour distortion of fusion results. Visual and statistical analyzes show that
the proposed algorithm clearly improves the merging quality in terms of:
correlation coefficient and UIQI; compared to fusion methods including, IHS,
Brovey, PCA , HPF, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and a-trous wavelet.

 <dc:description>  The energy of a graph G is equal to the sum of absolute values of the
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of G, whereas the Laplacian energy of a
graph G is equal to the sum of the absolute value of the difference between the
eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of G and average degree of the vertices of
G. Motivated by the work from Sharafdini et al. [R. Sharafdini, H. Panahbar,
Vertex weighted Laplacian graph energy and other topological indices. J. Math.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider coding of short data frames (192 bits) by IRA
codes. A new interleaver for the IRA codes based on a Gruenbaum graph is
proposed. The difference of the proposed algorithm from known methods consists
in the following: permutation is performed by using a match smaller interleaver
which is derived from the Gruenbaum graph by finding in this graph a
Hamiltonian path, enumerating the passed vertices in ascending order and
passing them again in the permuted order through the edges which are not
included in the Hamiltonian path. For the IRA code the obtained interleaver
provides 0.7-0.8 db gain over a convolutional code decoded by Viterbi
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Full-duplex is a promising technology and great system performance
enhancement can be achieved especially when we apply it to base stations. In
this paper, we consider a Multi-User OFDMA network consisting of one
Full-duplex base station, several uplink users, and a number of downlink users.
A joint subcarrier, downlink user and uplink user mapping and power allocation
optimization problem is investigated. In detail, we first decompose the
3-dimensional mapping problem into three 2-dimensional sub-problems and solve
them by iteratively using classical Hungarian Method. Then, based on the dual
method, we sequentially solve the power allocation and 3-dimensional mapping
problem at each dual point. And the optimal solution to the dual problem is
derived by using sub-gradient method. Unlike existing methods that only solve
one sub-problem but with a high computation complexity, we tackle both of them
and successfully reducing computation complexity from exponential to polynomial
order. Numerical simulations are conducted to verify the proposed system.

 <dc:description>  This paper is focuses on the computation of the positive moments of one-side
correlated random Gram matrices. Closed-form expressions for the moments can be
obtained easily, but numerical evaluation thereof is prone to numerical
stability, especially in high-dimensional settings. This letter provides a
numerically stable method that efficiently computes the positive moments in
closed-form. The developed expressions are more accurate and can lead to higher
accuracy levels when fed to moment based-approaches. As an application, we show
how the obtained moments can be used to approximate the marginal distribution
of the eigenvalues of random Gram matrices.

 <dc:description>  One of the main challenges in Recommender Systems (RSs) is the New User
problem which happens when the system has to generate personalised
recommendations for a new user whom the system has no information about. Active
Learning tries to solve this problem by acquiring user preference data with the
maximum quality, and with the minimum acquisition cost. Although there are
variety of works in active learning for RSs research area, almost all of them
have focused only on the single-domain recommendation scenario. However,
several real-world RSs operate in the cross-domain scenario, where the system
generates recommendations in the target domain by exploiting user preferences
in both the target and auxiliary domains. In such a scenario, the performance
of active learning strategies can be significantly influenced and typical
active learning strategies may fail to perform properly. In this paper, we
address this limitation, by evaluating active learning strategies in a novel
evaluation framework, explicitly suited for the cross-domain recommendation
scenario. We show that having access to the preferences of the users in the
auxiliary domain may have a huge impact on the performance of active learning
strategies w.r.t. the classical, single-domain scenario.

 <dc:title>Multi-level Representations for Fine-Grained Typing of Knowledge Base

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Entities are essential elements of natural language. In this paper, we
present methods for learning multi-level representations of entities on three
complementary levels: character (character patterns in entity names extracted,
e.g., by neural networks), word (embeddings of words in entity names) and
entity (entity embeddings). We investigate state-of-the-art learning methods on
each level and find large differences, e.g., for deep learning models,
traditional ngram features and the subword model of fasttext (Bojanowski et
al., 2016) on the character level; for word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the
word level; and for the order-aware model wang2vec (Ling et al., 2015a) on the
entity level. We confirm experimentally that each level of representation
contributes complementary information and a joint representation of all three
levels improves the existing embedding based baseline for fine-grained entity
typing by a large margin. Additionally, we show that adding information from
entity descriptions further improves multi-level representations of entities.

 <dc:title>Finding Network Motifs in Large Graphs using Compression as a Measure of
  Relevance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bloem, Peter</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>de Rooij, Steven</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new method for finding network motifs: interesting or
informative subgraph patterns in a network. Current methods for finding motifs
rely on the frequency of the motif: specifically, subgraphs are motifs when
their frequency in the data is high compared to the expected frequency under a
null model. To compute this expectation, the search for motifs is normally
repeated on as many as 1000 random graphs sampled from the null model; a
prohibitively expensive step. We use ideas from the Minimum Description Length
(MDL) literature to define a new measure of motif relevance, and a new
algorithm for detecting motifs. Our method allows motif analysis to scale to
networks with billions of links, while still resulting in informative motifs.

 <dc:title>An open shop approach in approximating optimal data transmission

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the past decade Optical WDM Networks (Wavelength Division Multiplexing)
are being used quite often and especially as far as broadband applications are
concerned. Message packets transmitted through such networks can be interrupted
using time slots in order to maximize network usage and minimize the time
required for all messages to reach their destination. However, preempting a
packet will result in time cost. The problem of scheduling message packets
through such a network is referred to as PBS and is known to be NP-Hard. In
this paper we have reduced PBS to Open Shop Scheduling and designed variations
of polynomially solvable instances of Open Shop to approximate PBS. We have
combined these variations and called the induced algorithm HSA (Hybridic
Scheduling Algorithm). We ran experiments to establish the efficiency of HSA
and found that in all datasets used it produces schedules very close to the
optimal. To further establish HSAs efficiency we ran tests to compare it to
SGA, another algorithm which when tested in the past has yielded excellent
results.

 <dc:description>  As power systems become more and more interconnected, the inter-area
oscillations has become a serious factor limiting large power transfer among
different areas. Underdamped (Undamped) inter-area oscillations may cause
system breakup and even lead to large-scale blackout. Traditional damping
controllers include Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and Flexible AC Transmission
System (FACTS) controller, which adds additional damping to the inter-area
oscillation modes by affecting the real power in an indirect manner. However,
the effectiveness of these controllers is restricted to the neighborhood of a
prescribed set of operating conditions. In this paper, decentralized robust
controllers are developed to improve the damping ratios of the inter-area
oscillation modes by directly affecting the real power through the turbine
governing system. The proposed control strategy requires only local signals and
is robust to the variations in operation condition and system topology. The
effectiveness of the proposed robust controllers is illustrated by detailed
case studies on two different test systems.

 <dc:title>&quot;The Capacity of the Relay Channel&quot;: Solution to Cover's Problem in the

 <dc:description>  Consider a memoryless relay channel, where the relay is connected to the
destination with an isolated bit pipe of capacity $C_0$. Let $C(C_0)$ denote
the capacity of this channel as a function of $C_0$. What is the critical value
of $C_0$ such that $C(C_0)$ first equals $C(\infty)$? This is a long-standing
open problem posed by Cover and named &quot;The Capacity of the Relay Channel,&quot; in
\emph{Open Problems in Communication and Computation}, Springer-Verlag, 1987.
In this paper, we answer this question in the Gaussian case and show that
$C(C_0)$ can not equal to $C(\infty)$ unless $C_0=\infty$, regardless of the
SNR of the Gaussian channels. Our proof significantly deviates from the typical
converse program in network information theory, which focuses on
&quot;single-letterizing&quot; expressions involving information measures in a
high-dimensional space (so called $n$-letter forms). Instead, we develop a
geometric technique that allows us to directly quantify the interplay between
$n$-letter information measures. Our key geometric ingredient is a
strengthening of the classical isoperimetric inequality on the sphere, which we
develop using the Riesz rearrangement inequality.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Blocking objects (blockages) between a transmitter and receiver cause
wireless communication links to transition from line-of-sight (LOS) to
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, which can greatly reduce the received
power, particularly at higher frequencies such as millimeter wave (mmWave). We
consider a cellular network in which a mobile user attempts to connect to two
or more base stations (BSs) simultaneously, to increase the probability of at
least one LOS link, which is a form of macrodiversity. We develop a framework
for determining the LOS probability as a function of the number of BSs, when
taking into account the correlation between blockages: for example, a single
blockage close to the device -- including the user's own body -- could block
multiple BSs. We consider the impact of the size of blocking objects on the
system reliability probability and show that macrodiversity gains are higher
when the blocking objects are small. We also show that the BS density must
scale as the square of the blockage density to maintain a given level of
reliability.

 <dc:title>Tunable GMM Kernels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Ping</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The recently proposed &quot;generalized min-max&quot; (GMM) kernel can be efficiently
linearized, with direct applications in large-scale statistical learning and
fast near neighbor search. The linearized GMM kernel was extensively compared
in with linearized radial basis function (RBF) kernel. On a large number of
classification tasks, the tuning-free GMM kernel performs (surprisingly) well
compared to the best-tuned RBF kernel. Nevertheless, one would naturally expect
that the GMM kernel ought to be further improved if we introduce tuning
parameters.
  In this paper, we study three simple constructions of tunable GMM kernels:
(i) the exponentiated-GMM (or eGMM) kernel, (ii) the powered-GMM (or pGMM)
kernel, and (iii) the exponentiated-powered-GMM (epGMM) kernel. The pGMM kernel
can still be efficiently linearized by modifying the original hashing procedure
for the GMM kernel. On about 60 publicly available classification datasets, we
verify that the proposed tunable GMM kernels typically improve over the
original GMM kernel. On some datasets, the improvements can be astonishingly
significant.
  For example, on 11 popular datasets which were used for testing deep learning
algorithms and tree methods, our experiments show that the proposed tunable GMM
kernels are strong competitors to trees and deep nets. The previous studies
developed tree methods including &quot;abc-robust-logitboost&quot; and demonstrated the
excellent performance on those 11 datasets (and other datasets), by
establishing the second-order tree-split formula and new derivatives for
multi-class logistic loss. Compared to tree methods like
&quot;abc-robust-logitboost&quot; (which are slow and need substantial model sizes), the
tunable GMM kernels produce largely comparable results.

 <dc:description>  Recent research has shown the usefulness of using collective user interaction
data (e.g., query logs) to recommend query modification suggestions for
Intranet search. However, most of the query suggestion approaches for Intranet
search follow an &quot;one size fits all&quot; strategy, whereby different users who
submit an identical query would get the same query suggestion list. This is
problematic, as even with the same query, different users may have different
topics of interest, which may change over time in response to the user's
interaction with the system. We address the problem by proposing a personalised
query suggestion framework for Intranet search. For each search session, we
construct two temporal user profiles: a click user profile using the user's
clicked documents and a query user profile using the user's submitted queries.
We then use the two profiles to re-rank the non-personalised query suggestion
list returned by a state-of-the-art query suggestion method for Intranet
search. Experimental results on a large-scale query logs collection show that
our personalised framework significantly improves the quality of suggested
queries.

procedures for certain class of quantum secret sharing are known to work

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework, the coupled compound Poisson factorization
(CCPF), to capture the missing-data mechanism in extremely sparse data sets by
coupling a hierarchical Poisson factorization with an arbitrary data-generating
model. We derive a stochastic variational inference algorithm for the resulting
model and, as examples of our framework, implement three different
data-generating models---a mixture model, linear regression, and factor
analysis---to robustly model non-random missing data in the context of
clustering, prediction, and matrix factorization. In all three cases, we test
our framework against models that ignore the missing-data mechanism on large
scale studies with non-random missing data, and we show that explicitly
modeling the missing-data mechanism substantially improves the quality of the
results, as measured using data log likelihood on a held-out test set.

 <dc:description>  We present OpenRBC, a coarse-grained molecular dynamics code, which is
capable of performing an unprecedented in silico experiment --- simulating an
entire mammal red blood cell lipid bilayer and cytoskeleton as modeled by 4
million mesoscopic particles --- using a single shared memory commodity
workstation. To achieve this, we invented an adaptive spatial-searching
algorithm to accelerate the computation of short-range pairwise interactions in
an extremely sparse 3D space. The algorithm is based on a Voronoi partitioning
of the point cloud of coarse-grained particles, and is continuously updated
over the course of the simulation. The algorithm enables the construction of
the key spatial searching data structure in our code, i.e. a lattice-free cell
list, with a time and space cost linearly proportional to the number of
particles in the system. The position and shape of the cells also adapt
automatically to the local density and curvature. The code implements OpenMP
parallelization and scales to hundreds of hardware threads. It outperforms a
legacy simulator by almost an order of magnitude in time-to-solution and more
than 40 times in problem size, thus providing a new platform for probing the
biomechanics of red blood cells.

 <dc:title>The Flow of Information in Interactive Quantum Protocols: the Cost of
  Forgetting</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the context of two-party interactive quantum communication protocols, we
study a recently defined notion of quantum information cost (QIC), which
possesses most of the important properties of its classical analogue. Although
this definition has the advantage to be valid for fully quantum inputs and
tasks, its interpretation for classical tasks remained rather obscure. Also,
the link between this new notion and other notions of information cost for
quantum protocols that had previously appeared in the literature was not clear,
if existent at all.
  We settle both these issues: for quantum communication with classical inputs,
we provide an alternate characterization of QIC in terms of information about
the input registers, avoiding any reference to the notion of a purification of
the classical input state. We provide an exact operational interpretation of
this alternative characterization as the sum of the cost of transmitting
information about the classical inputs and the cost of forgetting information
about these inputs. To obtain this characterization, we prove a general lemma,
the Information Flow Lemma, assessing exactly the transfer of information in
general interactive quantum processes. Furthermore, we clarify the link between
QIC and IC of classical protocols by simulating quantumly classical protocols.
  Finally, we apply these concepts to argue that any quantum protocol that does
not forget information solves Disjointness on n-bits in Omega (n)
communication, completely losing the quadratic quantum speedup. This provides a
specific sense in which forgetting information is a necessary feature of
interactive quantum protocols. We also apply these concepts to prove that QIC
at zero-error is exactly n for the Inner Product function, and n (1 - o(1)) for
a random Boolean function on n+n bits.

 <dc:description>  In the social, behavioral, and economic sciences, it is an important problem
to predict which individual opinions will eventually dominate in a large
population, if there will be a consensus, and how long it takes a consensus to
form. This idea has been studied heavily both in physics and in other
disciplines, and the answer depends strongly on both the model for opinions and
for the network structure on which the opinions evolve. One model that was
created to study consensus formation quantitatively is the Deffuant model, in
which the opinion distribution of a population evolves via sequential random
pairwise encounters. To consider the heterogeneity of interactions in a
population due to social influence, we study the Deffuant model on various
network structures (deterministic synthetic networks, random synthetic
networks, and social networks constructed from Facebook data) using several
interaction mechanisms. We numerically simulate the Deffuant model and conduct
regression analyses to investigate the dependence of the convergence time to
equilibrium on parameters, including a confidence bound for opinion updates,
the number of participating entities, and their willingness to compromise. We
find that network structure and parameter values both have an effect on the
convergence time, and for some network topologies, the convergence time
undergoes a transition at a critical value of the confidence bound. We discuss
the number of opinion groups that form at equilibrium in terms of a
confidence-bound threshold for a transition from consensus to multiple-opinion
equilibria.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on the personalized response generation for
conversational systems. Based on the sequence to sequence learning, especially
the encoder-decoder framework, we propose a two-phase approach, namely
initialization then adaptation, to model the responding style of human and then
generate personalized responses. For evaluation, we propose a novel human aided
method to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generation
models by online real-time conversation and offline human judgement. Moreover,
the lexical divergence of the responses generated by the 5 personalized models
indicates that the proposed two-phase approach achieves good results on
modeling the responding style of human and generating personalized responses
for the conversational systems.

 <dc:description>  Recently, linear codes constructed from defining sets have been studied
extensively. They may have nice parameters if the defining set is chosen
properly. Let $ m &gt;2$ be a positive integer. For an odd prime $ p $, let $
r=p^m $ and $\text{Tr}$ be the absolute trace function from $\mathbb{F}_r$ onto
$\mathbb{F}_p$. In this paper, we give a construction of linear codes by
defining the code $ C_{D}=\{(\mathrm{Tr}(ax))_{x\in D}: a \in \mathbb{F}_{r}
\}, $ where $ D =\left\{x\in \mathbb{F}_{r} : \mathrm{Tr}(x)=1,
\mathrm{Tr}(x^2)=0 \right\}. $ Its complete weight enumerator and weight
enumerator are determined explicitly by employing cyclotomic numbers and Gauss
sums. In addition, we obtain several optimal linear codes with a few weights.
They have higher rate compared with other codes, which enables them to have
essential applications in areas such as association schemes and secret sharing
schemes.

 <dc:title>A Review of Localization and Tracking Algorithms in Wireless Sensor

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a comprehensive survey of the pioneer as well as the state
of-the-art localization and tracking methods in the wireless sensor networks is
presented. Localization is mostly applicable for the static sensor nodes,
whereas, tracking for the mobile sensor nodes. The localization algorithms are
broadly classified as range-based and range-free methods. The estimated range
(distance) between an anchor and an unknown node is highly erroneous in an
indoor scenario. This limitation can be handled up to a large extent by
employing a large number of existing access points (APs) in the range free
localization method. Recent works emphasize on the use multi-sensor data like
magnetic, inertial, compass, gyroscope, ultrasound, infrared, visual and/or
odometer to improve the localization accuracy further. Additionally, tracking
method does the future prediction of location based on the past location
history. A smooth trajectory is noted even if some of the received measurements
are erroneous. Real experimental set-ups such as National Instruments (NI)
wireless sensor nodes, Crossbow motes and hand-held devices for carrying out
the localization and tracking are also highlighted herein.

 <dc:title>A Decentralized Optimization Framework for Energy Harvesting Devices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Biason, Alessandro</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Designing decentralized policies for wireless communication networks is a
crucial problem, which has only been partially solved in the literature so far.
In this paper, we propose the Decentralized Markov Decision Process (Dec-MDP)
framework to analyze a wireless sensor network with multiple users which access
a common wireless channel. We consider devices with energy harvesting
capabilities, so that they aim at balancing the energy arrivals with the data
departures and with the probability of colliding with other nodes. Randomly
over time, an access point triggers a SYNC slot, wherein it recomputes the
optimal transmission parameters of the whole network, and distributes this
information. Every node receives its own policy, which specifies how it should
access the channel in the future, and, thereafter, proceeds in a fully
decentralized fashion, without interacting with other entities in the network.
We propose a multi-layer Markov model, where an external MDP manages the jumps
between SYNC slots, and an internal Dec-MDP computes the optimal policy in the
near future. We numerically show that, because of the harvesting, a fully
orthogonal scheme (e.g., TDMA-like) is suboptimal in energy harvesting
scenarios, and the optimal trade-off lies between an orthogonal and a random
access system.

 <dc:title>On Achievable Rates of AWGN Energy-Harvesting Channels with Block Energy
  Arrival and Non-Vanishing Error Probabilities</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the achievable rates of an additive white Gaussian
noise (AWGN) energy-harvesting (EH) channel with an infinite battery. The EH
process is characterized by a sequence of blocks of harvested energy, which is
known causally at the source. The harvested energy remains constant within a
block while the harvested energy across different blocks is characterized by a
sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.
The blocks have length $L$, which can be interpreted as the coherence time of
the energy arrival process. If $L$ is a constant or grows sublinearly in the
blocklength $n$, we fully characterize the first-order term in the asymptotic
expansion of the maximum transmission rate subject to a fixed tolerable error
probability $\varepsilon$. The first-order term is known as the
$\varepsilon$-capacity. In addition, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the
second-order term in the asymptotic expansion, which reveal that the second
order term scales as $\sqrt{\frac{L}{n}}$ for any $\varepsilon$ less than
$1/2$. The lower bound is obtained through analyzing the save-and-transmit
strategy. If $L$ grows linearly in $n$, we obtain lower and upper bounds on the
$\varepsilon$-capacity, which coincide whenever the cumulative distribution
function (cdf) of the EH random variable is continuous and strictly increasing.
In order to achieve the lower bound, we have proposed a novel adaptive
save-and-transmit strategy, which chooses different save-and-transmit codes
across different blocks according to the energy variation across the blocks.

 <dc:description>  The recent work of Gatys et al., who characterized the style of an image by
the statistics of convolutional neural network filters, ignited a renewed
interest in the texture generation and image stylization problems. While their
image generation technique uses a slow optimization process, recently several
authors have proposed to learn generator neural networks that can produce
similar outputs in one quick forward pass. While generator networks are
promising, they are still inferior in visual quality and diversity compared to
generation-by-optimization. In this work, we advance them in two significant
ways. First, we introduce an instance normalization module to replace batch
normalization with significant improvements to the quality of image
stylization. Second, we improve diversity by introducing a new learning
formulation that encourages generators to sample unbiasedly from the Julesz
texture ensemble, which is the equivalence class of all images characterized by
certain filter responses. Together, these two improvements take feed forward
texture synthesis and image stylization much closer to the quality of
generation-via-optimization, while retaining the speed advantage.

 <dc:description>  Knapik et al. introduced the safety restriction which constrains both the
types and syntax of the production rules defining a higher-order recursion
scheme. This restriction gives rise to an equi-expressivity result between
order-n pushdown automata and order-n safe recursion schemes, when such devices
are used as tree generators. We show that the typing constraint of safety,
called homogeneity, is unnecessary in the sense that imposing the syntactic
restriction alone is sufficient to prove the equi-expressivity result for

 <dc:description>  Consider a channel with a given input distribution. Our aim is to degrade it
to a channel with at most L output letters. One such degradation method is the
so called &quot;greedy-merge&quot; algorithm. We derive an upper bound on the reduction
in mutual information between input and output. For fixed input alphabet size
and variable L, the upper bound is within a constant factor of an
algorithm-independent lower bound. Thus, we establish that greedy-merge is
optimal in the power-law sense.

 <dc:title>Differentially Private Neighborhood-based Recommender Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Privacy issues of recommender systems have become a hot topic for the society
as such systems are appearing in every corner of our life. In contrast to the
fact that many secure multi-party computation protocols have been proposed to
prevent information leakage in the process of recommendation computation, very
little has been done to restrict the information leakage from the
recommendation results. In this paper, we apply the differential privacy
concept to neighborhood-based recommendation methods (NBMs) under a
probabilistic framework. We first present a solution, by directly calibrating
Laplace noise into the training process, to differential-privately find the
maximum a posteriori parameters similarity. Then we connect differential
privacy to NBMs by exploiting a recent observation that sampling from the
scaled posterior distribution of a Bayesian model results in provably
differentially private systems. Our experiments show that both solutions allow
promising accuracy with a modest privacy budget, and the second solution yields
better accuracy if the sampling asymptotically converges. We also compare our
solutions to the recent differentially private matrix factorization (MF)
recommender systems, and show that our solutions achieve better accuracy when
the privacy budget is reasonably small. This is an interesting result because
MF systems often offer better accuracy when differential privacy is not
applied.

 <dc:title>Discrete approximations of the affine Gaussian derivative model for
  visual receptive fields</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lindeberg, Tony</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The affine Gaussian derivative model can in several respects be regarded as a
canonical model for receptive fields over a spatial image domain: (i) it can be
derived by necessity from scale-space axioms that reflect structural properties
of the world, (ii) it constitutes an excellent model for the receptive fields
of simple cells in the primary visual cortex and (iii) it is covariant under
affine image deformations, which enables more accurate modelling of image
measurements under the local image deformations caused by the perspective
mapping, compared to the more commonly used Gaussian derivative model based on
derivatives of the rotationally symmetric Gaussian kernel.
  This paper presents a theory for discretizing the affine Gaussian scale-space
concept underlying the affine Gaussian derivative model, so that scale-space
properties hold also for the discrete implementation.
  Two ways of discretizing spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels are
presented: (i) by solving semi-discretized affine diffusion equation, which has
derived by necessity from the requirements of a semi-group structure over scale
as parameterized by a family of spatial covariance matrices and obeying
non-creation of new structures from any finer to any coarser scale in terms of
non-enhancement of local extrema and (ii) approximating these semi-discrete
affine receptive fields by parameterized families of 3x3-kernels as obtained
from an additional discretization along the scale direction. The latter
discrete approach can be optionally complemented by spatial subsampling at
coarser scales, leading to the notion of affine hybrid pyramids.
  Using these theoretical results, we outline hybrid architectures for discrete
approximations of affine covariant receptive field families, to be used as a
first processing layer for affine covariant and affine invariant visual
operations at higher levels.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have been developed drawing inspiration from the brain
visual pathway, implementing an end-to-end approach: from image data to video
object classes. However building an fMRI decoder with the typical structure of
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), i.e. learning multiple level of
representations, seems impractical due to lack of brain data. As a possible
solution, this work presents the first hybrid fMRI and deep features decoding
approach: collected fMRI and deep learnt representations of video object
classes are linked together by means of Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis.
In decoding, this allows exploiting the discriminatory power of CNN by relating
the fMRI representation to the last layer of CNN (fc7). We show the
effectiveness of embedding fMRI data onto a subspace related to deep features
in distinguishing semantic visual categories based solely on brain imaging
data.

 <dc:description>  Light field cameras capture the 3D information in a scene with a single
exposure. This special feature makes light field cameras very appealing for a
variety of applications: from post-capture refocus, to depth estimation and
image-based rendering. However, light field cameras suffer by design from
strong limitations in their spatial resolution, which should therefore be
augmented by computational methods. On the one hand, off-the-shelf single-frame
and multi-frame super-resolution algorithms are not ideal for light field data,
as they do not consider its particular structure. On the other hand, the few
super-resolution algorithms explicitly tailored for light field data exhibit
significant limitations, such as the need to estimate an explicit disparity map
at each view. In this work we propose a new light field super-resolution
algorithm meant to address these limitations. We adopt a multi-frame alike
super-resolution approach, where the complementary information in the different
light field views is used to augment the spatial resolution of the whole light
field. We show that coupling the multi-frame approach with a graph regularizer,
that enforces the light field structure via nonlocal self similarities, permits
to avoid the costly and challenging disparity estimation step for all the
views. Extensive experiments show that the new algorithm compares favorably to
the other state-of-the-art methods for light field super-resolution, both in
terms of PSNR and visual quality.

 <dc:description>  Intrusion detection has attracted a considerable interest from researchers
and industries. The community, after many years of research, still faces the
problem of building reliable and efficient IDS that are capable of handling
large quantities of data, with changing patterns in real time situations. The
work presented in this manuscript classifies intrusion detection systems (IDS).
Moreover, a taxonomy and survey of shallow and deep networks intrusion
detection systems is presented based on previous and current works. This
taxonomy and survey reviews machine learning techniques and their performance
in detecting anomalies. Feature selection which influences the effectiveness of
machine learning (ML) IDS is discussed to explain the role of feature selection
in the classification and training phase of ML IDS. Finally, a discussion of
the false and true positive alarm rates is presented to help researchers model
reliable and efficient machine learning based intrusion detection systems.

 <dc:title>Task-Specific Attentive Pooling of Phrase Alignments Contributes to

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work studies comparatively two typical sentence matching tasks: textual
entailment (TE) and answer selection (AS), observing that weaker phrase
alignments are more critical in TE, while stronger phrase alignments deserve
more attention in AS. The key to reach this observation lies in phrase
detection, phrase representation, phrase alignment, and more importantly how to
connect those aligned phrases of different matching degrees with the final
classifier. Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase generation and
representation, or (ii) conducts alignment at word and phrase levels by
handcrafted features or (iii) utilizes a single framework of alignment without
considering the characteristics of specific tasks, which limits the framework's
effectiveness across tasks. We propose an architecture based on Gated Recurrent
Unit that supports (i) representation learning of phrases of arbitrary
granularity and (ii) task-specific attentive pooling of phrase alignments
between two sentences. Experimental results on TE and AS match our observation
and show the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:title>An SDN Approach for an Energy Efficient Heterogeneous Communication
  Network in Disaster Scenarios</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Wireless access technologies have been extensively developed aiming to give
users the ability to connect to their expected networks anytime, anywhere. This
leads to an increment of the number of wireless interfaces integrated into a
single mobile device, hence, it allows the device to be able to connect to
multiple access networks. However, in some specific cases such as natural
disasters, having an uncorrupted and timely information exchanging means is
critical for affected victims to survive or to connect to the outside world.
This is because the essential network infrastructures in these cases could be
destroyed causing a large number of systems to stop working. In that cases, the
victims need a heterogeneous communications network in which they can
communicate, without a doubt, by using different wireless access technologies,
i.e., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The network must also be able to smoothly change the
access technologies, or called a vertical handover, to ensure QoS for ongoing
applications. In addition, the network must have a mechanism to save energy.
For hese reasons, an SDN approach, which has been proposed in a previous work,
is considered. The performance of the system has been validated by a set of
experiments in a real testbed. The obtained results show that the proposed
vertical handover can save at least 24.42 per cent of the energy consumed by
the wireless communication. The handover delay with different UDP traffic is
less than 150ms. Moreover, the network allows a device using Bluetooth to talk
with another one using Wi-Fi over a heterogeneous connection where the
end-to-end jitter is mainly below 20ms and the packet loss rate is as small as
0.2 per cent.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the work that has been done in the design and
development of a wireless OBD II fleet management system. The system aims to
measure speed, distance and fuel consumption of vehicles for tracking and
analysis purposes. An OBD II reader is designed to measure speed and mass air
flow, from which distance and fuel consumption are also computed. This data is
then transmitted via WiFi to a remote server. The system also implements GPS
tracking to determine the location of the vehicle. A database management system
is implemented at the remote server for the storage and management of
transmitted data and a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for
analysing the transmitted data . Various qualification tests are conducted to
verify the functionality of the system. The results demonstrate that the system
is capable of reading the various parameters, and can successfully process,
transmit and display the readings.

 <dc:description>  The \emph{Orbit Problem} consists of determining, given a linear
transformation $A$ on $\mathbb{Q}^d$, together with vectors $x$ and $y$,
whether the orbit of $x$ under repeated applications of $A$ can ever reach $y$.
This problem was famously shown to be decidable by Kannan and Lipton in the
1980s.
  In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of synthesising suitable
\emph{invariants} $\mathcal{P} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, \emph{i.e.}, sets that
are stable under $A$ and contain $x$ and not $y$, thereby providing compact and
versatile certificates of non-reachability. We show that whether a given
instance of the Orbit Problem admits a semialgebraic invariant is decidable,
and moreover in positive instances we provide an algorithm to synthesise
suitable invariants of polynomial size.
  It is worth noting that the existence of \emph{semilinear} invariants, on the
other hand, is (to the best of our knowledge) not known to be decidable.

 <dc:description>  One of the main problems that emerges in the classic approach to semantics is
the difficulty in acquisition and maintenance of ontologies and semantic
annotations. On the other hand, the Internet explosion and the massive
diffusion of mobile smart devices lead to the creation of a worldwide system,
which information is daily checked and fueled by the contribution of millions
of users who interacts in a collaborative way. Search engines, continually
exploring the Web, are a natural source of information on which to base a
modern approach to semantic annotation. A promising idea is that it is possible
to generalize the semantic similarity, under the assumption that semantically
similar terms behave similarly, and define collaborative proximity measures
based on the indexing information returned by search engines. The PMING
Distance is a proximity measure used in data mining and information retrieval,
which collaborative information express the degree of relationship between two
terms, using only the number of documents returned as result for a query on a
search engine. In this work, the PMINIG Distance is updated, providing a novel
formal algebraic definition, which corrects previous works. The novel point of
view underlines the features of the PMING to be a locally normalized linear
combination of the Pointwise Mutual Information and Normalized Google Distance.
The analyzed measure dynamically reflects the collaborative change made on the
web resources.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art techniques for 6D object pose recovery depend on
occlusion-free point clouds to accurately register objects in 3D space. To deal
with this shortcoming, we introduce a novel architecture called Iterative Hough
Forest with Histogram of Control Points that is capable of estimating the 6D
pose of occluded and cluttered objects given a candidate 2D bounding box. Our
Iterative Hough Forest (IHF) is learnt using parts extracted only from the
positive samples. These parts are represented with Histogram of Control Points
(HoCP), a &quot;scale-variant&quot; implicit volumetric description, which we derive from
recently introduced Implicit B-Splines (IBS). The rich discriminative
information provided by the scale-variant HoCP features is leveraged during
inference. An automatic variable size part extraction framework iteratively
refines the object's initial pose that is roughly aligned due to the extraction
of coarsest parts, the ones occupying the largest area in image pixels. The
iterative refinement is accomplished based on finer (smaller) parts that are
represented with more discriminative control point descriptors by using our
Iterative Hough Forest. Experiments conducted on a publicly available dataset
report that our approach show better registration performance than the
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Games with Costs and Delays</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zimmermann, Martin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We demonstrate the usefulness of adding delay to infinite games with
quantitative winning conditions. In a delay game, one of the players may delay
her moves to obtain a lookahead on her opponent's moves. We show that
determining the winner of delay games with winning conditions given by parity
automata with costs is EXPTIME-complete and that exponential bounded lookahead
is both sufficient and in general necessary. Thus, although the parity
condition with costs is a quantitative extension of the parity condition, our
results show that adding costs does not increase the complexity of delay games
with parity conditions.
  Furthermore, we study a new phenomenon that appears in quantitative delay
games: lookahead can be traded for the quality of winning strategies and vice
versa. We determine the extent of this tradeoff. In particular, even the
smallest lookahead allows to improve the quality of an optimal strategy from
the worst possible value to almost the smallest possible one. Thus, the benefit
of introducing lookahead is twofold: not only does it allow the delaying player
to win games she would lose without, but lookahead also allows her to improve
the quality of her winning strategies in games she wins even without lookahead.

 <dc:description>  Cognitive computing systems require human labeled data for evaluation, and
often for training. The standard practice used in gathering this data minimizes
disagreement between annotators, and we have found this results in data that
fails to account for the ambiguity inherent in language. We have proposed the
CrowdTruth method for collecting ground truth through crowdsourcing, that
reconsiders the role of people in machine learning based on the observation
that disagreement between annotators provides a useful signal for phenomena
such as ambiguity in the text. We report on using this method to build an
annotated data set for medical relation extraction for the $cause$ and $treat$
relations, and how this data performed in a supervised training experiment. We
demonstrate that by modeling ambiguity, labeled data gathered from crowd
workers can (1) reach the level of quality of domain experts for this task
while reducing the cost, and (2) provide better training data at scale than
distant supervision. We further propose and validate new weighted measures for
precision, recall, and F-measure, that account for ambiguity in both human and
machine performance on this task.

 <dc:description>  A homomorphism from a graph G to a graph H is a vertex mapping f from the
vertex set of G to the vertex set of H such that there is an edge between
vertices f(u) and f(v) of H whenever there is an edge between vertices u and v
of G. The H-Colouring problem is to decide whether or not a graph G allows a
homomorphism to a fixed graph H. We continue a study on a variant of this
problem, namely the Surjective H-Colouring problem, which imposes the
homomorphism to be vertex-surjective. We build upon previous results and show
that this problem is NP-complete for every connected graph H that has exactly
two vertices with a self-loop as long as these two vertices are not adjacent.
As a result, we can classify the computational complexity of Surjective
H-Colouring for every graph H on at most four vertices.

 <dc:description>  XML data sources are more and more gaining popularity in the context of a
wide family of Business Intelligence (BI) and On-Line Analytical Processing
(OLAP) applications, due to the amenities of XML in representing and managing
semi-structured and complex multidimensional data. As a consequence, many XML
data warehouse models have been proposed during past years in order to handle
hetero-geneity and complexity of multidimensional data in a way traditional
relational data warehouse approaches fail to achieve. However, XML-native
database systems currently suffer from limited performance, both in terms of
volumes of manageable data and query response time. Therefore , recent research
efforts are focusing the attention on fragmentation techniques, which are able
to overcome the limitations above. Derived horizontal fragmentation is already
used in relational data warehouses, and can definitely be adapted to the XML
context. However, classical fragmentation algorithms are not suitable to
control the number of originated fragments, which instead plays a critical role
in data warehouses, and, with more emphasis, distributed data warehouse
architectures. Inspired by this research challenge, in this paper we propose
the use of K-means clustering algorithm for effectively and efficiently
supporting the fragmentation of very large XML data warehouses, and, at the
same time, completely controlling and determining the number of originated
fragments via adequately setting the parameter K. We complete our analytical
contribution by means of a comprehensive experimental assessment where we
compare the efficiency of our proposed XML data warehouse fragmentation
technique against those of classical derived horizontal fragmentation
algorithms adapted to XML data warehouses.

generalizing the Quantum Tic-Tac-Toe proposed by Allan Goff [2006]. A
Combinatorial Game is a two-player game with no chance and no hidden
information, such as Go or Chess. In this paper, we consider the possibility of
playing superpositions of moves in such games. We propose different rulesets
depending on when superposed moves should be played, and prove that all these
rulesets may lead similar games to different outcomes. We then consider Quantum
variations of the game of Nim. We conclude with some discussion on the relative
interest of the different rulesets.

 <dc:description>  Due to the limited generation and finite inertia, microgrid suffers from the
large frequency and voltage deviation which can lead to system collapse. Thus,
reliable load shedding to keep frequency stable is required. Wireless network,
benefiting from the high flexibility and low deployment cost, is considered as
a promising technology for fine-grained management. In this paper, for
balancing the supply-demand and reducing the load-shedding amount, a
distributed load shedding solution via wireless network is proposed. Firstly,
active power coordination of different priority loads is formulated as an
optimisation problem. To solve it, a distributed load shedding algorithm based
on subgradient method (DLSS) is developed for gradually shedding loads. Using
this method, power compensation can be utilised and has more time to lower the
power deficit so as to reduce the load-shedding amount. Secondly, to increase
the response rate and enhance the reliability of our method, a multicast
metropolis schedule based on TDMA (MMST) is developed. In this protocol, time
slots are dedicatedly allocated and a checking and retransmission mechanism is
utilised. Finally, the proposed solution is evaluated by NS3-Matlab
co-simulator. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of our solution.

 <dc:title>Finding AND-OR Hierarchies in Workflow Nets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sroka, Jacek</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hidders, Jan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the notion of AND-OR reduction, which reduces a WF net to
a smaller net by iteratively contracting certain well-formed subnets into
single nodes until no more such contractions are possible. This reduction can
reveal the hierarchical structure of a WF net, and since it preserves certain
semantical properties such as soundness, it can help with analysing and
understanding why a WF net is sound or not. The reduction can also be used to
verify if a WF net is an AND-OR net. This class of WF nets was introduced in
earlier work, and arguably describes nets that follow good hierarchical design
principles. It is shown that the AND-OR reduction is confluent up to
isomorphism, which means that despite the inherent non-determinism that comes
from the choice of subnets that are contracted, the final result of the
reduction is always the same up to the choice of the identity of the nodes.
Based on this result, a polynomial-time algorithm is presented that computes
this unique result of the AND-OR reduction. Finally, it is shown how this
algorithm can be used to verify if a WF net is an AND-OR net.

 <dc:description>  A tower is a sequence of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps.
We show how to compute a filtration, a sequence of nested simplicial complexes,
with the same persistent barcode as the tower. Our approach is based on the
coning strategy by Dey et al. (SoCG 2014). We show that a variant of this
approach yields a filtration that is asymptotically only marginally larger than
the tower and can be efficiently computed by a streaming algorithm, both in
theory and in practice. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be combined
with a streaming algorithm to compute the barcode of the tower via matrix
reduction. The space complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the length

 <dc:description>  Typical analysis of content caching algorithms using the metric of hit
probability under a stationary request process does not account for performance
loss under a variable request arrival process. In this work, we consider
adaptability of caching algorithms from two perspectives: (a) the accuracy of
learning a fixed popularity distribution; and (b) the speed of learning items'
popularity. In order to attain this goal, we compute the distance between the
stationary distributions of several popular algorithms with that of a
genie-aided algorithm that has knowledge of the true popularity ranking, which
we use as a measure of learning accuracy. We then characterize the mixing time
of each algorithm, i.e., the time needed to attain the stationary distribution,
which we use as a measure of learning efficiency. We merge both measures above
to obtain the &quot;learning error&quot; representing both how quickly and how accurately
an algorithm learns the optimal caching distribution, and use this to determine
the trade-off between these two objectives of many popular caching algorithms.
Informed by the results of our analysis, we propose a novel hybrid algorithm,
Adaptive-LRU (A-LRU), that learns both faster and better the changes in the
popularity. We show numerically that it also outperforms all other candidate
algorithms when confronted with either a dynamically changing synthetic request
process or using real world traces.

 <dc:description>  Scientific legacy code in MATLAB/Octave not compatible with modernization of
research workflows is vastly abundant throughout academic community.
Performance of non-vectorized code written in MATLAB/Octave represents a major
burden. A new programming language for technical computing Julia, promises to
address these issues. Although Julia syntax is similar to MATLAB/Octave,
porting code to Julia may be cumbersome for researchers. Here we present
MatlabCompat.jl - a library aimed at simplifying the conversion of your
MATLAB/Octave code to Julia. We show using a simplistic image analysis use case
that MATLAB/Octave code can be easily ported to high performant Julia using
MatlabCompat.jl.

 <dc:description>  Despite the fact that JSON is currently one of the most popular formats for
exchanging data on the Web, there are very few studies on this topic and there
are no agreement upon theoretical framework for dealing with JSON. There- fore
in this paper we propose a formal data model for JSON documents and, based on
the common features present in available systems using JSON, we define a
lightweight query language allowing us to navigate through JSON documents. We
also introduce a logic capturing the schema proposal for JSON and study the
complexity of basic computational tasks associated with these two formalisms.

 <dc:description>  This paper proves the approximate intermediate value theorem, constructively
and from notably weak hypotheses: from pointwise rather than uniform
continuity, without assuming that reals are presented with rational
approximants, and without using countable choice. The theorem is that if a
pointwise continuous function has both a negative and a positive value, then it
has values arbitrarily close to 0. The proof builds on the usual classical
proof by bisection, which repeatedly selects the left or right half of an
interval; the algorithm here selects an interval of half the size in a
continuous way, interpolating between those two possibilities.

 <dc:description>  Consider a pair of plane straight-line graphs, whose edges are colored red
and blue, respectively, and let n be the total complexity of both graphs. We
present a O(n log n)-time O(n)-space technique to preprocess such pair of
graphs, that enables efficient searches among the red-blue intersections along
edges of one of the graphs. Our technique has a number of applications to
geometric problems. This includes: (1) a solution to the batched red-blue
search problem [Dehne et al. 2006] in O(n log n) queries to the oracle; (2) an
algorithm to compute the maximum vertical distance between a pair of 3D
polyhedral terrains one of which is convex in O(n log n) time, where n is the
total complexity of both terrains; (3) an algorithm to construct the Hausdorff
Voronoi diagram of a family of point clusters in the plane in O((n+m) log^3 n)
time and O(n+m) space, where n is the total number of points in all clusters
and m is the number of crossings between all clusters; (4) an algorithm to
construct the farthest-color Voronoi diagram of the corners of n axis-aligned
rectangles in O(n log^2 n) time; (5) an algorithm to solve the stabbing circle
problem for n parallel line segments in the plane in optimal O(n log n) time.
All these results are new or improve on the best known algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We study rewritability of monadic disjunctive Datalog programs, (the
complements of) MMSNP sentences, and ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) based on
expressive description logics of the ALC family and on conjunctive queries. We
show that rewritability into FO and into monadic Datalog (MDLog) are decidable,
and that rewritability into Datalog is decidable when the original query
satisfies a certain condition related to equality. We establish
2NExpTime-completeness for all studied problems except rewritability into MDLog
for which there remains a gap between 2NExpTime and 3ExpTime. We also analyze
the shape of rewritings, which in the MMSNP case correspond to obstructions,
and give a new construction of canonical Datalog programs that is more
elementary than existing ones and also applies to formulas with free variables.

 <dc:description>  Mobile network operators can track subscribers via passive or active
monitoring of device locations. The recorded trajectories offer an
unprecedented outlook on the activities of large user populations, which
enables developing new networking solutions and services, and scaling up
studies across research disciplines. Yet, the disclosure of individual
trajectories raises significant privacy concerns: thus, these data are often
protected by restrictive non-disclosure agreements that limit their
availability and impede potential usages. In this paper, we contribute to the
development of technical solutions to the problem of privacy-preserving
publishing of spatiotemporal trajectories of mobile subscribers. We propose an
algorithm that generalizes the data so that they satisfy
$k^{\tau,\epsilon}$-anonymity, an original privacy criterion that thwarts
attacks on trajectories. Evaluations with real-world datasets demonstrate that
our algorithm attains its objective while retaining a substantial level of
accuracy in the data. Our work is a step forward in the direction of open,
privacy-preserving datasets of spatiotemporal trajectories.

 <dc:description>  It is a crucial problem in robotics field to cage an object using robots like
multifingered hand. However the problem what is the caging for general
geometrical objects and robots has not been well-described in mathematics
though there were many rigorous studies on the methods how to cage an object by
certain robots. In this article, we investigate the caging problem more
mathematically and describe the problem in terms of recursion of the simple
euclidean moves. Using the description, we show that the caging has the degree
of difficulty which is closely related to a combinatorial problem and a wire
puzzle. It implies that in order to capture an object by caging, from a
practical viewpoint the difficulty plays an important role.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Signature-based detectors for hyperspectral target detection rely on knowing
the specific target signature in advance. However, target signature are often
difficult or impossible to obtain. Furthermore, common methods for obtaining
target signatures, such as from laboratory measurements or manual selection
from an image scene, usually do not capture the discriminative features of
target class. In this paper, an approach for estimating a discriminative target
signature from imprecise labels is presented. The proposed approach maximizes
the response of the hybrid sub-pixel detector within a multiple instance
learning framework and estimates a set of discriminative target signatures.
After learning target signatures, any signature based detector can then be
applied on test data. Both simulated and real hyperspectral target detection
experiments are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the method.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new cellular network model that captures both deterministic and
random aspects of base station deployments. Namely, the base station locations
are modeled as the superposition of two independent stationary point processes:
a random shifted grid with intensity $\lambda_g$ and a Poisson point process
(PPP) with intensity $\lambda_p$. Grid and PPP deployments are special cases
with $\lambda_p \to 0$ and $\lambda_g \to 0$, with actual deployments in
between these two extremes, as we demonstrate with deployment data. Assuming
that each user is associated with the base station that provides the strongest
average received signal power, we obtain the probability that a typical user is
associated with either a grid or PPP base station. Assuming Rayleigh fading
channels, we derive the expression for the coverage probability of the typical
user, resulting in the following observations. First, the association and the
coverage probability of the typical user are fully characterized as functions
of intensity ratio $\rho_\lambda = \lambda_p/\lambda_g$. Second, the user
association is biased towards the base stations located on a grid. Finally, the
proposed model predicts the coverage probability of the actual deployment with
great accuracy.

 <dc:title>Morphognosis: the shape of knowledge in space and time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Portegys, Thomas E.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Artificial intelligence research to a great degree focuses on the brain and
behaviors that the brain generates. But the brain, an extremely complex
structure resulting from millions of years of evolution, can be viewed as a
solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. The
environment generates signals that produce sensory events within an organism.
Building an internal spatial and temporal model of the environment allows an
organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. Higher intelligence might
be the ability to process information coming from a larger extent of
space-time. In keeping with nature's penchant for extending rather than
replacing, the purpose of the mammalian neocortex might then be to record
events from distant reaches of space and time and render them, as though yet
near and present, to the older, deeper brain whose instinctual roles have
changed little over eons. Here this notion is embodied in a model called
morphognosis (morpho = shape and gnosis = knowledge). Its basic structure is a
pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of the pyramid
are the most recent and nearby events. Receding from the apex are less recent
and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a
structure of progressively larger chunks of space-time knowledge. A set of
morphognostics forms long-term memories that are learned by exposure to the
environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the
morphognosis model, using a simulated organism that learns to forage in its
world for food, build a nest, and play the game of Pong.

 <dc:title>Visual Multiple-Object Tracking for Unknown Clutter Rate</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Du Yong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In multi-object tracking applications, model parameter tuning is a
prerequisite for reliable performance. In particular, it is difficult to know
statistics of false measurements due to various sensing conditions and changes
in the field of views. In this paper we are interested in designing a
multi-object tracking algorithm that handles unknown false measurement rate.
Recently proposed robust multi-Bernoulli filter is employed for clutter
estimation while generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter is considered for
target tracking. Performance evaluation with real videos demonstrates the
effectiveness of the tracking algorithm for real-world scenarios.

 <dc:description>  We extend the framework by Kawamura and Cook for investigating computational
complexity for operators occurring in analysis. This model is based on
second-order complexity theory for functions on the Baire space, which is
lifted to metric spaces by means of representations. Time is measured in terms
of the length of the input encodings and the required output precision. We
propose the notions of a complete representation and of a regular
representation. We show that complete representations ensure that any
computable function has a time bound. Regular representations generalize
Kawamura and Cook's more restrictive notion of a second-order representation,
while still guaranteeing fast computability of the length of the encodings.
Applying these notions, we investigate the relationship between purely metric
properties of a metric space and the existence of a representation such that
the metric is computable within bounded time. We show that a bound on the
running time of the metric can be straightforwardly translated into size bounds
of compact subsets of the metric space. Conversely, for compact spaces and for
Banach spaces we construct a family of admissible, complete, regular
representations that allow for fast computation of the metric and provide short
encodings. Here it is necessary to trade the time bound off against the length
of encodings.

 <dc:title>Resolution Simulates Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams for Formulas in
  Conjunctive Normal Form</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tveretina, Olga</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A classical question of propositional logic is one of the shortest proof of a
tautology. A related fundamental problem is to determine the relative
efficiency of standard proof systems, where the relative complexity is measured
using the notion of polynomial simulation.
  Presently, the state-of-the-art satisfiability algorithms are based on
resolution in combination with search. An Ordered Binary Decision Diagram
(OBDD) is a data structure that is used to represent Boolean functions.
  Groote and Zantema have proved that there is exponential separation between
resolution and a proof system based on limited OBDD derivations. However,
formal comparison of these methods is not straightforward because OBDDs work on
arbitrary formulas, whereas resolution can only be applied to formulas in
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNFs).
  Contrary to popular belief, we argue that resolution simulates OBDDs
polynomially if we limit both to CNFs and thus answer negatively the open
question of Groote and Zantema whether there exist unsatisfiable CNFs having
polynomial OBDD refutations and requiring exponentially long resolution
refutations.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) has found great success in domains such
as multimedia understanding. However, the complex nature of multimedia data
makes it difficult to develop DL-based software. The state-of-the art tools,
such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch7, and CNTK, while are successful in their
applicable domains, are programming libraries with fixed user interface,
internal representation, and execution environment. This makes it difficult to
implement portable and customized DL applications.
  In this paper, we present DeepDSL, a domain specific language (DSL) embedded
in Scala, that compiles deep networks written in DeepDSL to Java source code.
Deep DSL provides (1) intuitive constructs to support compact encoding of deep
networks; (2) symbolic gradient derivation of the networks; (3) static analysis
for memory consumption and error detection; and (4) DSL-level optimization to
improve memory and runtime efficiency.
  DeepDSL programs are compiled into compact, efficient, customizable, and
portable Java source code, which operates the CUDA and CUDNN interfaces running
on Nvidia GPU via a Java Native Interface (JNI) library. We evaluated DeepDSL
with a number of popular DL networks. Our experiments show that the compiled
programs have very competitive runtime performance and memory efficiency
compared to the existing libraries.

 <dc:title>QuickNet: Maximizing Efficiency and Efficacy in Deep Architectures</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghosh, Tapabrata</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present QuickNet, a fast and accurate network architecture that is both
faster and significantly more accurate than other fast deep architectures like
SqueezeNet. Furthermore, it uses less parameters than previous networks, making
it more memory efficient. We do this by making two major modifications to the
reference Darknet model (Redmon et al, 2015): 1) The use of depthwise separable
convolutions and 2) The use of parametric rectified linear units. We make the
observation that parametric rectified linear units are computationally
equivalent to leaky rectified linear units at test time and the observation
that separable convolutions can be interpreted as a compressed Inception
network (Chollet, 2016). Using these observations, we derive a network
architecture, which we call QuickNet, that is both faster and more accurate
than previous models. Our architecture provides at least four major advantages:
(1) A smaller model size, which is more tenable on memory constrained systems;
(2) A significantly faster network which is more tenable on computationally
constrained systems; (3) A high accuracy of 95.7 percent on the CIFAR-10
Dataset which outperforms all but one result published so far, although we note
that our works are orthogonal approaches and can be combined (4) Orthogonality
to previous model compression approaches allowing for further speed gains to be
realized.

 <dc:description>  A number of recent works have used a variety of combinatorial constructions
to derive Tanner graphs for LDPC codes and some of these have been shown to
perform well in terms of their probability of error curves and error floors.
Such graphs are bipartite and many of these constructions yield biregular
graphs where the degree of left vertices is a constant $c+1$ and that of the
right vertices is a constant $d+1$. Such graphs are termed $(c+1,d+1)$
biregular bipartite graphs here. One property of interest in such work is the
girth of the graph and the number of short cycles in the graph, cycles of
length either the girth or slightly larger. Such numbers have been shown to be
related to the error floor of the probability of error curve of the related
LDPC code. Using known results of graph theory, it is shown how the girth and
the number of cycles of length equal to the girth may be computed for these
$(c+1,d+1)$ biregular bipartite graphs knowing only the parameters $c$ and $d$
and the numbers of left and right vertices. While numerous algorithms to
determine the number of short cycles in arbitrary graphs exist, the reduction
of the problem from an algorithm to a computation for these biregular bipartite
graphs is of interest.

represent illegal or covert activity. In such networks, people are unlikely to
disclose accurate information when queried. We present REDLEARN, an algorithm
for sampling dark networks with the goal of identifying as many nodes of
interest as possible. We consider two realistic lying scenarios, which describe
how individuals in a dark network may attempt to conceal their connections. We
test and present our results on several real-world multilayered networks, and
show that REDLEARN achieves up to a 340% improvement over the next best
strategy.

 <dc:description>  In computational complexity, a complexity class is given by a set of problems
or functions, and a basic challenge is to show separations of complexity
classes $A \not= B$ especially when $A$ is known to be a subset of $B$. In this
paper we introduce a homological theory of functions that can be used to
establish complexity separations, while also providing other interesting
consequences. We propose to associate a topological space $S_A$ to each class
of functions $A$, such that, to separate complexity classes $A \subseteq B'$,
it suffices to observe a change in &quot;the number of holes&quot;, i.e. homology, in
$S_A$ as a subclass $B$ of $B'$ is added to $A$. In other words, if the
homologies of $S_A$ and $S_{A \cup B}$ are different, then $A \not= B'$. We
develop the underlying theory of functions based on combinatorial and
homological commutative algebra and Stanley-Reisner theory, and recover Minsky
and Papert's 1969 result that parity cannot be computed by nonmaximal degree
polynomial threshold functions. In the process, we derive a &quot;maximal principle&quot;
for polynomial threshold functions that is used to extend this result further
to arbitrary symmetric functions. A surprising coincidence is demonstrated,
where the maximal dimension of &quot;holes&quot; in $S_A$ upper bounds the VC dimension
of $A$, with equality for common computational cases such as the class of
polynomial threshold functions or the class of linear functionals in $\mathbb
F_2$, or common algebraic cases such as when the Stanley-Reisner ring of $S_A$
is Cohen-Macaulay. As another interesting application of our theory, we prove a
result that a priori has nothing to do with complexity separation: it
characterizes when a vector subspace intersects the positive cone, in terms of
homological conditions. By analogy to Farkas' result doing the same with
*linear conditions*, we call our theorem the Homological Farkas Lemma.

 <dc:description>  Kernel matrices appear in machine learning and non-parametric statistics.
Given $N$ points in $d$ dimensions and a kernel function that requires
$\mathcal{O}(d)$ work to evaluate, we present an $\mathcal{O}(dN\log N)$-work
algorithm for the approximate factorization of a regularized kernel matrix, a
common computational bottleneck in the training phase of a learning task. With
this factorization, solving a linear system with a kernel matrix can be done
with $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ work. Our algorithm only requires kernel
evaluations and does not require that the kernel matrix admits an efficient
global low rank approximation. Instead our factorization only assumes low-rank
properties for the off-diagonal blocks under an appropriate row and column
ordering. We also present a hybrid method that, when the factorization is
prohibitively expensive, combines a partial factorization with iterative
methods. As a highlight, we are able to approximately factorize a dense
$11M\times11M$ kernel matrix in 2 minutes on 3,072 x86 &quot;Haswell&quot; cores and a
$4.5M\times4.5M$ matrix in 1 minute using 4,352 &quot;Knights Landing&quot; cores.

 <dc:description>  Despite enormous progress in object detection and classification, the problem
of incorporating expected contextual relationships among object instances into
modern recognition systems remains a key challenge. In this work we propose
Information Pursuit, a Bayesian framework for scene parsing that combines prior
models for the geometry of the scene and the spatial arrangement of objects
instances with a data model for the output of high-level image classifiers
trained to answer specific questions about the scene. In the proposed
framework, the scene interpretation is progressively refined as evidence
accumulates from the answers to a sequence of questions. At each step, we
choose the question to maximize the mutual information between the new answer
and the full interpretation given the current evidence obtained from previous
inquiries. We also propose a method for learning the parameters of the model
from synthesized, annotated scenes obtained by top-down sampling from an
easy-to-learn generative scene model. Finally, we introduce a database of
annotated indoor scenes of dining room tables, which we use to evaluate the
proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Context: Information Technology consumes up to 10\% of the world's
electricity generation, contributing to CO2 emissions and high energy costs.
Data centers, particularly databases, use up to 23% of this energy. Therefore,
building an energy-efficient (green) database engine could reduce energy
consumption and CO2 emissions.
  Goal: To understand the factors driving databases' energy consumption and
execution time throughout their evolution.
  Method: We conducted an empirical case study of energy consumption by two
MySQL database engines, InnoDB and MyISAM, across 40 releases. We examined the
relationships of four software metrics to energy consumption and execution time
to determine which metrics reflect the greenness and performance of a database.
  Results: Our analysis shows that database engines' energy consumption and
execution time increase as databases evolve. Moreover, the Lines of Code metric
is correlated moderately to strongly with energy consumption and execution time
in 88% of cases.
  Conclusions: Our findings provide insights to both practitioners and
researchers. Database administrators may use them to select a fast, green
release of the MySQL database engine. MySQL database-engine developers may use
the software metric to assess products' greenness and performance. Researchers
may use our findings to further develop new hypotheses or build models to
predict greenness and performance of databases.

 <dc:description>  A low-complexity coding scheme is developed to achieve the rate region of
maximum likelihood decoding for interference channels. As in the classical
rate-splitting multiple access scheme by Grant, Rimoldi, Urbanke, and Whiting,
the proposed coding scheme uses superposition of multiple codewords with
successive cancellation decoding, which can be implemented using standard
point-to-point encoders and decoders. Unlike rate-splitting multiple access,
which is not rate-optimal for multiple receivers, the proposed coding scheme
transmits codewords over multiple blocks in a staggered manner and recovers
them successively over sliding decoding windows, achieving the single-stream
optimal rate region as well as the more general Han--Kobayashi inner bound for
the two-user interference channel. The feasibility of this scheme in practice
is verified by implementing it using commercial channel codes over the two-user
Gaussian interference channel.

 <dc:description>  Recovering 3D full-body human pose is a challenging problem with many
applications. It has been successfully addressed by motion capture systems with
body worn markers and multiple cameras. In this paper, we address the more
challenging case of not only using a single camera but also not leveraging
markers: going directly from 2D appearance to 3D geometry. Deep learning
approaches have shown remarkable abilities to discriminatively learn 2D
appearance features. The missing piece is how to integrate 2D, 3D and temporal
information to recover 3D geometry and account for the uncertainties arising
from the discriminative model. We introduce a novel approach that treats 2D
joint locations as latent variables, whose uncertainty distributions are given
by a deep fully convolutional network. The unknown 3D poses are modeled by a
sparse representation and the 3D parameter estimates are realized via an
Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where it is shown that the 2D joint
location uncertainties can be conveniently marginalized out during inference.
Extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets shows that the proposed approach
achieves greater accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, the
proposed approach does not require synchronized 2D-3D data for training and is
applicable to &quot;in-the-wild&quot; images, which is demonstrated with the MPII
dataset.

 <dc:description>  Style transfer is an important task in which the style of a source image is
mapped onto that of a target image. The method is useful for synthesizing
derivative works of a particular artist or specific painting. This work
considers targeted style transfer, in which the style of a template image is
used to alter only part of a target image. For example, an artist may wish to
alter the style of only one particular object in a target image without
altering the object's general morphology or surroundings. This is useful, for
example, in augmented reality applications (such as the recently released
Pokemon GO), where one wants to alter the appearance of a single real-world
object in an image frame to make it appear as a cartoon. Most notably, the
rendering of real-world objects into cartoon characters has been used in a
number of films and television show, such as the upcoming series Son of Zorn.
We present a method for targeted style transfer that simultaneously segments
and stylizes single objects selected by the user. The method uses a Markov
random field model to smooth and anti-alias outlier pixels near object
boundaries, so that stylized objects naturally blend into their surroundings.

 <dc:description>  Maximizing product use is a central goal of many businesses, which makes
retention and monetization two central analytics metrics in games. Player
retention may refer to various duration variables quantifying product use:
total playtime or session playtime are popular research targets, and active
playtime is well-suited for subscription games. Such research often has the
goal of increasing player retention or conversely decreasing player churn.
Survival analysis is a framework of powerful tools well suited for retention
type data. This paper contributes new methods to game analytics on how playtime
can be analyzed using survival analysis without covariates. Survival and hazard
estimates provide both a visual and an analytic interpretation of the playtime
phenomena as a funnel type nonparametric estimate. Metrics based on the
survival curve can be used to aggregate this playtime information into a single
statistic. Comparison of survival curves between cohorts provides a scientific
AB-test. All these methods work on censored data and enable computation of
confidence intervals. This is especially important in time and sample limited
data which occurs during game development. Throughout this paper, we illustrate
the application of these methods to real world game development problems on the
Hipster Sheep mobile game.

 <dc:description>  Residual networks are the current state of the art on ImageNet. Similar work
in the direction of utilizing shortcut connections has been done extremely
recently with derivatives of residual networks and with highway networks. This
work potentially challenges our understanding that CNNs learn layers of local
features that are followed by increasingly global features. Through qualitative
visualization and empirical analysis, we explore the purpose that residual skip
connections serve. Our assessments show that the residual shortcut connections
force layers to refine features, as expected. We also provide alternate
visualizations that confirm that residual networks learn what is already
intuitively known about CNNs in general.

 <dc:description>  Social networks allow rapid spread of ideas and innovations while the
negative information can also propagate widely. When the cascades with
different opinions reaching the same user, the cascade arriving first is the
most likely to be taken by the user. Therefore, once misinformation or rumor is
detected, a natural containment method is to introduce a positive cascade
competing against the rumor. Given a budget $k$, the rumor blocking problem
asks for $k$ seed users to trigger the spread of the positive cascade such that
the number of the users who are not influenced by rumor can be maximized. The
prior works have shown that the rumor blocking problem can be approximated
within a factor of $(1-1/e-\delta)$ by a classic greedy algorithm combined with
Monte Carlo simulation with the running time of $O(\frac{k^3mn\ln
n}{\delta^2})$, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of users and edges,
respectively. Unfortunately, the Monte-Carlo-simulation-based methods are
extremely time consuming and the existing algorithms either trade performance
guarantees for practical efficiency or vice versa. In this paper, we present a
randomized algorithm which runs in $O(\frac{km\ln n}{\delta^2})$ expected time
and provides a $(1-1/e-\delta)$-approximation with a high probability. The
experimentally results on both the real-world and synthetic social networks
have shown that the proposed randomized rumor blocking algorithm is much more
efficient than the state-of-the-art method and it is able to find the seed
nodes which are effective in limiting the spread of rumor.

 <dc:description>  This paper extends recent work in interactive machine learning (IML) focused
on effectively incorporating human feedback. We show how control and feedback
signals complement each other in systems which model human reward. We
demonstrate that simultaneously incorporating human control and feedback
signals can improve interactive robotic systems' performance on a self-mirrored
movement control task where an RL-agent controlled right arm attempts to match
the preprogrammed movement pattern of the left arm. We illustrate the impact of
varying human feedback parameters on task performance by investigating the
probability of giving feedback on each time step and the likelihood of given
feedback being correct. We further illustrate that varying the temporal decay
with which the agent incorporates human feedback has a significant impact on
task performance. We found that smearing human feedback over time steps
improves performance and we show varying the probability of feedback at each
time step, and an increased likelihood of those feedbacks being 'correct' can
impact agent performance. We conclude that understanding latent variables in
human feedback is crucial for learning algorithms acting in human-machine
interaction domains.

 <dc:description>  A boolean function $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ is \textit{weakly symmetric} if it is
invariant under a transitive permutation group on its variables. A boolean
function $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ is \textit{elusive} if we have to check all
$x_1$,..., $x_n$ to determine the output of $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ in the worst-case.
It is conjectured that every nontrivial monotone weakly symmetric boolean
function is elusive, which has been open for a long time. In this paper, we
report that this conjecture is true for $n=14$.

 <dc:title>On the Tanner Graph Cycle Distribution of Random LDPC, Random
  Protograph-Based LDPC, and Random Quasi-Cyclic LDPC Code Ensembles</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dehghan, Ali</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Random bipartite graphs, random lifts of bipartite protographs, and random
cyclic lifts of bipartite protographs are used to represent random low-density
parity-check (LDPC) codes, randomly constructed protograph-based LDPC codes,
and random quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, respectively. In this paper, we study
the distribution of cycles of different length in all these three categories of
graphs. We prove that for a random bipartite graph, with a given degree
distribution, the distributions of cycles of different length tend to
independent Poisson distributions, as the size of the graph tends to infinity.
It is well-known that for a random lift of a protograph, the distributions of
cycles of different length $c$ tend to independent Poisson distributions with
expected value equal to the number of tailless backtrackless closed (tbc) walks
of length $c$ in the protograph, as the size of the graph (lifting degree)
tends to infinity. Here, we find the number of tbc walks in a bi-regular
protograph, and demonstrate that random bi-regular LDPC codes have essentially
the same cycle distribution as random protograph-based LDPC codes, as long as
the degree distributions are identical. For random QC-LDPC codes, however, we
show that the cycle distribution can be quite different from the other two
categories. While for the former categories, the expected number of cycles of
different length is $\Theta(1)$ with respect to the size of the graph, for the
case of QC-LDPC codes, depending on the protograph and the value of $c$, it can
be either $\Theta(N)$ or $\Theta(1)$, where $N$ is the lifting degree (code
length). In addition, we provide numerical results that match our theoretical
derivations. Our results also provide a theoretical foundation for empirical
results that were reported in the literature but were not well-justified.

 <dc:description>  Small-cell deployment in licensed and unlicensed spectrum is considered to be
one of the key approaches to cope with the ongoing wireless data demand
explosion. Compared to traditional cellular base stations with large
transmission power, small-cells typically have relatively low transmission
power, which makes them attractive for some spectrum bands that have strict
power regulations, for example, the 3.5GHz band [1]. In this paper we consider
a heterogeneous wireless network consisting of one or more service providers
(SPs). Each SP operates in both macro-cells and small-cells, and provides
service to two types of users: mobile and fixed. Mobile users can only
associate with macro-cells whereas fixed users can connect to either macro- or
small-cells. The SP charges a price per unit rate for each type of service.
Each SP is given a fixed amount of bandwidth and splits it between macro- and
small-cells. Motivated by bandwidth regulations, such as those for the 3.5Gz
band, we assume a minimum amount of bandwidth has to be set aside for
small-cells. We study the optimal pricing and bandwidth allocation strategies
in both monopoly and competitive scenarios. In the monopoly scenario the
strategy is unique. In the competitive scenario there exists a unique Nash
equilibrium, which depends on the regulatory constraints. We also analyze the
social welfare achieved, and compare it to that without the small-cell
bandwidth constraints. Finally, we discuss implications of our results on the
effectiveness of the minimum bandwidth constraint on influencing small-cell
deployments.

 <dc:description>  Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are an
effective method for training generative models of complex data such as natural
images. However, they are notoriously hard to train and can suffer from the
problem of missing modes where the model is not able to produce examples in
certain regions of the space. We propose an iterative procedure, called AdaGAN,
where at every step we add a new component into a mixture model by running a
GAN algorithm on a reweighted sample. This is inspired by boosting algorithms,
where many potentially weak individual predictors are greedily aggregated to
form a strong composite predictor. We prove that such an incremental procedure
leads to convergence to the true distribution in a finite number of steps if
each step is optimal, and convergence at an exponential rate otherwise. We also
illustrate experimentally that this procedure addresses the problem of missing
modes.

 <dc:title>Stoic Ethics for Artificial Agents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Murray, Gabriel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a position paper advocating the notion that Stoic philosophy and
ethics can inform the development of ethical A.I. systems. This is in sharp
contrast to most work on building ethical A.I., which has focused on
Utilitarian or Deontological ethical theories. We relate ethical A.I. to
several core Stoic notions, including the dichotomy of control, the four
cardinal virtues, the ideal Sage, Stoic practices, and Stoic perspectives on
emotion or affect. More generally, we put forward an ethical view of A.I. that
focuses more on internal states of the artificial agent rather than on external
actions of the agent. We provide examples relating to near-term A.I. systems as
well as hypothetical superintelligent agents.

 <dc:description>  Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the learning of policies for complex
tasks in partially observable environments, without explicitly learning the
underlying model of the tasks. While such model-free methods achieve
considerable performance, they often ignore the structure of task. We present a
natural representation of to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems using
Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), to better exploit this
inherent structure. We define 3 such RCNNs, whose forward passes execute an
efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable
environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Backpropagating
gradients through these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the
Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP,
serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the
proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We
demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of replanning,
learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learnt models to achieve
near-optimal policies.

 <dc:description>  Stable event structures, and their duality with prime algebraic domains
(arising as partial orders of configurations), are a landmark of concurrency
theory, providing a clear characterisation of causality in computations. They
have been used for defining a concurrent semantics of several formalisms, from
Petri nets to linear graph rewriting systems, which in turn lay at the basis of
many visual frameworks. Stability however is restrictive for dealing with
formalisms where a computational step can merge parts of the state, like graph
rewriting systems with non-linear rules, which are needed to cover some
relevant applications (such as the graphical encoding of calculi with name
passing). We characterise, as a natural generalisation of prime algebraic
domains, a class of domains that is well-suited to model the semantics of
formalisms with fusions. We then identify a corresponding class of event
structures, that we call connected event structures, via a duality result
formalised as an equivalence of categories. Connected event structures are
exactly the class of event structures the arise as the semantics of non-linear
graph rewriting systems. Interestingly, the category of general unstable event
structures coreflects into our category of domains, so that our result provides
a characterisation of the partial orders of configurations of such event
structures.

 <dc:title>A Linear Algebra Formulation for Boolean Satisfiability Testing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fang, Chengling</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Jiang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Boolean satisfiability (SAT) is a fundamental problem in computer science,
which is one of the first proven $\mathbf{NP}$-complete problems. Although
there is no known theoretically polynomial time algorithm for SAT, many
heuristic SAT methods have been developed for practical problems. For the sake
of efficiency, various techniques were explored, from discrete to continuous
methods, from sequential to parallel programmings, from constrained to
unconstrained optimizations, from deterministic to stochastic studies. Anyway,
showing the unsatisfiability is a main difficulty in certain sense of finding
an efficient algorithm for SAT. To address the difficulty, this article
presents a linear algebra formulation for unsatisfiability testing, which is a
procedure dramatically different from DPLL. Somehow it gives an affirmative
answer to an open question by Kautz and Selman in their article &quot;The State of
SAT&quot;. The new approach could provide a chance to disprove satisfiability
efficiently by resorting to a linear system having no solution, if the
investigated formula is unsatisfiable. Theoretically, the method can be applied
to test arbitrary formula in polynomial time. We are not unclear whether it can
also show satisfiability efficiently in the same way. If so,
$\mathbf{NP}=\mathbf{P}$. Whatever, our novel method is able to deliver a
definite result to uniquely positive $3$-SAT in polynomial time. To the best of
our knowledge, this constitutes the first polynomial time algorithm for such
problem. Anyway, the new formulation could provide a complementary choice to ad
hoc methods for SAT problem.

 <dc:description>  It is known that many Twitter users are bots, which are accounts controlled
and sometimes created by computers. Twitter bots can send spam tweets,
manipulate public opinion and be used for online fraud. Here we report the
discovery, retrieval, and analysis of the `Star Wars' botnet in Twitter, which
consists of more than 350,000 bots tweeting random quotations exclusively from
Star Wars novels.
  The botnet contains a single type of bot, showing exactly the same properties
throughout the botnet. It is unusually large, many times larger than other
available datasets. It provides a valuable source of ground truth for research
on Twitter bots. We analysed and revealed rich details on how the botnet was
designed and created. As of this writing, the Star Wars bots are still alive in
Twitter. They have survived since their creation in 2013, despite the
increasing efforts in recent years to detect and remove Twitter bots.We also
reflect on the `unconventional' way in which we discovered the Star Wars bots,
and discuss the current problems and future challenges of Twitter bot
detection.

 <dc:description>  Highly-available datastores are widely deployed for online applications.
However, many online applications are not contented with the simple data access
interface currently provided by highly-available datastores. Distributed
transaction support is demanded by applications such as large-scale online
payment used by Alipay or Paypal. Current solutions to distributed transaction
can spend more than half of the whole transaction processing time in
distributed commit. An efficient atomic commit protocol is highly desirable.
This paper presents the HACommit protocol, a logless one-phase commit protocol
for highly-available systems. HACommit has transaction participants vote for a
commit before the client decides to commit or abort the transaction; in
comparison, the state-of-the-art practice for distributed commit is to have the
client decide before participants vote. The change enables the removal of both
the participant logging and the coordinator logging steps in the distributed
commit process; it also makes possible that, after the client initiates the
transaction commit, the transaction data is visible to other transactions
within one communication roundtrip time (i.e., one phase). In the evaluation
with extensive experiments, HACommit outperforms recent atomic commit solutions
for highly-available datastores under different workloads. In the best case,
HACommit can commit in one fifth of the time 2PC does.

 <dc:description>  Update : An issue has been found in the correctness of our algorithm, and we
are working to resolve the issue. Until a resolution is found, we retract our
main claim that our approach gives a combinatorial solution to the CSP
conjecture. We remain hopeful that we can resolve the issues. We thank Ross
Willard for carefully checking the algorithm and pointing out the mistake in
the version of this manuscript. We briefly explain one issue at the beginning
of the text, and leave the rest of the manuscript intact for the moment . Ross
Willard is posting a more involved description of a counter-example to the
algorithm in the present manuscript. We have an updated manuscript that
corrects some issues while still not arriving at a full solution; we will keep
this private as long as unresolved issues remain.
  Previous abstract : We consider the problem of finding a homomorphism from an
input digraph G to a fixed digraph H. We show that if H admits a
weak-near-unanimity polymorphism $\phi$ then deciding whether G admits a
homomorphism to H (HOM(H)) is polynomial time solvable. This confirms the
conjecture of Maroti and McKenzie, and consequently implies the validity of the
celebrated dichotomy conjecture due to Feder and Vardi. We transform the
problem into an instance of the list homomorphism problem where initially all
the lists are full (contain all the vertices of H). Then we use the
polymorphism $\phi$ as a guide to reduce the lists to singleton lists, which
yields a homomorphism if one exists.

 <dc:description>  The focus of this paper is on the analysis and design of Raptor codes using a
multi-edge framework. In this regard, we first represent the Raptor code as a
multi-edge type low-density parity-check (METLDPC) code. This MET
representation gives a general framework to analyze and design Raptor codes
over a binary input additive white Gaussian noise channel using MET density
evolution (MET-DE). We consider a joint decoding scheme based on the belief
propagation (BP) decoding for Raptor codes in the multi-edge framework, and
analyze the convergence behavior of the BP decoder using MET-DE. In joint
decoding of Raptor codes, the component codes correspond to inner code and
precode are decoded in parallel and provide information to each other. We also
derive an exact expression for the stability of Raptor codes with joint
decoding. We then propose an efficient Raptor code design method using the
multi-edge framework, where we simultaneously optimize the inner code and the
precode. Finally we consider performance-complexity trade-offs of Raptor codes
using the multi-edge framework. Through density evolution analysis we show that
the designed Raptor codes using the multi-edge framework outperform the
existing Raptor codes in literature in terms of the realized rate.

 <dc:title>Coflow Scheduling in Input-Queued Switches: Optimal Delay Scaling and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A coflow is a collection of parallel flows belonging to the same job. It has
the all-or-nothing property: a coflow is not complete until the completion of
all its constituent flows. In this paper, we focus on optimizing
\emph{coflow-level delay}, i.e., the time to complete all the flows in a
coflow, in the context of an $N\times N$ input-queued switch. In particular, we
develop a throughput-optimal scheduling policy that achieves the best scaling
of coflow-level delay as $N\rightarrow\infty$. We first derive lower bounds on
the coflow-level delay that can be achieved by any scheduling policy. It is
observed that these lower bounds critically depend on the variability of flow
sizes. Then we analyze the coflow-level performance of some existing
coflow-agnostic scheduling policies and show that none of them achieves
provably optimal performance with respect to coflow-level delay. Finally, we
propose the Coflow-Aware Batching (CAB) policy which achieves the optimal
scaling of coflow-level delay under some mild assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Various current trends such as ever growing population and accelerated aging
effects have effectively promoted the growth of Wireless Body Area Network
(WBAN). Being the specialized standard of WBAN, the burgeoning IEEE 802.15.6 is
on its way to refinement and perfection. Since experiments are the foundation
of research in WBAN that reproduce system operating patterns, yet existing
platforms in WBAN are mainly simulations that could not highly conform to
reality with strict requirements to some degree. Thus, a reliable and efficient
system based on the IEEE 802.15.6, named WBAN prototype system, is proposed and
implemented in this paper. The prototype system is ascertained to be valid,
authentic and efficient via analyses of scenario tests. Running in
circumstances much closer to reality, the system obtains experimental results
that meet rigid requirements preferably. Furthermore, based on the valid
platform we created, optimizations of two parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6 by
actual measurements are derived. We obtain an optimum number of transmission
retries and relationship of payload length within 30 with FER, making a
trade-off between waste of resource and high packet loss rate.

 <dc:description>  Understanding a visual scene goes beyond recognizing individual objects in
isolation. Relationships between objects also constitute rich semantic
information about the scene. In this work, we explicitly model the objects and
their relationships using scene graphs, a visually-grounded graphical structure
of an image. We propose a novel end-to-end model that generates such structured
scene representation from an input image. The model solves the scene graph
inference problem using standard RNNs and learns to iteratively improves its
predictions via message passing. Our joint inference model can take advantage
of contextual cues to make better predictions on objects and their
relationships. The experiments show that our model significantly outperforms
previous methods for generating scene graphs using Visual Genome dataset and
inferring support relations with NYU Depth v2 dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we deal with the uncertainty of bidding for display
advertising. Similar to the financial market trading, real-time bidding (RTB)
based display advertising employs an auction mechanism to automate the
impression level media buying; and running a campaign is no different than an
investment of acquiring new customers in return for obtaining additional
converted sales. Thus, how to optimally bid on an ad impression to drive the
profit and return-on-investment becomes essential. However, the large
randomness of the user behaviors and the cost uncertainty caused by the auction
competition may result in a significant risk from the campaign performance
estimation. In this paper, we explicitly model the uncertainty of user
click-through rate estimation and auction competition to capture the risk. We
borrow an idea from finance and derive the value at risk for each ad display
opportunity. Our formulation results in two risk-aware bidding strategies that
penalize risky ad impressions and focus more on the ones with higher expected
return and lower risk. The empirical study on real-world data demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed risk-aware bidding strategies: yielding profit
gains of 15.4% in offline experiments and up to 17.5% in an online A/B test on
a commercial RTB platform over the widely applied bidding strategies.

 <dc:description>  This work leverages recent advances in probabilistic machine learning to
discover conservation laws expressed by parametric linear equations. Such
equations involve, but are not limited to, ordinary and partial differential,
integro-differential, and fractional order operators. Here, Gaussian process
priors are modified according to the particular form of such operators and are
employed to infer parameters of the linear equations from scarce and possibly
noisy observations. Such observations may come from experiments or &quot;black-box&quot;
computer simulations.

 <dc:title>Energy Harvesting Communication Using Finite-Capacity Batteries with
  Internal Resistance</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Modern systems will increasingly rely on energy harvested from their
environment. Such systems utilize batteries to smoothen out the random
fluctuations in harvested energy. These fluctuations induce highly variable
battery charge and discharge rates, which affect the efficiencies of practical
batteries that typically have non-zero internal resistances. In this paper, we
study an energy harvesting communication system using a finite battery with
non-zero internal resistance. We adopt a dual-path architecture, in which
harvested energy can be directly used, or stored and then used. In a frame,
both time and power can be split between energy storage and data transmission.
For a single frame, we derive an analytical expression for the rate optimal
time and power splitting ratios between harvesting energy and transmitting
data. We then optimize the time and power splitting ratios for a group of
frames, assuming non-causal knowledge of harvested power and fading channel
gains, by giving an approximate solution. When only the statistics of the
energy arrivals and channel gains are known, we derive a dynamic programming
based policy and, propose three sub-optimal policies, which are shown to
perform competitively. In summary, our study suggests that battery internal
resistance significantly impacts the design and performance of energy
harvesting communication systems and must be taken into account.

 <dc:description>  We study properties of classes of closure operators and closure systems
parameterized by systems of isotone Galois connections. The parameterizations
express stronger requirements on idempotency and monotony conditions of closure
operators. The present approach extends previous approaches to fuzzy closure
operators which appeared in analysis of object-attribute data with graded
attributes and reasoning with if-then rules in graded setting and is also
related to analogous results developed in linear temporal logic. In the paper,
we present foundations of the operators and include examples of general
problems in data analysis where such operators appear.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the emerging Internet-of-Things (IoT) has led to rising
concerns about the security of networked embedded devices. In this work, we
focus on the adaptation of Honeypots for improving the security of IoTs.
Low-interaction honeypots are used so far in the context of IoT. Such honeypots
are limited and easily detectable, and thus, there is a need to find ways how
to develop high-interaction, reliable, IoT honeypots that will attract skilled
attackers. In this work, we propose the SIPHON architecture - a Scalable
high-Interaction Honeypot platform for IoT devices. Our architecture leverages
IoT devices that are physically at one location and are connected to the
Internet through so-called wormholes distributed around the world. The
resulting architecture allows exposing few physical devices over a large number
of geographically distributed IP addresses. We demonstrate the proposed
architecture in a large scale experiment with 39 wormhole instances in 16
cities in 9 countries. Based on this setup, six physical IP cameras, one NVR
and one IP printer are presented as 85 real IoT devices on the Internet,
attracting a daily traffic of 700MB for a period of two months. A preliminary
analysis of the collected traffic indicates that devices in some cities
attracted significantly more traffic than others (ranging from 600 000 incoming
TCP connections for the most popular destination to less than 50000 for the
least popular). We recorded over 400 brute-force login attempts to the
web-interface of our devices using a total of 1826 distinct credentials, from
which 11 attempts were successful. Moreover, we noted login attempts to Telnet
and SSH ports some of which used credentials found in the recently disclosed
Mirai malware.

 <dc:title>Toward a Calculus of Redundancy: The feedback arrow of expectations in
  knowledge-based systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Leydesdorff, Loet</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Whereas the generation of Shannon-type information is coupled to the second
law of thermodynamics, redundancy--that is, the complement of information to
the maximum entropy--can be increased by further distinctions: new options can
discursively be generated. The dynamics of discursive knowledge production thus
infuse the historical dynamics with a cultural evolution based on expectations
(as different from observations). We distinguish among (i) the communication of
information, (ii) the sharing of meaning, and (iii) discursive knowledge.
Meaning is provided from the perspective of hindsight as feedback on the
entropy flow and thus generates redundancy. Specific meanings can selectively
be codified as discursive knowledge; knowledge-based reconstructions enable us
to specify expectations about future states which can be invoked in the
present. The cycling among the dynamics of information, meaning, and knowledge
in feedback and feedforward loops can be evaluated empirically: When mutual
redundancy prevails over mutual information, the sign of the resulting
information is negative indicating reduction of uncertainty because of new
options available for realization; innovation can then be expected to flourish.
When historical realizations prevail, innovation may be locked-in because of
insufficient options for further development.

 <dc:title>Rate Optimal Binary Linear Locally Repairable Codes with Small
  Availability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kadhe, Swanand</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Calderbank, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A locally repairable code with availability has the property that every code
symbol can be recovered from multiple, disjoint subsets of other symbols of
small size. In particular, a code symbol is said to have $(r,t)$-availability
if it can be recovered from $t$ disjoint subsets, each of size at most $r$. A
code with availability is said to be 'rate-optimal', if its rate is maximum
among the class of codes with given locality, availability, and alphabet size.
  This paper focuses on rate-optimal binary, linear codes with small
availability, and makes four contributions. First, it establishes tight upper
bounds on the rate of binary linear codes with $(r,2)$ and $(2,3)$
availability. Second, it establishes a uniqueness result for binary
rate-optimal codes, showing that for certain classes of binary linear codes
with $(r,2)$ and $(2,3)$-availability, any rate optimal code must be a direct
sum of shorter rate optimal codes. Third, it presents novel upper bounds on the
rates of binary linear codes with $(2,t)$ and $(r,3)$-availability. In
particular, the main contribution here is a new method for bounding the number
of cosets of the dual of a code with availability, using its covering
properties. Finally, it presents a class of locally repairable linear codes
associated with convex polyhedra, focusing on the codes associated with the
Platonic solids. It demonstrates that these codes are locally repairable with
$t = 2$, and that the codes associated with (geometric) dual polyhedra are
(coding theoretic) duals of each other.
</dc:description>

  second version contains a new section on rate upper bounds for binary linear
  codes with (2,t) and (r,3)-availability</dc:description>

 <dc:title>Can scientists and their institutions become their own open access

 <dc:creator>Shashok, Karen</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article offers a personal perspective on the current state of academic
publishing, and posits that the scientific community is beset with journals
that contribute little valuable knowledge, overload the community's capacity
for high-quality peer review, and waste resources. Open access publishing can
offer solutions that benefit researchers and other information users, as well
as institutions and funders, but commercial journal publishers have influenced
open access policies and practices in ways that favor their economic interests
over those of other stakeholders in knowledge creation and sharing. One way to
free research from constraints on access is the diamond route of open access
publishing, in which institutions and funders that produce new knowledge
reclaim responsibility for publication via institutional journals or other open
platforms. I argue that research journals (especially those published for
profit) may no longer be fit for purpose, and hope that readers will consider
whether the time has come to put responsibility for publishing back into the
hands of researchers and their institutions. The potential advantages and
challenges involved in a shift away from for-profit journals in favor of
institutional open access publishing are explored.

 <dc:description>  3D models provide a common ground for different representations of human
bodies. In turn, robust 2D estimation has proven to be a powerful tool to
obtain 3D fits &quot;in-the- wild&quot;. However, depending on the level of detail, it
can be hard to impossible to acquire labeled data for training 2D estimators on
large scale. We propose a hybrid approach to this problem: with an extended
version of the recently introduced SMPLify method, we obtain high quality 3D
body model fits for multiple human pose datasets. Human annotators solely sort
good and bad fits. This procedure leads to an initial dataset, UP-3D, with rich
annotations. With a comprehensive set of experiments, we show how this data can
be used to train discriminative models that produce results with an
unprecedented level of detail: our models predict 31 segments and 91 landmark
locations on the body. Using the 91 landmark pose estimator, we present
state-of-the art results for 3D human pose and shape estimation using an order
of magnitude less training data and without assumptions about gender or pose in
the fitting procedure. We show that UP-3D can be enhanced with these improved
fits to grow in quantity and quality, which makes the system deployable on
large scale. The data, code and models are available for research purposes.

 <dc:description>  Purpose of review: This paper presents a review of the current state of the
art in remote sensing based monitoring of forest disturbances and forest
degradation from optical Earth Observation data. Part one comprises an overview
of currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used for
forest disturbance and degradation mapping. Part two reviews the two main
categories of existing approaches: classical image-to-image change detection
and time series analysis. Recent findings: With the launch of the Sentinel-2a
satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the
most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping
approaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. The
methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A
separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies
for two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus on
Europe and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa. Summary: The
review revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forest
degradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transfer
these approaches to high resolution time series data from multiple sensors.
Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance types
and the development of robust up-scalable methods to enable near real time
disturbance mapping in support of operational reactive measures.

 <dc:title>An efficient exact model for the cell formation problem with a variable
  number of production cells</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bychkov, Ilya</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Batsyn, Mikhail</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Cell Formation Problem has been studied as an optimization problem in
manufacturing for more than 90 years. It consists of grouping machines and
parts into manufacturing cells in order to maximize loading of cells and
minimize movement of parts from one cell to another. Many heuristic algorithms
have been proposed which are doing well even for large-sized instances.
However, only a few authors have aimed to develop exact methods and most of
these methods have some major restrictions such as a fixed number of production
cells for example. In this paper we suggest a new mixed-integer linear
programming model for solving the cell formation problem with a variable number
of manufacturing cells. The popular grouping efficacy measure is used as an
objective function. To deal with its fractional nature we apply the Dinkelbach
approach. Our computational experiments are performed on two testsets: the
first consists of 35 well-known instances from the literature and the second
contains 32 instances less popular. We solve these instances using CPLEX
software. Optimal solutions have been found for 63 of the 67 considered problem
instances and several new solutions unknown before have been obtained. The
computational times are greatly decreased comparing to the state-of-art
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Multi-task learning (MTL) involves the simultaneous training of two or more
related tasks over shared representations. In this work, we apply MTL to
audio-visual automatic speech recognition(AV-ASR). Our primary task is to learn
a mapping between audio-visual fused features and frame labels obtained from
acoustic GMM/HMM model. This is combined with an auxiliary task which maps
visual features to frame labels obtained from a separate visual GMM/HMM model.
The MTL model is tested at various levels of babble noise and the results are
compared with a base-line hybrid DNN-HMM AV-ASR model. Our results indicate
that MTL is especially useful at higher level of noise. Compared to base-line,
upto 7\% relative improvement in WER is reported at -3 SNR dB

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose three novel models to enhance word embedding by
implicitly using morphological information. Experiments on word similarity and
syntactic analogy show that the implicit models are superior to traditional
explicit ones. Our models outperform all state-of-the-art baselines and
significantly improve the performance on both tasks. Moreover, our performance
on the smallest corpus is similar to the performance of CBOW on the corpus
which is five times the size of ours. Parameter analysis indicates that the
implicit models can supplement semantic information during the word embedding
training process.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel image set classification technique using linear regression
models. Downsampled gallery image sets are interpreted as subspaces of a high
dimensional space to avoid the computationally expensive training step. We
estimate regression models for each test image using the class specific gallery
subspaces. Images of the test set are then reconstructed using the regression
models. Based on the minimum reconstruction error between the reconstructed and
the original images, a weighted voting strategy is used to classify the test
set. We performed extensive evaluation on the benchmark UCSD/Honda, CMU Mobo
and YouTube Celebrity datasets for face classification, and ETH-80 dataset for
object classification. The results demonstrate that by using only a small
amount of training data, our technique achieved competitive classification
accuracy and superior computational speed compared with the state-of-the-art
methods.

 <dc:description>  The majority of online display ads are served through real-time bidding (RTB)
--- each ad display impression is auctioned off in real-time when it is just
being generated from a user visit. To place an ad automatically and optimally,
it is critical for advertisers to devise a learning algorithm to cleverly bid
an ad impression in real-time. Most previous works consider the bid decision as
a static optimization problem of either treating the value of each impression
independently or setting a bid price to each segment of ad volume. However, the
bidding for a given ad campaign would repeatedly happen during its life span
before the budget runs out. As such, each bid is strategically correlated by
the constrained budget and the overall effectiveness of the campaign (e.g., the
rewards from generated clicks), which is only observed after the campaign has
completed. Thus, it is of great interest to devise an optimal bidding strategy
sequentially so that the campaign budget can be dynamically allocated across
all the available impressions on the basis of both the immediate and future
rewards. In this paper, we formulate the bid decision process as a
reinforcement learning problem, where the state space is represented by the
auction information and the campaign's real-time parameters, while an action is
the bid price to set. By modeling the state transition via auction competition,
we build a Markov Decision Process framework for learning the optimal bidding
policy to optimize the advertising performance in the dynamic real-time bidding
environment. Furthermore, the scalability problem from the large real-world
auction volume and campaign budget is well handled by state value approximation
using neural networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies dynamic complexity under definable change operations in
the DynFO framework by Patnaik and Immerman. It is shown that for changes
definable by parameter-free first-order formulas, all (uniform) $AC^1$ queries
can be maintained by first-order dynamic programs. Furthermore, many
maintenance results for single-tuple changes are extended to more powerful
change operations: (1) The reachability query for undirected graphs is
first-order maintainable under single tuple changes and first-order defined
insertions, likewise the reachability query for directed acyclic graphs under
quantifier-free insertions. (2) Context-free languages are first-order
maintainable under $\Sigma_1$-defined changes. These results are complemented
by several inexpressibility results, for example, that the reachability query
cannot be maintained by quantifier-free programs under definable,
quantifier-free deletions.

 <dc:title>Network Topology Modulation for Energy and Data Transmission in Internet
  of Magneto-Inductive Things</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gulbahar, Burhan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Internet-of-things (IoT) architectures connecting a massive number of
heterogeneous devices need energy efficient, low hardware complexity, low cost,
simple and secure mechanisms to realize communication among devices. One of the
emerging schemes is to realize simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) in an energy harvesting network. Radio frequency (RF)
solutions require special hardware and modulation methods for RF to direct
current (DC) conversion and optimized operation to achieve SWIPT which are
currently in an immature phase. On the other hand, magneto-inductive (MI)
communication transceivers are intrinsically energy harvesting with potential
for SWIPT in an efficient manner. In this article, novel modulation and
demodulation mechanisms are presented in a combined framework with
multiple-access channel (MAC) communication and wireless power transmission.
The network topology of power transmitting active coils in a transceiver
composed of a grid of coils is changed as a novel method to transmit
information. Practical demodulation schemes are formulated and numerically
simulated for two-user MAC topology of small size coils. The transceivers are
suitable to attach to everyday objects to realize reliable local area network
(LAN) communication performances with tens of meters communication ranges. The
designed scheme is promising for future IoT applications requiring SWIPT with
energy efficient, low cost, low power and low hardware complexity solutions.

 <dc:description>  Functional transductions realized by two-way transducers (equivalently, by
streaming transducers and by MSO transductions) are the natural and standard
notion of &quot;regular&quot; mappings from words to words. It was shown recently
(LICS'13) that it is decidable if such a transduction can be implemented by
some one-way transducer, but the given algorithm has non-elementary complexity.
We provide an algorithm of different flavor solving the above question, that
has double exponential space complexity. We further apply our technique to
decide whether the transduction realized by a two-way transducer can be
implemented by a sweeping transducer, with either known or unknown number of
passes.

 <dc:description>  Transfer learning leverages the knowledge in one domain, the source domain,
to improve learning efficiency in another domain, the target domain. Existing
transfer learning research is relatively well-progressed, but only in
situations where the feature spaces of the domains are homogeneous and the
target domain contains at least a few labeled instances. However, transfer
learning has not been well-studied in heterogeneous settings with an unlabeled
target domain. To contribute to the research in this emerging field, this paper
presents: (1) an unsupervised knowledge transfer theorem that prevents negative
transfer; and (2) a principal angle-based metric to measure the distance
between two pairs of domains. The metric shows the extent to which homogeneous
representations have preserved the information in original source and target
domains. The unsupervised knowledge transfer theorem sets out the transfer
conditions necessary to prevent negative transfer. Linear monotonic maps meet
the transfer conditions of the theorem and, hence, are used to construct
homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous domains, which in principle
prevents negative transfer. The metric and the theorem have been implemented in
an innovative transfer model, called a Grassmann-LMM-geodesic flow kernel
(GLG), that is specifically designed for knowledge transfer across
heterogeneous domains. The GLG model learns homogeneous representations of
heterogeneous domains by minimizing the proposed metric. Knowledge is
transferred through these learned representations via a geodesic flow kernel.
Notably, the theorem presented in this paper provides the sufficient transfer
conditions needed to guarantee that knowledge is transferred from a source
domain to an unlabeled target domain with correctness.

 <dc:description>  In the literature on robotics and multibody dynamics, the concept of average
angular velocity has received considerable attention in recent years. We
address the question of whether the average angular velocity defines an
orientation framethat depends only on the current robot configuration and
provide a simple algebraic condition to check whether this holds. In the
language of geometric mechanics, this condition corresponds to requiring the
flatness of the mechanical connection associated to the robotic system. Here,
however, we provide both a reinterpretation and a proof of this result
accessible to readers with a background in rigid body kinematics and multibody
dynamics but not necessarily acquainted with differential geometry, still
providing precise links to the geometric mechanics literature. This should help
spreading the algebraic condition beyond the scope of geometric
mechanics,contributing to a proper utilization and understanding of the concept
of average angular velocity.

 <dc:description>  Content Centric Networking (CCN) is a new network infrastructure around
content dissemination and retrieval, shift from host addresses to named data.
Each CCN router has a cache to store the chunks passed by it. Therefore the
caching strategy about chunk placement can greatly affect the whole CCN
performance. This paper proposes an implicit coordinate chunk caching location
and searching scheme (CLS) in CCN hierarchical infrastructure. In CLS, there is
at most one copy of a chunk cached on the path between a server and a leaf
router. This copy is pulled down one level towards the leaf router by a request
or pushed up one level towards the server by the cache eviction. Thus, it is
possible to store more diverse contents in the whole CCN and improve the
network performance. Plus, in order to reduce the server workload and file
download time, a caching trail of chunk is created to direct the following
request where to find the chunk. Extensive test-bed experiments have been
performed to evaluate the proposed scheme in terms of a wide range of
performance metrics. The results show that the proposed scheme outperforms
existing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We propose a graph-based process calculus for modeling and reasoning about
wireless networks with local broadcasts. Graphs are used at syntactical level
to describe the topological structures of networks. This calculus is equipped
with a reduction semantics and a labelled transition semantics. The former is
used to define weak barbed congruence. The latter is used to define a
parameterized weak bisimulation emphasizing locations and local broadcasts. We
prove that weak bisimilarity implies weak barbed congruence. The potential
applications are illustrated by some examples and two case studies.

 <dc:description>  We study the heavy path decomposition of conditional Galton-Watson trees. In
a standard Galton-Watson tree conditional on its size $n$, we order all
children by their subtree sizes, from large (heavy) to small. A node is marked
if it is among the $k$ heaviest nodes among its siblings. Unmarked nodes and
their subtrees are removed, leaving only a tree of marked nodes, which we call
the $k$-heavy tree. We study various properties of these trees, including their
size and the maximal distance from any original node to the $k$-heavy tree. In
particular, under some moment condition, the $2$-heavy tree is with high
probability larger than $cn$ for some constant $c &gt; 0$, and the maximal
distance from the $k$-heavy tree is $O(n^{1/(k+1)})$ in probability. As a
consequence, for uniformly random Apollonian networks of size $n$, the expected
size of the longest simple path is $\Omega(n)$.

 <dc:description>  Today's WiFi networks deliver a large fraction of traffic. However, the
performance and quality of WiFi networks are still far from satisfactory. Among
many popular quality metrics (throughput, latency), the probability of
successfully connecting to WiFi APs and the time cost of the WiFi connection
set-up process are the two of the most critical metrics that affect WiFi users'
experience. To understand the WiFi connection set-up process in real-world
settings, we carry out measurement studies on $5$ million mobile users from $4$
representative cities associating with $7$ million APs in $0.4$ billion WiFi
sessions, collected from a mobile &quot;WiFi Manager&quot; App that tops the Android/iOS
App market. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do such large
scale study on: how large the WiFi connection set-up time cost is, what factors
affect the WiFi connection set-up process, and what can be done to reduce the
WiFi connection set-up time cost. Based on the measurement analysis, we develop
a machine learning based AP selection strategy that can significantly improve

 <dc:description>  We derive bounds on the extremal singular values and the condition number of
NxK, with N&gt;=K, Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the unit disk. The
mathematical techniques we develop to prove our main results are inspired by a
link---first established by by Selberg [1] and later extended by Moitra
[2]---between the extremal singular values of Vandermonde matrices with nodes
on the unit circle and large sieve inequalities. Our main conceptual
contribution lies in establishing a connection between the extremal singular
values of Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the unit disk and a novel large
sieve inequality involving polynomials in z \in C with |z|&lt;=1. Compared to
Baz\'an's upper bound on the condition number [3], which, to the best of our
knowledge, constitutes the only analytical result---available in the
literature---on the condition number of Vandermonde matrices with nodes in the
unit disk, our bound not only takes a much simpler form, but is also sharper
for certain node configurations. Moreover, the bound we obtain can be evaluated
consistently in a numerically stable fashion, whereas the evaluation of
Baz\'an's bound requires the solution of a linear system of equations which has
the same condition number as the Vandermonde matrix under consideration and can
therefore lead to numerical instability in practice. As a byproduct, our
result---when particularized to the case of nodes on the unit circle---slightly
improves upon the Selberg-Moitra bound.

 <dc:description>  Forecasting the flow of crowds is of great importance to traffic management
and public safety, and very challenging as it is affected by many complex
factors, including spatial dependencies (nearby and distant), temporal
dependencies (closeness, period, trend), and external conditions (e.g., weather
and events). We propose a deep-learning-based approach, called ST-ResNet, to
collectively forecast two types of crowd flows (i.e. inflow and outflow) in
each and every region of a city. We design an end-to-end structure of ST-ResNet
based on unique properties of spatio-temporal data. More specifically, we
employ the residual neural network framework to model the temporal closeness,
period, and trend properties of crowd traffic. For each property, we design a
branch of residual convolutional units, each of which models the spatial
properties of crowd traffic. ST-ResNet learns to dynamically aggregate the
output of the three residual neural networks based on data, assigning different
weights to different branches and regions. The aggregation is further combined
with external factors, such as weather and day of the week, to predict the
final traffic of crowds in each and every region. We have developed a real-time
system based on Microsoft Azure Cloud, called UrbanFlow, providing the crowd
flow monitoring and forecasting in Guiyang City of China. In addition, we
present an extensive experimental evaluation using two types of crowd flows in
Beijing and New York City (NYC), where ST-ResNet outperforms nine well-known
baselines.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things is arriving to our homes or cities through fields
already known like Smart Homes, Smart Cities, or Smart Towns. The monitoring of
environmental conditions of cities can help to adapt the indoor locations of
the cities in order to be more comfortable for people who stay there. A way to
improve the indoor conditions is an efficient temperature control, however, it
depends on many factors like the different combinations of outdoor temperature
and humidity. Therefore, adjusting the indoor temperature is not setting a
value according to other value. There are many more factors to take into
consideration, hence the traditional logic based in binary states cannot be
used. Many problems cannot be solved with a set of binary solutions and we need
a new way of development. Fuzzy logic is able to interpret many states, more
than two states, giving to computers the capacity to react in a similar way to
people. In this paper we will propose a new approach to control the temperature
using the Internet of Things together its platforms and fuzzy logic regarding
not only the indoor temperature but also the outdoor temperature and humidity
in order to save energy and to set a more comfortable environment for their
users. Finally, we will conclude that the fuzzy approach allows us to achieve
an energy saving around 40% and thus, save money.

 <dc:description>  Energy-parity objectives combine $\omega$-regular with quantitative
objectives of reward MDPs. The controller needs to avoid to run out of energy
while satisfying a parity objective.
  We refute the common belief that, if an energy-parity objective holds
almost-surely, then this can be realised by some finite memory strategy. We
provide a surprisingly simple counterexample that only uses coB\&quot;uchi
conditions.
  We introduce the new class of bounded (energy) storage objectives that, when
combined with parity objectives, preserve the finite memory property. Based on
these, we show that almost-sure and limit-sure energy-parity objectives, as
well as almost-sure and limit-sure storage parity objectives, are in
$\mathit{NP}\cap \mathit{coNP}$ and can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time for
energy-parity MDPs.

 <dc:description>  Higher-order probabilistic programming languages allow programmers to write
sophisticated models in machine learning and statistics in a succinct and
structured way, but step outside the standard measure-theoretic formalization
of probability theory. Programs may use both higher-order functions and
continuous distributions, or even define a probability distribution on
functions. But standard probability theory does not handle higher-order
functions well: the category of measurable spaces is not cartesian closed.
  Here we introduce quasi-Borel spaces. We show that these spaces: form a new
formalization of probability theory replacing measurable spaces; form a
cartesian closed category and so support higher-order functions; form a
well-pointed category and so support good proof principles for equational
reasoning; and support continuous probability distributions. We demonstrate the
use of quasi-Borel spaces for higher-order functions and probability by:
showing that a well-known construction of probability theory involving random
functions gains a cleaner expression; and generalizing de Finetti's theorem,
that is a crucial theorem in probability theory, to quasi-Borel spaces.

 <dc:title>The ANTS problem</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Feinerman, Ofer</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Korman, Amos</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce the Ants Nearby Treasure Search (ANTS) problem, which models
natural cooperative foraging behavior such as that performed by ants around
their nest. In this problem, k probabilistic agents, initially placed at a
central location, collectively search for a treasure on the two-dimensional
grid. The treasure is placed at a target location by an adversary and the
agents' goal is to find it as fast as possible as a function of both k and D,
where D is the (unknown) distance between the central location and the target.
We concentrate on the case in which agents cannot communicate while searching.
It is straightforward to see that the time until at least one agent finds the
target is at least $\Omega$(D + D 2 /k), even for very sophisticated agents,
with unrestricted memory. Our algorithmic analysis aims at establishing
connections between the time complexity and the initial knowledge held by
agents (e.g., regarding their total number k), as they commence the search. We
provide a range of both upper and lower bounds for the initial knowledge
required for obtaining fast running time. For example, we prove that log log k
+ $\Theta$(1) bits of initial information are both necessary and sufficient to
obtain asymptotically optimal running time, i.e., O(D +D 2 /k). We also we
prove that for every 0 \textless{} \textless{} 1, running in time O(log 1-- k
$\times$(D +D 2 /k)) requires that agents have the capacity for storing
$\Omega$(log k) different states as they leave the nest to start the search. To
the best of our knowledge, the lower bounds presented in this paper provide the
first non-trivial lower bounds on the memory complexity of probabilistic agents
in the context of search problems. We view this paper as a &quot;proof of concept&quot;
for a new type of interdisciplinary methodology. To fully demonstrate this
methodology, the theoretical tradeoff presented here (or a similar one) should
be combined with measurements of the time performance of searching ants.

 <dc:title>Time Complexity Analysis of a Distributed Stochastic Optimization in a
  Non-Stationary Environment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bharath, B. N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Vaishali, P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a distributed stochastic optimization problem
where the goal is to minimize the time average of a cost function subject to a
set of constraints on the time averages of related stochastic processes called
penalties. We assume that the state of the system is evolving in an independent
and non-stationary fashion and the &quot;common information&quot; available at each node
is distributed and delayed. Such stochastic optimization is an integral part of
many important problems in wireless networks such as scheduling, routing,
resource allocation and crowd sensing. We propose an approximate distributed
Drift- Plus-Penalty (DPP) algorithm, and show that it achieves a time average
cost (and penalties) that is within epsilon &gt; 0 of the optimal cost (and
constraints) with high probability. Also, we provide a condition on the
convergence time t for this result to hold. In particular, for any delay D &gt;= 0
in the common information, we use a coupling argument to prove that the
proposed algorithm converges almost surely to the optimal solution. We use an
application from wireless sensor network to corroborate our theoretical
findings through simulation results.

 <dc:description>  Dynamical compensation (DC) has been recently defined as the ability of a
biological system to keep its output dynamics unchanged in the face of varying
parameters. This concept is purported to describe a design principle that
provides robustness to physiological circuits. Here we note the similitude
between DC and Structural Identifiability (SI), and we argue that the former
can be explained in terms of (lack of) the latter. We propose to exploit this
fact by using currently existing tools for SI analysis to perform DC analysis.
We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with four physiological
circuits, for which we confirm the correspondence between DC and lack of SI. We
also warn that care should we taken when using an unidentifiable model to
extract biological insight, since lack of SI can be the result of an
inappropriate choice of model structure and therefore not necessarily a sign of
biological robustness.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Solving a large-scale regularized linear inverse problem using multiple
processors is important in various real-world applications due to the
limitations of individual processors and constraints on data sharing policies.
This paper focuses on the setting where the matrix is partitioned column-wise.
We extend the algorithmic framework and the theoretical analysis of approximate
message passing (AMP), an iterative algorithm for solving linear inverse
problems, whose asymptotic dynamics are characterized by state evolution (SE).
In particular, we show that column-wise multiprocessor AMP (C-MP-AMP) obeys an
SE under the same assumptions when the SE for AMP holds. The SE results imply
that (i) the SE of C-MP-AMP converges to a state that is no worse than that of
AMP and (ii) the asymptotic dynamics of C-MP-AMP and AMP can be identical.
Moreover, for a setting that is not covered by SE, numerical results show that
damping can improve the convergence performance of C-MP-AMP.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe and evaluate a mixed reality system that aims to
augment users in task guidance applications by combining automated and
unsupervised information collection with minimally invasive video guides. The
result is a self-contained system that we call GlaciAR (Glass-enabled
Contextual Interactions for Augmented Reality), that operates by extracting
contextual interactions from observing users performing actions. GlaciAR is
able to i) automatically determine moments of relevance based on a head motion
attention model, ii) automatically produce video guidance information, iii)
trigger these video guides based on an object detection method, iv) learn
without supervision from observing multiple users and v) operate fully on-board
a current eyewear computer (Google Glass). We describe the components of
GlaciAR together with evaluations on how users are able to use the system to
achieve three tasks. We see this work as a first step toward the development of
systems that aim to scale up the notoriously difficult authoring problem in
guidance systems and where people's natural abilities are enhanced via
minimally invasive visual guidance.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a simple and accurate neural model for dependency-based semantic
role labeling. Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on
states of a bidirectional LSTM encoder. The semantic role labeler achieves
competitive performance on English, even without any kind of syntactic
information and only using local inference. However, when automatically
predicted part-of-speech tags are provided as input, it substantially
outperforms all previous local models and approaches the best reported results
on the English CoNLL-2009 dataset. We also consider Chinese, Czech and Spanish
where our approach also achieves competitive results. Syntactic parsers are
unreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e., syntactically-informed)
SRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. Our syntax-agnostic model
appears more robust, resulting in the best reported results on standard
out-of-domain test sets.

Buckley-Osthus model for web graph. We compare different numerical methods for
PageRank calculation. With the best method we do a lot of numerical

 <dc:description>  Cloud Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has emerged as a tool for
analysis, processing and transmission of geospatial data. The Fog computing is
a paradigm where Fog devices help to increase throughput and reduce latency at
the edge of the client. This paper developed a Fog-based framework named Fog
GIS for mining analytics from geospatial data. We built a prototype using Intel
Edison, an embedded microprocessor. We validated the FogGIS by doing
preliminary analysis. including compression, and overlay analysis. Results
showed that Fog computing hold a great promise for analysis of geospatial data.
We used several open source compression techniques for reducing the
transmission to the cloud.

 <dc:title>Energy-Efficient Data Collection in Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks
  employing Distributed DCT</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nguyen, Minh</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a energy-efficient data collection method is proposed in which
an integration between Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) matrix and clustering in
wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is exploited.Based on the fact that sensory
data in WSNs is often highly correlated and is suitable to be transformed in
DCT domain, we propose that each cluster from the networks only sends a small
number of large DCT transformed coefficients to the base-station (BS) for data
collection in two common ways, either directly or in multi-hop routing. All
sensory data from the sensor network can be recovered based on the large
coefficients received at the BS. We further analyze and formulate the
communication cost as the power consumption for transmitting data in such
networks based on stochastic problems. Some common clustering algorithms are
applied and compared to verify the analysis and simulation results. Both noise
and noiseless environments for the proposed method are considered.

 <dc:title>SubCMap: Subject and Condition Specific Effect Maps</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Konukoglu, Ender</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most widely used statistical analysis methods for neuroimaging data identify
condition related structural alterations in the human brain by detecting group
differences. These methods can construct detailed maps showing population-wide
changes due to a given condition of interest using the data of an appropriate
cohort. Although very useful, they are not designed to identify
subject-specific structural alterations in a diagnostic fashion, i.e. for a new
subject without information on the condition's presence. Existing methods, such
as multivariate predictive models, can be modified for this task, however,
modifications can fall short in detection accuracy due to the design of the
original methods. In this article, we propose SubCMap, a novel method to detect
subject and condition specific structural alterations. SubCMap is designed to
work without information on condition presence in order to provide diagnostic
value. Its detections are condition-specific and can be used to study the
effects of various conditions. The method combines techniques from predictive
modeling and image restoration. It is univariate in nature and thus allows
localised interpretations. Experimental evaluation is performed on
synthetically generated data as well as data from the ADNI database. Results on
synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SubCMap compared to
population-wide techniques and higher detection accuracy compared to outlier
detection and other alternatives based on predictive modeling. Analysis with
the ADNI dataset show that SubCMap detections on cortical thickness data well
correlate with non-imaging markers of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the Mini Mental
State Examination Score and Cerebrospinal Fluid amyloid-beta levels.
Furthermore, repeatability experiments on the ADNI dataset show that SubCMap
detections are repeatable across longitudinal images to a large extent.

 <dc:title>List Decoding of Insertions and Deletions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wachter-Zeh, Antonia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  List decoding of insertions and deletions in the Levenshtein metric is
considered. The Levenshtein distance between two sequences is the minimum
number of insertions and deletions needed to turn one of the sequences into the
other. In this paper, a Johnson-like upper bound on the maximum list size when
list decoding in the Levenshtein metric is derived. This bound depends only on
the length and minimum Levenshtein distance of the code, the length of the
received word, and the alphabet size. It shows that polynomial-time list
decoding beyond half the Levenshtein distance is possible for many parameters.
Further, we also prove a lower bound on list decoding of deletions with with
the well-known binary Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes which shows that the
maximum list size grows exponentially with the number of deletions. Finally, an
efficient list decoding algorithm for two insertions/deletions with VT codes is
given. This decoder can be modified to a polynomial-time list decoder of any
constant number of insertions/deletions.

 <dc:description>  Number of published scholarly articles is growing exponentially. To tackle
this information overload, researchers are increasingly depending on niche
academic search engines. Recent works have shown that two major general web
search engines: Google and Bing, have high level of agreement in their top
search results. In contrast, we show that various academic search engines have
low degree of agreement among themselves. We performed experiments using 2500
queries over four academic search engines. We observe that overlap in search
result sets of any pair of academic search engines is significantly low and in
most of the cases the search result sets are mutually exclusive. We also
discuss implications of this low overlap.

recognition performance of synthetic versus real data augmentation, and image

different training choices such as class-balancing, sample-weighting and
explicit modeling the background class (i.e. no-logo regions). Experimental
results confirm the feasibility of the proposed method, that outperforms the
methods in the state of the art.

 <dc:title>Constraint Satisfaction Problems over semilattice block Mal'tsev
  algebras</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bulatov, Andrei A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There are two well known types of algorithms for solving CSPs: local
propagation and generating a basis of the solution space. For several years the
focus of the CSP research has been on `hybrid' algorithms that somehow combine
the two approaches. In this paper we present a new method of such hybridization
that allows us to solve certain CSPs that has been out of reach for a quite a
while. We consider these method on a fairly restricted class of CSPs given by
algebras we will call semilattice block Mal'tsev. An algebra A is called
semilattice block Mal'tsev if it has a binary operation f, a ternary operation
m, and a congruence s such that the quotient A/s with operation $f$ is a
semilattice, $f$ is a projection on every block of s, and every block of s is a
Mal'tsev algebra with Mal'tsev operation m. We show that the constraint
satisfaction problem over a semilattice block Mal'tsev algebra is solvable in
polynomial time.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This version features a different proof of the main result, which
  uses an approach closer to that in [Andrei A. Bulatov: A dichotomy theorem

 <dc:title>Greed is Good: Optimistic Algorithms for Bipartite-Graph Partial
  Coloring on Multicore Architectures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In parallel computing, a valid graph coloring yields a lock-free processing
of the colored tasks, data points, etc., without expensive synchronization
mechanisms. However, coloring is not free and the overhead can be significant.
In particular, for the bipartite-graph partial coloring (BGPC) and distance-2
graph coloring (D2GC) problems, which have various use-cases within the
scientific computing and numerical optimization domains, the coloring overhead
can be in the order of minutes with a single thread for many real-life graphs.
  In this work, we propose parallel algorithms for bipartite-graph partial
coloring on shared-memory architectures. Compared to the existing shared-memory
BGPC algorithms, the proposed ones employ greedier and more optimistic
techniques that yield a better parallel coloring performance. In particular, on
16 cores, the proposed algorithms perform more than 4x faster than their
counterparts in the ColPack library which is, to the best of our knowledge, the
only publicly-available coloring library for multicore architectures. In
addition to BGPC, the proposed techniques are employed to devise parallel
distance-2 graph coloring algorithms and similar performance improvements have
been observed. Finally, we propose two costless balancing heuristics for BGPC
that can reduce the skewness and imbalance on the cardinality of color sets
(almost) for free. The heuristics can also be used for the D2GC problem and in
general, they will probably yield a better color-based parallelization
performance especially on many-core architectures.

 <dc:description>  Could we use Computer Vision in the Internet of Things for using pictures as
sensors? This is the principal hypothesis that we want to resolve. Currently,
in order to create safety areas, cities, or homes, people use IP cameras.
Nevertheless, this system needs people who watch the camera images, watch the
recording after something occurred, or watch when the camera notifies them of
any movement. These are the disadvantages. Furthermore, there are many Smart
Cities and Smart Homes around the world. This is why we thought of using the
idea of the Internet of Things to add a way of automating the use of IP
cameras. In our case, we propose the analysis of pictures through Computer
Vision to detect people in the analysed pictures. With this analysis, we are
able to obtain if these pictures contain people and handle the pictures as if
they were sensors with two possible states. Notwithstanding, Computer Vision is
a very complicated field. This is why we needed a second hypothesis: Could we
work with Computer Vision in the Internet of Things with a good accuracy to
automate or semi-automate this kind of events? The demonstration of these
hypotheses required a testing over our Computer Vision module to check the
possibilities that we have to use this module in a possible real environment
with a good accuracy. Our proposal, as a possible solution, is the analysis of
entire sequence instead of isolated pictures for using pictures as sensors in
the Internet of Things.

 <dc:description>  Many practical scenarios make it necessary to evaluate top-k queries over
data items with partially unknown values. This paper considers a setting where
the values are taken from a numerical domain, and where some partial order
constraints are given over known and unknown values: under these constraints,
we assume that all possible worlds are equally likely. Our work is the first to
propose a principled scheme to derive the value distributions and expected
values of unknown items in this setting, with the goal of computing estimated
top-k results by interpolating the unknown values from the known ones. We study
the complexity of this general task, and show tight complexity bounds, proving
that the problem is intractable, but can be tractably approximated. We then
consider the case of tree-shaped partial orders, where we show a constructive
PTIME solution. We also compare our problem setting to other top-k definitions
on uncertain data.

 <dc:description>  Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a crucial component of the future
autonomous driving systems since it enables improved awareness of the
surrounding environment, even without extensive processing of sensory
information. However, V2V communication is prone to failures and delays, so a
distributed fault-tolerant approach is required for safe and efficient
transportation. In this paper, we focus on the intersection crossing (IC)
problem with autonomous vehicles that cooperate via V2V communications, and
propose a novel distributed IC algorithm that can handle an unknown number of
communication failures. Our analysis shows that both safety and liveness
requirements are satisfied in all realistic situations. We also found, based on
a real data set, that the crossing delay is only slightly increased even in the
presence of highly correlated failures.

 <dc:title>Why Can't You Behave? Non-termination Analysis of Direct Recursive Rules
  with Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with rule-based programs that go wrong. The unwanted
behavior of rule applications is non-termination or failure of a computation.
We propose a static program analysis of the non-termination problem for
recursion in the Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) language.
  CHR is an advanced concurrent declarative language involving constraint
reasoning. It has been closely related to many other rule-based approaches, so
the results are of a more general interest. In such languages, non-termination
is due to infinite applications of recursive rules. Failure is due to
accumulation of contradicting constraints during the computation.
  We give theorems with so-called misbehavior conditions for potential
non-termination and failure (as well as definite termination) of linear direct
recursive simplification rules. Logical relationships between the constraints
in a recursive rule play a crucial role in this kind of program analysis. We
think that our approach can be extended to other types of recursion and to a
more general class of rules. Therefore this paper can serve as a basic
reference and a starting point for further research.

 <dc:title>Algebras of Information. A New and Extended Axiomatic Foundation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kohlas, Juerg</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>08A, 06F, 68-02, 68Q87</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The basic idea behind information algebras is that information comes in
pieces, each referring to a certain question, that these pieces can be combined
or aggregated and that the part relating to a given question can be extracted.
This algebraic structure can be given different forms. Questions were
originally represented by subsets of variables. Pieces of information were then
represented by valuations associated with the domains of variables. This leads
to an algebraic structure called valuation algebras. The basic axiomatics of
this algebraic structure was in essence proposed by Shenoy and Shafer. Here a
much more general view of systems of questions is proposed and pieces of
information are related to the elements of this system of questions. This leads
to a new and extended system of axioms for information algebras. Classical
valuation algebras are essentially a special case of this new system. A full
discussion of the algebraic theory of this new information algebras is given,
including local computation, duality between labeled and domain-free versions
of the algebras, order of information, finiteness of information and
approximation, compact and continuous information algebras. Finally a rather
complete discussion of uncertain information, based on random maps into
information algebras is presented. This is shown to represent a generalisation
of classical Dempster-Shafer theory.

 <dc:title>Towards parallelizable sampling-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bobiti, R. V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lazar, M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new sampling-based nonlinear model predictive control
(MPC) algorithm, with a bound on complexity quadratic in the prediction horizon
N and linear in the number of samples. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to
use the sequence of predicted inputs from the previous time step as a warm
start, and to iteratively update this sequence by changing its elements one by
one, starting from the last predicted input and ending with the first predicted
input. This strategy, which resembles the dynamic programming principle, allows
for parallelization up to a certain level and yields a suboptimal nonlinear MPC
algorithm with guaranteed recursive feasibility, stability and improved cost
function at every iteration, which is suitable for real-time implementation.
The complexity of the algorithm per each time step in the prediction horizon
depends only on the horizon, the number of samples and parallel threads, and it
is independent of the measured system state. Comparisons with the fmincon
nonlinear optimization solver on benchmark examples indicate that as the
simulation time progresses, the proposed algorithm converges rapidly to the
&quot;optimal&quot; solution, even when using a small number of samples.

 <dc:description>  This paper reviews the historic of ChaLearn Looking at People (LAP) events.
We started in 2011 (with the release of the first Kinect device) to run
challenges related to human action/activity and gesture recognition. Since then
we have regularly organized events in a series of competitions covering all
aspects of visual analysis of humans. So far we have organized more than 10
international challenges and events in this field. This paper reviews
associated events, and introduces the ChaLearn LAP platform where public
resources (including code, data and preprints of papers) related to the
organized events are available. We also provide a discussion on perspectives of
ChaLearn LAP activities.

 <dc:description>  Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) is both an effective concurrent declarative
constraint-based programming language and a versatile computational formalism.
While conceptually simple, CHR is distinguished by a remarkable combination of
desirable features: - semantic foundation in classical and linear logic, -
effective and efficient sequential and parallel execution model - guaranteed
properties like the anytime online algorithm properties - powerful analysis
methods for deciding essential program properties. This overview of CHR
research and applications is by no complete. It concentrates on the years since
2000. Up-to-date information on CHR can be found at the CHR web-site
www.constraint-handling-rules.org, including the slides of the keynote talk
associated with this article, an extensive bibliography, online demo versions
and free downloads of the language.

 <dc:description>  With the evolution of HDTV and Ultra HDTV, the bandwidth requirement for
IP-based TV content is rapidly increasing. Consumers demand uninterrupted
service with a high Quality of Experience (QoE). Service providers are
constantly trying to differentiate themselves by innovating new ways of
distributing content more efficiently with lower cost and higher penetration.
In this work, we propose a cost-efficient wireless framework (WiLiTV) for
delivering live TV services, consisting of a mix of wireless access
technologies (e.g. Satellite, WiFi and LTE overlay links). In the proposed
architecture, live TV content is injected into the network at a few residential
locations using satellite dishes. The content is then further distributed to
other homes using a house-to-house WiFi network or via an overlay LTE network.
Our problem is to construct an optimal TV distribution network with the minimum
number of satellite injection points, while preserving the highest QoE, for
different neighborhood densities. We evaluate the framework using realistic
time-varying demand patterns and a diverse set of home location data. Our study
demonstrates that the architecture requires 75 - 90% fewer satellite injection
points, compared to traditional architectures. Furthermore, we show that most
cost savings can be obtained using simple and practical relay routing
solutions.

 <dc:description>  First-order logic (FO) over words is shown to be equiexpressive with FO
equipped with a restricted set of numerical predicates, namely the order, a
binary predicate MSB$_0$, and the finite-degree predicates: FO[Arb] = FO[&lt;,
MSB$_0$, Fin].
  The Crane Beach Property (CBP), introduced more than a decade ago, is true of
a logic if all the expressible languages admitting a neutral letter are
regular.
  Although it is known that FO[Arb] does not have the CBP, it is shown here
that the (strong form of the) CBP holds for both FO[&lt;, Fin] and FO[&lt;, MSB$_0$].
Thus FO[&lt;, Fin] exhibits a form of locality and the CBP, and can still express
a wide variety of languages, while being one simple predicate away from the
expressive power of FO[Arb]. The counting ability of FO[&lt;, Fin] is studied as
an application.

 <dc:description>  It's useful to automatically transform an image from its original form to
some synthetic form (style, partial contents, etc.), while keeping the original
structure or semantics. We define this requirement as the &quot;image-to-image
translation&quot; problem, and propose a general approach to achieve it, based on
deep convolutional and conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs),
which has gained a phenomenal success to learn mapping images from noise input
since 2014. In this work, we develop a two step (unsupervised) learning method
to translate images between different domains by using unlabeled images without
specifying any correspondence between them, so that to avoid the cost of
acquiring labeled data. Compared with prior works, we demonstrated the capacity
of generality in our model, by which variance of translations can be conduct by
a single type of model. Such capability is desirable in applications like
bidirectional translation

 <dc:title>A Devil's Advocate against Termination of Direct Recursion</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A devil's advocate is one who argues against a claim, not as a committed
opponent but in order to determine the validity of the claim. We are interested
in a devil's advocate that argues against termination of a program. He does so
by producing a maleficent program that can cause the non-termination of the
original program. By inspecting and running the malicious program, one may gain
insight into the potential reasons for non-termination and produce
counterexamples for termination.
  We introduce our method using the concurrent programming language Constraint
Handling Rules (CHR). Like in other declarative languages, non-termination
occurs through unbounded recursion. Given a self-recursive rule, we
automatically generate one or more devil's rules from it. The construction of
the devil's rules is straightforward and involves no guessing. The devil's
rules can be simple. For example, they are non-recursive for rules with single
recursion.
  We show that the devil's rules are maximally vicious in the following sense:
For any program that contains the self-recursive rule and for any infinite
computation through that rule in that program, there is a corresponding
infinite computation with the recursive rule and the devil's rules alone. In
that case, the malicious rules serve as a finite witness for non-termination.
On the other hand, if the devil's rules do not exhibit an infinite computation,
the recursive rule is unconditionally terminating. We also identify cases where
the static analysis of the devil's rule decides termination or non-termination
of the recursive rule.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper presents the graph Fourier transform (GFT) of a signal in terms of
its spectral decomposition over the Jordan subspaces of the graph adjacency
matrix $A$. This representation is unique and coordinate free, and it leads to
unambiguous definition of the spectral components (&quot;harmonics&quot;) of a graph
signal. This is particularly meaningful when $A$ has repeated eigenvalues, and
it is very useful when $A$ is defective or not diagonalizable (as it may be the
case with directed graphs). Many real world large sparse graphs have defective
adjacency matrices. We present properties of the GFT and show it to satisfy a
generalized Parseval inequality and to admit a total variation ordering of the
spectral components. We express the GFT in terms of spectral projectors and
present an illustrative example for a real world large urban traffic dataset.

 <dc:description>  For any group $G$ and any set $A$, a cellular automaton (CA) is a
transformation of the configuration space $A^G$ defined via a finite memory set
and a local function. Let $\text{CA}(G;A)$ be the monoid of all CA over $A^G$.
In this paper, we investigate a generalisation of the inverse of a CA from the
semigroup-theoretic perspective. An element $\tau \in \text{CA}(G;A)$ is von
Neumann regular (or simply regular) if there exists $\sigma \in \text{CA}(G;A)$
such that $\tau \circ \sigma \circ \tau = \tau$ and $\sigma \circ \tau \circ
\sigma = \sigma$, where $\circ$ is the composition of functions. Such an
element $\sigma$ is called a generalised inverse of $\tau$. The monoid
$\text{CA}(G;A)$ itself is regular if all its elements are regular. We
establish that $\text{CA}(G;A)$ is regular if and only if $\vert G \vert = 1$
or $\vert A \vert = 1$, and we characterise all regular elements in
$\text{CA}(G;A)$ when $G$ and $A$ are both finite. Furthermore, we study
regular linear CA when $A= V$ is a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$; in
particular, we show that every regular linear CA is invertible when $G$ is
torsion-free elementary amenable (e.g. when $G=\mathbb{Z}^d, \ d \in
\mathbb{N}$) and $V=\mathbb{F}$, and that every linear CA is regular when $V$
is finite-dimensional and $G$ is locally finite with $\text{Char}(\mathbb{F})
\nmid o(g)$ for all $g \in G$.

 <dc:description>  Social media are massive marketplaces in which memes compete for our
attention. We investigate the conditions in which the best ideas prevail in a
stylized model of online social network, where agents have behavioral
limitations in managing a heavy flow of information. We measure the
relationship between the quality of an idea and its likelihood to become
prevalent at the system level. We find that both information overload and
limited attention contribute to a degradation in the market's discriminative
power. A good tradeoff between discriminative power and diversity of
information is possible according to the model. However, calibration with
empirical data characterizing information load and finite attention in real
social media reveals a weak correlation between quality and popularity of
information. In these realistic conditions, the model predicts that low-quality
information is just as likely to go viral, providing an interpretation for the
high volume of misinformation we observe online.

 <dc:description>  Although Deep Convolutional Networks (DCNs) are approaching the accuracy of
human observers at object recognition, it is unknown whether they leverage
similar visual representations to achieve this performance. To address this, we
introduce Clicktionary, a web-based game for identifying visual features used
by human observers during object recognition. Importance maps derived from the
game are consistent across participants and uncorrelated with image saliency
measures. These results suggest that Clicktionary identifies image regions that
are meaningful and diagnostic for object recognition but different than those
driving eye movements. Surprisingly, Clicktionary importance maps are only
weakly correlated with relevance maps derived from DCNs trained for object
recognition. Our study demonstrates that the narrowing gap between the object
recognition accuracy of human observers and DCNs obscures distinct visual
strategies used by each to achieve this performance.

 <dc:description>  Batch codes, first introduced by Ishai, Kushilevitz, Ostrovsky, and Sahai,
mimic a distributed storage of a set of $n$ data items on $m$ servers, in such
a way that any batch of $k$ data items can be retrieved by reading at most some
$t$ symbols from each server. Combinatorial batch codes, are replication-based
batch codes in which each server stores a subset of the data items.
  In this paper, we propose a generalization of combinatorial batch codes,
called multiset combinatorial batch codes (MCBC), in which $n$ data items are
stored in $m$ servers, such that any multiset request of $k$ items, where any
item is requested at most $r$ times, can be retrieved by reading at most $t$
items from each server. The setup of this new family of codes is motivated by
recent work on codes which enable high availability and parallel reads in
distributed storage systems. The main problem under this paradigm is to
minimize the number of items stored in the servers, given the values of
$n,m,k,r,t$, which is denoted by $N(n,k,m,t;r)$. We first give a necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of MCBCs. Then, we present several
bounds on $N(n,k,m,t;r)$ and constructions of MCBCs. In particular, we
determine the value of $N(n,k,m,1;r)$ for any $n\geq
\left\lfloor\frac{k-1}{r}\right\rfloor{m\choose k-1}-(m-k+1)A(m,4,k-2)$, where
$A(m,4,k-2)$ is the maximum size of a binary constant weight code of length
$m$, distance four and weight $k-2$. We also determine the exact value of
$N(n,k,m,1;r)$ when $r\in\{k,k-1\}$ or $k=m$.

 <dc:title>Distributed Estimation of Dynamic Fields over Multi-agent Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work presents distributed algorithms for estimation of time-varying
random fields over multi-agent/sensor networks. A network of sensors makes
sparse and noisy local measurements of the dynamic field. Each sensor aims to
obtain unbiased distributed estimates of the entire field with bounded
mean-squared error (MSE) based on its own local observations and its neighbors'
estimates. This work develops three novel distributed estimators:
Pseudo-Innovations Kalman Filter (PIKF), Distributed Information Kalman Filter
(DIKF) and Consensus+Innovations Kalman Filter (CIKF). We design the gain
matrices such that the estimators achieve unbiased estimates with bounded MSE
under minimal assumptions on the local observation and network communication
models. This work establishes trade-offs between these three distributed
estimators and demonstrates how they outperform existing solutions. We validate
our results through extensive numerical evaluations.

 <dc:description>  There are many occasions in which the security community is interested to
discover the authorship of malware binaries, either for digital forensics
analysis of malware corpora or for thwarting live threats of malware invasion.
Such a discovery of authorship might be possible due to stylistic features
inherent to software codes written by human programmers. Existing studies of
authorship attribution of general purpose software mainly focus on source code,
which is typically based on the style of programs and environment. However,
those features critically depend on the availability of the program source
code, which is usually not the case when dealing with malware binaries. Such
program binaries often do not retain many semantic or stylistic features due to
the compilation process. Therefore, authorship attribution in the domain of
malware binaries based on features and styles that will survive the compilation
process is challenging. This paper provides the state of the art in this
literature. Further, we analyze the features involved in those techniques. By
using a case study, we identify features that can survive the compilation
process. Finally, we analyze existing works on binary authorship attribution
and study their applicability to real malware binaries.

 <dc:description>  This chapter presents an H-infinity filtering framework for cloud-aided
semiactive suspension system with time-varying delays. In this system, road
profile information is downloaded from a cloud database to facilitate onboard
estimation of suspension states. Time-varying data transmission delays are
considered and assumed to be bounded. A quarter-car linear suspension model is
used and an H-infinity filter is designed with both onboard sensor measurements
and delayed road profile information from the cloud. The filter design
procedure is designed based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Numerical
simulation results are reported that illustrates the fusion of cloud-based and
on-board information that can be achieved in Vehicleto- Cloud-to-Vehicle
(V2C2V) implementation.

 <dc:description>  Humans have rich understanding of liquid containers and their contents; for
example, we can effortlessly pour water from a pitcher to a cup. Doing so
requires estimating the volume of the cup, approximating the amount of water in
the pitcher, and predicting the behavior of water when we tilt the pitcher.
Very little attention in computer vision has been made to liquids and their
containers. In this paper, we study liquid containers and their contents, and
propose methods to estimate the volume of containers, approximate the amount of
liquid in them, and perform comparative volume estimations all from a single
RGB image. Furthermore, we show the results of the proposed model for
predicting the behavior of liquids inside containers when one tilts the
containers. We also introduce a new dataset of Containers Of liQuid contEnt
(COQE) that contains more than 5,000 images of 10,000 liquid containers in
context labelled with volume, amount of content, bounding box annotation, and
corresponding similar 3D CAD models.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective models for reducing
spectral variations and modeling spectral correlations in acoustic features for
automatic speech recognition (ASR). Hybrid speech recognition systems
incorporating CNNs with Hidden Markov Models/Gaussian Mixture Models
(HMMs/GMMs) have achieved the state-of-the-art in various benchmarks.
Meanwhile, Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) with Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs), which is proposed for labeling unsegmented sequences, makes it
feasible to train an end-to-end speech recognition system instead of hybrid
settings. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and sometimes difficult
to train. In this paper, inspired by the advantages of both CNNs and the CTC
approach, we propose an end-to-end speech framework for sequence labeling, by
combining hierarchical CNNs with CTC directly without recurrent connections. By
evaluating the approach on the TIMIT phoneme recognition task, we show that the
proposed model is not only computationally efficient, but also competitive with
the existing baseline systems. Moreover, we argue that CNNs have the capability
to model temporal correlations with appropriate context information.

consists in scheduling the management of Web Advertising (Adv) campaign between
Trafficking campaigns in the most efficient way to oversee and manage
relationship with partners and internal teams, managing expectations through
integration and post-launch in order to ensure success for every stakeholders
involved. For our own interest we did that independent research projects also
through specific innovative tasks validate towards average working time
declared on &quot;specification required&quot; by the main worldwide industry leading
Advertising Agency. We present a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
formulation for end-to-end management of campaign workflow along a
predetermined path and generalize it to include alternative path to oversee and
manage detail-oriented relationship with partners and internal teams to achieve
the goals above mentioned. To meet clients' KPIs, we consider an objective
function that includes the punctuality indicators (the average waiting time and
completion times) but also the main punctuality indicators (the average delay
and the on time performance). Then we investigate their analytical
relationships in the advertising domain through experiments based on real data
from a Traffic Office. We show that the classic punctuality indicators are in
contradiction with the task of reducing waiting times. We propose new
indicators used for a synthesize analysis on projects or process changes for
the wider team that are more sustainable, but also more relevant for
stakeholders. We also show that the flow of a campaign (adv-ways) is the main
bottleneck of a Traffic Office and that alternate paths cannot improve the
performance indicators.

 <dc:description>  Social media users and microbloggers post about a wide variety of (off-line)
collective social activities as they participate in them, ranging from concerts
and sporting events to political rallies and civil protests. In this context,
people who take part in the same collective social activity often post closely
related content from nearby locations at similar times, resulting in
distinctive spatiotemporal patterns. Can we automatically detect these patterns
and thus provide insights into the associated activities? In this paper, we
propose a modeling framework for clustering streaming spatiotemporal data, the
Spatial Dirichlet Hawkes Process (SDHP), which allows us to automatically
uncover a wide variety of spatiotemporal patterns of collective social activity
from geolocated online traces. Moreover, we develop an efficient, online
inference algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo that scales to millions of
geolocated posts. Experiments on synthetic data and real data gathered from
Twitter show that our framework can recover a wide variety of meaningful social
activity patterns in terms of both content and spatiotemporal dynamics, that it
yields interesting insights about these patterns, and that it can be used to
estimate the location from where a tweet was posted.

the column subset selection problem (CSSP), we need to minimize the quantity
$\|M-SA\|$, where $A$ can be an arbitrary $k\times c$ matrix, and $S$ runs over

numerical linear algebra are being discussed for several decades, but its
algorithmic complexity remained an open issue. We show that CSSP is
NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of universal joint clustering and registration of
images and define algorithms using multivariate information functionals. We
first study registering two images using maximum mutual information and prove
its asymptotic optimality. We then show the shortcomings of pairwise
registration in multi-image registration, and design an asymptotically optimal
algorithm based on multiinformation. Further, we define a novel multivariate
information functional to perform joint clustering and registration of images,
and prove consistency of the algorithm. Finally, we consider registration and
clustering of numerous limited-resolution images, defining algorithms that are
order-optimal in scaling of number of pixels in each image with the number of

 <dc:description>  Motivated by applications in computational advertising and systems biology,
we consider the problem of identifying the best out of several possible soft
interventions at a source node $V$ in an acyclic causal directed graph, to
maximize the expected value of a target node $Y$ (located downstream of $V$).
Our setting imposes a fixed total budget for sampling under various
interventions, along with cost constraints on different types of interventions.
We pose this as a best arm identification bandit problem with $K$ arms where
each arm is a soft intervention at $V,$ and leverage the information leakage
among the arms to provide the first gap dependent error and simple regret
bounds for this problem. Our results are a significant improvement over the
traditional best arm identification results. We empirically show that our
algorithms outperform the state of the art in the Flow Cytometry data-set, and
also apply our algorithm for model interpretation of the Inception-v3 deep net
that classifies images.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We outline a bidirectional translation system that converts sentences from
American Sign Language (ASL) to English, and vice versa. To perform machine
translation between ASL and English, we utilize a generative approach.
Specifically, we employ an adjustment to the IBM word-alignment model 1 (IBM
WAM1), where we define language models for English and ASL, as well as a
translation model, and attempt to generate a translation that maximizes the
posterior distribution defined by these models. Then, using these models, we
are able to quantify the concepts of fluency and faithfulness of a translation
between languages.

 <dc:description>  Human activities from hunting to emailing are performed in a fractal-like
scale invariant pattern. These patterns are considered efficient for hunting or
foraging, but are they efficient for gathering information? Here we link the
scale invariant pattern of inter-touch intervals on the smartphone to optimal
strategies for information gathering. We recorded touchscreen touches in 65
individuals for a month and categorized the activity into checking for
information vs. sharing content. For both categories, the inter-touch intervals
were well described by power-law fits spanning 5 orders of magnitude, from 1 s
to several hours. The power-law exponent typically found for checking was 1.5
and for generating it was 1.3. Next, by using computer simulations we addressed
whether the checking pattern was efficient - in terms of minimizing futile
attempts yielding no new information. We find that the best performing power
law exponent depends on the duration of the assessment and the exponent of 1.5
was the most efficient in the short-term i.e. in the few minutes range.
Finally, we addressed whether how people generated and shared content was in
tune with the checking pattern. We assumed that the unchecked posts must be
minimized for maximal efficiency and according to our analysis the most
efficient temporal pattern to share content was the exponent of 1.3 - which was
also the pattern displayed by the smartphone users. The behavioral organization
for content generation is different from content consumption across time
scales. We propose that this difference is a signature of optimal behavior and
the short-term assessments used in modern human actions.

 <dc:description>  During the last decades, the number of new full-reference image quality
assessment algorithms has been increasing drastically. Yet, despite of the
remarkable progress that has been made, the medical ultrasound image similarity
measurement remains largely unsolved due to a high level of speckle noise
contamination. Potential applications of the ultrasound image similarity
measurement seem evident in several aspects. To name a few, ultrasound imaging
quality assessment, abnormal function region detection, etc. In this paper, a
comparative study was made on full-reference image quality assessment methods
for ultrasound image visual structural similarity measure. Moreover, based on
the image similarity index, a generic ultrasound motion tracking
re-initialization framework is given in this work. The experiments are
conducted on synthetic data and real-ultrasound liver data and the results
demonstrate that, with proposed similarity-based tracking re-initialization,
the mean error of landmarks tracking can be decreased from 2 mm to about 1.5 mm
in the ultrasound liver sequence.

 <dc:description>  Recent work in distance metric learning has focused on learning
transformations of data that best align with specified pairwise similarity and
dissimilarity constraints, often supplied by a human observer. The learned
transformations lead to improved retrieval, classification, and clustering
algorithms due to the better adapted distance or similarity measures. Here, we
address the problem of learning these transformations when the underlying
constraint generation process is nonstationary. This nonstationarity can be due
to changes in either the ground-truth clustering used to generate constraints
or changes in the feature subspaces in which the class structure is apparent.
We propose Online Convex Ensemble StrongLy Adaptive Dynamic Learning (OCELAD),
a general adaptive, online approach for learning and tracking optimal metrics
as they change over time that is highly robust to a variety of nonstationary
behaviors in the changing metric. We apply the OCELAD framework to an ensemble
of online learners. Specifically, we create a retro-initialized composite
objective mirror descent (COMID) ensemble (RICE) consisting of a set of
parallel COMID learners with different learning rates, and demonstrate
parameter-free RICE-OCELAD metric learning on both synthetic data and a highly
nonstationary Twitter dataset. We show significant performance improvements and
increased robustness to nonstationary effects relative to previously proposed
batch and online distance metric learning algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The regular separability problem asks, for two given languages, if there
exists a regular language including one of them but disjoint from the other.
Our main result is decidability, and PSpace-completeness, of the regular
separability problem for languages of one counter automata without zero tests
(also known as one counter nets). This contrasts with undecidability of the
regularity problem for one counter nets, and with undecidability of the regular
separability problem for one counter automata, which is our second result.

 <dc:description>  LTE evolved Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (eMBMS) is an attractive
solution for video delivery to very large groups in crowded venues. However,
deployment and management of eMBMS systems is challenging, due to the lack of
realtime feedback from the User Equipment (UEs). Therefore, we present the
Dynamic Monitoring (DyMo) system for low-overhead feedback collection. DyMo
leverages eMBMS for broadcasting Stochastic Group Instructions to all UEs.
These instructions indicate the reporting rates as a function of the observed
Quality of Service (QoS). This simple feedback mechanism collects very limited
QoS reports from the UEs. The reports are used for network optimization,
thereby ensuring high QoS to the UEs. We present the design aspects of DyMo and
evaluate its performance analytically and via extensive simulations.
Specifically, we show that DyMo infers the optimal eMBMS settings with
extremely low overhead, while meeting strict QoS requirements under different
UE mobility patterns and presence of network component failures. For instance,
DyMo can detect the eMBMS Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) experienced by the 0.1%
percentile of the UEs with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05% with only 5
to 10 reports per second regardless of the number of UEs.

 <dc:description>  Learning-based binary hashing has become a powerful paradigm for fast search
and retrieval in massive databases. However, due to the requirement of discrete
outputs for the hash functions, learning such functions is known to be very
challenging. In addition, the objective functions adopted by existing hashing
techniques are mostly chosen heuristically. In this paper, we propose a novel
generative approach to learn hash functions through Minimum Description Length
principle such that the learned hash codes maximally compress the dataset and
can also be used to regenerate the inputs. We also develop an efficient
learning algorithm based on the stochastic distributional gradient, which
avoids the notorious difficulty caused by binary output constraints, to jointly
optimize the parameters of the hash function and the associated generative
model. Extensive experiments on a variety of large-scale datasets show that the
proposed method achieves better retrieval results than the existing
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows that for any random variables $X$ and $Y$, it is possible to
represent $Y$ as a function of $(X,Z)$ such that $Z$ is independent of $X$ and
$I(X;Z|Y)\le\log(I(X;Y)+1)+4$ bits. We use this strong functional
representation lemma (SFRL) to establish a bound on the rate needed for
one-shot exact channel simulation for general (discrete or continuous) random
variables, strengthening the results by Harsha et al. and Braverman and Garg,
and to establish new and simple achievability results for one-shot
variable-length lossy source coding, multiple description coding and Gray-Wyner
system. We also show that the SFRL can be used to reduce the channel with state
noncausally known at the encoder to a point-to-point channel, which provides a
simple achievability proof of the Gelfand-Pinsker theorem.

 <dc:description>  Despite significant progress, image saliency detection still remains a
challenging task in complex scenes and environments. Integrating multiple
different but complementary cues, like RGB and Thermal (RGB-T), may be an
effective way for boosting saliency detection performance. The current research
in this direction, however, is limited by the lack of a comprehensive
benchmark. This work contributes such a RGB-T image dataset, which includes 821
spatially aligned RGB-T image pairs and their ground truth annotations for
saliency detection purpose. The image pairs are with high diversity recorded
under different scenes and environmental conditions, and we annotate 11
challenges on these image pairs for performing the challenge-sensitive analysis
for different saliency detection algorithms. We also implement 3 kinds of
baseline methods with different modality inputs to provide a comprehensive
comparison platform.
  With this benchmark, we propose a novel approach, multi-task manifold ranking
with cross-modality consistency, for RGB-T saliency detection. In particular,
we introduce a weight for each modality to describe the reliability, and
integrate them into the graph-based manifold ranking algorithm to achieve
adaptive fusion of different source data. Moreover, we incorporate the
cross-modality consistent constraints to integrate different modalities
collaboratively. For the optimization, we design an efficient algorithm to
iteratively solve several subproblems with closed-form solutions. Extensive
experiments against other baseline methods on the newly created benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and we also provide
basic insights and potential future research directions for RGB-T saliency
detection.

 <dc:description>  The problem of recovering a signal from its power spectrum, called phase
retrieval, arises in many scientific fields. One of many examples is
ultra-short laser pulse characterization in which the electromagnetic field is
oscillating with ~10^15 Hz and phase information cannot be measured directly
due to limitations of the electronic sensors. Phase retrieval is ill-posed in
most cases as there are many different signals with the same Fourier transform
magnitude. To overcome this fundamental ill-posedness, several measurement
techniques are used in practice. One of the most popular methods for complete
characterization of ultra-short laser pulses is the Frequency-Resolved Optical
Gating (FROG). In FROG, the acquired data is the power spectrum of the product
of the unknown pulse with its delayed replica. Therefore the measured signal is
a quartic function of the unknown pulse. A generalized version of FROG, where
the delayed replica is replaced by a second unknown pulse, is called blind
FROG. In this case, the measured signal is quadratic with respect to both
pulses. In this letter we introduce and formulate FROG-type techniques. We then
show that almost all band-limited signals are determined uniquely, up to
trivial ambiguities, by blind FROG measurements (and thus also by FROG), if in
addition we have access to the signals power spectrum.

 <dc:description>  Two strings x and y are said to be Abelian equivalent if x is a permutation
of y, or vice versa. If a string z satisfies z = xy with x and y being Abelian
equivalent, then z is said to be an Abelian square. If a string w can be
factorized into a sequence v_1,...,v_s of strings such that v_1 ,..., v_{s-1}
are all Abelian equivalent and vs is a substring of a permutation of v_1, then
w is said to have a regular Abelian period (p,t) where p = |v_1| and t = |v_s|.
If a substring w_1[i..i+l-1] of a string w_1 and a substring w_2[j..j+l-1] of
another string w_2 are Abelian equivalent, then the substrings are said to be a
common Abelian factor of w_1 and w_2 and if the length l is the maximum of such
then the substrings are said to be a longest common Abelian factor of w_1 and
w_2. We propose efficient algorithms which compute these Abelian regularities
using the run length encoding (RLE) of strings. For a given string w of length
n whose RLE is of size m, we propose algorithms which compute all Abelian
squares occurring in w in O(mn) time, and all regular Abelian periods of w in
O(mn) time. For two given strings w_1 and w_2 of total length n and of total
RLE size m, we propose an algorithm which computes all longest common Abelian
factors in O(m^2n) time.

 <dc:title>Extensible Datasort Refinements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dunfield, Joshua</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Refinement types turn typechecking into lightweight verification. The classic
form of refinement type is the datasort refinement, in which datasorts identify
subclasses of inductive datatypes.
  Existing type systems for datasort refinements require that all the
refinements of a type be specified when the type is declared; multiple
refinements of the same type can be obtained only by duplicating type
definitions, and consequently, duplicating code.
  We enrich the traditional notion of a signature, which describes the
inhabitants of datasorts, to allow re-refinement via signature extension,
without duplicating definitions. Since arbitrary updates to a signature can
invalidate the inversion principles used to check case expressions, we develop
a definition of signature well-formedness that ensures that extensions maintain
existing inversion principles. This definition allows different parts of a
program to extend the same signature in different ways, without conflicting
with each other. Each part can be type-checked independently, allowing separate
compilation.

 <dc:title>Solving Partial Differential Equations on Manifolds From Incomplete

 <dc:description>  Solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds have provided
important applications in different fields in science and engineering. Existing
methods are majorly based on discretization of manifolds as implicit functions,
triangle meshes, or point clouds, where the manifold structure is approximated
by either zero level set of an implicit function or a set of points. In many
applications, manifolds might be only provided as an inter-point distance
matrix with possible missing values. This paper discusses a framework to
discretize PDEs on manifolds represented as incomplete inter-point distance
information. Without conducting a time-consuming global coordinates
reconstruction, we propose a more efficient strategy by discretizing
differential operators only based on point-wisely local reconstruction. Our
local reconstruction model is based on the recent advances of low-rank matrix
completion theory, where only a very small random portion of distance
information is required. This method enables us to conduct analyses of
incomplete distance data using solutions of special designed PDEs such as the
Laplace-Beltrami (LB) eigen-system. As an application, we demonstrate a new way
of manifold reconstruction from an incomplete distance by stitching patches
using the spectrum of the LB operator. Intensive numerical experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

 <dc:title>Selecting optimal minimum spanning trees that share a topological

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Combinatorics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Choi et. al (2011) introduced a minimum spanning tree (MST)-based method
called CLGrouping, for constructing tree-structured probabilistic graphical
models, a statistical framework that is commonly used for inferring
phylogenetic trees. While CLGrouping works correctly if there is a unique MST,
we observe an indeterminacy in the method in the case that there are multiple
MSTs. In this work we remove this indeterminacy by introducing so-called
vertex-ranked MSTs. We note that the effectiveness of CLGrouping is inversely
related to the number of leaves in the MST. This motivates the problem of
finding a vertex-ranked MST with the minimum number of leaves (MLVRMST). We
provide a polynomial time algorithm for the MLVRMST problem, and prove its
correctness for graphs whose edges are weighted with tree-additive distances.

 <dc:title>Agile Inexact Methods for Spectral Projector-Based Graph Fourier
  Transforms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Deri, Joya A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Moura, Jos&#xe9; M. F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose an inexact method for the graph Fourier transform of a graph
signal, as defined by the signal decomposition over the Jordan subspaces of the
graph adjacency matrix. This method projects the signal over the generalized
eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix, which accelerates the transform
computation over large, sparse, and directed adjacency matrices. The trade-off
between execution time and fidelity to the original graph structure is
discussed. In addition, properties such as a generalized Parseval's identity
and total variation ordering of the generalized eigenspaces are discussed.
  The method is applied to 2010-2013 NYC taxi trip data to identify traffic
hotspots on the Manhattan grid. Our results show that identical highly
expressed geolocations can be identified with the inexact method and the method
based on eigenvector projections, while reducing computation time by a factor
of 26,000 and reducing energy dispersal among the spectral components
corresponding to the multiple zero eigenvalue.

 <dc:description>  In the Survivable Network Design Problem (SNDP), the input is an
edge-weighted (di)graph $G$ and an integer $r_{uv}$ for every pair of vertices
$u,v\in V(G)$. The objective is to construct a subgraph $H$ of minimum weight
which contains $r_{uv}$ edge-disjoint (or node-disjoint) $u$-$v$ paths. This is
a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization that captures numerous
well-studied problems in graph theory and graph algorithms. In this paper, we
consider the version of the problem where we are given a $\lambda$-edge
connected (di)graph $G$ with a non-negative weight function $w$ on the edges
and an integer $k$, and the objective is to find a minimum weight spanning
subgraph $H$ that is also $\lambda$-edge connected, and has at least $k$ fewer
edges than $G$. In other words, we are asked to compute a maximum weight subset
of edges, of cardinality up to $k$, which may be safely deleted from $G$.
Motivated by this question, we investigate the connectivity properties of
$\lambda$-edge connected (di)graphs and obtain algorithmically significant
structural results. We demonstrate the importance of our structural results by
presenting an algorithm running in time $2^{O(k \log k)} |V(G)|^{O(1)}$ for
$\lambda$-ECS, thus proving its fixed-parameter tractability. We follow up on
this result and obtain the {\em first polynomial compression} for $\lambda$-ECS
on unweighted graphs. As a consequence, we also obtain the first fixed
parameter tractable algorithm, and a polynomial kernel for a parameterized
version of the classic Mininum Equivalent Graph problem. We believe that our
structural results are of independent interest and will play a crucial role in
the design of algorithms for connectivity-constrained problems in general and
the SNDP problem in particular.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel decoding approach for neural machine translation (NMT)
based on continuous optimisation. We convert decoding - basically a discrete
optimization problem - into a continuous optimization problem. The resulting
constrained continuous optimisation problem is then tackled using
gradient-based methods. Our powerful decoding framework enables decoding
intractable models such as the intersection of left-to-right and right-to-left
(bidirectional) as well as source-to-target and target-to-source (bilingual)
NMT models. Our empirical results show that our decoding framework is
effective, and leads to substantial improvements in translations generated from
the intersected models where the typical greedy or beam search is not feasible.
We also compare our framework against reranking, and analyse its advantages and
disadvantages.

 <dc:description>  We define and discuss the utility of two equivalence graph classes over which
a spectral projector-based graph Fourier transform is equivalent: isomorphic
equivalence classes and Jordan equivalence classes. Isomorphic equivalence
classes show that the transform is equivalent up to a permutation on the node
labels. Jordan equivalence classes permit identical transforms over graphs of
nonidentical topologies and allow a basis-invariant characterization of total
variation orderings of the spectral components. Methods to exploit these
classes to reduce computation time of the transform as well as limitations are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an inference technique to produce discriminative context-aware
image captions (captions that describe differences between images or visual
concepts) using only generic context-agnostic training data (captions that
describe a concept or an image in isolation). For example, given images and
captions of &quot;siamese cat&quot; and &quot;tiger cat&quot;, we generate language that describes
the &quot;siamese cat&quot; in a way that distinguishes it from &quot;tiger cat&quot;. Our key
novelty is that we show how to do joint inference over a language model that is
context-agnostic and a listener which distinguishes closely-related concepts.
We first apply our technique to a justification task, namely to describe why an
image contains a particular fine-grained category as opposed to another
closely-related category of the CUB-200-2011 dataset. We then study
discriminative image captioning to generate language that uniquely refers to
one of two semantically-similar images in the COCO dataset. Evaluations with
discriminative ground truth for justification and human studies for
discriminative image captioning reveal that our approach outperforms baseline
generative and speaker-listener approaches for discrimination.

 <dc:description>  Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a key NLP task, which is all the more
challenging on Web and user-generated content with their diverse and
continuously changing language. This paper aims to quantify how this diversity
impacts state-of-the-art NER methods, by measuring named entity (NE) and
context variability, feature sparsity, and their effects on precision and
recall. In particular, our findings indicate that NER approaches struggle to
generalise in diverse genres with limited training data. Unseen NEs, in
particular, play an important role, which have a higher incidence in diverse
genres such as social media than in more regular genres such as newswire.
Coupled with a higher incidence of unseen features more generally and the lack
of large training corpora, this leads to significantly lower F1 scores for
diverse genres as compared to more regular ones. We also find that leading
systems rely heavily on surface forms found in training data, having problems
generalising beyond these, and offer explanations for this observation.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study the secrecy capacity of Gaussian multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) wiretap channels (WTCs) with a finite memory, subject to
a per-symbol average power constraint on the MIMO channel input. MIMO channels
with finite memory are very common in wireless communications as well as in
wireline communications (e.g., in communications over power lines). To derive
the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian MIMO WTC with finite memory we first
construct an asymptotically-equivalent block-memoryless MIMO WTC, which is then
transformed into a set of parallel, independent, memoryless MIMO WTCs in the
frequency domain. The secrecy capacity of the Gaussian MIMO WTC with finite
memory is obtained as the secrecy capacity of the set of parallel independent
memoryless MIMO WTCs, and is expressed as a maximization over the input
covariance matrices in the frequency domain. Lastly, we detail two applications
of our result: First, we show that the secrecy capacity of the Gaussian scalar
WTC with finite memory can be achieved by waterfilling, and obtain a
closed-form expression for this secrecy capacity. Then, we use our result to
characterize the secrecy capacity of narrowband powerline channels, thereby
resolving one of the major open issues for this channel model.

 <dc:title>The empirical Christoffel function with applications in Machine Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We illustrate the potential applications in machine learning of the
Christoffel function, or more precisely, its empirical counterpart associated
with a counting measure uniformly supported on a finite set of points. Firstly,
we provide a thresholding scheme which allows to approximate the support of a
measure from a finite subset of its moments with strong asymptotic guaranties.
Secondly, we provide a consistency result which relates the empirical
Christoffel function and its population counterpart in the limit of large
samples. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our results on simulated and
real world datasets for several applications in statistics and machine
learning: (a) density and support estimation from finite samples, (b) outlier
and novelty detection and (c) affine matching.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of multivariate linear regression where a
portion of the observations is grossly corrupted or is missing, and the
magnitudes and locations of such occurrences are unknown in priori. To deal
with this problem, we propose a new approach by explicitly consider the error
source as well as its sparseness nature. An interesting property of our
approach lies in its ability of allowing individual regression output elements
or tasks to possess their unique noise levels. Moreover, despite working with a
non-smooth optimization problem, our approach still guarantees to converge to
its optimal solution. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach compared with existing multivariate regression
models. In addition, empirically our approach has been validated with very
promising results on two exemplar real-world applications: The first concerns
the prediction of \textit{Big-Five} personality based on user behaviors at
social network sites (SNSs), while the second is 3D human hand pose estimation
from depth images. The implementation of our approach and comparison methods as
well as the involved datasets are made publicly available in support of the
open-source and reproducible research initiatives.

 <dc:description>  The range resolution in conventional continuous time frequency modulation
(CTFM) is inversely proportional to the signal bandwidth. The dual-demodulator
continuous time frequency modulation (DD-CTFM) processing technique was
proposed by Gough et al [1] as a method to increase the range resolution by
making the output of DD-CTFM truly continuous. However, it has been found that
in practice the range resolution is still limited by the signal bandwidth. The
limitation of DD-CTFM has been explained using simulations and mathematically
in this paper.

 <dc:title>Colored Image Encryption and Decryption Using Chaotic Lorenz System and

 <dc:creator>Alsaedi, Mohammed</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a scheme for the encryption and decryption of colored images
by using the Lorenz system and the discrete cosine transform in two dimensions
(DCT2) is proposed. Although chaos is random, it has deterministic features
that can be used for encryption; further, the same sequences can be produced at
the transmitter and receiver under the same initial conditions. Another
property of DCT2 is that the energy is concentrated in some elements of the
coefficients. These two properties are used to efficiently encrypt and recover
the image at the receiver by using three different keys with three different
predefined number of shifts for each instance of key usage. Simulation results
and statistical analysis show that the scheme high performance in weakening the
correlation between the pixels of the image that resulted from the inverse of
highest energy values of DCT2 that form 99.9 % of the energy as well as those
of the difference image.

 <dc:description>  The retina is a complex nervous system which encodes visual stimuli before
higher order processing occurs in the visual cortex. In this study we evaluated
whether information about the stimuli received by the retina can be retrieved
from the firing rate distribution of Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs), exploiting
High-Density 64x64 MEA technology. To this end, we modeled the RGC population
activity using mean-covariance Restricted Boltzmann Machines, latent variable
models capable of learning the joint distribution of a set of continuous
observed random variables and a set of binary unobserved random units. The idea
was to figure out if binary latent states encode the regularities associated to
different visual stimuli, as modes in the joint distribution. We measured the
goodness of mcRBM encoding by calculating the Mutual Information between the
latent states and the stimuli shown to the retina. Results show that binary
states can encode the regularities associated to different stimuli, using both
gratings and natural scenes as stimuli. We also discovered that hidden
variables encode interesting properties of retinal activity, interpreted as
population receptive fields. We further investigated the ability of the model
to learn different modes in population activity by comparing results associated
to a retina in normal conditions and after pharmacologically blocking GABA
receptors (GABAC at first, and then also GABAA and GABAB). As expected, Mutual
Information tends to decrease if we pharmacologically block receptors. We
finally stress that the computational method described in this work could
potentially be applied to any kind of neural data obtained through MEA
technology, though different techniques should be applied to interpret the
results.

 <dc:title>Optimal Compression for Two-Field Entries in Fixed-Width Memories</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rottenstreich, Ori</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Cassuto, Yuval</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Data compression is a well-studied (and well-solved) problem in the setup of
long coding blocks. But important emerging applications need to compress data
to memory words of small fixed widths. This new setup is the subject of this
paper. In the problem we consider we have two sources with known discrete
distributions, and we wish to find codes that maximize the success probability
that the two source outputs are represented in $L$ bits or less. A good
practical use for this problem is a table with two-field entries that is stored
in a memory of a fixed width $L$. Such tables of very large sizes drive the
core functionalities of network switches and routers. After defining the
problem formally, we solve it optimally with an efficient code-design
algorithm. We also solve the problem in the more constrained case where a
single code is used in both fields (to save space for storing code
dictionaries). For both code-design problems we find decompositions that yield
efficient dynamic-programming algorithms. With an empirical study we show the
success probabilities of the optimal codes for different distributions and
memory widths. In particular, the study demonstrates the superiority of the new
codes over existing compression algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We aim to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of the newly introduced
neural machine translation paradigm. To that end, we conduct a multifaceted
evaluation in which we compare outputs produced by state-of-the-art neural
machine translation and phrase-based machine translation systems for 9 language
directions across a number of dimensions. Specifically, we measure the
similarity of the outputs, their fluency and amount of reordering, the effect
of sentence length and performance across different error categories. We find
out that translations produced by neural machine translation systems are
considerably different, more fluent and more accurate in terms of word order
compared to those produced by phrase-based systems. Neural machine translation
systems are also more accurate at producing inflected forms, but they perform
poorly when translating very long sentences.

 <dc:description>  Decidability of the determinization problem for weighted automata over the
semiring $(\mathbb{Z} \cup {-\infty}, \max, +)$, WA for short, is a
long-standing open question. We propose two ways of approaching it by
constraining the search space of deterministic WA: k-delay and r-regret. A WA N
is k-delay determinizable if there exists a deterministic automaton D that
defines the same function as N and for all words {\alpha} in the language of N,
the accepting run of D on {\alpha} is always at most k-away from a maximal
accepting run of N on {\alpha}. That is, along all prefixes of the same length,
the absolute difference between the running sums of weights of the two runs is
at most k. A WA N is r-regret determinizable if for all words {\alpha} in its
language, its non-determinism can be resolved on the fly to construct a run of
N such that the absolute difference between its value and the value assigned to
{\alpha} by N is at most r.
  We show that a WA is determinizable if and only if it is k-delay
determinizable for some k. Hence deciding the existence of some k is as
difficult as the general determinization problem. When k and r are given as
input, the k-delay and r-regret determinization problems are shown to be
EXPtime-complete. We also show that determining whether a WA is r-regret
determinizable for some r is in EXPtime.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We introduce a sequent calculus with a simple restriction of Lambek's product
rules that precisely captures the classical Tamari order, i.e., the partial
order on fully-bracketed words (equivalently, binary trees) induced by a
semi-associative law (equivalently, tree rotation). We establish a focusing
property for this sequent calculus (a strengthening of cut-elimination), which
yields the following coherence theorem: every valid entailment in the Tamari
order has exactly one focused derivation. One combinatorial application of this
coherence theorem is a new proof of the Tutte-Chapoton formula for the number
of intervals in the Tamari lattice $Y_n$. We also apply the sequent calculus
and the coherence theorem to build a surprising bijection between intervals of
the Tamari order and a certain fragment of lambda calculus, consisting of the
$\beta$-normal planar lambda terms with no closed proper subterms.

 <dc:description>  The reconstruction of sparse signals requires the solution of an
$\ell_0$-norm minimization problem in Compressed Sensing. Previous research has
focused on the investigation of a single candidate to identify the support
(index of nonzero elements) of a sparse signal. To ensure that the optimal
candidate can be obtained in each iteration, we propose here an iterative
greedy reconstruction algorithm (GSRA). First, the intersection of the support
sets estimated by the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Subspace Pursuit
(SP) is set as the initial support set. Then, a hope-tree is built to expand
the set. Finally, a developed decreasing subspace pursuit method is used to
rectify the candidate set. Detailed simulation results demonstrate that GSRA is
more accurate than other typical methods in recovering Gaussian signals, 0--1
sparse signals, and synthetic signals.

 <dc:description>  The first step of processing a question in Question Answering(QA) Systems is
to carry out a detailed analysis of the question for the purpose of determining
what it is asking for and how to perfectly approach answering it. Our Question
analysis uses several techniques to analyze any question given in natural
language: a Stanford POS Tagger &amp; parser for Arabic language, a named entity
recognizer, tokenizer,Stop-word removal, Question expansion, Question
classification and Question focus extraction components. We employ numerous
detection rules and trained classifier using features from this analysis to
detect important elements of the question, including: 1) the portion of the
question that is a referring to the answer (the focus); 2) different terms in
the question that identify what type of entity is being asked for (the lexical
answer types); 3) Question expansion ; 4) a process of classifying the question
into one or more of several and different types; and We describe how these
elements are identified and evaluate the effect of accurate detection on our
question-answering system using the Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR) accuracy measure.

 <dc:description>  We study the size and the complexity of computing finite state automata (FSA)
representing and approximating the downward and the upward closure of Petri net
languages with coverability as the acceptance condition. We show how to
construct an FSA recognizing the upward closure of a Petri net language in
doubly-exponential time, and therefore the size is at most doubly exponential.
For downward closures, we prove that the size of the minimal automata can be
non-primitive recursive. In the case of BPP nets, a well-known subclass of
Petri nets, we show that an FSA accepting the downward/upward closure can be
constructed in exponential time. Furthermore, we consider the problem of
checking whether a simple regular language is included in the downward/upward
closure of a Petri net/BPP net language. We show that this problem is
EXPSPACE-complete (resp. NP-complete) in the case of Petri nets (resp. BPP
nets). Finally, we show that it is decidable whether a Petri net language is
upward/downward closed.

 <dc:description>  Quantum parameter estimation plays a key role in many fields like quantum
computation, communication and metrology. Optimal estimation allows one to
achieve the most precise parameter estimates, but requires accurate knowledge
of the model. Any inevitable uncertainty in the model parameters may heavily
degrade the quality of the estimate. It is therefore desired to make the
estimation process robust to such uncertainties. Robust estimation was
previously studied for a varying phase, where the goal was to estimate the
phase at some time in the past, using the measurement results from both before
and after that time within a fixed time interval up to current time. Here, we
consider a robust guaranteed-cost filter yielding robust estimates of a varying
phase in real time, where the current phase is estimated using only past
measurements. Our filter minimizes the largest (worst-case) variance in the
allowable range of the uncertain model parameter(s) and this determines its
guaranteed cost. It outperforms in the worst case the optimal Kalman filter
designed for the model with no uncertainty, that corresponds to the center of
the possible range of the uncertain parameter(s). Moreover, unlike the Kalman
filter, our filter in the worst case always performs better than the best
achievable variance for heterodyne measurements, that we consider as the
tolerable threshold for our system. Furthermore, we consider effective quantum
efficiency and effective noise power, and show that our filter provides the
best results by these measures in the worst case.
