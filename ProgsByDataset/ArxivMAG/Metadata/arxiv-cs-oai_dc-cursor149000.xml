 <dc:description>  Power law distributions have been found in many natural and social phenomena,
and more recently in the source code and run-time characteristics of
Object-Oriented (OO) systems. A power law implies that small values are
extremely common, whereas large values are extremely rare. In this paper, we
identify twelve new power laws relating to the static graph structures of Java
programs. The graph structures analyzed represented different forms of OO
coupling, namely, inheritance, aggregation, interface, parameter type and
return type. Identification of these new laws provide the basis for predicting
likely features of classes in future developments. The research in this paper
ties together work in object-based coupling and World Wide Web structures.

 <dc:title>The Evolution of the Computerized Database</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bercich, Nancy Hartline</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.2.m</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Databases, collections of related data, are as old as the written word. A
database can be anything from a homemaker's metal recipe file to a
sophisticated data warehouse. Yet today, when we think of a database we
invariably think of computerized data and their DBMSs (database management
systems). How did we go from organizing our data in a simple metal filing box
or cabinet to storing our data in a sophisticated computerized database? How
did the computerized database evolve?
  This paper defines what we mean by a database. It traces the evolution of the
database, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now
standard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early
computerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed
Sequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage
methods. Early database models are explored including the network and
hierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and
object-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams,
including hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity
relationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to
support the text.
  This paper concludes with an exploration of current and future trends in DBMS
development. It discusses the factors affecting these trends. It delves into
the relationship between DBMSs and the increasingly popular object-oriented
development methodologies. Finally, it speculates on the future of the DBMS.

 <dc:title>Periodicity and Unbordered Words: A Proof of the Extended Duval
  Conjecture</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.m</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The relationship between the length of a word and the maximum length of its
unbordered factors is investigated in this paper. Consider a finite word w of
length n. We call a word bordered, if it has a proper prefix which is also a
suffix of that word. Let f(w) denote the maximum length of all unbordered
factors of w, and let p(w) denote the period of w. Clearly, f(w) &lt; p(w)+1.
  We establish that f(w) = p(w), if w has an unbordered prefix of length f(w)
and n &gt; 2f(w)-2. This bound is tight and solves the stronger version of a 21
years old conjecture by Duval. It follows from this result that, in general, n
&gt; 3f(w)-3 implies f(w) = p(w) which gives an improved bound for the question
asked by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger in 1979.

 <dc:description>  In this paper bounded model checking of asynchronous concurrent systems is
introduced as a promising application area for answer set programming. As the
model of asynchronous systems a generalisation of communicating automata,
1-safe Petri nets, are used. It is shown how a 1-safe Petri net and a
requirement on the behaviour of the net can be translated into a logic program
such that the bounded model checking problem for the net can be solved by
computing stable models of the corresponding program. The use of the stable
model semantics leads to compact encodings of bounded reachability and deadlock
detection tasks as well as the more general problem of bounded model checking
of linear temporal logic. Correctness proofs of the devised translations are
given, and some experimental results using the translation and the Smodels
system are presented.

 <dc:title>Factorization of Language Models through Backing-Off Lattices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Wei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Factorization of statistical language models is the task that we resolve the
most discriminative model into factored models and determine a new model by
combining them so as to provide better estimate. Most of previous works mainly
focus on factorizing models of sequential events, each of which allows only one
factorization manner. To enable parallel factorization, which allows a model
event to be resolved in more than one ways at the same time, we propose a
general framework, where we adopt a backing-off lattice to reflect parallel
factorizations and to define the paths along which a model is resolved into
factored models, we use a mixture model to combine parallel paths in the
lattice, and generalize Katz's backing-off method to integrate all the mixture
models got by traversing the entire lattice. Based on this framework, we
formulate two types of model factorizations that are used in natural language
modeling.

 <dc:description>  We uncover a vulnerability that allows for an attacker to perform an
email-based attack on selected victims, using only standard scripts and agents.
What differentiates the attack we describe from other, already known forms of
distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks is that an attacker does not need
to infiltrate the network in any manner -- as is normally required to launch a
DDoS attack. Thus, we see this type of attack as a poor man's DDoS. Not only is
the attack easy to mount, but it is also almost impossible to trace back to the
perpetrator. Along with descriptions of our attack, we demonstrate its
destructive potential with (limited and contained) experimental results. We
illustrate the potential impact of our attack by describing how an attacker can
disable an email account by flooding its inbox; block competition during
on-line auctions; harm competitors with an on-line presence; disrupt phone
service to a given victim; cheat in SMS-based games; disconnect mobile
corporate leaders from their networks; and disrupt electronic elections.
Finally, we propose a set of countermeasures that are light-weight, do not
require modifications to the infrastructure, and can be deployed in a gradual
manner.

 <dc:title>Updating beliefs with incomplete observations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>de Cooman, Gert</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zaffalon, Marco</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in
1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a
fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian
networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating
strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this
paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete
observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions
about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with
incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a
vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and
we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In
general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior
probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions.
This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the
incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of
classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads
to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian
networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for
classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for
a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the
more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much
harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears
to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations,
when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.

 <dc:description>  We present some applications of intermediate logics in the field of Answer
Set Programming (ASP). A brief, but comprehensive introduction to the answer
set semantics, intuitionistic and other intermediate logics is given. Some
equivalence notions and their applications are discussed. Some results on
intermediate logics are shown, and applied later to prove properties of answer
sets. A characterization of answer sets for logic programs with nested
expressions is provided in terms of intuitionistic provability, generalizing a
recent result given by Pearce.
  It is known that the answer set semantics for logic programs with nested
expressions may select non-minimal models. Minimal models can be very important
in some applications, therefore we studied them; in particular we obtain a
characterization, in terms of intuitionistic logic, of answer sets which are
also minimal models. We show that the logic G3 characterizes the notion of
strong equivalence between programs under the semantic induced by these models.
Finally we discuss possible applications and consequences of our results. They
clearly state interesting links between ASP and intermediate logics, which
might bring research in these two areas together.

 <dc:description>  In January 1999, CERN began to develop CASTOR (&quot;CERN Advanced STORage
manager&quot;). This Hierarchical Storage Manager targetted at HEP applications has
been in full production at CERN since May 2001. It now contains more than two
Petabyte of data in roughly 9 million files. In 2002, 350 Terabytes of data
were stored for COMPASS at 45 MB/s and a Data Challenge was run for ALICE in
preparation for the LHC startup in 2007 and sustained a data transfer to tape
of 300 MB/s for one week (180 TB). The major functionality improvements were
the support for files larger than 2 GB (in collaboration with IN2P3) and the
development of Grid interfaces to CASTOR: GridFTP and SRM (&quot;Storage Resource
Manager&quot;). An ongoing effort is taking place to copy the existing data from
obsolete media like 9940 A to better cost effective offerings. CASTOR has also
been deployed at several HEP sites with little effort. In 2003, we plan to
continue working on Grid interfaces and to improve performance not only for
Central Data Recording but also for Data Analysis applications where thousands
of processes possibly access the same hot data. This could imply the selection
of another filesystem or the use of replication (hardware or software).

reproducible images with a normalized form and the effect of negative stain. In
this paper, we will discuss a new concept of interpreting the 2D images and
overcoming the aforementioned technical difficulties using mathematical
transformation. The method makes use of 2D gel images of proteins in serums and
we explain a way of representing the images into vectors in order to apply
machine-learning methods, such as the support vector machine.

 <dc:description>  Athena is the ATLAS off-line software framework, based upon the GAUDI
architecture from LHCb. As part of ATLAS' continuing efforts to enhance and
customise the architecture to meet our needs, we have developed a data object
description tool suite and service for Athena. The aim is to provide a set of
tools to describe, manage, integrate and use the Event Data Model at a design
level according to the concepts of the Athena framework (use of patterns,
relationships, ...). Moreover, to ensure stability and reusability this must be
fully independent from the implementation details. After an extensive
investigation into the many options, we have developed a language grammar based
upon a description language (IDL, ODL) to provide support for object
integration in Athena. We have then developed a compiler front end based upon
this language grammar, JavaCC, and a Java Reflection API-like interface. We
have then used these tools to develop several compiler back ends which meet
specific needs in ATLAS such as automatic generation of object converters, and
data object scripting interfaces. We present here details of our work and
experience to date on the Athena Definition Language and Athena Data
Dictionary.

 <dc:description>  The EU DataGrid project workpackage 4 has as an objective to provide the
necessary tools for automating the management of medium size to very large
computing fabrics. At the end of the second project year subsystems for
centralized configuration management (presented at LISA'02) and
performance/exception monitoring have been delivered. This will soon be
augmented with a subsystem for node installation and service configuration,
which is based on existing widely used standards where available (e.g. rpm,
kickstart, init.d scripts) and clean interfaces to OS dependent components
(e.g. base installation and service management). The three subsystems together
allow for centralized management of very large computer farms. Finally, a fault
tolerance system is being developed for tying together the above subsystems to
form a complete framework for automated enterprise computing management by
3Q03. All software developed is open source covered by the EU DataGrid project
license agreements. This article describes the architecture behind the designed
fabric management system and the status of the different developments. It also
covers the experience with an existing tool for automated configuration and
installation that have been adapted and used from the beginning to manage the
EU DataGrid testbed, which is now used for LHC data challenges.

 <dc:description>  The bandwidth of a graph is the labeling of vertices with minimum maximum
edge difference. For many graph families this is NP-complete. A classic result
computes the bandwidth for the hypercube. We generalize this result to give
sharp lower bounds for products of cliques. This problem turns out to be
equivalent to one in communication over multiple channels in which channels can
fail and the information sent over those channels is lost. The goal is to
create an encoding that minimizes the difference between the received and the
original information while having as little redundancy as possible. Berger-Wolf
and Reingold [2] have considered the problem for the equal size cliques (or
equal capacity channels). This paper presents a tight lower bound and an
algorithm for constructing the labeling for the product of any number of
arbitrary size cliques.

 <dc:description>  Solomonoff unified Occam's razor and Epicurus' principle of multiple
explanations to one elegant, formal, universal theory of inductive inference,
which initiated the field of algorithmic information theory. His central result
is that the posterior of his universal semimeasure M converges rapidly to the
true sequence generating posterior mu, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is
eligible as a universal predictor in case of unknown mu. We investigate the
existence and convergence of computable universal (semi)measures for a
hierarchy of computability classes: finitely computable, estimable, enumerable,
and approximable. For instance, M is known to be enumerable, but not finitely
computable, and to dominate all enumerable semimeasures. We define seven
classes of (semi)measures based on these four computability concepts. Each
class may or may not contain a (semi)measure which dominates all elements of
another class. The analysis of these 49 cases can be reduced to four basic
cases, two of them being new. The results hold for discrete and continuous
semimeasures. We also investigate more closely the types of convergence,
possibly implied by universality: in difference and in ratio, with probability
1, in mean sum, and for Martin-Loef random sequences. We introduce a
generalized concept of randomness for individual sequences and use it to
exhibit difficulties regarding these issues.

 <dc:description>  The UQ Flint Archive houses the field notes and elicitation recordings made
by Elwyn Flint in the 1950's and 1960's during extensive linguistic survey work
across Queensland, Australia.
  The process of digitizing the contents of the UQ Flint Archive provides a
number of interesting challenges in the context of EMELD. Firstly, all of the
linguistic data is for languages which are either endangered or extinct, and as
such forms a valuable ethnographic repository. Secondly, the physical format of
the data is itself in danger of decline, and as such digitization is an
important preservation task in the short to medium term. Thirdly, the adoption
of open standards for the encoding and presentation of text and audio data for
linguistic field data, whilst enabling preservation, represents a new field of
research in itself where best practice has yet to be formalised. Fourthly, the
provision of this linguistic data online as a new data source for future
research introduces concerns of data portability and longevity.
  This paper will outline the origins of the data model, the content creation
components, presentation forms based on the data model, data capture tools and
media conversion components. It will also address some of the larger questions
regarding the digitization and annotation of linguistic field work based on
experience gained through work with the Flint Archive contents.

 <dc:description>  Monitoring large clusters is a challenging problem. It is necessary to
observe a large quantity of devices with a reasonably short delay between
consecutive observations. The set of monitored devices may include PCs, network
switches, tape libraries and other equipments. The monitoring activity should
not impact the performances of the system. In this paper we present PerfMC, a
monitoring system for large clusters. PerfMC is driven by an XML configuration
file, and uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for data
collection. SNMP is a standard protocol implemented by many networked
equipments, so the tool can be used to monitor a wide range of devices. System
administrators can display informations on the status of each device by
connecting to a WEB server embedded in PerfMC. The WEB server can produce
graphs showing the value of different monitored quantities as a function of
time; it can also produce arbitrary XML pages by applying XSL Transformations
to an internal XML representation of the cluster's status. XSL Transformations
may be used to produce HTML pages which can be displayed by ordinary WEB
browsers. PerfMC aims at being relatively easy to configure and operate, and
highly efficient. It is currently being used to monitor the Italian
Reprocessing farm for the BaBar experiment, which is made of about 200 dual-CPU
Linux machines.

 <dc:description>  An analytical formula for the probability distribution of stock-market
returns, derived from the Heston model assuming a mean-reverting stochastic
volatility, was recently proposed by Dragulescu and Yakovenko in Quantitative
Finance 2002. While replicating their results, we found two significant
weaknesses in their method to pre-process the data, which cast a shadow over
the effective goodness-of-fit of the model. We propose a new method, more truly
capturing the market, and perform a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and a Chi Square
test on the resulting probability distribution. The results raise some
significant questions for large time lags -- 40 to 250 days -- where the
smoothness of the data does not require such a complex model; nevertheless, we
also provide some statistical evidence in favour of the Heston model for small
time lags -- 1 and 5 days -- compared with the traditional Gaussian model
assuming constant volatility.

Recent additions to the design of the configuration database provide better

 <dc:description>  The Persint program is designed for the three-dimensional representation of
objects and for the interfacing and access to a variety of independent
applications, in a fully interactive way. Facilities are provided for the
spatial navigation and the definition of the visualization properties, in order
to interactively set the viewing and viewed points, and to obtain the desired
perspective. In parallel, applications may be launched through the use of
dedicated interfaces, such as the interactive reconstruction and display of
physics events. Recent developments have focalized on the interfacing to the
XML ATLAS General Detector Description AGDD, making it a widely used tool for
XML developers. The graphics capabilities of this program were exploited in the
context of the ATLAS 2002 Muon Testbeam where it was used as an online event
display, integrated in the online software framework and participating in the
commissioning and debug of the detector system.

 <dc:description>  WorldGrid is an intercontinental testbed spanning Europe and the US
integrating architecturally different Grid implementations based on the Globus
toolkit. It has been developed in the context of the DataTAG and iVDGL
projects, and successfully demonstrated during the WorldGrid demos at IST2002
(Copenhagen) and SC2002 (Baltimore). Two HEP experiments, ATLAS and CMS,
successful exploited the WorldGrid testbed for executing jobs simulating the
response of their detectors to physics eve nts produced by real collisions
expected at the LHC accelerator starting from 2007. This data intensive
activity has been run since many years on local dedicated computing farms
consisting of hundreds of nodes and Terabytes of disk and tape storage. Within
the WorldGrid testbed, for the first time HEP simulation jobs were submitted
and run indifferently on US and European resources, despite of their underlying
different Grid implementations, and produced data which could be retrieved and
further analysed on the submitting machine, or simply stored on the remote
resources and registered on a Replica Catalogue which made them available to
the Grid for further processing. In this contribution we describe the job
submission from Europe for both ATLAS and CMS applications, performed through
the GENIUS portal operating on top of an EDG User Interface submitting to an
EDG Resource Broker, pointing out the chosen interoperability solutions which
made US and European resources equivalent from the applications point of view,
the data management in the WorldGrid environment, and the CMS specific
production tools which were interfaced to the GENIUS portal.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we report on the first two years of running the CERN testbed
site for the EU DataGRID project. The site consists of about 120 dual-processor
PCs distributed over several testbeds used for different purposes: software
development, system integration, and application tests. Activities at the site
included test productions of MonteCarlo data for LHC experiments, tutorials and
demonstrations of GRID technologies, and support for individual users analysis.
This paper focuses on node installation and configuration techniques, service

 <dc:description>  We report on our investigations on some technologies that can be used to
build disk servers and networks of disk servers using commodity hardware and
software solutions. It focuses on the performance that can be achieved by these
systems and gives measured figures for different configurations.
  It is divided into two parts : iSCSI and other technologies and hardware and
software RAID solutions.
  The first part studies different technologies that can be used by clients to
access disk servers using a gigabit ethernet network. It covers block access
technologies (iSCSI, hyperSCSI, ENBD). Experimental figures are given for
different numbers of clients and servers.
  The second part compares a system based on 3ware hardware RAID controllers, a
system using linux software RAID and IDE cards and a system mixing both
hardware RAID and software RAID. Performance measurements for reading and
writing are given for different RAID levels.

 <dc:description>  During the last years large farms have been built using commodity hardware.
This hardware lacks components for remote and automated administration.
Products that can be retrofitted to these systems are either costly or
inherently insecure. We present a system based on serial ports and simple
machine controlled relays. We report on experience gained by setting up a
50-machine test environment as well as current work in progress in the area.

 <dc:description>  Distributed Services Architecture with support for mobile agents between
services, offer significantly improved communication and computational
flexibility. The uses of agents allow execution of complex operations that
involve large amounts of data to be processed effectively using distributed
resources. The prototype system Distributed Agents for Mobile and Dynamic
Services (DIAMOnDS), allows a service to send agents on its behalf, to other
services, to perform data manipulation and processing. Agents have been
implemented as mobile services that are discovered using the Jini Lookup
mechanism and used by other services for task management and communication.
Agents provide proxies for interaction with other services as well as specific
GUI to monitor and control the agent activity. Thus agents acting on behalf of
one service cooperate with other services to carry out a job, providing
inter-operation of loosely coupled services in a semi-autonomous way. Remote
file system access functionality has been incorporated by the agent framework
and allows services to dynamically share and browse the file system resources
of hosts, running the services. Generic database access functionality has been
implemented in the mobile agent framework that allows performing complex data
mining and processing operations efficiently in distributed system. A basic
data searching agent is also implemented that performs a query based search in
a file system. The testing of the framework was carried out on WAN by moving
Connectivity Test agents between AgentStations in CERN, Switzerland and NUST,
Pakistan.

 <dc:description>  McRunjob is a powerful grid workflow manager used to manage the generation of
large numbers of production processing jobs in High Energy Physics. In use at
both the DZero and CMS experiments, McRunjob has been used to manage large
Monte Carlo production processing since 1999 and is being extended to uses in
regular production processing for analysis and reconstruction. Described at
CHEP 2001, McRunjob converts core metadata into jobs submittable in a variety
of environments. The powerful core metadata description language includes
methods for converting the metadata into persistent forms, job descriptions,
multi-step workflows, and data provenance information. The language features
allow for structure in the metadata by including full expressions, namespaces,
functional dependencies, site specific parameters in a grid environment, and
ontological definitions. It also has simple control structures for
parallelization of large jobs. McRunjob features a modular design which allows
for easy expansion to new job description languages or new application level
tasks.

and identifies the Ethernet features required for a proper operation of the
network: MAC address table size, switch performance in terms of throughput and
latency, the use of Flow Control, Virtual LANs and Quality of Service. We
investigate these features on some Ethernet switches, and conclude on their
usefulness for the ATLAS DataFlow network.

 <dc:description>  The BaBar online data acquisition (DAQ) system includes approximately fifty
Unix systems that collectively implement the level-three trigger. These systems
all run the same code. Each of these systems has its own state, and this state
is expected to change in response to changes in the overall DAQ system. A
specialized subsystem has been developed to initiate processing on this
collection of systems, and to monitor them both for error conditions and to
ensure that they all follow the same state trajectory within a specifiable
period of time. This subsystem receives start commands from the main DAQ run
control system, and reports major coherent state changes, as well as error
conditions, back to the run control system. This state monitoring subsystem has
the novel feature that it does not know anything about the state machines that
it is monitoring, and hence does not introduce any fundamentally new state
machine into the overall system. This feature makes it trivially applicable to
other multi-node subsystems. Indeed it has already found a second application
beyond the level-three trigger, within the BaBar experiment.

 <dc:description>  The CMS Integration Grid Testbed (IGT) comprises USCMS Tier-1 and Tier-2
hardware at the following sites: the California Institute of Technology, Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory, the University of California at San Diego, and
the University of Florida at Gainesville. The IGT runs jobs using the Globus
Toolkit with a DAGMan and Condor-G front end. The virtual organization (VO) is
managed using VO management scripts from the European Data Grid (EDG). Gridwide
monitoring is accomplished using local tools such as Ganglia interfaced into
the Globus Metadata Directory Service (MDS) and the agent based Mona Lisa.
Domain specific software is packaged and installed using the Distrib ution
After Release (DAR) tool of CMS, while middleware under the auspices of the
Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) is distributed using Pacman. During a continuo us
two month span in Fall of 2002, over 1 million official CMS GEANT based Monte
Carlo events were generated and returned to CERN for analysis while being
demonstrated at SC2002. In this paper, we describe the process that led to one
of the world's first continuously available, functioning grids.

 <dc:description>  We describe R-GMA (Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture) which is being
developed within the European DataGrid Project as an Grid Information and
Monitoring System. Is is based on the GMA from GGF, which is a simple
Consumer-Producer model. The special strength of this implementation comes from
the power of the relational model. We offer a global view of the information as
if each VO had one large relational database. We provide a number of different
Producer types with different characteristics; for example some support
streaming of information. We also provide combined Consumer/Producers, which
are able to combine information and republish it. At the heart of the system is
the mediator, which for any query is able to find and connect to the best
Producers to do the job. We are able to invoke MDS info-provider scripts and
publish the resulting information via R-GMA in addition to having some of our
own sensors. APIs are available which allow the user to deploy monitoring and
information services for any application that may be needed in the future. We
have used it both for information about the grid (primarily to find what
services are available at any one time) and for application monitoring. R-GMA
has been deployed in Grid testbeds, we describe the results and experiences of
this deployment.

 <dc:description>  One of the fundamental concepts in Grid computing is the creation of Virtual
Organizations (VO's): a set of resource consumers and providers that join
forces to solve a common problem. Typical examples of Virtual Organizations
include collaborations formed around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
experiments. To date, Grid computing has been applied on a relatively small
scale, linking dozens of users to a dozen resources, and management of these
VO's was a largely manual operation. With the advance of large collaboration,
linking more than 10000 users with a 1000 sites in 150 counties, a
comprehensive, automated management system is required. It should be simple
enough not to deter users, while at the same time ensuring local site autonomy.
The VO Management Service (VOMS), developed by the EU DataGrid and DataTAG
projects[1, 2], is a secured system for managing authorization for users and
resources in virtual organizations. It extends the existing Grid Security
Infrastructure[3] architecture with embedded VO affiliation assertions that can
be independently verified by all VO members and resource providers. Within the
EU DataGrid project, Grid services for job submission, file- and database
access are being equipped with fine- grained authorization systems that take VO
membership into account. These also give resource owners the ability to ensure
site security and enforce local access policies. This paper will describe the
EU DataGrid security architecture, the VO membership service and the local site
enforcement mechanisms Local Centre Authorization Service (LCAS), Local
Credential Mapping Service(LCMAPS) and the Java Trust and Authorization
Manager.

 <dc:description>  The concept of Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) has been developed by the ALICE
Software Project to allow different Monte Carlo simulation programs to run
without changing the user code, such as the geometry definition, the detector
response simulation or input and output formats. Recently, the VMC classes have
been integrated into the ROOT framework, and the other relevant packages have
been separated from the AliRoot framework and can be used individually by any
other HEP project. The general concept of the VMC and its set of base classes
provided in ROOT will be presented. Existing implementations for Geant3, Geant4
and FLUKA and simple examples of usage will be described.

 <dc:description>  Conditions Data in high energy physics experiments is frequently seen as
every data needed for reconstruction besides the event data itself. This
includes all sorts of slowly evolving data like detector alignment, calibration
and robustness, and data from detector control system. Also, every Conditions
Data Object is associated with a time interval of validity and a version.
Besides that, quite often is useful to tag collections of Conditions Data
Objects altogether. These issues have already been investigated and a data
model has been proposed and used for different implementations based in
commercial DBMSs, both at CERN and for the BaBar experiment. The special case
of the ATLAS complex trigger that requires online access to calibration and
alignment data poses new challenges that have to be met using a flexible and
customizable solution more in the line of Open Source components. Motivated by
the ATLAS challenges we have developed an alternative implementation, based in
an Open Source RDBMS. Several issues were investigated land will be described
in this paper:
  -The best way to map the conditions data model into the relational database
concept considering what are foreseen as the most frequent queries.
  -The clustering model best suited to address the scalability problem.
-Extensive tests were performed and will be described.
  The very promising results from these tests are attracting the attention from
the HEP community and driving further developments.

 <dc:description>  The BaBar experiment is characterized by extremely high luminosity, a complex
detector, and a huge data volume, with increasing requirements each year. To
fulfill these requirements a new control system has been designed and developed
for the offline data reconstruction system. The new control system described in
this paper provides the performance and flexibility needed to manage a large
number of small computing farms, and takes full benefit of OO design. The
infrastructure is well isolated from the processing layer, it is generic and
flexible, based on a light framework providing message passing and cooperative
multitasking. The system is actively distributed, enforces the separation
between different processing tiers by using different naming domains, and glues
them together by dedicated brokers. It provides a powerful Finite State Machine
framework to describe custom processing models in a simple regular language.
This paper describes this new control system, currently in use at SLAC and
Padova on ~450 CPUs organized in 12 farms.

 <dc:description>  Initial applications of the GriPhyN Chimera Virtual Data System have been
performed within the context of CMS Production of Monte Carlo Simulated Data.
The GriPhyN Chimera system consists of four primary components: 1) a Virtual
Data Language, which is used to describe virtual data products, 2) a Virtual
Data Catalog, which is used to store virtual data entries, 3) an Abstract
Planner, which resolves all dependencies of a particular virtual data product
and forms a location and existence independent plan, 4) a Concrete Planner,
which maps an abstract, logical plan onto concrete, physical grid resources
accounting for staging in/out files and publishing results to a replica
location service. A CMS Workflow Planner, MCRunJob, is used to generate virtual
data products using the Virtual Data Language. Subsequently, a prototype
workflow manager, known as WorkRunner, is used to schedule the instantiation of
virtual data products across a grid.

(illuminable) from an internal point $s$, is simply connected. Aronov et al.
\cite{addpp981} established that the region $V_1(s)$ of a simple polygon
visible from an internal point $s$ due to at most one diffuse reflection on the
boundary of the polygon $P$, is also simply connected. In this paper we
establish that the region $V_2(s)$, visible from $s$ due to at most two diffuse

$n$-sided simple polygon with a point $s$ inside it so that and the region of

 <dc:description>  In the first phase of the EU DataGrid (EDG) project, a Data Management System
has been implemented and provided for deployment. The components of the current
EDG Testbed are: a prototype of a Replica Manager Service built around the
basic services provided by Globus, a centralised Replica Catalogue to store
information about physical locations of files, and the Grid Data Mirroring
Package (GDMP) that is widely used in various HEP collaborations in Europe and
the US for data mirroring. During this year these services have been refined
and made more robust so that they are fit to be used in a pre-production
environment. Application users have been using this first release of the Data
Management Services for more than a year. In the paper we present the
components and their interaction, our implementation and experience as well as
the feedback received from our user communities. We have resolved not only
issues regarding integration with other EDG service components but also many of
the interoperability issues with components of our partner projects in Europe
and the U.S. The paper concludes with the basic lessons learned during this
operation. These conclusions provide the motivation for the architecture of the
next generation of Data Management Services that will be deployed in EDG during
2003.

 <dc:description>  Many entities managed by HEP Software Frameworks represent spatial
(3-dimensional) real objects. Effective definition, manipulation and
visualization of such objects is an indispensable functionality.
  GraXML is a modular Geometric Modeling toolkit capable of processing
geometric data of various kinds (detector geometry, event geometry) from
different sources and delivering them in ways suitable for further use.
Geometric data are first modeled in one of the Generic Models. Those Models are
then used to populate powerful Geometric Model based on the Java3D technology.
While Java3D has been originally created just to provide visualization of 3D
objects, its light weight and high functionality allow an effective reuse as a
general geometric component. This is possible also thanks to a large overlap
between graphical and general geometric functionality and modular design of
Java3D itself. Its graphical functionalities also allow a natural visualization
of all manipulated elements.
  All these techniques have been developed primarily (or only) for the Java
environment. It is, however, possible to interface them transparently to
Frameworks built in other languages, like for example C++.
  The GraXML toolkit has been tested with data from several sources, as for
example ATLAS and ALICE detector description and ATLAS event data. Prototypes
for other sources, like Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML) exist too
and interface to any other source is easy to add.

 <dc:title>Transparent Persistence with Java Data Objects</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Flexible and performant Persistency Service is a necessary component of any
HEP Software Framework. The building of a modular, non-intrusive and performant
persistency component have been shown to be very difficult task. In the past,
it was very often necessary to sacrifice modularity to achieve acceptable
performance. This resulted in the strong dependency of the overall Frameworks
on their Persistency subsystems.
  Recent development in software technology has made possible to build a
Persistency Service which can be transparently used from other Frameworks. Such
Service doesn't force a strong architectural constraints on the overall
Framework Architecture, while satisfying high performance requirements. Java
Data Object standard (JDO) has been already implemented for almost all major
databases. It provides truly transparent persistency for any Java object (both
internal and external). Objects in other languages can be handled via
transparent proxies. Being only a thin layer on top of a used database, JDO
doesn't introduce any significant performance degradation. Also Aspect-Oriented
Programming (AOP) makes possible to treat persistency as an orthogonal Aspect
of the Application Framework, without polluting it with persistence-specific
concepts.
  All these techniques have been developed primarily (or only) for the Java
environment. It is, however, possible to interface them transparently to
Frameworks built in other languages, like for example C++.
  Fully functional prototypes of flexible and non-intrusive persistency modules
have been build for several other packages, as for example FreeHEP AIDA and LCG
Pool AttributeSet (package Indicium).

 <dc:description>  Recently SCRAM (Software Configuration And Management) has been adopted by
the applications area of the LHC computing grid project as baseline
configuration management and build support infrastructure tool.
  SCRAM is a software engineering tool, that supports the configuration
management and management processes for software development. It resolves the
issues of configuration definition, assembly break-down, build, project
organization, run-time environment, installation, distribution, deployment, and
source code distribution. It was designed with a focus on supporting a
distributed, multi-project development work-model.
  We will describe the underlying technology, and the solutions SCRAM offers to
the above software engineering processes, while taking a users view of the
system under configuration management.

 <dc:description>  There are several numerical methods for computing approximate zeros of a
given univariate polynomial. In this paper, we develop a simple and novel
method for determining sharp upper bounds on errors in approximate zeros of a
given polynomial using Rouche's theorem from complex analysis. We compute the
error bounds using non-linear optimization. Our bounds are scalable in the
sense that we compute sharper error bounds for better approximations of zeros.
We use high precision computations using the LEDA/real floating-point filter
for computing our bounds robustly.

 <dc:title>Minimum Model Semantics for Logic Programs with Negation-as-Failure</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We give a purely model-theoretic characterization of the semantics of logic
programs with negation-as-failure allowed in clause bodies. In our semantics
the meaning of a program is, as in the classical case, the unique minimum model
in a program-independent ordering. We use an expanded truth domain that has an
uncountable linearly ordered set of truth values between False (the minimum
element) and True (the maximum), with a Zero element in the middle. The truth
values below Zero are ordered like the countable ordinals. The values above
Zero have exactly the reverse order. Negation is interpreted as reflection
about Zero followed by a step towards Zero; the only truth value that remains
unaffected by negation is Zero. We show that every program has a unique minimum
model M_P, and that this model can be constructed with a T_P iteration which
proceeds through the countable ordinals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that M_P
can also be obtained through a model intersection construction which
generalizes the well-known model intersection theorem for classical logic
programming. Finally, we show that by collapsing the true and false values of
the infinite-valued model M_P to (the classical) True and False, we obtain a
three-valued model identical to the well-founded one.

 <dc:description>  WorldGRID is an intercontinental testbed spanning Europe and the US
integrating architecturally different Grid implementations based on the Globus
toolkit. The WorldGRID testbed has been successfully demonstrated during the
WorldGRID demos at SuperComputing 2002 (Baltimore) and IST2002 (Copenhagen)
where real HEP application jobs were transparently submitted from US and Europe
using &quot;native&quot; mechanisms and run where resources were available, independently
of their location. To monitor the behavior and performance of such testbed and
spot problems as soon as they arise, DataTAG has developed the EDT-Monitor tool
based on the Nagios package that allows for Virtual Organization centric views
of the Grid through dynamic geographical maps. The tool has been used to spot
several problems during the WorldGRID operations, such as malfunctioning
Resource Brokers or Information Servers, sites not correctly configured, job
dispatching problems, etc. In this paper we give an overview of the package,
its features and scalability solutions and we report on the experience acquired
and the benefit that a GRID operation center would gain from such a tool.

 <dc:description>  PHENIX is one of the two large experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and archives roughly
100TB of experimental data per year. In addition, large volumes of simulated
data are produced at multiple off-site computing centers. For any file catalog
to play a central role in data management it has to face problems associated
with the need for distributed access and updates. To be used effectively by the
hundreds of PHENIX collaborators in 12 countries the catalog must satisfy the
following requirements: 1) contain up-to-date data, 2) provide fast and
reliable access to the data, 3) have write permissions for the sites that store
portions of data. We present an analysis of several available Relational
Database Management Systems (RDBMS) to support a catalog meeting the above
requirements and discuss the PHENIX experience with building and using the
distributed file catalog.

 <dc:description>  The BaBar database has pioneered the use of a commercial ODBMS within the HEP
community. The unique object-oriented architecture of Objectivity/DB has made
it possible to manage over 700 terabytes of production data generated since
May'99, making the BaBar database the world's largest known database. The
ongoing development includes new features, addressing the ever-increasing
luminosity of the detector as well as other changing physics requirements.
Significant efforts are focused on reducing space requirements and operational
costs. The paper discusses our experience with developing a large scale
database system, emphasizing universal aspects which may be applied to any
large scale system, independently of underlying technology used.

 <dc:description>  The vocabulary of a continuous speech recognition (CSR) system is a
significant factor in determining its performance. In this paper, we present
three principled approaches to select the target vocabulary for a particular
domain by trading off between the target out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate and
vocabulary size. We evaluate these approaches against an ad-hoc baseline
strategy. Results are presented in the form of OOV rate graphs plotted against
increasing vocabulary size for each technique.

 <dc:description>  As the BaBar experiment progresses, it produces new and unforeseen
requirements and increasing demands on capacity and feature base. The current
system is being utilized well beyond its original design specifications, and
has scaled appropriately, maintaining data consistency and durability. The
persistent event storage system has remained largely unchanged since the
initial implementation, and thus includes many design features which have
become performance bottlenecks. Programming interfaces were designed before
sufficient usage information became available. Performance and efficiency were
traded off for added flexibility to cope with future demands. With significant
experience in managing actual production data under our belt, we are now in a
position to recraft the system to better suit current needs. The Event Store
redesign is intended to eliminate redundant features while adding new ones,
increase overall performance, and contain the physical storage cost of the
world's largest database.

 <dc:description>  The adoption of Grid technology has the potential to greatly aid the BaBar
experiment. BdbServer was originally designed to extract copies of data from
the Objectivity/DB database at SLAC and IN2P3. With data now stored in multiple
locations in a variety of data formats, we are enhancing this tool. This will
enable users to extract selected deep copies of event collections and ship them
to the requested site using the facilities offered by the existing Grid
infrastructure. By building on the work done by various groups in BaBar, and
the European DataGrid, we have successfully expanded the capabilities of the
BdbServer software. This should provide a framework for future work in data
distribution.

 <dc:description>  Workpackage 8 of the European Datagrid project was formed in January 2001
with representatives from the four LHC experiments, and with experiment
independent people from five of the six main EDG partners. In September 2002
WP8 was strengthened by the addition of effort from BaBar and D0. The original
mandate of WP8 was, following the definition of short- and long-term
requirements, to port experiment software to the EDG middleware and testbed
environment. A major additional activity has been testing the basic
functionality and performance of this environment. This paper reviews
experiences and evaluations in the areas of job submission, data management,
mass storage handling, information systems and monitoring. It also comments on
the problems of remote debugging, the portability of code, and scaling problems
with increasing numbers of jobs, sites and nodes. Reference is made to the
pioneeering work of Atlas and CMS in integrating the use of the EDG Testbed
into their data challenges. A forward look is made to essential software
developments within EDG and to the necessary cooperation between EDG and LCG
for the LCG prototype due in mid 2003.

 <dc:description>  The system PL permits the translation of abstract proofs of program
correctness into programs in a variety of programming languages. A programming
language satisfying certain axioms may be the target of such a translation. The
system PL also permits the construction and proof of correctness of programs in
an abstract programming language, and permits the translation of these programs
into correct programs in a variety of languages. The abstract programming
language has an imperative style of programming with assignment statements and
side-effects, to allow the efficient generation of code. The abstract programs
may be written by humans and then translated, avoiding the need to write the
same program repeatedly in different languages or even the same language. This
system uses classical logic, is conceptually simple, and permits reasoning
about nonterminating programs using Scott-Strachey style denotational
semantics.

 <dc:description>  In the future ALICE heavy ion experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider
input data rates of up to 25 GB/s have to be handled by the High Level Trigger
(HLT) system, which has to scale them down to at most 1.25 GB/s before being
written to permanent storage. The HLT system that is being designed to cope
with these data rates consists of a large PC cluster, up to the order of a 1000
nodes, connected by a fast network. For the software that will run on these
nodes a flexible data transport and distribution software framework has been
developed. This framework consists of a set of separate components, that can be
connected via a common interface, allowing to construct different
configurations for the HLT, that are even changeable at runtime. To ensure a
fault-tolerant operation of the HLT, the framework includes a basic fail-over
mechanism that will be further expanded in the future, utilizing the runtime
reconnection feature of the framework's component interface. First performance
tests show very promising results for the software, indicating that it can
achieve an event rate for the data transport sufficiently high to satisfy
ALICE's requirements.

 <dc:description>  In this note, we describe a probabilistic attack on public key cryptosystems
based on the word/conjugacy problems for finitely presented groups of the type
proposed recently by Anshel, Anshel and Goldfeld. In such a scheme, one makes
use of the property that in the given group the word problem has a polynomial
time solution, while the conjugacy problem has no known polynomial solution. An
example is the braid group from topology in which the word problem is solvable
in polynomial time while the only known solutions to the conjugacy problem are
exponential. The attack in this paper is based on having a canonical
representative of each string relative to which a length function may be
computed. Hence the term length attack. Such canonical representatives are
known to exist for the braid group.

 <dc:description>  We present a procedure for the construction of multi-valued t-norms and
t-conorms. Our procedure makes use of a pair of single-valued t-norms and the
respective dual t-conorms and produces interval-valued t-norms and t-conorms.
In this manner we combine desirable characteristics of different t-norms and
t-conorms; if we use the t-norm min and t-conorm max, then the resulting
structure is a superlattice, i.e. the multivalued analog of a lattice.

 <dc:title>A Transformational Decision Procedure for Non-Clausal Propositional

 <dc:description>  A decision procedure for detecting valid propositional formulas is presented.
It is based on the Davis-Putnam method and deals with propositional formulas
that are initially converted to negational normal form. This procedure splits
variables but, in contrast to other decision procedures based on the
Davis-Putnam method, it does not branch. Instead, this procedure iteratively
makes validity-preserving transformations of fragments of the formula. The
transformations involve only a minimal formula part containing occurrences of
the selected variable. Selection of the best variable for splitting is crucial
in this decision procedure - it may shorten the decision process dramatically.
A variable whose splitting leads to a minimal size of the transformed formula
is selected. Also, the decision procedure performs plenty of optimizations
based on calculation of delta-sets. Some optimizations lead to removing
fragments of the formula. Others detect variables for which a single truth
value assignment is sufficient. The latest information about this research can
be found at http://www.sakharov.net/valid.html

 <dc:description>  This paper studies sequence prediction based on the monotone Kolmogorov
complexity Km=-log m, i.e. based on universal deterministic/one-part MDL. m is
extremely close to Solomonoff's prior M, the latter being an excellent
predictor in deterministic as well as probabilistic environments, where
performance is measured in terms of convergence of posteriors or losses.
Despite this closeness to M, it is difficult to assess the prediction quality
of m, since little is known about the closeness of their posteriors, which are
the important quantities for prediction. We show that for deterministic
computable environments, the &quot;posterior&quot; and losses of m converge, but rapid
convergence could only be shown on-sequence; the off-sequence behavior is
unclear. In probabilistic environments, neither the posterior nor the losses
converge, in general.

 <dc:description>  We propose flow-based analysis to estimate quality of an Internet connection.
Using results from the queuing theory we compare two expressions for backbone
traffic that have different scopes of applicability. A curve that shows
dependence of utilization of a link on a number of active flows in it describes
different states of the network. We propose a methodology for plotting such a
curve using data received from a Cisco router by NetFlow protocol, determining
the working area and the overloading point of the network. Our test is an easy
way to find a moment for upgrading the backbone.

 <dc:description>  We present a theory for modeling the structure of information and a language
(Quanta) expressing the theory. Unlike Shannon's information theory, which
focuses on the amount of information in an information system, we focus on the
structure of the information in the system. For example, we can model the
information structure corresponding to an algorithm or a physical process such
as the structure of a quantum interaction. After a brief discussion of the
relation between an evolving state-system and an information structure, we
develop an algebra of information pieces (infons) to represent the structure of
systems where descriptions of complex systems are constructed from expressions
involving descriptions of simpler information systems. We map the theory to the
Von Neumann computing model of sequences/conditionals/repetitions, and to the
class/object theory of object-oriented programming (OOP).

 <dc:description>  Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) offer an elegant way to integrate various
aspects of language in one model. Many existing algorithms developed for
learning and inference in DBNs are applicable to probabilistic language
modeling. To demonstrate the potential of DBNs for natural language processing,
we employ a DBN in an information extraction task. We show how to assemble
wealth of emerging linguistic instruments for shallow parsing, syntactic and
semantic tagging, morphological decomposition, named entity recognition etc. in
order to incrementally build a robust information extraction system. Our method
outperforms previously published results on an established benchmark domain.

 <dc:description>  New ways of documenting and describing language via electronic media coupled
with new ways of distributing the results via the World-Wide Web offer a degree
of access to language resources that is unparalleled in history. At the same
time, the proliferation of approaches to using these new technologies is
causing serious problems relating to resource discovery and resource creation.
This article describes the infrastructure that the Open Language Archives
Community (OLAC) has built in order to address these problems. Its technical
and usage infrastructures address problems of resource discovery by
constructing a single virtual library of distributed resources. Its governance
infrastructure addresses problems of resource creation by providing a mechanism
through which the language-resource community can express its consensus on
recommended best practices.

 <dc:title>Monodic temporal resolution</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Until recently, First-Order Temporal Logic (FOTL) has been little understood.
While it is well known that the full logic has no finite axiomatisation, a more
detailed analysis of fragments of the logic was not previously available.
However, a breakthrough by Hodkinson et.al., identifying a finitely
axiomatisable fragment, termed the monodic fragment, has led to improved
understanding of FOTL. Yet, in order to utilise these theoretical advances, it
is important to have appropriate proof techniques for the monodic fragment.
  In this paper, we modify and extend the clausal temporal resolution
technique, originally developed for propositional temporal logics, to enable
its use in such monodic fragments. We develop a specific normal form for
formulae in FOTL, and provide a complete resolution calculus for formulae in
this form. Not only is this clausal resolution technique useful as a practical
proof technique for certain monodic classes, but the use of this approach
provides us with increased understanding of the monodic fragment. In
particular, we here show how several features of monodic FOTL are established
as corollaries of the completeness result for the clausal temporal resolution
method. These include definitions of new decidable monodic classes,
simplification of existing monodic classes by reductions, and completeness of
clausal temporal resolution in the case of monodic logics with expanding
domains, a case with much significance in both theory and practice.

 <dc:description>  Skip graphs are a novel distributed data structure, based on skip lists, that
provide the full functionality of a balanced tree in a distributed system where
resources are stored in separate nodes that may fail at any time. They are
designed for use in searching peer-to-peer systems, and by providing the
ability to perform queries based on key ordering, they improve on existing
search tools that provide only hash table functionality. Unlike skip lists or
other tree data structures, skip graphs are highly resilient, tolerating a
large fraction of failed nodes without losing connectivity. In addition,
constructing, inserting new nodes into, searching a skip graph, and detecting
and repairing errors in the data structure introduced by node failures can be
done using simple and straightforward algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We define a measure of competitive performance for distributed algorithms
based on throughput, the number of tasks that an algorithm can carry out in a
fixed amount of work. This new measure complements the latency measure of Ajtai
et al., which measures how quickly an algorithm can finish tasks that start at
specified times. The novel feature of the throughput measure, which
distinguishes it from the latency measure, is that it is compositional: it
supports a notion of algorithms that are competitive relative to a class of
subroutines, with the property that an algorithm that is k-competitive relative
to a class of subroutines, combined with an l-competitive member of that class,
gives a combined algorithm that is kl-competitive.
  In particular, we prove the throughput-competitiveness of a class of
algorithms for collect operations, in which each of a group of n processes
obtains all values stored in an array of n registers. Collects are a
fundamental building block of a wide variety of shared-memory distributed
algorithms, and we show that several such algorithms are competitive relative
to collects. Inserting a competitive collect in these algorithms gives the
first examples of competitive distributed algorithms obtained by composition
using a general construction.

 <dc:description>  The European DataTAG project has taken a major step towards making the
concept of a worldwide computing Grid a reality. In collaboration with the
companion U.S. project iVDGL, DataTAG has realized an intercontinental testbed
spanning Europe and the U.S. integrating architecturally different Grid
implementations based on the Globus toolkit. The WorldGrid testbed has been
successfully demonstrated at SuperComputing 2002 and IST2002 where real HEP
application jobs were transparently submitted from U.S. and Europe using native
mechanisms and run where resources were available, independently of their
location. In this paper we describe the architecture of the WorldGrid testbed,
the problems encountered and the solutions taken in realizing such a testbed.
With our work we present an important step towards interoperability of Grid
middleware developed and deployed in Europe and the U.S.. Some of the solutions
developed in WorldGrid will be adopted by the LHC Computing Grid first service.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale testbed that
combines middleware components and makes them work together.

 <dc:title>Compact Approximation of Lattice Functions with Applications to

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>E.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a very simple randomised data structure that stores an
approximation from above of a lattice-valued function. Computing the function
value requires a constant number of steps, and the error probability can be
balanced with space usage, much like in Bloom filters. The structure is
particularly well suited for functions that are bottom on most of their domain.
We then show how to use our methods to store in a compact way the bad-character
shift function for variants of the Boyer-Moore text search algorithms. As a
result, we obtain practical implementations of these algorithms that can be
used with large alphabets, such as Unicode collation elements, with a small
setup time. The ideas described in this paper have been implemented as free
software under the GNU General Public License within the MG4J project
(http://mg4j.dsi.unimi.it/).

 <dc:description>  XML is now becoming an industry standard for data description and exchange.
Despite this there are still some questions about how or if this technology can
be useful in High Energy Physics software development and data analysis. This
paper aims to answer these questions by demonstrating how XML is used in the
IceCube software development system, data handling and analysis. It does this
by first surveying the concepts and tools that make up the XML technology. It
then goes on to discuss concrete examples of how these concepts and tools are
used to speed up software development in IceCube and what are the benefits of
using XML in IceCube's data handling and analysis chain. The overall aim of
this paper it to show that XML does have many benefits to bring High Energy
Physics software development and data analysis.

 <dc:description>  Dataset storage, exchange, and access play a critical role in scientific
applications. For such purposes netCDF serves as a portable and efficient file
format and programming interface, which is popular in numerous scientific
application domains. However, the original interface does not provide an
efficient mechanism for parallel data storage and access. In this work, we
present a new parallel interface for writing and reading netCDF datasets. This
interface is derived with minimum changes from the serial netCDF interface but
defines semantics for parallel access and is tailored for high performance. The
underlying parallel I/O is achieved through MPI-IO, allowing for dramatic
performance gains through the use of collective I/O optimizations. We compare
the implementation strategies with HDF5 and analyze both. Our tests indicate
programming convenience and significant I/O performance improvement with this
parallel netCDF interface.

 <dc:description>  We show how one can encode $n$ bits with $n^{o(1)}$ ``wave-bits'' using still
hypothetical filter-machines (here $o(1)$ denotes a positive quantity which
goes to 0 as $n$ goes to infity). Our present result - in a completely
different computational model - significantly improves on the quantum
superdense-coding breakthrough of Bennet and Wiesner (1992) which encoded $n$
bits by $\lceil{n/2}\rceil$ quantum-bits. We also show that our earlier
algorithm (Tech. Rep. TR03-001, ECCC, See
ftp://ftp.eccc.uni-trier.de/pub/eccc/reports/2003/TR03-001/index.html) which
used $n^{o(1)}$ muliplication for computing a representation of the dot-product
of two $n$-bit sequences modulo 6, and, similarly, an algorithm for computing a
representation of the multiplication of two $n\times n$ matrices with
$n^{2+o(1)}$ multiplications can be turned to algorithms computing the exact
dot-product or the exact matrix-product with the same number of multiplications
with filter-machines. With classical computation, computing the dot-product
needs $\Omega(n)$ multiplications and the best known algorithm for matrix
multiplication (D. Coppersmith and S. Winograd, Matrix multiplication via
arithmetic progressions, J. Symbolic Comput., 9(3):251--280, 1990) uses
$n^{2.376}$ multiplications.

 <dc:description>  For data analysis of large-scale experiments such as LHC Atlas and other
Japanese high energy and nuclear physics projects, we have constructed a Grid
test bed at ICEPP and KEK. These institutes are connected to national
scientific gigabit network backbone called SuperSINET. In our test bed, we have
installed NorduGrid middleware based on Globus, and connected 120TB HPSS at KEK
as a large scale data store. Atlas simulation data at ICEPP has been
transferred and accessed using SuperSINET. We have tested various performances
and characteristics of HPSS through this high speed WAN. The measurement
includes comparison between computing and storage resources are tightly coupled
with low latency LAN and long distant WAN.

 <dc:title>ATLAS Data Challenge 1</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Poulard, Gilbert</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>J.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 2002 the ATLAS experiment started a series of Data Challenges (DC) of
which the goals are the validation of the Computing Model, of the complete
software suite, of the data model, and to ensure the correctness of the
technical choices to be made. A major feature of the first Data Challenge (DC1)
was the preparation and the deployment of the software required for the
production of large event samples for the High Level Trigger (HLT) and physics
communities, and the production of those samples as a world-wide distributed
activity. The first phase of DC1 was run during summer 2002, and involved 39
institutes in 18 countries. More than 10 million physics events and 30 million
single particle events were fully simulated. Over a period of about 40 calendar
days 71000 CPU-days were used producing 30 Tbytes of data in about 35000
partitions. In the second phase the next processing step was performed with the
participation of 56 institutes in 21 countries (~ 4000 processors used in
parallel). The basic elements of the ATLAS Monte Carlo production system are
described. We also present how the software suite was validated and the
participating sites were certified. These productions were already partly
performed by using different flavours of Grid middleware at ~ 20 sites.

 <dc:description>  In &quot;Grids&quot; and &quot;collaboratories,&quot; we find distributed communities of resource
providers and resource consumers, within which often complex and dynamic
policies govern who can use which resources for which purpose. We propose a new
approach to the representation, maintenance, and enforcement of such policies
that provides a scalable mechanism for specifying and enforcing these policies.
Our approach allows resource providers to delegate some of the authority for
maintaining fine-grained access control policies to communities, while still
maintaining ultimate control over their resources. We also describe a prototype
implementation of this approach and an application in a data management
context.

 <dc:description>  Oval is a testing tool which help developers to detect unexpected changes in
the behavior of their software. It is able to automatically compile some test
programs, to prepare on the fly the needed configuration files, to run the
tests within a specified Unix environment, and finally to analyze the output
and check expectations. Oval does not provide utility code to help writing the
tests, therefore it is quite independant of the programming/scripting language
of the software to be tested. It can be seen as a kind of robot which apply the
tests and warn about any unexpected change in the output. Oval was developed by
the LLR laboratory for the needs of the CMS experiment, and it is now
recommended by the CERN LCG project.

 <dc:description>  High energy physics experiments including those at the Tevatron and the
upcoming LHC require analysis of large data sets which are best handled by
distributed computation. We present the design and development of a distributed
data analysis framework based on Java. Analysis jobs run through three phases:
discovery of data sets available, brokering/assignment of data sets to analysis
servers, and job execution. Each phase is represented by a set of abstract
interfaces. These interfaces allow different techniques to be used without
modification to the framework. For example, the communications interface has
been implemented by both a packet protocol and a SOAP-based scheme. User
authentication can be provided either through simple passwords or through a GSI
certificates system. Data from CMS HCAL Testbeams, the L3 LEP experiment, and a
hypothetical high-energy linear collider experiment have been interfaced with
the framework.

 <dc:title>Twelve Ways to Build CMS Crossings from ROOT Files</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The simulation of CMS raw data requires the random selection of one hundred
and fifty pileup events from a very large set of files, to be superimposed in
memory to the signal event. The use of ROOT I/O for that purpose is quite
unusual: the events are not read sequentially but pseudo-randomly, they are not
processed one by one in memory but by bunches, and they do not contain orthodox
ROOT objects but many foreign objects and templates. In this context, we have
compared the performance of ROOT containers versus the STL vectors, and the use
of trees versus a direct storage of containers. The strategy with best
performances is by far the one using clones within trees, but it stays hard to
tune and very dependant on the exact use-case. The use of STL vectors could
bring more easily similar performances in a future ROOT release.

 <dc:description>  When the IceCube experiment started serious software development it needed a
development environment in which both its developers and clients could work and
that would encourage and support a good software development process. Some of
the key features that IceCube wanted in such a environment were: the separation
of the configuration and build tools; inclusion of an issue tracking system;
support for the Unified Change Model; support for unit testing; and support for
continuous building. No single, affordable, off the shelf, environment offered
all these features. However there are many open source tools that address
subsets of these feature, therefore IceCube set about selecting those tools
which it could use in developing its own environment and adding its own tools
where no suitable tools were found. This paper outlines the tools that where
chosen, what are their responsibilities in the development environment and how
they fit together. The complete environment will be demonstrated with a walk
through of single cycle of the development process.

 <dc:description>  Having built up Linux clusters to more than 1000 nodes over the past five
years, we already have practical experience confronting some of the LHC scale
computing challenges: scalability, automation, hardware diversity, security,
and rolling OS upgrades. This paper describes the tools and processes we have
implemented, working in close collaboration with the EDG project [1],
especially with the WP4 subtask, to improve the manageability of our clusters,
in particular in the areas of system installation, configuration, and
monitoring. In addition to the purely technical issues, providing shared
interactive and batch services which can adapt to meet the diverse and changing
requirements of our users is a significant challenge. We describe the
developments and tuning that we have introduced on our LSF based systems to
maximise both responsiveness to users and overall system utilisation. Finally,
this paper will describe the problems we are facing in enlarging our
heterogeneous Linux clusters, the progress we have made in dealing with the
current issues and the steps we are taking to gridify the clusters

 <dc:description>  HepRep is a generic, hierarchical format for description of graphics
representables that can be augmented by physics information and relational
properties. It was developed for high energy physics event display applications
and is especially suited to client/server or component frameworks. The GLAST
experiment, an international effort led by NASA for a gamma-ray telescope to
launch in 2006, chose HepRep to provide a flexible, extensible and maintainable
framework for their event display without tying their users to any one graphics
application. To support HepRep in their GUADI infrastructure, GLAST developed a
HepRep filler and builder architecture. The architecture hides the details of
XML and CORBA in a set of base and helper classes allowing physics experts to
focus on what data they want to represent. GLAST has two GAUDI services:
HepRepSvc, which registers HepRep fillers in a global registry and allows the
HepRep to be exported to XML, and CorbaSvc, which allows the HepRep to be
published through a CORBA interface and which allows the client application to
feed commands back to GAUDI (such as start next event, or run some GAUDI
algorithm). GLAST's HepRep solution gives users a choice of client
applications, WIRED (written in Java) or FRED (written in C++ and Ruby), and
leaves them free to move to any future HepRep-compliant event display.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes DIRAC, the LHCb Monte Carlo production system. DIRAC has
a client/server architecture based on: Compute elements distributed among the
collaborating institutes; Databases for production management, bookkeeping (the
metadata catalogue) and software configuration; Monitoring and cataloguing
services for updating and accessing the databases. Locally installed software
agents implemented in Python monitor the local batch queue, interrogate the
production database for any outstanding production requests using the XML-RPC
protocol and initiate the job submission. The agent checks and, if necessary,
installs any required software automatically. After the job has processed the
events, the agent transfers the output data and updates the metadata catalogue.
DIRAC has been successfully installed at 18 collaborating institutes, including
the DataGRID, and has been used in recent Physics Data Challenges. In the near
to medium term future we must use a mixed environment with different types of
grid middleware or no middleware. We describe how this flexibility has been
achieved and how ubiquitously available grid middleware would improve DIRAC.

 <dc:description>  To date, the BaBar experiment has stored over 0.7PB of data in an
Objectivity/DB database. Approximately half this data-set comprises simulated
data of which more than 70% has been produced at more than 20 collaborating
institutes outside of SLAC. The operational aspects of managing such a large
data set and providing access to the physicists in a timely manner is a
challenging and complex problem. We describe the operational aspects of
managing such a large distributed data-set as well as importing and exporting
data from geographically spread BaBar collaborators. We also describe problems
common to dealing with such large datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a machine learning approach to discourse planning in
natural language generation. More specifically, we address the problem of
learning the most natural ordering of facts in discourse plans for a specific
domain. We discuss our methodology and how it was instantiated using two
different machine learning algorithms. A quantitative evaluation performed in
the domain of museum exhibit descriptions indicates that our approach performs
significantly better than manually constructed ordering rules. Being
retrainable, the resulting planners can be ported easily to other similar
domains, without requiring language technology expertise.

 <dc:description>  Registration and management of users in a large scale Grid computing
environment presents new challenges that are not well addressed by existing
protocols. Within a single Virtual Organization (VO), thousands of users will
potentially need access to hundreds of computing sites, and the traditional
model where users register for local accounts at each site will present
significant scaling problems. However, computing sites must maintain control
over access to the site and site policies generally require individual local
accounts for every user. We present here a model that allows users to register
once with a VO and yet still provides all of the computing sites the
information they require with the required level of trust. We have developed
tools to allow sites to automate the management of local accounts and the
mappings between Grid identities and local accounts.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a prototype for redundant, highly available and fault
tolerant peer to peer framework for data management. Peer to peer computing is
gaining importance due to its flexible organization, lack of central authority,
distribution of functionality to participating nodes and ability to utilize
unused computational resources. Emergence of GRID computing has provided much
needed infrastructure and administrative domain for peer to peer computing. The
components of this framework exploit peer group concept to scope service and
information search, arrange services and information in a coherent manner,
provide selective redundancy and ensure availability in face of failure and
high load conditions. A prototype system has been implemented using JXTA peer
to peer technology and XML is used for service description and interfaces,
allowing peers to communicate with services implemented in various platforms
including web services and JINI services. It utilizes code mobility to achieve
role interchange among services and ensure dynamic group membership. Security
is ensured by using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to implement group level
security policies for membership and service access.

 <dc:description>  The POOL project is the common persistency framework for the LHC experiments
to store petabytes of experiment data and metadata in a distributed and grid
enabled way. POOL is a hybrid event store consisting of a data streaming layer
and a relational layer. This paper describes the design of file catalog,
collection and metadata components which are not part of the data streaming
layer of POOL and outlines how POOL aims to provide transparent and efficient
data access for a wide range of environments and use cases - ranging from a
large production site down to a single disconnected laptops. The file catalog
is the central POOL component translating logical data references to physical
data files in a grid environment. POOL collections with their associated
metadata provide an abstract way of accessing experiment data via their logical
grouping into sets of related data objects.

 <dc:description>  AliEn (ALICE Environment) is a lightweight GRID framework developed by the
Alice Collaboration. When the experiment starts running, it will collect data
at a rate of approximately 2 PB per year, producing O(109) files per year. All
these files, including all simulated events generated during the preparation
phase of the experiment, must be accounted and reliably tracked in the GRID
environment. The backbone of AliEn is a distributed file catalogue, which
associates universal logical file name to physical file names for each dataset
and provides transparent access to datasets independently of physical location.
The file replication and transport is carried out under the control of the File
Transport Broker. In addition, the file catalogue maintains information about
every job running in the system. The jobs are distributed by the Job Resource
Broker that is implemented using a simplified pull (as opposed to traditional
push) architecture. This paper describes the Job and File Transport Resource
Brokers and shows that a similar architecture can be applied to solve both
problems.

 <dc:description>  The BaBar experiment at SLAC is in its fourth year of running. The data
processing system has been continuously evolving to meet the challenges of
higher luminosity running and the increasing bulk of data to re-process each
year. To meet these goals a two-pass processing architecture has been adopted,
where 'rolling calibrations' are quickly calculated on a small fraction of the
events in the first pass and the bulk data reconstruction done in the second.
This allows for quick detector feedback in the first pass and allows for the
parallelization of the second pass over two or more separate farms. This
two-pass system allows also for distribution of processing farms off-site. The
first such site has been setup at INFN Padova. The challenges met here were
many. The software was ported to a full Linux-based, commodity hardware system.
The raw dataset, 90 TB, was imported from SLAC utilizing a 155 Mbps network
link. A system for quality control and export of the processed data back to
SLAC was developed. Between SLAC and Padova we are currently running three
pass-one farms, with 32 CPUs each, and nine pass-two farms with 64 to 80 CPUs
each. The pass-two farms can process between 2 and 4 million events per day.
Details about the implementation and performance of the system will be
presented.

 <dc:description>  As the Grid paradigm is adopted as a standard way of sharing remote resources
across organizational domains, the need for fine-grained access control to
these resources increases. This paper presents an authorization solution for
job submission and control, developed as part of the National Fusion
Collaboratory, that uses the Globus Toolkit 2 and the Akenti authorization
service in order to perform fine-grained authorization of job and resource
management requests in a Grid environment. At job startup, it allows the system
to evaluate a user's Resource Specification Language request against
authorization policies on resource usage (determining how many CPUs or memory a
user can use on a given resource or which executables the user can run).
Furthermore, based on authorization policies, it allows other virtual
organization members to manage the user's job.

 <dc:description>  Among the services offered by the AliEn (ALICE Environment
http://alien.cern.ch) Grid framework there is a virtual file catalogue to allow
transparent access to distributed data-sets using various file transfer
protocols. $alienfs$ (AliEn File System) integrates the AliEn file catalogue as
a new file system type into the Linux kernel using LUFS, a hybrid user space
file system framework (Open Source http://lufs.sourceforge.net). LUFS uses a
special kernel interface level called VFS (Virtual File System Switch) to
communicate via a generalised file system interface to the AliEn file system
daemon. The AliEn framework is used for authentication, catalogue browsing,
file registration and read/write transfer operations. A C++ API implements the
generic file system operations. The goal of AliEnFS is to allow users easy
interactive access to a worldwide distributed virtual file system using
familiar shell commands (f.e. cp,ls,rm ...) The paper discusses general aspects
of Grid File Systems, the AliEn implementation and present and future
developments for the AliEn Grid File System.

an environment allowing to define and submit jobs to the Grid, and able to find
and use the ``best'' resources for these jobs. Application users have now been
experiencing for about a year now with this first release of the workload
management system. The experiences acquired, the feedback received by the user
and the need to plug new components implementing new functionalities, triggered
an update of the existing architecture. A description of this revised and
complemented workload management system is given.

 <dc:description>  Grid computing consists of the coordinated use of large sets of diverse,
geographically distributed resources for high performance computation.
Effective monitoring of these computing resources is extremely important to
allow efficient use on the Grid. The large number of heterogeneous computing
entities available in Grids makes the task challenging. In this work, we
describe a Grid monitoring system, called GridMonitor, that captures and makes
available the most important information from a large computing facility. The
Grid monitoring system consists of four tiers: local monitoring, archiving,
publishing and harnessing. This architecture was applied on a large scale linux
farm and network infrastructure. It can be used by many higher-level Grid
services including scheduling services and resource brokering.

 <dc:title>Understanding and Coping with Hardware and Software Failures in a Very

 <dc:subject>B.8.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When thousands of processors are involved in performing event filtering on a
trigger farm, there is likely to be a large number of failures within the
software and hardware systems. BTeV, a proton/antiproton collider experiment at
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has designed a trigger, which includes
several thousand processors. If fault conditions are not given proper
treatment, it is conceivable that this trigger system will experience failures
at a high enough rate to have a negative impact on its effectiveness. The RTES
(Real Time Embedded Systems) collaboration is a group of physicists, engineers,
and computer scientists working to address the problem of reliability in
large-scale clusters with real-time constraints such as this. Resulting
infrastructure must be highly scalable, verifiable, extensible by users, and
dynamically changeable.

 <dc:description>  Every year the PHENIX collaboration deals with increasing volume of data (now
about 1/4 PB/year). Apparently the more data the more questions how to process
all the data in most efficient way. In recent past many developments in HEP
computing were dedicated to the production environment. Now we need more tools
to help to obtain physics results from the analysis of distributed simulated
and experimental data. Developments in Grid architectures gave many examples
how distributed computing facilities can be organized to meet physics analysis
needs. We feel that our main task in this area is to try to use already
developed systems or system components in PHENIX environment.
  We are concentrating here on the followed problems: file/replica catalog
which keep names of our files, data moving over WAN, job submission in
multicluster environment.
  PHENIX is a running experiment and this fact narrowed our ability to test new
software on the collaboration computer facilities. We are experimenting with
system prototypes at State University of New York at Stony Brook (SUNYSB) where
we run midrange computing cluster for physics analysis. The talk is dedicated
to discuss some experience with Grid software and achieved results.

 <dc:title>FAYE: A Java Implement of the Frame/Stream/Stop Analysis Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Patton, S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>J.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  FAYE, The Frame AnalYsis Executable, is a Java based implementation of the
Frame/Stream/Stop model for analyzing data. Unlike traditional Event based
analysis models, the Frame/Stream/Stop model has no preference as to which part
of any data is to be analyzed, and an Event get as equal treatment as a change
in the high voltage. This model means that FAYE is a suitable analysis
framework for many different type of data analysis, such as detector trends or
as a visualization core. During the design of FAYE the emphasis has been on
clearly delineating each of the executable's responsibilities and on keeping
their implementations as completely independent as possible. This leads to the
large part of FAYE being a generic core which is experiment independent, and
smaller section that customizes this core to an experiments own data
structures. This customization can even be done in C++, using JNI, while the
executable's control remains in Java. This paper reviews the Frame/Stream/Stop
model and then looks at how FAYE has approached its implementation, with an
emphasis on which responsibilities are handled by the generic core, and which
parts an experiment must provide as part of the customization portion of the
executable.

 <dc:description>  In preparation for the planned linear collider TESLA, DESY is designing the
required buildings and facilities. The accelerator and infrastructure
components have to be allocated to buildings, and their required areas for
installation, operation and maintenance have to be determined.
Interdisciplinary working groups specify the project from different viewpoints
and need to develop a common vision as a precondition for an optimal solution.
A commercial requirements database is used as a collaborative tool, enabling
concurrent requirements specification by independent working groups. The
requirements database ensures long term storage and availability of the
emerging knowledge, and it offers a central platform for communication which is
available for all project members. It is successfully operating since summer
2002 and has since then become an important tool for the design team.

 <dc:description>  In this talk we will review the major additions and improvements made to the
ROOT system in the last 18 months and present our plans for future
developments. The additons and improvements range from modifications to the I/O
sub-system to allow users to save and restore objects of classes that have not
been instrumented by special ROOT macros, to the addition of a geometry package
designed for building, browsing, tracking and visualizing detector geometries.
Other improvements include enhancements to the quick analysis sub-system
(TTree::Draw()), the addition of classes that allow inter-file object
references (TRef, TRefArray), better support for templated and STL classes,
amelioration of the Automatic Script Compiler and the incorporation of new
fitting and mathematical tools. Efforts have also been made to increase the
modularity of the ROOT system with the introduction of more abstract interfaces
and the development of a plug-in manager. In the near future, we intend to
continue the development of PROOF and its interfacing with GRID environments.
We plan on providing an interface between Geant3, Geant4 and Fluka and the new
geometry package. The ROOT GUI classes will finally be available on Windows and
we plan to release a GUI inspector and builder. In the last year, ROOT has
drawn the endorsement of additional experiments and institutions. It is now
officially supported by CERN and used as key I/O component by the LCG project.

 <dc:description>  Next-generation projects in High Energy Physics will reach again a new
dimension of complexity. Information management has to ensure an efficient and
economic information flow within the collaborations, offering world-wide
up-to-date information access to the collaborators as one condition for
successful projects. DESY introduces several information systems in preparation
for the planned linear collider TESLA: a Requirements Management System (RMS)
is in production for the TESLA planning group, a Product Data Management System
(PDMS) is in production since the beginning of 2002 and is supporting the
cavity preparation and the general engineering of accelerator components. A
pilot Asset Management System (AMS) is in production for supporting the
management and maintenance of the technical infrastructure, and a Facility
Management System (FMS) with a Geographic Information System (GIS) is currently
being introduced to support civil engineering. Efforts have been started to
integrate the systems with the goal that users can retrieve information through
a single point of access. The paper gives an introduction to information
management and the activities at DESY.

 <dc:description>  Managing large-scale software products is a complex software engineering
task. The automation of the software development, release and distribution
process is most beneficial in the large collaborations, where the big number of
developers, multiple platforms and distributed environment are typical factors.
This paper describes Build and Output Analyzer framework and its components
that have been developed in CMS to facilitate software maintenance and improve
software quality. The system allows to generate, control and analyze various
types of automated software builds and tests, such as regular rebuilds of the
development code, software integration for releases and installation of the
existing versions.

 <dc:description>  In the context of the ATLAS experiment there is growing evidence of the
importance of different kinds of Meta-data including all the important details
of the detector and data acquisition that are vital for the analysis of the
acquired data. The Online BookKeeper (OBK) is a component of ATLAS online
software that stores all information collected while running the experiment,
including the Meta-data associated with the event acquisition, triggering and
storage. The facilities for acquisition of control data within the on-line
software framework, together with a full functional Web interface, make the OBK
a powerful tool containing all information needed for event analysis, including
an electronic log book.
  In this paper we explain how OBK plays a role as one of the main collectors
and managers of Meta-data produced on-line, and we'll also focus on the Web
facilities already available. The usage of the web interface as an electronic
run logbook is also explained, together with the future extensions.
  We describe the technology used in OBK development and how we arrived at the
present level explaining the previous experience with various DBMS
technologies. The extensive performance evaluations that have been performed
and the usage in the production environment of the ATLAS test beams are also
analysed.

 <dc:description>  Virtual organizations (VOs) are communities of resource providers and users
distributed over multiple policy domains. These VOs often wish to define and
enforce consistent policies in addition to the policies of their underlying
domains. This is challenging, not only because of the problems in distributing
the policy to the domains, but also because of the fact that those domains may
each have different capabilities for enforcing the policy. The Community
Authorization Service (CAS) solves this problem by allowing resource providers
to delegate some policy authority to the VO while maintaining ultimate control
over their resources. In this paper we describe CAS and our past and current
implementations of CAS, and we discuss our plans for CAS-related research.

 <dc:description>  The Athena Startup Kit (ASK), is an interactive front-end to the Atlas
software framework (ATHENA). Written in python, a very effective &quot;glue&quot;
language, it is build on top of the, in principle unrelated, code repository,
build, configuration, debug, binding, and analysis tools. ASK automates many
error-prone tasks that are otherwise left to the end-user, thereby pre-empting
a whole category of potential problems. Through the existing tools, which ASK
will setup for the user if and as needed, it locates available resources,
maintains job coherency, manages the run-time environment, allows for
interactivity and debugging, and provides standalone execution scripts. An
end-user who wants to run her own analysis algorithms within the standard
environment can let ASK generate the appropriate skeleton package, the needed
dependencies and run-time, as well as a default job options script. For new and
casual users, ASK comes with a graphical user interface; for advanced users,
ASK has a scriptable command line interface. Both are built on top of the same
set of libraries. ASK does not need to be, and isn't, experiment neutral. Thus
it has built-in workarounds for known gotcha's, that would otherwise be a major
time-sink for each and every new user. ASK minimizes the overhead for those
physicists in Atlas who just want to write and run their analysis code.

 <dc:description>  We present two versions of a grid job submission system produced for the
BaBar experiment. Both use globus job submission to process data spread across
various sites, producing output which can be combined for analysis. The
problems encountered with authorisation and authentication, data location, job
submission, and the input and output sandboxes are described, as are the
solutions. The total system is still some way short of the aims of enterprises
such as the EDG, but represent a significant step along the way.

 <dc:description>  The Gaudi/Athena and Grid Alliance (GANGA) is a front-end for the
configuration, submission, monitoring, bookkeeping, output collection, and
reporting of computing jobs run on a local batch system or on the grid. In
particular, GANGA handles jobs that use applications written for the Gaudi
software framework shared by the Atlas and LHCb experiments. GANGA exploits the
commonality of Gaudi-based computing jobs, while insulating against grid-,
batch- and framework-specific technicalities, to maximize end-user productivity
in defining, configuring, and executing jobs. Designed for a python-based
component architecture, GANGA has a modular underpinning and is therefore well
placed for contributing to, and benefiting from, work in related projects. Its
functionality is accessible both from a scriptable command-line interface, for
expert users and automated tasks, and through a graphical interface, which
simplifies the interaction with GANGA for beginning and c1asual users.
  This paper presents the GANGA design and implementation, the development of
the underlying software bus architecture, and the functionality of the first
public GANGA release.

 <dc:description>  Grid applications are, by their nature, wide-area distributed applications.
This WAN aspect of Grid applications makes the use of conventional monitoring
and instrumentation tools (such as top, gprof, LSF Monitor, etc) impractical
for verification that the application is running correctly and efficiently. To
be effective, monitoring data must be &quot;end-to-end&quot;, meaning that all components
between the Grid application endpoints must be monitored. Instrumented
applications can generate a large amount of monitoring data, so typically the
instrumentation is off by default. For jobs running on a Grid, there needs to
be a general mechanism to remotely activate the instrumentation in running
jobs. The NetLogger Toolkit Activation Service provides this mechanism.
  To demonstrate this, we have instrumented the ATLAS Athena Framework with
NetLogger to generate monitoring events. We then use a GMA-based activation
service to control NetLogger's trigger mechanism. The NetLogger trigger
mechanism allows one to easily start, stop, or change the logging level of a
running program by modifying a trigger file. We present here details of the
design of the NetLogger implementation of the GMA-based activation service and
the instrumentation service for Athena. We also describe how this activation
service allows us to non-intrusively collect and visualize the ATLAS Athena
Framework monitoring data.

 <dc:description>  LHC-era HENP experiments will generate unprecidented volumes of data and
require commensurately large compute resources. These resources are larger than
can be marshalled at any one site within the community. Production
reconstruction, analysis, and simulation will need to take maximum advantage of
these distributed computing and storage resources using the new capabilities
offered by the Grid computing paradigm. Since large-scale, coordinated Grid
computing involves user access across many Regional Centers and national and
funding boundaries, one of the most crucial aspects of Grid computing is that
of user authentication and authorization. While projects such as the DOE Grids
CA have gone a long way to solving the problem of distributed authentication,
the authorization problem is still largely open.
  We have developed and tested a prototype VO-Role management system using the
Community Authorization Service (CAS) from the Globus project. CAS allows for a
flexible definition of resources. In this protoype we define a role as a
resource within the CAS database and assign individuals in the VO access to
that resource to indicate their ability to assert the role. The access of an
individual to this VO-Role resource is then an annotation of the user's CAS
proxy certificate. This annotation is then used by the local resource managers
to authorize access to local compute and storage resources at a granularity
which is base on neither VOs nor individuals. We report here on the
configuration details for the CAS database and the Globus Gatekeeper and on how
this general approch could be formalized and extended to meet the clear needs
of LHC experiments using the Grid.

 <dc:description>  The Atlas collaboration at CERN has adopted the Gaudi software architecture
which belongs to the blackboard family: data objects produced by knowledge
sources (e.g. reconstruction modules) are posted to a common in-memory data
base from where other modules can access them and produce new data objects. The
StoreGate has been designed, based on the Atlas requirements and the experience
of other HENP systems such as Babar, CDF, CLEO, D0 and LHCB, to identify in a
simple and efficient fashion (collections of) data objects based on their type
and/or the modules which posted them to the Transient Data Store (the
blackboard). The developer also has the freedom to use her preferred key class
to uniquely identify a data object according to any other criterion. Besides
this core functionality, the StoreGate provides the developers with a powerful
interface to handle in a coherent fashion persistable references, object
lifetimes, memory management and access control policy for the data objects in
the Store. It also provides a Handle/Proxy mechanism to define and hide the
cache fault mechanism: upon request, a missing Data Object can be transparently
created and added to the Transient Store presumably retrieving it from a
persistent data-base, or even reconstructing it on demand.

 <dc:description>  The Grid Datafarm architecture is designed for global petascale
data-intensive computing. It provides a global parallel filesystem with online
petascale storage, scalable I/O bandwidth, and scalable parallel processing,
and it can exploit local I/O in a grid of clusters with tens of thousands of
nodes. One of features is that it manages file replicas in filesystem metadata
for fault tolerance and load balancing.
  This paper discusses and evaluates several techniques to support
long-distance fast file replication. The Grid Datafarm manages a ranked group
of files as a Gfarm file, each file, called a Gfarm file fragment, being stored
on a filesystem node, or replicated on several filesystem nodes. Each Gfarm
file fragment is replicated independently and in parallel using rate-controlled
HighSpeed TCP with network striping. On a US-Japan testbed with 10,000 km
distance, we achieve 419 Mbps using 2 nodes on each side, and 741 Mbps using 4
nodes out of 893 Mbps with two transpacific networks.

 <dc:description>  Sheer amount of petabyte scale data foreseen in the LHC experiments require a
careful consideration of the persistency design and the system design in the
world-wide distributed computing. Event parallelism of the HENP data analysis
enables us to take maximum advantage of the high performance cluster computing
and networking when we keep the parallelism both in the data processing phase,
in the data management phase, and in the data transfer phase. A modular
architecture of FADS/ Goofy, a versatile detector simulation framework for
Geant4, enables an easy choice of plug-in facilities for persistency
technologies such as Objectivity/DB and ROOT I/O. The framework is designed to
work naturally with the parallel file system of Grid Datafarm (Gfarm).
FADS/Goofy is proven to generate 10^6 Geant4-simulated Atlas Mockup events
using a 512 CPU PC cluster. The data in ROOT I/O files is replicated using
Gfarm file system. The histogram information is collected from the distributed
ROOT files. During the data replication it has been demonstrated to achieve
more than 2.3 Gbps data transfer rate between the PC clusters over seven
participating PC clusters in the United States and in Japan.

 <dc:description>  Experiments like ATLAS at LHC involve a scale of computing and data
management that greatly exceeds the capability of existing systems, making it
necessary to resort to Grid-based Parallel Event Processing Systems (GEPS).
Traditional Grid systems concentrate the data in central data servers which
have to be accessed by many nodes each time an analysis or processing job
starts. These systems require very powerful central data servers and make
little use of the distributed disk space that is available in commodity
computers. The Grid-Brick system, which is described in this paper, follows a
different approach. The data storage is split among all grid nodes having each
one a piece of the whole information. Users submit queries and the system will
distribute the tasks through all the nodes and retrieve the result, merging
them together in the Job Submit Server. The main advantage of using this system
is the huge scalability it provides, while its biggest disadvantage appears in
the case of failure of one of the nodes. A workaround for this problem involves
data replication or backup.

 <dc:description>  The BABAR Web site was established in 1993 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) to support the BABAR experiment, to report its results, and to
facilitate communication among its scientific and engineering collaborators,
currently numbering about 600 individuals from 75 collaborating institutions in
10 countries. The BABAR Web site is, therefore, a community Web site. At the
same time it is hosted at SLAC and funded by agencies that demand adherence to
policies decided under different priorities. Additionally, the BABAR Web
administrators deal with the problems that arise during the course of managing
users, content, policies, standards, and changing technologies. Desired
solutions to some of these problems may be incompatible with the overall
administration of the SLAC Web sites and/or the SLAC policies and concerns.
There are thus different perspectives of the same Web site and differing
expectations in segments of the SLAC population which act as constraints and
challenges in any review or re-engineering activities. Web Engineering, which
post-dates the BABAR Web, has aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of
all aspects of Web development. This paper reports on the first part of a
recent review of application of Web Engineering methods to the BABAR Web site,
which has led to explicit user and information models of the BABAR community
and how SLAC and the BABAR community relate and react to each other. The paper
identifies the issues of a community Web site in a hierarchical,
semi-governmental sector and formulates a strategy for periodic reviews of
BABAR and similar sites.

 <dc:description>  The aim of the recently EU-funded MammoGrid project is, in the light of
emerging Grid technology, to develop a European-wide database of mammograms
that will be used to develop a set of important healthcare applications and
investigate the potential of this Grid to support effective co-working between
healthcare professionals throughout the EU. The MammoGrid consortium intends to
use a Grid model to enable distributed computing that spans national borders.
This Grid infrastructure will be used for deploying novel algorithms as
software directly developed or enhanced within the project. Using the MammoGrid
clinicians will be able to harness the use of massive amounts of medical image
data to perform epidemiological studies, advanced image processing,
radiographic education and ultimately, tele-diagnosis over communities of
medical &quot;virtual organisations&quot;. This is achieved through the use of
Grid-compliant services [1] for managing (versions of) massively distributed
files of mammograms, for handling the distributed execution of mammograms
analysis software, for the development of Grid-aware algorithms and for the
sharing of resources between multiple collaborating medical centres. All this
is delivered via a novel software and hardware information infrastructure that,
in addition guarantees the integrity and security of the medical data. The
MammoGrid implementation is based on AliEn, a Grid framework developed by the
ALICE Collaboration. AliEn provides a virtual file catalogue that allows
transparent access to distributed data-sets and provides top to bottom
implementation of a lightweight Grid applicable to cases when handling of a
large number of files is required. This paper details the architecture that
will be implemented by the MammoGrid project.

 <dc:description>  The MonALISA (Monitoring Agents in A Large Integrated Services Architecture)
system provides a distributed monitoring service. MonALISA is based on a
scalable Dynamic Distributed Services Architecture which is designed to meet
the needs of physics collaborations for monitoring global Grid systems, and is
implemented using JINI/JAVA and WSDL/SOAP technologies. The scalability of the
system derives from the use of multithreaded Station Servers to host a variety
of loosely coupled self-describing dynamic services, the ability of each
service to register itself and then to be discovered and used by any other
services, or clients that require such information, and the ability of all
services and clients subscribing to a set of events (state changes) in the
system to be notified automatically. The framework integrates several existing
monitoring tools and procedures to collect parameters describing computational
nodes, applications and network performance. It has built-in SNMP support and
network-performance monitoring algorithms that enable it to monitor end-to-end
network performance as well as the performance and state of site facilities in
a Grid. MonALISA is currently running around the clock on the US CMS test Grid
as well as an increasing number of other sites. It is also being used to
monitor the performance and optimize the interconnections among the reflectors
in the VRVS system.

 <dc:description>  The measurement of the similarity of RNA secondary structures, and in general
of contact structures, of a fixed length has several specific applications. For
instance, it is used in the analysis of the ensemble of suboptimal secondary
structures generated by a given algorithm on a given RNA sequence, and in the
comparison of the secondary structures predicted by different algorithms on a
given RNA molecule. It is also a useful tool in the quantitative study of
sequence-structure maps. A way to measure this similarity is by means of
metrics. In this paper we introduce a new class of metrics $d_{m}$, $m\geq 3$,
on the set of all contact structures of a fixed length, based on their
representation by means of edge ideals in a polynomial ring. These metrics can
be expressed in terms of Hilbert functions of monomial ideals, which allows the
use of several public domain computer algebra systems to compute them. We study
some abstract properties of these metrics, and we obtain explicit descriptions
of them for $m=3,4$ on arbitrary contact structures and for $m=5,6$ on RNA
secondary structures.

 <dc:title>Making refactoring decisions in large-scale Java systems: an empirical

 <dc:description>  Decisions on which classes to refactor are fraught with difficulty. The
problem of identifying candidate classes becomes acute when confronted with
large systems comprising hundreds or thousands of classes. In this paper, we
describe a metric by which key classes, and hence candidates for refactoring,
can be identified. Measures quantifying the usage of two forms of coupling,
inheritance and aggregation, together with two other class features (number of
methods and attributes) were extracted from the source code of three large Java
systems. Our research shows that metrics from other research domains can be
adapted to the software engineering process. Substantial differences were found
between each of the systems in terms of the key classes identified and hence
opportunities for refactoring those classes varied between those systems.

 <dc:description>  k is the most important parameter in a text categorization system based on
k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm (kNN).In the classification process, k nearest
documents to the test one in the training set are determined firstly. Then, the
predication can be made according to the category distribution among these k
nearest neighbors. Generally speaking, the class distribution in the training
set is uneven. Some classes may have more samples than others. Therefore, the
system performance is very sensitive to the choice of the parameter k. And it
is very likely that a fixed k value will result in a bias on large categories.
To deal with these problems, we propose an improved kNN algorithm, which uses
different numbers of nearest neighbors for different categories, rather than a
fixed number across all categories. More samples (nearest neighbors) will be
used for deciding whether a test document should be classified to a category,
which has more samples in the training set. Preliminary experiments on Chinese
text categorization show that our method is less sensitive to the parameter k
than the traditional one, and it can properly classify documents belonging to
smaller classes with a large k. The method is promising for some cases, where
estimating the parameter k via cross-validation is not allowed.

 <dc:description>  For efficiency of the large production tasks distributed worldwide, it is
essential to provide shared production management tools comprised of
integratable and interoperable services. To enhance the ATLAS DC1 production
toolkit, we introduced and tested a Virtual Data services component. For each
major data transformation step identified in the ATLAS data processing pipeline
(event generation, detector simulation, background pile-up and digitization,
etc) the Virtual Data Cookbook (VDC) catalogue encapsulates the specific data
transformation knowledge and the validated parameters settings that must be
provided before the data transformation invocation. To provide for local-remote
transparency during DC1 production, the VDC database server delivered in a
controlled way both the validated production parameters and the templated
production recipes for thousands of the event generation and detector
simulation jobs around the world, simplifying the production management
solutions.

 <dc:description>  We present the design and the status of the database for detector description
parameters in ATLAS experiment. The ATLAS Primary Numbers are the parameters
defining the detector geometry and digitization in simulations, as well as
certain reconstruction parameters. Since the detailed ATLAS detector
description needs more than 10,000 such parameters, a preferred solution is to
have a single verified source for all these data. The database stores the data
dictionary for each parameter collection object, providing schema evolution
support for object-based retrieval of parameters. The same Primary Numbers are
served to many different clients accessing the database: the ATLAS software
framework Athena, the Geant3 heritage framework Atlsim, the Geant4 developers
framework FADS/Goofy, the generator of XML output for detector description, and
several end-user clients for interactive data navigation, including web-based
browsers and ROOT. The choice of the MySQL database product for the
implementation provides additional benefits: the Primary Numbers database can
be used on the developers laptop when disconnected (using the MySQL embedded
server technology), with data being updated when the laptop is connected (using
the MySQL database replication).

 <dc:description>  We show how to support efficient back traversal in a unidirectional list,
using small memory and with essentially no slowdown in forward steps. Using
$O(\log n)$ memory for a list of size $n$, the $i$'th back-step from the
farthest point reached so far takes $O(\log i)$ time in the worst case, while
the overhead per forward step is at most $\epsilon$ for arbitrary small
constant $\epsilon&gt;0$. An arbitrary sequence of forward and back steps is
allowed. A full trade-off between memory usage and time per back-step is
presented: $k$ vs. $kn^{1/k}$ and vice versa. Our algorithms are based on a
novel pebbling technique which moves pebbles on a virtual binary, or $t$-ary,
tree that can only be traversed in a pre-order fashion. The compact data
structures used by the pebbling algorithms, called list traversal synopses,
extend to general directed graphs, and have other interesting applications,
including memory efficient hash-chain implementation. Perhaps the most
surprising application is in showing that for any program, arbitrary rollback
steps can be efficiently supported with small overhead in memory, and marginal
overhead in its ordinary execution. More concretely: Let $P$ be a program that
runs for at most $T$ steps, using memory of size $M$. Then, at the cost of
recording the input used by the program, and increasing the memory by a factor
of $O(\log T)$ to $O(M \log T)$, the program $P$ can be extended to support an
arbitrary sequence of forward execution and rollback steps: the $i$'th rollback
step takes $O(\log i)$ time in the worst case, while forward steps take O(1)
time in the worst case, and $1+\epsilon$ amortized time per step.

 <dc:description>  This paper gives an overview of a reconstruction algorithm for muon events in
ATLAS experiment at CERN. After a short introduction on ATLAS Muon
Spectrometer, we will describe the procedure performed by the algorithms
Muonbox and Muonboy (last version) in order to achieve correctly the
reconstruction task. These algorithms have been developed in Fortran language
and are working in the official C++ framework Athena, as well as in stand alone
mode. A description of the interaction between Muonboy and Athena will be
given, together with the reconstruction performances (efficiency and momentum
resolution) obtained with MonteCarlo data.

 <dc:description>  The relationship between Popper spaces (conditional probability spaces that
satisfy some regularity conditions), lexicographic probability systems (LPS's),
and nonstandard probability spaces (NPS's) is considered. If countable
additivity is assumed, Popper spaces and a subclass of LPS's are equivalent;
without the assumption of countable additivity, the equivalence no longer
holds. If the state space is finite, LPS's are equivalent to NPS's. However, if
the state space is infinite, NPS's are shown to be more general than LPS's.

 <dc:title>On the Relationship between Strand Spaces and Multi-Agent Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Strand spaces are a popular framework for the analysis of security protocols.
Strand spaces have some similarities to a formalism used successfully to model
protocols for distributed systems, namely multi-agent systems. We explore the
exact relationship between these two frameworks here. It turns out that a key
difference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces
and explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from
strand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in
the strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest
can be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in
the strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To
highlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand
spaces can be extended to model more systems.

 <dc:description>  Web Engineering is the application of systematic, disciplined and
quantifiable approaches to development, operation, and maintenance of Web-based
applications. It is both a pro-active approach and a growing collection of
theoretical and empirical research in Web application development. This paper
gives an overview of Web Engineering by addressing the questions: a) why is it
needed? b) what is its domain of operation? c) how does it help and what should
it do to improve Web application development? and d) how should it be
incorporated in education and training? The paper discusses the significant
differences that exist between Web applications and conventional software, the
taxonomy of Web applications, the progress made so far and the research issues
and experience of creating a specialisation at the master's level. The paper
reaches a conclusion that Web Engineering at this stage is a moving target
since Web technologies are constantly evolving, making new types of
applications possible, which in turn may require innovations in how they are
built, deployed and maintained.

 <dc:description>  This paper examines how a &quot;Distributed Heterogeneous Relational Data
Warehouse&quot; can be integrated in a Grid environment that will provide physicists
with efficient access to large and small object collections drawn from
databases at multiple sites. This paper investigates the requirements of
Grid-enabling such a warehouse, and explores how these requirements may be met
by extensions to existing Grid middleware. We present initial results obtained
with a working prototype warehouse of this kind using both SQLServer and
Oracle9i, where a Grid-enabled web-services interface makes it easier for
web-applications to access the distributed contents of the databases securely.
Based on the success of the prototype, we proposes a framework for using
heterogeneous relational data warehouse through the web-service interface and
create a single &quot;Virtual Database System&quot; for users. The ability to
transparently access data in this way, as shown in prototype, is likely to be a
very powerful facility for HENP and other grid users wishing to collate and
analyze information distributed over Grid.

 <dc:description>  The Run Control and Monitor System (RCMS) of the CMS experiment is the set of
hardware and software components responsible for controlling and monitoring the
experiment during data-taking. It provides users with a &quot;virtual counting
room&quot;, enabling them to operate the experiment and to monitor detector status
and data quality from any point in the world. This paper describes the
architecture of the RCMS with particular emphasis on its scalability through a
distributed collection of nodes arranged in a tree-based hierarchy. The current
implementation of the architecture in a prototype RCMS used in test beam
setups, detector validations and DAQ demonstrators is documented. A discussion
of the key technologies used, including Web Services, and the results of tests
performed with a 128-node system are presented.

 <dc:description>  Grid technologies aim at enabling a coordinated resource-sharing and
problem-solving capabilities over local and wide area networks and span
locations, organizations, machine architectures and software boundaries. The
heterogeneity of involved resources and the need for interoperability among
different grid middlewares require the sharing of a common information model.
Abstractions of different flavors of resources and services and conceptual
schemas of domain specific entities require a collaboration effort in order to
enable a coherent information services cooperation.
  With this paper, we present the result of our experience in grid resources
and services modelling carried out within the Grid Laboratory Uniform
Environment (GLUE) effort, a joint US and EU High Energy Physics projects
collaboration towards grid interoperability. The first implementation-neutral
agreement on services such as batch computing and storage manager, resources
such as the hierarchy cluster, sub-cluster, host and the storage library are
presented. Design guidelines and operational results are depicted together with
open issues and future evolutions.

 <dc:description>  The CDF and D0 experiments probe the high-energy frontier and as they do so
have accumulated hundreds of Terabytes of data on the way to petabytes of data
over the next two years. The experiments have made a commitment to use the
developing Grid based on the SAM system to handle these data. The D0 SAM has
been extended for use in CDF as common patterns of design emerged to meet the
similar requirements of these experiments. The process by which the merger was
achieved is explained with particular emphasis on lessons learned concerning
the database design patterns plus realization of the use cases.

 <dc:description>  We report on the production experience of the D0 experiment at the Fermilab
Tevatron, using the SAM data handling system with a variety of computing
hardware configurations, batch systems, and mass storage strategies. We have
stored more than 300 TB of data in the Fermilab Enstore mass storage system. We
deliver data through this system at an average rate of more than 2 TB/day to
analysis programs, with a substantial multiplication factor in the consumed
data through intelligent cache management. We handle more than 1.7 Million
files in this system and provide data delivery to user jobs at Fermilab on four
types of systems: a reconstruction farm, a large SMP system, a Linux batch
cluster, and a Linux desktop cluster. In addition, we import simulation data
generated at 6 sites worldwide, and deliver data to jobs at many more sites. We
describe the scope of the data handling deployment worldwide, the operational
experience with this system, and the feedback of that experience.

 <dc:description>  The D0 experiment is facing many exciting challenges providing a computing
environment for its worldwide collaboration. Transparent access to data for
processing and analysis has been enabled through deployment of its SAM system
to collaborating sites and additional functionality will be provided soon with
SAMGrid components. In order to maximize access to global storage,
computational and intellectual resources, and to enable the system to scale to
the large demands soon to be realized, several strategic sites have been
identified as Regional Analysis Centers (RAC's). These sites play an expanded
role within the system. The philosophy and function of these centers is
discussed and details of their composition and operation are outlined. The plan
for future additional centers is also addressed.

 <dc:description>  The Virtual Rooms Videoconferencing Service (VRVS) provides a worldwide
videoconferencing service and collaborative environment to the research and
education communities. This system provides a low cost, bandwidth-efficient,
extensible means for videoconferencing and remote collaboration over networks
within the High Energy and Nuclear Physics communities (HENP). VRVS has become
a standard part of the toolset used daily by a large sector of HENP, and it is
used increasingly for other DoE/NSF-supported programs. The current features
included multi-protocol, multi-OS support for all significant video enabled
clients including: H.323, Mbone, QuickTime, MPEG2, Java Media Framework, and
other clients. The current architecture makes VRVS a distributed, highly
functional, and efficient software-only system for multipoint audio, video and
web conferencing and collaboration over global IP networks. VRVS has developed
the VRVS-AG Reflector and a specialized Web interface that enables end users to
connect to any Access Grid (AG) session, in any of the AG &quot;virtual venues&quot; from
anywhere worldwide. The VRVS system has now been running for the last five and
half years, offering to the HENP community a working and reliable tool for
collaboration within groups and among physicists dispersed world-wide. The goal
of this ongoing effort is to develop the next generation collaborative systems
running over next generation networks. The new developments area integrate
emerging standards, include all security aspects, and will extend the range of
VRVS video technologies supported to cover the latest high end standards
quality. We will focus the discussion on the new capability provides by the
latest version V3.0 and its future evolution.

 <dc:title>Deciding regular grammar logics with converse through first-order logic</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We provide a simple translation of the satisfiability problem for regular
grammar logics with converse into GF2, which is the intersection of the guarded
fragment and the 2-variable fragment of first-order logic. This translation is
theoretically interesting because it translates modal logics with certain frame
conditions into first-order logic, without explicitly expressing the frame
conditions.
  A consequence of the translation is that the general satisfiability problem
for regular grammar logics with converse is in EXPTIME. This extends a previous
result of the first author for grammar logics without converse. Using the same
method, we show how some other modal logics can be naturally translated into
GF2, including nominal tense logics and intuitionistic logic.
  In our view, the results in this paper show that the natural first-order
fragment corresponding to regular grammar logics is simply GF2 without extra
machinery such as fixed point-operators.

properties of these endofunctors are proved, e.g. the existence of a free

 <dc:title>A Method for Solving Distributed Service Allocation Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vidal, Jose M</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.11</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a method for solving service allocation problems in which a set of
services must be allocated to a set of agents so as to maximize a global
utility. The method is completely distributed so it can scale to any number of
services without degradation. We first formalize the service allocation problem
and then present a simple hill-climbing, a global hill-climbing, and a
bidding-protocol algorithm for solving it. We analyze the expected performance
of these algorithms as a function of various problem parameters such as the
branching factor and the number of agents. Finally, we use the sensor
allocation problem, an instance of a service allocation problem, to show the
bidding protocol at work. The simulations also show that phase transition on
the expected quality of the solution exists as the amount of communication
between agents increases.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning is commonly used with function approximation. However,
very few positive results are known about the convergence of function
approximation based RL control algorithms. In this paper we show that TD(0) and
Sarsa(0) with linear function approximation is convergent for a simple class of
problems, where the system is linear and the costs are quadratic (the LQ
control problem). Furthermore, we show that for systems with Gaussian noise and
non-completely observable states (the LQG problem), the mentioned RL algorithms
are still convergent, if they are combined with Kalman filtering.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with the verification of reachability properties in a
commonly used state transition model of communication protocols, which consists
of finite state machines connected by potentially unbounded FIFO channels.
Although simple reachability problems are undecidable for general protocols
with unbounded channels, they are decidable for the protocols with the
recognizable channel property. The decidability question is open for the
protocols with the rational channel property.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm called the Best Trail Algorithm, which helps solve
the hypertext navigation problem by automating the construction of memex-like
trails through the corpus. The algorithm performs a probabilistic best-first
expansion of a set of navigation trees to find relevant and compact trails. We
describe the implementation of the algorithm, scoring methods for trails,
filtering algorithms and a new metric called \emph{potential gain} which
measures the potential of a page for future navigation opportunities.

 <dc:title>Heuristic to reduce the complexity of complete bipartite graphs to

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>G.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A maximum weighted matching for bipartite graphs $G=(A \cup B,E)$ can be
found by using the algorithm of Edmonds and Karp with a Fibonacci Heap and a
modified Dijkstra in $O(nm + n^2 \log{n})$ time where n is the number of nodes
and m the number of edges. For the case that $|A|=|B|$ the number of edges is
$n^2$ and therefore the complexity is $O(n^3)$. In this paper we want to
present a simple heuristic method to reduce the number of edges of complete
bipartite graphs $G=(A \cup B,E)$ with $|A|=|B|$ such that $m = n\log{n}$ and
therefore the complexity of such that $m = n\log{n}$ and therefore the
complexity of $O(n^2 \log{n})$. The weights of all edges in G must be uniformly
distributed in [0,1].

 <dc:description>  As examples such as the Monty Hall puzzle show, applying conditioning to
update a probability distribution on a ``naive space'', which does not take
into account the protocol used, can often lead to counterintuitive results.
Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'') in the
statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'' conditioning in a naive
space works. We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we
provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm
that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This
substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more
generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing
relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that
characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show
that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives
the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained
in the literature on CAR and MRE.

 <dc:description>  In the present paper a newer application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
has been developed i.e., predicting response-function results of
electrical-mechanical system through ANN. This method is specially useful to
complex systems for which it is not possible to find the response-function
because of complexity of the system. The proposed approach suggests that how
even without knowing the response-function, the response-function results can
be predicted with the use of ANN to the system. The steps used are: (i)
Depending on the system, the ANN-architecture and the input &amp; output parameters
are decided, (ii) Training &amp; test data are generated from simplified circuits
and through tactic-superposition of it for complex circuits, (iii) Training the
ANN with training data through many cycles and (iv) Test-data are used for
predicting the response-function results. It is found that the proposed novel
method for response prediction works satisfactorily. Thus this method could be
used specially for complex systems where other methods are unable to tackle it.
In this paper the application of ANN is particularly demonstrated to
electrical-circuit system but can be applied to other systems too.

 <dc:description>  Given the joint chances of a pair of random variables one can compute
quantities of interest, like the mutual information. The Bayesian treatment of
unknown chances involves computing, from a second order prior distribution and
the data likelihood, a posterior distribution of the chances. A common
treatment of incomplete data is to assume ignorability and determine the
chances by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The two different
methods above are well established but typically separated. This paper joins
the two approaches in the case of Dirichlet priors, and derives efficient
approximations for the mean, mode and the (co)variance of the chances and the
mutual information. Furthermore, we prove the unimodality of the posterior
distribution, whence the important property of convergence of EM to the global
maximum in the chosen framework. These results are applied to the problem of
selecting features for incremental learning and naive Bayes classification. A
fast filter based on the distribution of mutual information is shown to
outperform the traditional filter based on empirical mutual information on a
number of incomplete real data sets.

 <dc:description>  We had assembled a Java package, known as MatrixPak, of four classes for the
purpose of numerical matrix computation. The classes are matrix,
matrix_operations, StrToMatrix, and MatrixToStr; all of which are inherited
from java.lang.Object class. Class matrix defines a matrix as a two-dimensional
array of float types, and contains the following mathematical methods:
transpose, adjoint, determinant, inverse, minor and cofactor. Class
matrix_operations contains the following mathematical methods: matrix addition,
matrix subtraction, matrix multiplication, and matrix exponential. Class
StrToMatrix contains methods necessary to parse a string representation (for
example, [[2 3 4]-[5 6 7]]) of a matrix into a matrix definition, whereas class
MatrixToStr does the reverse.

 <dc:description>  The 2 x 2 games, in particular the Prisoner's Dilemma, have been extensively
used in studies into reciprocal cooperation and, to a lesser extent, kin
selection. This paper examines the suitability of the 2 x 2 games for modelling
the evolution of cooperation through reciprocation and kin selection. This
examination is not restricted to the Prisoner's Dilemma, but includes the other
non-trivial symmetric 2 x 2 games. We show that the popularity of the
Prisoner's Dilemma for modelling social and biotic interaction is justified by
its superiority according to these criteria. Indeed, the Prisoner's Dilemma is
unique in providing the simplest support for reciprocal cooperation, and
additive kin-selected altruism. However, care is still required in choosing the
particular Prisoner's Dilemma payoff matrix to use. This paper reviews the
impact of non-linear payoffs for the application of Hamilton's rule to typical
altruistic interactions, and derives new results for cases in which the roles
of potential altruist and beneficiary are separated. In doing so we find the
same equilibrium condition holds in continuous games between relatives, and in
discrete games with roles.

 <dc:description>  Grid computing is concerned with the sharing and coordinated use of diverse
resources in distributed &quot;virtual organizations.&quot; The dynamic and
multi-institutional nature of these environments introduces challenging
security issues that demand new technical approaches. In particular, one must
deal with diverse local mechanisms, support dynamic creation of services, and
enable dynamic creation of trust domains. We describe how these issues are
addressed in two generations of the Globus Toolkit. First, we review the Globus
Toolkit version 2 (GT2) approach; then, we describe new approaches developed to
support the Globus Toolkit version 3 (GT3) implementation of the Open Grid
Services Architecture, an initiative that is recasting Grid concepts within a
service oriented framework based on Web services. GT3's security implementation
uses Web services security mechanisms for credential exchange and other
purposes, and introduces a tight least-privilege model that avoids the need for
any privileged network service.

 <dc:description>  Fully-automatic general-purpose high-quality machine translation systems
(FGH-MT) are extremely difficult to build. In fact, there is no system in the
world for any pair of languages which qualifies to be called FGH-MT. The
reasons are not far to seek. Translation is a creative process which involves
interpretation of the given text by the translator. Translation would also vary
depending on the audience and the purpose for which it is meant. This would
explain the difficulty of building a machine translation system. Since, the
machine is not capable of interpreting a general text with sufficient accuracy
automatically at present - let alone re-expressing it for a given audience, it
fails to perform as FGH-MT. FOOTNOTE{The major difficulty that the machine
faces in interpreting a given text is the lack of general world knowledge or
common sense knowledge.}

 <dc:description>  The even cycle problem for both undirected and directed graphs has been the
topic of intense research in the last decade. In this paper, we study the
computational complexity of \emph{cycle length modularity problems}. Roughly
speaking, in a cycle length modularity problem, given an input (undirected or
directed) graph, one has to determine whether the graph has a cycle $C$ of a
specific length (or one of several different lengths), modulo a fixed integer.
We denote the two families (one for undirected graphs and one for directed
graphs) of problems by $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ and $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$,
where $m \in \mathcal{N}$ and $S \subseteq \{0,1, ..., m-1\}$.
$(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ (respectively, $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$) is defined as
follows: Given an undirected (respectively, directed) graph $G$, is there a
cycle in $G$ whose length, modulo $m$, is a member of $S$? In this paper, we
fully classify (i.e., as either polynomial-time solvable or as ${\rm
NP}$-complete) each problem $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ such that $0 \in S$ and
each problem $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm DC}$ such that $0 \notin S$. We also give a
sufficient condition on $S$ and $m$ for the following problem to be
polynomial-time computable: $(S,m)\hbox{-}{\rm UC}$ such that $0 \notin S$.

 <dc:description>  Grappa is a Grid portal effort designed to provide physicists convenient
access to Grid tools and services. The ATLAS analysis and control framework,
Athena, was used as the target application. Grappa provides basic Grid
functionality such as resource configuration, credential testing, job
submission, job monitoring, results monitoring, and preliminary integration
with the ATLAS replica catalog system, MAGDA. Grappa uses Jython to combine the
ease of scripting with the power of java-based toolkits. This provides a
powerful framework for accessing diverse Grid resources with uniform
interfaces. The initial prototype system was based on the XCAT Science Portal
developed at the Indiana University Extreme Computing Lab and was demonstrated
by running Monte Carlo production on the U.S. ATLAS test-bed. The portal also
communicated with a European resource broker on WorldGrid as part of the joint
iVDGL-DataTAG interoperability project for the IST2002 and SC2002
demonstrations. The current prototype replaces the XCAT Science Portal with an
xbooks jetspeed portlet for managing user scripts.

 <dc:description>  In 1978, Schaefer proved his famous dichotomy theorem for generalized
satisfiability problems. He defined an infinite number of propositional
satisfiability problems (nowadays usually called Boolean constraint
satisfaction problems) and showed that all these satisfiability problems are
either in P or NP-complete. In recent years, similar results have been obtained
for quite a few other problems for Boolean constraints.Almost all of these
problems are variations of the satisfiability problem.
  In this paper, we address a problem that is not a variation of
satisfiability, namely, the isomorphism problem for Boolean constraints.
Previous work by B\&quot;ohler et al. showed that the isomorphism problem is either
coNP-hard or reducible to the graph isomorphism problem (a problem that is in
NP, but not known to be NP-hard), thus distinguishing a hard case and an easier
case. However, they did not classify which cases are truly easy, i.e., in P.
This paper accomplishes exactly that. It shows that Boolean constraint
isomorphism is coNP-hard (and GI-hard), or equivalent to graph isomorphism, or
in P, and it gives simple criteria to determine which case holds.

 <dc:description>  Configuring consists in simulating the realization of a complex product from
a catalog of component parts, using known relations between types, and picking
values for object attributes. This highly combinatorial problem in the field of
constraint programming has been addressed with a variety of approaches since
the foundation system R1(McDermott82). An inherent difficulty in solving
configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among
interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the
detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the
problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic
subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which
canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper
we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can
be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator. The cost and
efficiency of this canonicity test are given.

 <dc:description>  This thesis presents a series of theoretical results and practical
realisations about the theory of computation in distributive categories.
Distributive categories have been proposed as a foundational tool for Computer
Science in the last years, starting from the papers of R.F.C. Walters. We shall
focus on two major topics: distributive computability, i.e., a generalized
theory of computability based on distributive categories, and the Imp(G)
language, which is a language based on the syntax of distributive categories.
The link between the former and the latter is that the functions computed by
Imp(G) programs are exactly the distributively computable functions.

 <dc:description>  The D0 experiment at Fermilab relies on a central Oracle database for storing
all detector calibration information. Access to this data is needed by hundreds
of physics applications distributed worldwide. In order to meet the demands of
these applications from scarce resources, we have created a distributed system
that isolates the user applications from the database facilities. This system,
known as the Database Application Network (DAN) operates as the middle tier in
a three tier architecture. A DAN server employs a hierarchical caching scheme
and database connection management facility that limits access to the database
resource. The modular design allows for caching strategies and database access
components to be determined by runtime configuration. To solve scalability
problems, a proxy database component allows for DAN servers to be arranged in a
hierarchy. Also included is an event based monitoring system that is currently
being used to collect statistics for performance analysis and problem
diagnosis. DAN servers are currently implemented as a Python multithreaded
program using CORBA for network communications and interface specification. The
requirement details, design, and implementation of DAN are discussed along with
operational experience and future plans.

 <dc:description>  A satisfactory multiagent learning algorithm should, {\em at a minimum},
learn to play optimally against stationary opponents and converge to a Nash
equilibrium in self-play. The algorithm that has come closest, WoLF-IGA, has
been proven to have these two properties in 2-player 2-action repeated
games--assuming that the opponent's (mixed) strategy is observable. In this
paper we present AWESOME, the first algorithm that is guaranteed to have these
two properties in {\em all} repeated (finite) games. It requires only that the
other players' actual actions (not their strategies) can be observed at each
step. It also learns to play optimally against opponents that {\em eventually
become} stationary. The basic idea behind AWESOME ({\em Adapt When Everybody is
Stationary, Otherwise Move to Equilibrium}) is to try to adapt to the others'
strategies when they appear stationary, but otherwise to retreat to a
precomputed equilibrium strategy. The techniques used to prove the properties
of AWESOME are fundamentally different from those used for previous algorithms,
and may help in analyzing other multiagent learning algorithms also.

 <dc:description>  In multiagent settings where the agents have different preferences,
preference aggregation is a central issue. Voting is a general method for
preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting
protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting
protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard computationally.
The complexity of manipulating realistic elections where the number of
candidates is a small constant was recently studied (Conitzer 2002), but the
emphasis was on the question of whether or not a protocol becomes hard to
manipulate for some constant number of candidates. That work, in many cases,
left open the question: How many candidates are needed to make elections hard
to manipulate? This is a crucial question when comparing the relative
manipulability of different voting protocols. In this paper we answer that
question for the voting protocols of the earlier study: plurality, Borda, STV,
Copeland, maximin, regular cup, and randomized cup. We also answer that
question for two voting protocols for which no results on the complexity of
manipulation have been derived before: veto and plurality with runoff. It turns
out that the voting protocols under study become hard to manipulate at 3
candidates, 4 candidates, 7 candidates, or never.

 <dc:description>  A metamorphic robotic system is an aggregate of homogeneous robot units which
can individually and selectively locomote in such a way as to change the global
shape of the system. We introduce a mathematical framework for defining and
analyzing general metamorphic robots. This formal structure, combined with
ideas from geometric group theory, leads to a natural extension of a
configuration space for metamorphic robots -- the state complex -- which is
especially adapted to parallelization. We present an algorithm for optimizing
reconfiguration sequences with respect to elapsed time. A universal geometric
property of state complexes -- non-positive curvature -- is the key to proving
convergence to the globally time-optimal solution.

 <dc:title>Optimal Adaptive Algorithms for Finding the Nearest and Farthest Point

 <dc:description>  We consider a general model for representing and manipulating parametric
curves, in which a curve is specified by a black box mapping a parameter value
between 0 and 1 to a point in Euclidean d-space. In this model, we consider the
nearest-point-on-curve and farthest-point-on-curve problems: given a curve C
and a point p, find a point on C nearest to p or farthest from p. In the
general black-box model, no algorithm can solve these problems. Assuming a
known bound on the speed of the curve (a Lipschitz condition), the answer can
be estimated up to an additive error of epsilon using O(1/epsilon) samples, and
this bound is tight in the worst case. However, many instances can be solved
with substantially fewer samples, and we give algorithms that adapt to the
inherent difficulty of the particular instance, up to a logarithmic factor.
More precisely, if OPT(C,p,epsilon) is the minimum number of samples of C that
every correct algorithm must perform to achieve tolerance epsilon, then our
algorithm performs O(OPT(C,p,epsilon) log (epsilon^(-1)/OPT(C,p,epsilon)))
samples. Furthermore, any algorithm requires Omega(k log (epsilon^(-1)/k))
samples for some instance C' with OPT(C',p,epsilon) = k; except that, for the
nearest-point-on-curve problem when the distance between C and p is less than
epsilon, OPT is 1 but the upper and lower bounds on the number of samples are
both Theta(1/epsilon). When bounds on relative error are desired, we give
algorithms that perform O(OPT log (2+(1+epsilon^(-1)) m^(-1)/OPT)) samples
(where m is the exact minimum or maximum distance from p to C) and prove that
Omega(OPT log (1/epsilon)) samples are necessary on some problem instances.

 <dc:subject>I.2.11</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present BL-WoLF, a framework for learnability in repeated zero-sum games
where the cost of learning is measured by the losses the learning agent accrues
(rather than the number of rounds). The game is adversarially chosen from some
family that the learner knows. The opponent knows the game and the learner's
learning strategy. The learner tries to either not accrue losses, or to quickly
learn about the game so as to avoid future losses (this is consistent with the
Win or Learn Fast (WoLF) principle; BL stands for ``bounded loss''). Our
framework allows for both probabilistic and approximate learning. The resultant
notion of {\em BL-WoLF}-learnability can be applied to any class of games, and
allows us to measure the inherent disadvantage to a player that does not know
which game in the class it is in. We present {\em guaranteed
BL-WoLF-learnability} results for families of games with deterministic payoffs
and families of games with stochastic payoffs. We demonstrate that these
families are {\em guaranteed approximately BL-WoLF-learnable} with lower cost.
We then demonstrate families of games (both stochastic and deterministic) that
are not guaranteed BL-WoLF-learnable. We show that those families,
nevertheless, are {\em BL-WoLF-learnable}. To prove these results, we use a key
lemma which we derive.

 <dc:description>  The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) was created as a practical way to promote
interoperability between eprint repositories. Although the scope of the OAI has
been broadened, eprint repositories still represent a significant fraction of
OAI data providers. In this article I present a brief survey of OAI eprint
repositories, and of services using metadata harvested from eprint repositories
using the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting (OAI-PMH). I then discuss
several situations where metadata harvesting may be used to further improve the
utility of eprint archives as a component of the scholarly communication
infrastructure.

 <dc:description>  When implementing regular enough functions (e.g., elementary or special
functions) on a computing system, we frequently use polynomial approximations.
In most cases, the polynomial that best approximates (for a given distance and
in a given interval) a function has coefficients that are not exactly
representable with a finite number of bits. And yet, the polynomial
approximations that are actually implemented do have coefficients that are
represented with a finite - and sometimes small - number of bits: this is due
to the finiteness of the floating-point representations (for software
implementations), and to the need to have small, hence fast and/or inexpensive,
multipliers (for hardware implementations). We then have to consider polynomial
approximations for which the degree-$i$ coefficient has at most $m_i$
fractional bits (in other words, it is a rational number with denominator
$2^{m_i}$). We provide a general method for finding the best polynomial
approximation under this constraint. Then, we suggest refinements than can be
used to accelerate our method.

 <dc:title>Probabilistic Reasoning as Information Compression by Multiple
  Alignment, Unification and Search: An Introduction and Overview</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wolff, J Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article introduces the idea that probabilistic reasoning (PR) may be
understood as &quot;information compression by multiple alignment, unification and
search&quot; (ICMAUS). In this context, multiple alignment has a meaning which is
similar to but distinct from its meaning in bio-informatics, while unification
means a simple merging of matching patterns, a meaning which is related to but
simpler than the meaning of that term in logic.
  A software model, SP61, has been developed for the discovery and formation of
'good' multiple alignments, evaluated in terms of information compression. The
model is described in outline.
  Using examples from the SP61 model, this article describes in outline how the
ICMAUS framework can model various kinds of PR including: PR in best-match
pattern recognition and information retrieval; one-step 'deductive' and
'abductive' PR; inheritance of attributes in a class hierarchy; chains of
reasoning (probabilistic decision networks and decision trees, and PR with
'rules'); geometric analogy problems; nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with
default values; modelling the function of a Bayesian network.

mobile devices, accessibility considerations, and novel software technologies
that combine diverse interaction media. This article investigates systems
support for web browsing in a multimodal interface. Specifically, we outline
the design and implementation of a software framework that integrates hyperlink
and speech modes of interaction. Instead of viewing speech as merely an
alternative interaction medium, the framework uses it to support out-of-turn
interaction, providing a flexibility of information access not possible with
hyperlinks alone. This approach enables the creation of websites that adapt to
the needs of users, yet permits the designer fine-grained control over what
interactions to support. Design methodology, implementation details, and two
case studies are presented.

 <dc:description>  Ad hoc networks rely on the cooperation of the nodes participating in the
network to forward packets for each other. A node may decide not to cooperate
to save its resources while still using the network to relay its traffic. If
too many nodes exhibit this behavior, network performance degrades and
cooperating nodes may find themselves unfairly loaded. Most previous efforts to
counter this behavior have relied on further cooperation between nodes to
exchange reputation information about other nodes. If a node observes another
node not participating correctly, it reports this observation to other nodes
who then take action to avoid being affected and potentially punish the bad
node by refusing to forward its traffic. Unfortunately, such second-hand
reputation information is subject to false accusations and requires maintaining
trust relationships with other nodes. The objective of OCEAN is to avoid this
trust-management machinery and see how far we can get simply by using direct
first-hand observations of other nodes' behavior. We find that, in many
scenarios, OCEAN can do as well as, or even better than, schemes requiring
second-hand reputation exchanges. This encouraging result could possibly help
obviate solutions requiring trust-management for some contexts.

 <dc:title>'Computing' as Information Compression by Multiple Alignment,

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper argues that the operations of a 'Universal Turing Machine' (UTM)
and equivalent mechanisms such as the 'Post Canonical System' (PCS) - which are
widely accepted as definitions of the concept of `computing' - may be
interpreted as *information compression by multiple alignment, unification and
search* (ICMAUS).
  The motivation for this interpretation is that it suggests ways in which the
UTM/PCS model may be augmented in a proposed new computing system designed to
exploit the ICMAUS principles as fully as possible. The provision of a
relatively sophisticated search mechanism in the proposed 'SP' system appears
to open the door to the integration and simplification of a range of functions
including unsupervised inductive learning, best-match pattern recognition and
information retrieval, probabilistic reasoning, planning and problem solving,
and others. Detailed consideration of how the ICMAUS principles may be applied
to these functions is outside the scope of this article but relevant sources
are cited in this article.

 <dc:title>Syntax, Parsing and Production of Natural Language in a Framework of

 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article introduces the idea that &quot;information compression by multiple
alignment, unification and search&quot; (ICMAUS) provides a framework within which
natural language syntax may be represented in a simple format and the parsing
and production of natural language may be performed in a transparent manner.
  The ICMAUS concepts are embodied in a software model, SP61. The organisation
and operation of the model are described and a simple example is presented
showing how the model can achieve parsing of natural language.
  Notwithstanding the apparent paradox of 'decompression by compression', the
ICMAUS framework, without any modification, can produce a sentence by decoding
a compressed code for the sentence. This is illustrated with output from the
SP61 model.
  The article includes four other examples - one of the parsing of a sentence
in French and three from the domain of English auxiliary verbs. These examples
show how the ICMAUS framework and the SP61 model can accommodate 'context
sensitive' features of syntax in a relatively simple and direct manner.

 <dc:description>  We report the development of an open-sourced data warehouse builder,
InterBase Data Warehouse Builder (IB-DWB), based on Borland InterBase 6 Open
Edition Database Server. InterBase 6 is used for its low maintenance and small
footprint. IB-DWB is designed modularly and consists of 5 main components, Data
Plug Platform, Discoverer Platform, Multi-Dimensional Cube Builder, and Query
Supporter, bounded together by a Kernel. It is also an extensible system, made
possible by the Data Plug Platform and the Discoverer Platform. Currently,
extensions are only possible via dynamic linked-libraries (DLLs).
Multi-Dimensional Cube Builder represents a basal mean of data aggregation. The
architectural philosophy of IB-DWB centers around providing a base platform
that is extensible, which is functionally supported by expansion modules.
IB-DWB is currently being hosted by sourceforge.net (Project Unix Name:
ib-dwb), licensed under GNU General Public License, Version 2.

 <dc:description>  Coalition formation is a key problem in automated negotiation among
self-interested agents, and other multiagent applications. A coalition of
agents can sometimes accomplish things that the individual agents cannot, or
can do things more efficiently. However, motivating the agents to abide to a
solution requires careful analysis: only some of the solutions are stable in
the sense that no group of agents is motivated to break off and form a new
coalition. This constraint has been studied extensively in cooperative game
theory. However, the computational questions around this constraint have
received less attention. When it comes to coalition formation among software
agents (that represent real-world parties), these questions become increasingly
explicit.
  In this paper we define a concise general representation for games in
characteristic form that relies on superadditivity, and show that it allows for
efficient checking of whether a given outcome is in the core. We then show that
determining whether the core is nonempty is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete both with
and without transferable utility. We demonstrate that what makes the problem
hard in both cases is determining the collaborative possibilities (the set of
outcomes possible for the grand coalition), by showing that if these are given,
the problem becomes tractable in both cases. However, we then demonstrate that
for a hybrid version of the problem, where utility transfer is possible only
within the grand coalition, the problem remains $\mathcal{NP}$-complete even
when the collaborative possibilities are given.

 <dc:description>  In most real-world settings, due to limited time or other resources, an agent
cannot perform all potentially useful deliberation and information gathering
actions. This leads to the metareasoning problem of selecting such actions.
Decision-theoretic methods for metareasoning have been studied in AI, but there
are few theoretical results on the complexity of metareasoning.
  We derive hardness results for three settings which most real metareasoning
systems would have to encompass as special cases. In the first, the agent has
to decide how to allocate its deliberation time across anytime algorithms
running on different problem instances. We show this to be
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete. In the second, the agent has to (dynamically) allocate
its deliberation or information gathering resources across multiple actions
that it has to choose among. We show this to be $\mathcal{NP}$-hard even when
evaluating each individual action is extremely simple. In the third, the agent
has to (dynamically) choose a limited number of deliberation or information
gathering actions to disambiguate the state of the world. We show that this is
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard under a natural restriction, and $\mathcal{PSPACE}$-hard in
general.

 <dc:title>Universal Voting Protocol Tweaks to Make Manipulation Hard</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Voting is a general method for preference aggregation in multiagent settings,
but seminal results have shown that all (nondictatorial) voting protocols are
manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting protocols
where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard computationally. A number
of recent papers study the complexity of manipulating existing protocols. This
paper is the first work to take the next step of designing new protocols that
are especially hard to manipulate. Rather than designing these new protocols
from scratch, we instead show how to tweak existing protocols to make
manipulation hard, while leaving much of the original nature of the protocol
intact. The tweak studied consists of adding one elimination preround to the
election. Surprisingly, this extremely simple and universal tweak makes typical
protocols hard to manipulate! The protocols become NP-hard, #P-hard, or
PSPACE-hard to manipulate, depending on whether the schedule of the preround is
determined before the votes are collected, after the votes are collected, or
the scheduling and the vote collecting are interleaved, respectively. We prove
general sufficient conditions on the protocols for this tweak to introduce the
hardness, and show that the most common voting protocols satisfy those
conditions. These are the first results in voting settings where manipulation
is in a higher complexity class than NP (presuming PSPACE $\neq$ NP).

 <dc:description>  Fermilab operates several clusters for lattice gauge computing. Minimal
manpower is available to manage these clusters. We have written a number of
tools and developed techniques to cope with this task. We describe our tools
which use the IPMI facilities of our systems for hardware management tasks such
as remote power control, remote system resets, and health monitoring. We
discuss our techniques involving network booting for installation and upgrades
of the operating system on these computers, and for reloading BIOS and other
firmware. Finally, we discuss our tools for parallel command processing and
their use in monitoring and administrating the PBS batch queue system used on
our clusters.

 <dc:description>  We consider a simple extension of logic programming where variables may range
over goals and goals may be arguments of predicates. In this language we can
write logic programs which use goals as data. We give practical evidence that,
by exploiting this capability when transforming programs, we can improve
program efficiency.
  We propose a set of program transformation rules which extend the familiar
unfolding and folding rules and allow us to manipulate clauses with goals which
occur as arguments of predicates. In order to prove the correctness of these
transformation rules, we formally define the operational semantics of our
extended logic programming language. This semantics is a simple variant of
LD-resolution. When suitable conditions are satisfied this semantics agrees
with LD-resolution and, thus, the programs written in our extended language can
be run by ordinary Prolog systems.
  Our transformation rules are shown to preserve the operational semantics and
termination.

 <dc:title>Testing Bipartiteness of Geometric Intersection Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We show how to test the bipartiteness of an intersection graph of n line
segments or simple polygons in the plane, or of balls in R^d, in time O(n log
n). More generally we find subquadratic algorithms for connectivity and
bipartiteness testing of intersection graphs of a broad class of geometric
objects. For unit balls in R^d, connectivity testing has equivalent randomized
complexity to construction of Euclidean minimum spanning trees, and hence is
unlikely to be solved as efficiently as bipartiteness testing. For line
segments or planar disks, testing k-colorability of intersection graphs for k&gt;2
is NP-complete.

 <dc:description>  Several tools exist that collect host-to-host connectivity measurements. To
improve the usability of such measurements, they should be mapped into a
framework consisting of complex subsystems, and the infrastructure that
connects them. We introduce one such framework, and analyze the architectural
implications on the network structure. In our framework, a complex subsystem
consists of several computing facilities and the infrastructure that connects
them: we call it a -monitoring domain-. The task of measuring the connectivity
between -monitoring domains- is considered distinct from the activity of
-storage- and -computing- elements. Therefore we introduce a new element in our
topology: we call it -theodolite- element, since its function is similar to
that of a transponder. Using these basic concepts, we analyze the architectural
implications on the network structure: in a nutshell, if we want that
-theodolites- serve as a reference, than the contribution to the relevant
network metrics due to the -monitoring domain- infrastructure must be
negligible with respect to contributions of the inter-domain infrastructure. In
addition all -theodolites- of a -monitoring domain- must give an image of the
inter-domain infrastructure that is consistent with that experienced by network
applications. We conclude giving a running SQL example of how information about
-monitoring domains- and -theodolites- could be organized, and we outline the
application of such framework in the GLUE schema activity for the network
element

 <dc:description>  This article presents an overview of the idea that &quot;information compression
by multiple alignment, unification and search&quot; (ICMAUS) may serve as a unifying
principle in computing (including mathematics and logic) and in such aspects of
human cognition as the analysis and production of natural language, fuzzy
pattern recognition and best-match information retrieval, concept hierarchies
with inheritance of attributes, probabilistic reasoning, and unsupervised
inductive learning. The ICMAUS concepts are described together with an outline
of the SP61 software model in which the ICMAUS concepts are currently realised.
A range of examples is presented, illustrated with output from the SP61 model.

 <dc:title>Improving the Security and Performance of the BaBar Detector Controls
  System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kotturi, Karen D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It starts out innocently enough - users want to monitor Online data and so
run their own copies of the detector control GUIs in their offices and at home.
But over time, the number of processes making requests for values to display on
GUIs, webpages and stripcharts can grow, and affect the performance of an
Input/Output Controller (IOC) such that it is unable to respond to requests
from requests critical to data-taking. At worst, an IOC can hang, its CPU
having been allocated 100% to responding to network requests.
  For the BaBar Online Detector Control System, we were able to eliminate this
problem and make great gains in security by moving all of the IOCs to a
non-routed, virtual LAN and by enlisting a workstation with two network
interface cards to act as the interface between the virtual LAN and the public
BaBar network. On the interface machine, we run the Experimental Physics
Industrial Control System (EPICS) Channel Access (CA) gateway software
(originating from Advanced Photon Source). This software accepts as inputs, all
the channels which are loaded into the EPICS databases on all the IOCs. It
polls them to update its copy of the values. It answers requests from
applications by sending them the currently cached value.
  We adopted the requirement that data-taking would be independent of the
gateway, so that, in the event of a gateway failure, data-taking would be
uninterrupted. In this way, we avoided introducing any new risk elements to
data-taking. Security rules already in use by the IOC were propagated to the
gateway's own security rules and the security of the IOCs themselves was
improved by removing them from the public BaBar network.

 <dc:description>  We present memory-efficient deterministic algorithms for constructing
epsilon-nets and epsilon-approximations of streams of geometric data. Unlike
probabilistic approaches, these deterministic samples provide guaranteed bounds
on their approximation factors. We show how our deterministic samples can be
used to answer approximate online iceberg geometric queries on data streams. We
use these techniques to approximate several robust statistics of geometric data
streams, including Tukey depth, simplicial depth, regression depth, the
Thiel-Sen estimator, and the least median of squares. Our algorithms use only a
polylogarithmic amount of memory, provided the desired approximation factors
are inverse-polylogarithmic. We also include a lower bound for non-iceberg
geometric queries.

 <dc:description>  As interaction between autonomous agents, communication can be analyzed in
game-theoretic terms. Meaning game is proposed to formalize the core of
intended communication in which the sender sends a message and the receiver
attempts to infer its meaning intended by the sender. Basic issues involved in
the game of natural language communication are discussed, such as salience,
grammaticality, common sense, and common belief, together with some
demonstration of the feasibility of game-theoretic account of language.

 <dc:description>  The basic properties of RSA cryptosystems and some classical attacks on them
are described. Derived from geometric properties of the Euler functions, the
Euler function rays, a new ansatz to attack RSA cryptosystems is presented. A
resulting, albeit inefficient, algorithm is given. It essentially consists of a
loop with starting value determined by the Euler function ray and with step
width given by a function $\omega_e(n)$ being a multiple of the order
$\mathrm{ord}_n(e)$, where $e$ denotes the public key exponent and $n$ the RSA
modulus. For $n=pq$ and an estimate $r&lt;\sqrt{pq}$ for the smaller prime factor
$p$, the running time is given by $T(e,n,r) = O((r-p)\ln e \ln n \ln r).$

 <dc:description>  The standard tabulation techniques for logic programming presuppose fixed
order of computation. Some data-driven control should be introduced in order to
deal with diverse contexts. The present paper describes a data-driven method of
constraint transformation with a sort of compilation which subsumes
accessibility check and last-call optimization, which characterize standard

 <dc:description>  Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) are effective tools in classification problems,
and in recent years the even more powerful Dynamic Growing Neural Networks, a
variant of SOMs, have been developed. Automatic Classification (also called
clustering) is an important and difficult problem in many Astrophysical
experiments, for instance, Gamma Ray Burst classification, or gamma-hadron
separation. After a brief introduction to classification problem, we discuss
Self-Organising Maps in section 2. Section 3 discusses with various models of
growing neural networks and finally in section 4 we discuss the research
perspectives in growing neural networks for efficient classification in
astrophysical problems.

 <dc:description>  We analyse the issues involved in the management and mining of astrophysical
data. The traditional approach to data management in the astrophysical field is
not able to keep up with the increasing size of the data gathered by modern
detectors. An essential role in the astrophysical research will be assumed by
automatic tools for information extraction from large datasets, i.e. data
mining techniques, such as clustering and classification algorithms. This asks
for an approach to data management based on data warehousing, emphasizing the
efficiency and simplicity of data access; efficiency is obtained using
multidimensional access methods and simplicity is achieved by properly handling
metadata. Clustering and classification techniques, on large datasets, pose
additional requirements: computational and memory scalability with respect to
the data size, interpretability and objectivity of clustering or classification
results. In this study we address some possible solutions.

 <dc:description>  Excellent computer simulations are done for a purpose. The most valid
purposes are to explore uncharted territory, to resolve a well-posed scientific
or technical question, or to make a design choice. Stand-alone modeling can
serve the first purpose. The other two goals need a full integration of the
modeling effort into a scientific or engineering program.
  Some excellent work, much of it related to the Department of Energy
Laboratories, is reviewed. Some less happy stories are recounted.
  In the past, some of the most impressive work has involved complexity and
chaos. Prediction in a complex world requires a first principles understanding
based upon the intersection of theory, experiment and simulation.

 <dc:description>  Self-managing software has emerged as modern systems have become more
complex. Some of the distributed object systems may contain thousands of
objects deployed on tens or even hundreds hosts. Development and support of
such systems often costs a lot. To solve this issue the systems, which are
capable supporting multiple self-managing attributes, should be created. In the
paper, the Adaptive domain concept is introduced as an extension to the basic
domain concept to support a generic adaptation environment for building
distributed object systems with multiple self-managing attributes.

 <dc:description>  Web caches, content distribution networks, peer-to-peer file sharing
networks, distributed file systems, and data grids all have in common that they
involve a community of users who generate requests for shared data. In each
case, overall system performance can be improved significantly if we can first
identify and then exploit interesting structure within a community's access
patterns. To this end, we propose a novel perspective on file sharing based on
the study of the relationships that form among users based on the files in
which they are interested.
  We propose a new structure that captures common user interests in data--the
data-sharing graph-- and justify its utility with studies on three
data-distribution systems: a high-energy physics collaboration, the Web, and
the Kazaa peer-to-peer network. We find small-world patterns in the
data-sharing graphs of all three communities. We analyze these graphs and
propose some probable causes for these emergent small-world patterns. The
significance of small-world patterns is twofold: it provides a rigorous support
to intuition and, perhaps most importantly, it suggests ways to design
mechanisms that exploit these naturally emerging patterns.

 <dc:description>  Modern HENP experiments such as CMS and Atlas involve as many as 2000
collaborators around the world. Collaborations this large will be unable to
meet often enough to support working closely together. Many of the tools
currently available for collaboration focus on heavy-weight applications such
as videoconferencing tools. While these are important, there is a more basic
need for tools that support connecting physicists to work together on an ad hoc
or continuous basis. Tools that support the day-to-day connectivity and
underlying needs of a group of collaborators are important for providing
light-weight, non-intrusive, and flexible ways to work collaboratively. Some
example tools include messaging, file-sharing, and shared plot viewers. An
important component of the environment is a scalable underlying communication
framework. In this paper we will describe our current progress on building a
dynamic and ad hoc collaboration environment and our vision for its evolution
into a HENP collaboration environment.

 <dc:description>  In the manifold learning problem one seeks to discover a smooth low
dimensional surface, i.e., a manifold embedded in a higher dimensional linear
vector space, based on a set of measured sample points on the surface. In this
paper we consider the closely related problem of estimating the manifold's
intrinsic dimension and the intrinsic entropy of the sample points.
Specifically, we view the sample points as realizations of an unknown
multivariate density supported on an unknown smooth manifold. We present a
novel geometrical probability approach, called the
geodesic-minimal-spanning-tree (GMST), to obtaining asymptotically consistent
estimates of the manifold dimension and the R\'{e}nyi $\alpha$-entropy of the
sample density on the manifold. The GMST approach is striking in its simplicity
and does not require reconstructing the manifold or estimating the multivariate
density of the samples. The GMST method simply constructs a minimal spanning
tree (MST) sequence using a geodesic edge matrix and uses the overall lengths
of the MSTs to simultaneously estimate manifold dimension and entropy. We
illustrate the GMST approach for dimension and entropy estimation of a human
face dataset.

 <dc:title>Bridging the gap between modal temporal logics and constraint-based QSR

 <dc:description>  The aim of this work is to provide a family of qualitative theories for
spatial change in general, and for motion of spatial scenes in particular. To
achieve this, we consider a spatio-temporalisation MTALC(D_x), of the
well-known ALC(D) family of Description Logics (DLs) with a concrete domainan.
In particular, the concrete domain D_x is generated by a qualitative spatial
Relation Algebra (RA) x. We show the important result that satisfiability of an
MTALC(D_x) concept with respect to a weakly cyclic TBox is decidable in
nondeterministic exponential time, by reducing it to the emptiness problem of a
weak alternating automaton augmented with spatial constraints, which we show to
remain decidable, although the accepting condition of a run involves,
additionally to the standard case, consistency of a CSP (Constraint
Satisfaction Problem) potentially infinite. The result provides an effective
tableaux-like satisfiability procedure which is discussed.

 <dc:description>  Suppose that there are $n$ Senders and $n$ Receivers. Our goal is to send
long messages from Sender $i$ to Receiver $i$ such that no other receiver can
retrieve the message intended for Receiver $i$. The task can easily be
completed using $n$ private channels between the pairs. Solutions, using one
channel needs either encryption or switching elements for routing the messages
to their addressee.
  The main result of the present work is a description of a network in which
The Senders and the Receivers are connected with only $n^{o(1)}$ channels; the
encoding and de-coding is nothing else just very fast linear combinations of
the message-bits; and there are no switching or routing-elements in the
network, just linear combinations are computed, with fixed connections
(channels or wires).
  In the proofs we do not use {\em any} unproven cryptographical or complexity
theoretical assumptions.

 <dc:description>  We report a small advance on a question raised by Robertson, Schweitzer, and
Wagon in [RSW02]. They constructed a genus-13 polyhedron built from bricks
without corners, and asked whether every genus-0 such polyhedron must have a
corner. A brick is a parallelopiped, and a corner is a brick of degree three or
less in the brick graph. We describe a genus-3 polyhedron built from bricks
with no corner, narrowing the genus gap.

 <dc:description>  The Lovasz Local Lemma due to Erdos and Lovasz is a powerful tool in proving
the existence of rare events. We present an extension of this lemma, which
works well when the event to be shown to exist is a conjunction of individual
events, each of which asserts that a random variable does not deviate much from
its mean. As applications, we consider two classes of NP-hard integer programs:
minimax and covering integer programs. A key technique, randomized rounding of
linear relaxations, was developed by Raghavan and Thompson to derive good
approximation algorithms for such problems. We use our extension of the Local
Lemma to prove that randomized rounding produces, with non-zero probability,
much better feasible solutions than known before, if the constraint matrices of
these integer programs are column-sparse (e.g., routing using short paths,
problems on hypergraphs with small dimension/degree). This complements certain
well-known results from discrepancy theory. We also generalize the method of
pessimistic estimators due to Raghavan, to obtain constructive (algorithmic)
versions of our results for covering integer programs.

 <dc:description>  MPEG-7 (Moving Picture Experts Group Phase 7) is an XML-based international
standard on semantic description of multimedia content. This document discusses
the Linguistic DS and related tools. The linguistic DS is a tool, based on the
GDA tag set (http://i-content.org/GDA/tagset.html), for semantic annotation of
linguistic data in or associated with multimedia content. The current document
text reflects `Study of FPDAM - MPEG-7 MDS Extensions' issued in March 2003,
and not most part of MPEG-7 MDS, for which the readers are referred to the
first version of MPEG-7 MDS document available from ISO (http://www.iso.org).
Without that reference, however, this document should be mostly intelligible to
those who are familiar with XML and linguistic theories. Comments are welcome
and will be considered in the standardization process.

 <dc:description>  Most algorithms in 3D computer vision rely on the pinhole camera model
because of its simplicity, whereas virtually all imaging devices introduce
certain amount of nonlinear distortion, where the radial distortion is the most
severe part. Common approach to radial distortion is by the means of polynomial
approximation, which introduces distortion-specific parameters into the camera
model and requires estimation of these distortion parameters. The task of
estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows
easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new
radial distortion model with an easy analytical undistortion formula, which
also belongs to the polynomial approximation category. Experimental results are
presented to show that with this radial distortion model, satisfactory accuracy
is achieved. An application of the new radial distortion model is non-iterative
yellow line alignment with a calibrated camera on ODIS, a robot built in our
CSOIS.

 <dc:description>  We propose a calculus integrating two calculi well-known in Qualitative
Spatial Reasoning (QSR): Frank's projection-based cardinal direction calculus,
and a coarser version of Freksa's relative orientation calculus. An original
constraint propagation procedure is presented, which implements the interaction
between the two integrated calculi. The importance of taking into account the
interaction is shown with a real example providing an inconsistent knowledge
base, whose inconsistency (a) cannot be detected by reasoning separately about
each of the two components of the knowledge, just because, taken separately,
each is consistent, but (b) is detected by the proposed algorithm, thanks to
the interaction knowledge propagated from each of the two compnents to the
other.

do have a free action on an $\bbR^n$-tree. We then prove that a finitely

free abelian groups and surface groups by a finite sequence of free products
and amalgamations over cyclic groups. As a corollary, such a group is finitely
presented, has a finite classifying space, its abelian subgroups are finitely
generated and contains only finitely many conjugacy classes of non-cyclic

 <dc:title>A ternary Relation Algebra of directed lines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Isli, Amar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2 (I.2.4)</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We define a ternary Relation Algebra (RA) of relative position relations on
two-dimensional directed lines (d-lines for short). A d-line has two degrees of
freedom (DFs): a rotational DF (RDF), and a translational DF (TDF). The
representation of the RDF of a d-line will be handled by an RA of 2D
orientations, CYC_t, known in the literature. A second algebra, TA_t, which
will handle the TDF of a d-line, will be defined. The two algebras, CYC_t and
TA_t, will constitute, respectively, the translational and the rotational
components of the RA, PA_t, of relative position relations on d-lines: the PA_t
atoms will consist of those pairs &lt;t,r&gt; of a TA_t atom and a CYC_t atom that
are compatible. We present in detail the RA PA_t, with its converse table, its
rotation table and its composition tables. We show that a (polynomial)
constraint propagation algorithm, known in the literature, is complete for a
subset of PA_t relations including almost all of the atomic relations. We will
discuss the application scope of the RA, which includes incidence geometry, GIS
(Geographic Information Systems), shape representation, localisation in
(multi-)robot navigation, and the representation of motion prepositions in NLP
(Natural Language Processing). We then compare the RA to existing ones, such as
an algebra for reasoning about rectangles parallel to the axes of an
(orthogonal) coordinate system, a ``spatial Odyssey'' of Allen's interval
algebra, and an algebra for reasoning about 2D segments.

 <dc:title>An Analytical Piecewise Radial Distortion Model for Precision Camera

 <dc:description>  The common approach to radial distortion is by the means of polynomial
approximation, which introduces distortion-specific parameters into the camera
model and requires estimation of these distortion parameters. The task of
estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows
easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new
piecewise radial distortion model with easy analytical undistortion formula.
The motivation for seeking a piecewise radial distortion model is that, when a
camera is resulted in a low quality during manufacturing, the nonlinear radial
distortion can be complex. Using low order polynomials to approximate the
radial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order
polynomials suffer from the inverse problem. With the new piecewise radial
distortion function, more flexibility is obtained and the radial undistortion
can be performed analytically. Experimental results are presented to show that
with this new piecewise radial distortion model, better performance is achieved
than that using the single function. Furthermore, a comparable performance with
the conventional polynomial model using 2 coefficients can also be
accomplished.

 <dc:description>  The notion of grid computing has gained an increasing popularity recently as
a realistic solution to many of our large-scale data storage and processing
needs. It enables the sharing, selection and aggregation of resources
geographically distributed across collaborative organisations. Now more and
more people are beginning to embrace grid computing and thus are seeing the
need to set up their own grids and grid testbeds. With this comes the need to
have some means to enable them to view and monitor the status of the resources
in these testbeds (eg. Web based Grid portal). Generally developers invest a
substantial amount of time and effort developing custom monitoring software. To
overcome this limitation, this paper proposes Gridscape ? a tool that enables
the rapid creation of interactive and dynamic testbed portals (without any
programming effort). Gridscape primarily aims to provide a solution for those
users who need to be able to create a grid testbed portal but don?t necessarily
have the time or resources to build a system of their own from scratch.

 <dc:description>  We present a C++ implementation of a fifth order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta
algorithm for solving Ordinary Differential Equations. This algorithm can be
used for studying many different problems and in particular it can be applied
for computing the evolution of any system whose Hamiltonian is known. We
consider in particular the problem of calculating the neutrino oscillation
probabilities in presence of matter interactions. The time performance and the
accuracy of this implementation is competitive with respect to the other
analytical and numerical techniques used in literature. The algorithm design
and the salient features of the code are presented and discussed and some
explicit examples of code application are given.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm for learning from unlabeled text, based on the Vector
Space Model (VSM) of information retrieval, that can solve verbal analogy
questions of the kind found in the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). A verbal
analogy has the form A:B::C:D, meaning &quot;A is to B as C is to D&quot;; for example,
mason:stone::carpenter:wood. SAT analogy questions provide a word pair, A:B,
and the problem is to select the most analogous word pair, C:D, from a set of
five choices. The VSM algorithm correctly answers 47% of a collection of 374
college-level analogy questions (random guessing would yield 20% correct). We
motivate this research by relating it to work in cognitive science and
linguistics, and by applying it to a difficult problem in natural language
processing, determining semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs. The problem
is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such as &quot;laser printer&quot;, according to the
semantic relation between the noun (printer) and the modifier (laser). We use a
supervised nearest-neighbour algorithm that assigns a class to a given
noun-modifier pair by finding the most analogous noun-modifier pair in the
training data. With 30 classes of semantic relations, on a collection of 600
labeled noun-modifier pairs, the learning algorithm attains an F value of 26.5%
(random guessing: 3.3%). With 5 classes of semantic relations, the F value is
43.2% (random: 20%). The performance is state-of-the-art for these challenging
problems.

 <dc:title>From Statistical Knowledge Bases to Degrees of Belief</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its
environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to
quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the
expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need
to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions.
Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should
be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one
approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that
can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations,
physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds
method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of
the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to
integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic
reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be
easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in
direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about
individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of
random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of
reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant
information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the
expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random
worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many
other non-deductive reasoning systems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a general framework for reasoning about secrecy and privacy
requirements in multiagent systems. Our definitions extend earlier definitions
of secrecy and nondeducibility given by Shannon and Sutherland. Roughly
speaking, one agent maintains secrecy with respect to another if the second
agent cannot rule out any possibilities for the behavior or state of the first
agent. We show that the framework can handle probability and nondeterminism in
a clean way, is useful for reasoning about asynchronous systems as well as
synchronous systems, and suggests generalizations of secrecy that may be useful
for dealing with issues such as resource-bounded reasoning. We also show that a
number of well-known attempts to characterize the absence of information flow
are special cases of our definitions of secrecy.

 <dc:description>  Performance profiling consists of tracing a software system during execution
and then analyzing the obtained traces. However, traces themselves affect the
performance of the system distorting its execution. Therefore, there is a need
to minimize the effect of the tracing on the underlying system's performance.
To achieve this, the trace set needs to be optimized according to the
performance profiling problem being solved. Our position is that such
minimization can be achieved only by adding the software trace design and
implementation to the overall software development process. In such a process,
the performance analyst supplies the knowledge of performance measurement
requirements, while the software developer supplies the knowledge of the
software. Both of these are needed for an optimal trace placement.

 <dc:description>  A group authentication protocol authenticates pre-defined groups of
individuals such that:
  - No individual is identified
  - No knowledge of which groups can be successfully authenticated is known to
the verifier
  - No sensitive data is exposed
  The paper presents a group authentication protocol based on splitting the
private keys of the Naccache-Stern public-key cryptosystem in such a way that
the Boolean expression defining the authenticable groups is implicit in the
split.

 <dc:title>Neural realisation of the SP theory: cell assemblies revisited</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wolff, J. Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes how the elements of the SP theory (Wolff, 2003a) may be
realised with neural structures and processes. To the extent that this is
successful, the insights that have been achieved in the SP theory - the
integration and simplification of a range of phenomena in perception and
cognition - may be incorporated in a neural view of brain function.
  These proposals may be seen as a development of Hebb's (1949) concept of a
'cell assembly'. By contrast with that concept and variants of it, the version
described in this paper proposes that any one neuron can belong in one assembly
and only one assembly. A distinctive feature of the present proposals is that
any neuron or cluster of neurons within a cell assembly may serve as a proxy or
reference for another cell assembly or class of cell assemblies. This device
provides solutions to many of the problems associated with cell assemblies, it
allows information to be stored in a compressed form, and it provides a robust
mechanism by which assemblies may be connected to form hierarchies, grammars
and other kinds of knowledge structure.
  Drawing on insights derived from the SP theory, the paper also describes how
unsupervised learning may be achieved with neural structures and processes.
This theory of learning overcomes weaknesses in the Hebbian concept of learning
and it is, at the same time, compatible with the observations that Hebb's
theory was designed to explain.

 <dc:description>  The boundary knot method (BKM) [1] is a meshless boundary-type radial basis
function (RBF) collocation scheme, where the nonsingular general solution is
used instead of fundamental solution to evaluate the homogeneous solution,
while the dual reciprocity method (DRM) is employed to approximation of
particular solution. Despite the fact that there are not nonsingular RBF
general solutions available for Laplace and biharmonic problems, this study
shows that the method can be successfully applied to these problems. The
high-order general and fundamental solutions of Burger and Winkler equations
are also first presented here.

corresponding to the number of steps Hensley already has proved a Local Limit

 <dc:description>  This paper describes an approach to the representation and processing of
ontologies in the Semantic Web, based on the ICMAUS theory of computation and
AI. This approach has strengths that complement those of languages based on the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) such as RDF Schema and DAML+OIL. The main
benefits of the ICMAUS approach are simplicity and comprehensibility in the
representation of ontologies, an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties
in knowledge, and a versatile reasoning system with capabilities in the kinds
of probabilistic reasoning that seem to be required in the Semantic Web.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient and inexpensive to develop application for
interactive high-performance parallel visualization. We extend popular APIs
such as Open Inventor and VTK to support commodity-based cluster visualization.
Our implementation follows a standard master/slave concept: the general idea is
to have a ``Master'' node, which will intercept a sequential graphical user
interface (GUI) and broadcast it to the ``Slave'' nodes. The interactions
between the nodes are implemented using MPI. The parallel remote rendering uses
Chromium. This paper is mainly the report of our implementation experiences. We
present in detail the proposed model and key aspects of its implementation.
Also, we present performance measurements, we benchmark and quantitatively
demonstrate the dependence of the visualization speed on the data size and the
network bandwidth, and we identify the singularities and draw conclusions on
Chromium's sort-first rendering architecture. The most original part of this
work is the combined use of Open Inventor and Chromium.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present XtremWeb, a Global Computing platform used to
generate monte carlos showers in Auger, an HEP experiment to study the highest
energy cosmic rays at Mallargue-Mendoza, Argentina.
  XtremWeb main goal, as a Global Computing platform, is to compute distributed
applications using idle time of widely interconnected machines. It is
especially dedicated to -but not limited to- multi-parameters applications such
as monte carlos computations; its security mechanisms ensuring not only hosts
integrity but also results certification and its fault tolerant features,
encouraged us to test it and, finally, to deploy it as to support our CPU needs
to simulate showers.
  We first introduce Auger computing needs and how Global Computing could help.
We then detail XtremWeb architecture and goals. The fourth and last part
presents the profits we have gained to choose this platform. We conclude on
what could be done next.

 <dc:title>Sound search in a denotational semantics for first order logic</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we adapt the definitions and results from Apt and Vermeulen on
`First order logic as a constraint programming language' (in: Proceedings of
LPAR2001, Baaz and Voronkov (eds.), Springer LNAI 2514) to include important
ideas about search and choice into the system. We give motivating examples.
Then we set up denotational semantics for first order logic as follows: the
semantic universe includes states that consist of two components: a
substitution, which can be seen as the computed answer; and a constraint
satisfaction problem, which can be seen as the residue of the original problem,
yet to be handled by constraint programming. The interaction between these
components is regulated by an operator called: infer. In this paper we regard
infer as an operator on sets of states to enable us to analyze ideas about
search among states and choice between states.
  The precise adaptations of definitions and results are able to deal with the
examples and we show that, given several reasonable conditions, the new
definitions ensure soundness of the system with respect to the standard
interpretation of first order logic. In this way the `reasonable conditions'
can be read as conditions for sound search.
  We indicate briefly how to investigate efficiency of search in future
research.

 <dc:description>  Physical disabled access is something that most cultural institutions such as
museums consider very seriously. Indeed, there are normally legal requirements
to do so. However, online disabled access is still a relatively novel and
developing field. Many cultural organizations have not yet considered the
issues in depth and web developers are not necessarily experts either. The
interface for websites is normally tested with major browsers, but not with
specialist software like text to audio converters for the blind or against the
relevant accessibility and validation standards. We consider the current state
of the art in this area, especially with respect to aspects of particular
importance to the access of cultural heritage.

 <dc:description>  Belief change is a fundamental problem in AI: Agents constantly have to
update their beliefs to accommodate new observations. In recent years, there
has been much work on axiomatic characterizations of belief change. We claim
that a better understanding of belief change can be gained from examining
appropriate semantic models. In this paper we propose a general framework in
which to model belief change. We begin by defining belief in terms of knowledge
and plausibility: an agent believes p if he knows that p is more plausible than
its negation. We then consider some properties defining the interaction between
knowledge and plausibility, and show how these properties affect the properties
of belief. In particular, we show that by assuming two of the most natural
properties, belief becomes a KD45 operator. Finally, we add time to the
picture. This gives us a framework in which we can talk about knowledge,
plausibility (and hence belief), and time, which extends the framework of
Halpern and Fagin for modeling knowledge in multi-agent systems. We then
examine the problem of ``minimal change''. This notion can be captured by using
prior plausibilities, an analogue to prior probabilities, which can be updated
by ``conditioning''. We show by example that conditioning on a plausibility
measure can capture many scenarios of interest. In a companion paper, we show
how the two best-studied scenarios of belief change, belief revisionand belief
update, fit into our framework.

 <dc:description>  The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In
recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief
update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper, we introduce a new
framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and
epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the
change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and
belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the
assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles
underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of
belief update depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its
applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to
identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief
change operations including revision and update.

 <dc:description>  The task of camera calibration is to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic
parameters of a camera model. Though there are some restricted techniques to
infer the 3-D information about the scene from uncalibrated cameras, effective
camera calibration procedures will open up the possibility of using a wide
range of existing algorithms for 3-D reconstruction and recognition.
  The applications of camera calibration include vision-based metrology, robust
visual platooning and visual docking of mobile robots where the depth
information is important.

of a semi-algebraic set in three dimensions by testing the connectivity of a
finite number of two-dimensional ``samples'' of the set, where these samples
are defined by first-order queries. The question is answered negatively for two

 <dc:description>  Interactions are patterns between several attributes in data that cannot be
inferred from any subset of these attributes. While mutual information is a
well-established approach to evaluating the interactions between two
attributes, we surveyed its generalizations as to quantify interactions between
several attributes. We have chosen McGill's interaction information, which has
been independently rediscovered a number of times under various names in
various disciplines, because of its many intuitively appealing properties. We
apply interaction information to visually present the most important
interactions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight
into the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant
attributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering
unexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of
predictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine
learning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps:
myopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of
interactions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in
spite of independence.

 <dc:description>  The commonly used radial distortion model for camera calibration is in fact
an assumption or a restriction. In practice, camera distortion could happen in
a general geometrical manner that is not limited to the radial sense. This
paper proposes a simplified geometrical distortion modeling method by using two
different radial distortion functions in the two image axes. A family of
simplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple
polynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric
undistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in
this paper and their performance can be improved by applying a piecewise
fitting idea. Our experimental results show that the geometrical distortion
models always perform better than their radial distortion counterparts.
Furthermore, the proposed geometric modeling method is more appropriate for
cameras whose distortion is not perfectly radially symmetric around the center
of distortion.

 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm for fast record retrieval,
distribute-probe-gather, or DPG. DPG has important applications both in sorting
and in joins. Current main memory sorting algorithms split their work into
three phases: extraction of key-pointer pairs; sorting of the key-pointer
pairs; and copying of the original records into the destination array according
the sorted key-pointer pairs. The copying in the last phase dominates today's
sorting time. Hence, the use of DPG in the third phase provides an accelerator
for existing sorting algorithms.
  DPG also provides two new join methods for foreign key joins: DPG-move join
and DPG-sort join. The resulting join methods with DPG are faster because DPG
join is cache-efficient and at the same time DPG join avoids the need for
sorting or for hashing. The ideas presented for foreign key join can also be
extended to faster record pair retrieval for spatial and temporal databases.

 <dc:description>  Physical disabled access is something that most museums consider very
seriously. Indeed, there are normally legal requirements to do so. However,
online disabled access is still a relatively novel field. Most museums have not
yet considered the issues in depth. The Human-Computer Interface for their
websites is normally tested with major browsers, but not with specialist
browsers or against the relevant accessibility and validation standards. We
consider the current state of the art in this area and mention an accessibility
survey of some museum websites.

 <dc:description>  We present a first exact study on higher-dimensional packing problems with
order constraints. Problems of this type occur naturally in applications such
as logistics or computer architecture and can be interpreted as
higher-dimensional generalizations of scheduling problems. Using
graph-theoretic structures to describe feasible solutions, we develop a novel
exact branch-and-bound algorithm. This extends previous work by Fekete and
Schepers; a key tool is a new order-theoretic characterization of feasible
extensions of a partial order to a given complementarity graph that is
tailor-made for use in a branch-and-bound environment. The usefulness of our
approach is validated by computational results.

 <dc:title>On Applying Or-Parallelism and Tabling to Logic Programs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The past years have seen widening efforts at increasing Prolog's
declarativeness and expressiveness. Tabling has proved to be a viable technique
to efficiently overcome SLD's susceptibility to infinite loops and redundant
subcomputations. Our research demonstrates that implicit or-parallelism is a
natural fit for logic programs with tabling. To substantiate this belief, we
have designed and implemented an or-parallel tabling engine -- OPTYap -- and we
used a shared-memory parallel machine to evaluate its performance. To the best
of our knowledge, OPTYap is the first implementation of a parallel tabling
engine for logic programming systems. OPTYap builds on Yap's efficient
sequential Prolog engine. Its execution model is based on the SLG-WAM for
tabling, and on the environment copying for or-parallelism.
  Preliminary results indicate that the mechanisms proposed to parallelize
search in the context of SLD resolution can indeed be effectively and naturally
generalized to parallelize tabled computations, and that the resulting systems
can achieve good performance on shared-memory parallel machines. More
importantly, it emphasizes our belief that through applying or-parallelism and
tabling to logic programs the range of applications for Logic Programming can
be increased.

 <dc:description>  We describe the design and early implementation of an extensible,
component-based software architecture for natural language engineering
applications which interfaces with high performance distributed computing
services. The architecture leverages existing linguistic resource description
and discovery mechanisms based on metadata descriptions, combining these in a
compatible fashion with other software definition abstractions. Within this
architecture, application design is highly flexible, allowing disparate
components to be combined to suit the overall application functionality, and
formally described independently of processing concerns. An application
specification language provides abstraction from the programming environment
and allows ease of interface with high performance computational grids via a
broker.

 <dc:description>  Practical data analysis involves many implicit or explicit assumptions about
the good behavior of the data, and excludes consideration of various
potentially pathological or limit cases. In this work, we present a new general
theory of data, and of data processing, to bypass some of these assumptions.
The new framework presented is focused on integration, and has direct
applicability to expectation, distance, correlation, and aggregation. In a case
study, we seek to reveal faint structure in financial data. Our new foundation
for data encoding and handling offers increased justification for our
conclusions.

 <dc:description>  In this note I will review some of the recent results that have been obtained
in the probabilistic approach to the random satisfiability problem. At the
present moment the results are only heuristic. In the case of the random
3-satisfiability problem a phase transition from the satisfiable to the
unsatisfiable phase is found at $\alpha=4.267$. There are other values of
$\alpha$ that separates different regimes and they will be described in
details. In this context the properties of the survey decimation algorithm will
also be discussed.

 <dc:description>  Short cycles connectivity is a generalization of ordinary connectivity.
Instead by a path (sequence of edges), two vertices have to be connected by a
sequence of short cycles, in which two adjacent cycles have at least one common
vertex. If all adjacent cycles in the sequence share at least one edge, we talk
about edge short cycles connectivity.
  It is shown that the short cycles connectivity is an equivalence relation on
the set of vertices, while the edge short cycles connectivity components
determine an equivalence relation on the set of edges. Efficient algorithms for
determining equivalence classes are presented.
  Short cycles connectivity can be extended to directed graphs (cyclic and
transitive connectivity). For further generalization we can also consider
connectivity by small cliques or other families of graphs.

 <dc:description>  We show that constant-depth Frege systems with counting axioms modulo $m$
polynomially simulate Nullstellensatz refutations modulo $m$. Central to this
is a new definition of reducibility from formulas to systems of polynomials
with the property that, for most previously studied translations of formulas to
systems of polynomials, a formula reduces to its translation. When combined
with a previous result of the authors, this establishes the first size
separation between Nullstellensatz and polynomial calculus refutations. We also
obtain new, small refutations for certain CNFs by constant-depth Frege systems
with counting axioms.

peer-to-peer database systems. We first define a pre- cise model-theoretic
semantics of a peer-to-peer system, which allows for local inconsistency
handling. We then characterise the general computa- tional properties for the
problem of answering queries to such a peer-to- peer system. Finally, we devise
tight complexity bounds and distributed procedures for the problem of answering
queries in few relevant special cases.

 <dc:description>  OpenPGP, an IETF Proposed Standard based on PGP application, has its own
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architecture which is different from the one
based on X.509, another standard from ITU. This paper describes the OpenPGP
PKI; the historical perspective as well as its current use. The current OpenPGP
PKI issues include the capability of a PGP keyserver and its performance. PGP
keyservers have been developed and operated by volunteers since the 1990s. The
keyservers distribute, merge, and expire the OpenPGP public keys. Major
keyserver managers from several countries have built the globally distributed
network of PGP keyservers. However, the current PGP Public Keyserver (pksd) has
some limitations. It does not support fully the OpenPGP format so that it is
neither expandable nor flexible, without any cluster technology. Finally we
introduce the project on the next generation OpenPGP public keyserver called
the OpenPKSD, lead by Hironobu Suzuki, one of the authors, and funded by
Japanese Information-technology Promotion Agency(IPA).

 <dc:description>  The world is passing through a major revolution called the information
revolution, in which information and knowledge is becoming available to people
in unprecedented amounts wherever and whenever they need it. Those societies
which fail to take advantage of the new technology will be left behind, just
like in the industrial revolution.
  The information revolution is based on two major technologies: computers and
communication. These technologies have to be delivered in a COST EFFECTIVE
manner, and in LANGUAGES accessible to people.
  One way to deliver them in cost effective manner is to make suitable
technology choices, and to allow people to access through shared resources.
This could be done throuch street corner shops (for computer usage, e-mail
etc.), schools, community centres and local library centres.

 <dc:description>  The world is passing through a major revolution called the information
revolution, in which information and knowledge is becoming available to people
in unprecedented amounts wherever and whenever they need it. Those societies
which fail to take advantage of the new technology will be left behind, just
like in the industrial revolution.
  The information revolution is based on two major technologies: computers and
communication. These technologies have to be delivered in a COST EFFECTIVE
manner, and in LANGUAGES accessible to people.
  One way to deliver them in cost effective manner is to make suitable
technology choices (discussed later), and to allow people to access through
shared resources. This could be done throuch street corner shops (for computer
usage, e-mail etc.), schools, community centers and local library centres.

 <dc:description>  The anusaaraka system makes text in one Indian language accessible in another
Indian language. In the anusaaraka approach, the load is so divided between man
and computer that the language load is taken by the machine, and the
interpretation of the text is left to the man. The machine presents an image of
the source text in a language close to the target language.In the image, some
constructions of the source language (which do not have equivalents) spill over
to the output. Some special notation is also devised. The user after some
training learns to read and understand the output. Because the Indian languages
are close, the learning time of the output language is short, and is expected
to be around 2 weeks.
  The output can also be post-edited by a trained user to make it grammatically
correct in the target language. Style can also be changed, if necessary. Thus,
in this scenario, it can function as a human assisted translation system.
  Currently, anusaarakas are being built from Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali
and Punjabi to Hindi. They can be built for all Indian languages in the near
future. Everybody must pitch in to build such systems connecting all Indian
languages, using the free software model.

 <dc:description>  The anusaaraka system (a kind of machine translation system) makes text in
one Indian language accessible through another Indian language. The machine
presents an image of the source text in a language close to the target
language. In the image, some constructions of the source language (which do not
have equivalents in the target language) spill over to the output. Some special
notation is also devised.
  Anusaarakas have been built from five pairs of languages: Telugu,Kannada,
Marathi, Bengali and Punjabi to Hindi. They are available for use through Email
servers.
  Anusaarkas follows the principle of substitutibility and reversibility of
strings produced. This implies preservation of information while going from a
source language to a target language.
  For narrow subject areas, specialized modules can be built by putting subject
domain knowledge into the system, which produce good quality grammatical
output. However, it should be remembered, that such modules will work only in
narrow areas, and will sometimes go wrong. In such a situation, anusaaraka
output will still remain useful.

 <dc:description>  The paper reports on efforts taken to create lexical resources pertaining to
Indian languages, using the collaborative model. The lexical resources being
developed are: (1) Transfer lexicon and grammar from English to several Indian
languages. (2) Dependencey tree bank of annotated corpora for several Indian
languages. The dependency trees are based on the Paninian model. (3) Bilingual
dictionary of 'core meanings'.

 <dc:description>  We propose a sufficient condition for invertibility of a polynomial mapping
function defined on a cube or simplex. This condition is applicable to finite
element analysis using curved meshes. The sufficient condition is based on an
analysis of the Bernstein-B\'ezier form of the columns of the derivative.

 <dc:description>  As language data and associated technologies proliferate and as the language
resources community expands, it is becoming increasingly difficult to locate
and reuse existing resources. Are there any lexical resources for such-and-such
a language? What tool works with transcripts in this particular format? What is
a good format to use for linguistic data of this type? Questions like these
dominate many mailing lists, since web search engines are an unreliable way to
find language resources. This paper reports on a new digital infrastructure for
discovering language resources being developed by the Open Language Archives
Community (OLAC). At the core of OLAC is its metadata format, which is designed
to facilitate description and discovery of all kinds of language resources,
including data, tools, or advice. The paper describes OLAC metadata, its
relationship to Dublin Core metadata, and its dissemination using the metadata
harvesting protocol of the Open Archives Initiative.

 <dc:description>  We study a popular algorithm for fitting polynomial curves to scattered data
based on the least squares with gradient weights. We show that sometimes this
algorithm admits a substantial reduction of complexity, and, furthermore, find
precise conditions under which this is possible. It turns out that this is,
indeed, possible when one fits circles but not ellipses or hyperbolas.

 <dc:description>  We describe R-GMA (Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture) which has been
developed within the European DataGrid Project as a Grid Information and
Monitoring System. Is is based on the GMA from GGF, which is a simple
Consumer-Producer model. The special strength of this implementation comes from
the power of the relational model. We offer a global view of the information as
if each Virtual Organisation had one large relational database. We provide a
number of different Producer types with different characteristics; for example
some support streaming of information. We also provide combined
Consumer/Producers, which are able to combine information and republish it. At
the heart of the system is the mediator, which for any query is able to find
and connect to the best Producers for the job. We have developed components to
allow a measure of inter-working between MDS and R-GMA. We have used it both
for information about the grid (primarily to find out about what services are
available at any one time) and for application monitoring. R-GMA has been
deployed in various testbeds; we describe some preliminary results and
experiences of this deployment.

 <dc:description>  A model of sensory information processing is presented. The model assumes
that learning of internal (hidden) generative models, which can predict the
future and evaluate the precision of that prediction, is of central importance
for information extraction. Furthermore, the model makes a bridge to
goal-oriented systems and builds upon the structural similarity between the
architecture of a robust controller and that of the hippocampal entorhinal
loop. This generative control architecture is mapped to the neocortex and to
the hippocampal entorhinal loop. Implicit memory phenomena; priming and
prototype learning are emerging features of the model. Mathematical theorems
ensure stability and attractive learning properties of the architecture.
Connections to reinforcement learning are also established: both the control
network, and the network with a hidden model converge to (near) optimal policy
under suitable conditions. Falsifying predictions, including the role of the
feedback connections between neocortical areas are made.

 <dc:description>  We describe a collection of techniques whereby audiovisual or other
recordings of significant events can be made in a way that hinders
falsification, pre-dating, or post-dating by interested parties, even by the
makers and operators of the recording equipment. A central feature of these
techniques is the interplay between private information, which by its nature is
untrustworthy and susceptible to suppression or manipulation by interested
parties, and public information, which is too widely known to be manipulated by
anyone. While authenticated recordings may be infeasible to falsify, they can
be abused in other ways, such as being used for blackmail or harassment; but
susceptibility to these abuses can be reduced by encryption and secret sharing.

 <dc:description>  In recent years there has been a great deal of work done on secret sharing
scehemes. Secret Sharing Schemes allow for the division of keys so that an
authorised set of users may access information. In this paper we wish to
present a critical comparison of two of these schemes based on Latin Squares,
[Cooper et., al.] and RSA [Shoup]. These two protocols will be examined in
terms of their positive and negative aspects of their secuirty.

 <dc:description>  Secure networks rely upon players to maintain security and reliability.
However not every player can be assumed to have total loyalty and one must use
methods to uncover traitors in such networks. We use the original concept of
the Byzantine Generals Problem by Lamport, and the more formal Byzantine
Agreement describe by Linial, to nd traitors in secure networks. By applying
general fault-tolerance methods to develop a more formal design of secure
networks we are able to uncover traitors amongst a group of players. We also
propose methods to integrate this system with insecure channels. This new
resiliency can be applied to broadcast and peer-to-peer secure communication
systems where agents may be traitors or become unreliable due to faults.

 <dc:title>On Decidability of Expressive Description Logics with Composition of
  Roles in Number Restrictions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Description Logics are knowledge representation formalisms which have been
used in a wide range of application domains. Owing to their appealing
expressiveness, we consider in this paper extensions of the well-known concept
language ALC allowing for number restrictions on complex role expressions.
These have been first introduced by Baader and Sattler as ALCN(M) languages,
with the adoption of role constructors M subset-of {o,-,And,Or}. In particular,
they showed in 1999 that, although ALCN(o) is decidable, the addition of other
operators may easily lead to undecidability: in fact, ALCN(o,And) and
ALCN(o,-,Or) were proved undecidable.
  In this work, we further investigate the computational properties of the ALCN
family, aiming at narrowing the decidability gap left open by Baader and
Sattler's results. In particular, we will show that ALCN(o) extended with
inverse roles both in number and in value restrictions becomes undecidable,
whereas it can be safely extended with qualified number restrictions without
losing decidability.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the topic of learning in multiagent systems. We first provide a
quick introduction to the field of game theory, focusing on the equilibrium
concepts of iterated dominance, and Nash equilibrium. We show some of the most
relevant findings in the theory of learning in games, including theorems on
fictitious play, replicator dynamics, and evolutionary stable strategies. The
CLRI theory and n-level learning agents are introduced as attempts to apply
some of these findings to the problem of engineering multiagent systems with
learning agents. Finally, we summarize some of the remaining challenges in the
field of learning in multiagent systems.

 <dc:description>  The scope of this teaching package is to make a brief induction to Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs) for people who have no previous knowledge of them. We
first make a brief introduction to models of networks, for then describing in
general terms ANNs. As an application, we explain the backpropagation
algorithm, since it is widely used and many other algorithms are derived from
it. The user should know algebra and the handling of functions and vectors.
Differential calculus is recommendable, but not necessary. The contents of this
package should be understood by people with high school education. It would be
useful for people who are just curious about what are ANNs, or for people who
want to become familiar with them, so when they study them more fully, they
will already have clear notions of ANNs. Also, people who only want to apply
the backpropagation algorithm without a detailed and formal explanation of it
will find this material useful. This work should not be seen as &quot;Nets for
dummies&quot;, but of course it is not a treatise. Much of the formality is skipped
for the sake of simplicity. Detailed explanations and demonstrations can be
found in the referred readings. The included exercises complement the
understanding of the theory. The on-line resources are highly recommended for
extending this brief induction.

 <dc:title>Evaluation of text data mining for database curation: lessons learned

 <dc:description>  MOTIVATION: The biological literature is a major repository of knowledge.
Many biological databases draw much of their content from a careful curation of
this literature. However, as the volume of literature increases, the burden of
curation increases. Text mining may provide useful tools to assist in the
curation process. To date, the lack of standards has made it impossible to
determine whether text mining techniques are sufficiently mature to be useful.
  RESULTS: We report on a Challenge Evaluation task that we created for the
Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) Challenge Cup. We provided a training
corpus of 862 articles consisting of journal articles curated in FlyBase, along
with the associated lists of genes and gene products, as well as the relevant
data fields from FlyBase. For the test, we provided a corpus of 213 new
(`blind') articles; the 18 participating groups provided systems that flagged
articles for curation, based on whether the article contained experimental
evidence for gene expression products. We report on the the evaluation results
and describe the techniques used by the top performing groups.

 <dc:description>  Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing,
indexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and
searching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases
from within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes
it feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not
have manually assigned keyphrases. A limitation of previous keyphrase
extraction algorithms is that the selected keyphrases are occasionally
incoherent. That is, the majority of the output keyphrases may fit together
well, but there may be a minority that appear to be outliers, with no clear
semantic relation to the majority or to each other. This paper presents
enhancements to the Kea keyphrase extraction algorithm that are designed to
increase the coherence of the extracted keyphrases. The approach is to use the
degree of statistical association among candidate keyphrases as evidence that
they may be semantically related. The statistical association is measured using
web mining. Experiments demonstrate that the enhancements improve the quality
of the extracted keyphrases. Furthermore, the enhancements are not
domain-specific: the algorithm generalizes well when it is trained on one
domain (computer science documents) and tested on another (physics documents).

 <dc:description>  We show that the Internet topology at the Autonomous System (AS) level has a
rich--club phenomenon. The rich nodes, which are a small number of nodes with
large numbers of links, are very well connected to each other. The rich--club
is a core tier that we measured using the rich--club connectivity and the
node--node link distribution. We obtained this core tier without any heuristic
assumption between the ASes. The rich--club phenomenon is a simple qualitative
way to differentiate between power law topologies and provides a criterion for
new network models. To show this, we compared the measured rich--club of the AS
graph with networks obtained using the Barab\'asi--Albert (BA) scale--free
network model, the Fitness BA model and the Inet--3.0 model.

idea of this algorithm is to extend the existing algorithms by a component,
which reflects the interests of the users more than existing methods. The &quot;Vox
Populi Algorithm&quot; (VPA) creates a feedback from the users to the content of the
search index. The information derived from the users query analysis is used to
modify the existing crawling algorithms. The VPA controls the distribution of
the resources of the crawler. Finally, we also discuss methods of suppressing
unwanted content (spam).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a discrete data structure for reservations of
limited resources. A reservation is defined as a tuple consisting of the time
interval of when the resource should be reserved, $I_R$, and the amount of the
resource that is reserved, $B_R$, formally $R=\{I_R,B_R\}$.
  The data structure is similar to a segment tree. The maximum spanning
interval of the data structure is fixed and defined in advance. The granularity
and thereby the size of the intervals of the leaves is also defined in advance.
The data structure is built only once. Neither nodes nor leaves are ever
inserted, deleted or moved. Hence, the running time of the operations does not
depend on the number of reservations previously made. The running time does not
depend on the size of the interval of the reservation either. Let $n$ be the
number of leaves in the data structure. In the worst case, the number of
touched (i.e. traversed) nodes is in any operation $O(\log n)$, hence the
running time of any operation is also $O(\log n)$.

 <dc:description>  WWW has a scale-free structure where novel information is often difficult to
locate. Moreover, Intelligent agents easily get trapped in this structure. Here
a novel method is put forth, which turns these traps into information
repositories, supplies: We populated an Internet environment with intelligent
news foragers. Foraging has its associated cost whereas foragers are rewarded
if they detect not yet discovered novel information. The intelligent news
foragers crawl by using the estimated long-term cumulated reward, and also have
a finite sized memory: the list of most promising supplies. Foragers form an
artificial life community: the most successful ones are allowed to multiply,
while unsuccessful ones die out. The specific property of this community is
that there is no direct communication amongst foragers but the centralized
rewarding system. Still, fast division of work is achieved.

 <dc:description>  Introduced below is a quantum database method, not only for retrieval but
also for creation. It uses a particular structure of true's and false's in a
state vector of n qubits, permitting up to 2**2**n words, vastly more than for
classical bits. Several copies are produced so that later they can be
destructively observed and a word determined with high probability. Grover's
algorithm is proposed below to read out, nondestructively the unknown contents
of a given stored state vector using only one state vector.

 <dc:description>  A new method of hierarchical clustering of graph vertexes is suggested. In
the method, the graph partition is determined with an equivalence relation
satisfying a recursive definition stating that vertexes are equivalent if the
vertexes they point to (or vertexes pointing to them) are equivalent. Iterative
application of the partitioning yields a hierarchical clustering of graph
vertexes. The method is applied to the citation graph of hep-th. The outcome is
a two-level classification scheme for the subject field presented in hep-th,
and indexing of the papers from hep-th in this scheme. A number of tests show
that the classification obtained is adequate.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an exploratory study of college-age students using
two-way, push-to-talk cellular radios. We describe the observed and reported
use of cellular radio by the participants, the activities and purposes for
which they adopted it, and their responses. We then examine these empirical
results using mediated communication theory. Cellular radios have a unique
combination of affordances relative to other media used by this age group,
including instant messaging (IM) and mobile phones; the results of our analysis
do suggest explanations for some observed phenomena but also highlight the
counter-intuitive nature of other phenomena. For example, although the radios
have many important dissimilarities with IM from the viewpoint of mediated
communication theory, the observed use patterns resembled those of IM to a
surprising degree.

 <dc:description>  The overall goal of this paper is to investigate the theoretical foundations
of algorithmic verification techniques for first order linear logic
specifications. The fragment of linear logic we consider in this paper is based
on the linear logic programming language called LO enriched with universally
quantified goal formulas. Although LO was originally introduced as a
theoretical foundation for extensions of logic programming languages, it can
also be viewed as a very general language to specify a wide range of
infinite-state concurrent systems.
  Our approach is based on the relation between backward reachability and
provability highlighted in our previous work on propositional LO programs.
Following this line of research, we define here a general framework for the
bottom-up evaluation of first order linear logic specifications. The evaluation
procedure is based on an effective fixpoint operator working on a symbolic
representation of infinite collections of first order linear logic formulas.
The theory of well quasi-orderings can be used to provide sufficient conditions
for the termination of the evaluation of non trivial fragments of first order
linear logic.

 <dc:description>  A formal model of the structure of information is presented in five axioms
which define identity, containment, and joins of infons. Joins are shown to be
commutative, associative, provide inverses of infons, and, potentially, have
many identity elements, two of which are multiplicative and additive. Those two
types of join are distributive. The other identity elements are for operators
on entwined states. Multiplicative joins correspond to adding or removing new
bits to a system while additive joins correspond to a change of state. The
order or size of an infon is defined. This groundwork is intended to be used to
model continuous and discreet information structures through time, especially
in closed systems.

 <dc:description>  We propose a family of very efficient hierarchical indexing schemes for
ungapped, score matrix-based similarity search in large datasets of short (4-12
amino acid) protein fragments. This type of similarity search has importance in
both providing a building block to more complex algorithms and for possible use
in direct biological investigations where datasets are of the order of 60
million objects. Our scheme is based on the internal geometry of the amino acid
alphabet and performs exceptionally well, for example outputting 100 nearest
neighbours to any possible fragment of length 10 after scanning on average less
than one per cent of the entire dataset.

 <dc:title>The KR-Benes Network: A Control-Optimal Rearrangeable Permutation

 <dc:description>  The Benes network has been used as a rearrangeable network for over 40 years,
yet the uniform $N(2 \log N-1)$ control complexity of the $N \times N$ Benes is
not optimal for many permutations. In this paper, we present a novel $O(\log
N)$ depth rearrangeable network called KR-Benes that is {\it
permutation-specific control-optimal}. The KR-Benes routes {\it every}
permutation with the minimal control complexity {\it specific} to that
permutation and its worst-case complexity for arbitrary permutations is bounded
by the Benes; thus it replaces the Benes when considering control
complexity/latency. We design the KR-Benes by first constructing a restricted
$2 \log K +2$ depth rearrangeable network called $K$-Benes for routing
$K$-bounded permutations with control $2N \log K$, $0 \leq K \leq N/4$. We then
show that the $N \times N$ Benes network itself (with one additional stage)
contains every $K$-Benes network as a subgraph and use this property to
construct the KR-Benes network. With regard to the control-optimality of the
KR-Benes, we show that any optimal network for rearrangeably routing
$K$-bounded permutations must have depth $2 \log K + 2$, and therefore the
$K$-Benes (and hence the KR-Benes) is optimal.

 <dc:description>  On the basis of convolutional (Hamming) version of recent Neural Network
Assembly Memory Model (NNAMM) for intact two-layer autoassociative Hopfield
network optimal receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) have been derived
analytically. A method of taking into account explicitly a priori probabilities
of alternative hypotheses on the structure of information initiating memory
trace retrieval and modified ROCs (mROCs, a posteriori probabilities of correct
recall vs. false alarm probability) are introduced. The comparison of empirical
and calculated ROCs (or mROCs) demonstrates that they coincide quantitatively
and in this way intensities of cues used in appropriate experiments may be
estimated. It has been found that basic ROC properties which are one of
experimental findings underpinning dual-process models of recognition memory
can be explained within our one-factor NNAMM.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel scheme to the coverage problem, introducing a quantitative
way to estimate the interaction between a block and its enviroment.This is
achieved by setting a discrete version of Green`s theorem, specially adapted
for Model Checking based verification of integrated circuits.This method is
best suited for the coverage problem since it enables one to quantify the
incompleteness or, on the other hand, the redundancy of a set of rules,
describing the model under verification.Moreover this can be done continuously
throughout the verification process, thus enabling the user to pinpoint the
stages at which incompleteness/redundancy occurs. Although the method is
presented locally on a small hardware example, we additionally show its
possibility to provide precise coverage estimation also for large scale
systems. We compare this method to others by checking it on the same
test-cases.

 <dc:title>What Is Working Memory and Mental Imagery? A Robot that Learns to

 <dc:description>  This paper goes back to Turing (1936) and treats his machine as a cognitive
model (W,D,B), where W is an &quot;external world&quot; represented by memory device (the
tape divided into squares), and (D,B) is a simple robot that consists of the
sensory-motor devices, D, and the brain, B. The robot's sensory-motor devices
(the &quot;eye&quot;, the &quot;hand&quot;, and the &quot;organ of speech&quot;) allow the robot to simulate
the work of any Turing machine. The robot simulates the internal states of a
Turing machine by &quot;talking to itself.&quot; At the stage of training, the teacher
forces the robot (by acting directly on its motor centers) to perform several
examples of an algorithm with different input data presented on tape. Two
effects are achieved: 1) The robot learns to perform the shown algorithm with
any input data using the tape. 2) The robot learns to perform the algorithm
&quot;mentally&quot; using an &quot;imaginary tape.&quot; The model illustrates the simplest
concept of a universal learning neurocomputer, demonstrates universality of
associative learning as the mechanism of programming, and provides a
simplified, but nontrivial neurobiologically plausible explanation of the
phenomena of working memory and mental imagery. The model is implemented as a
user-friendly program for Windows called EROBOT. The program is available at
www.brain0.com/software.html.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new homomorphic public-key cryptosystem over arbitrary
nonidentity finite group based on the difficulty of the membership problem for
groups of integer matrices. Besides, a homomorphic cryptosystem is designed for
the first time over finite commutative rings.

 <dc:description>  We introduce indexing of tables referencing complex structures such as
digraphs and spatial objects, appearing in genetics and other data intensive
analysis. The indexing is achieved by extracting dimension schemas from the
referenced structures. The schemas and their dimensionality are determined by
proper coloring algorithms and the duality between all such schemas and all
such possible proper colorings is established. This duality, in turn, provides
us with an extensive library of solutions when addressing indexing questions.
It is illustrated how to use the schemas, in connection with additional
relational database technologies, to optimize queries conditioned on the
structural information being referenced. Comparisons using bitmap indexing in
the Oracle 9.2i database, on the one hand, and multidimensional clustering in
DB2 8.1.2, on the other hand, are used to illustrate the applicability of the
indexing to different technology settings. Finally, we illustrate how the
indexing can be used to extract low dimensional schemas from a binary interval
tree in order to resolve efficiently interval and stabbing queries.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents our computational methodology using Genetic Algorithms
(GA) for exploring the nature of RNA editing. These models are constructed
using several genetic editing characteristics that are gleaned from the RNA
editing system as observed in several organisms. We have expanded the
traditional Genetic Algorithm with artificial editing mechanisms as proposed by
(Rocha, 1997). The incorporation of editing mechanisms provides a means for
artificial agents with genetic descriptions to gain greater phenotypic
plasticity, which may be environmentally regulated. Our first implementations
of these ideas have shed some light into the evolutionary implications of RNA
editing. Based on these understandings, we demonstrate how to select proper RNA
editors for designing more robust GAs, and the results will show promising
applications to real-world problems. We expect that the framework proposed will
both facilitate determining the evolutionary role of RNA editing in biology,
and advance the current state of research in Genetic Algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation systems for different Document Networks (DN) such as the World
Wide Web (WWW) and Digital Libraries, often use distance functions extracted
from relationships among documents and keywords. For instance, documents in the
WWW are related via a hyperlink network, while documents in bibliographic
databases are related by citation and collaboration networks. Furthermore,
documents are related to keyterms. The distance functions computed from these
relations establish associative networks among items of the DN, referred to as
Distance Graphs, which allow recommendation systems to identify relevant
associations for individual users. However, modern recommendation systems need
to integrate associative data from multiple sources such as different
databases, web sites, and even other users. Thus, we are presented with a
problem of combining evidence (about associations between items) from different
sources characterized by distance functions. In this paper we describe our work
on (1) inferring relevant associations from, as well as characterizing,
semi-metric distance graphs and (2) combining evidence from different distance
graphs in a recommendation system. Regarding (1), we present the idea of
semi-metric distance graphs, and introduce ratios to measure semi-metric
behavior. We compute these ratios for several DN such as digital libraries and
web sites and show that they are useful to identify implicit associations.
Regarding (2), we describe an algorithm to combine evidence from distance
graphs that uses Evidence Sets, a set structure based on Interval Valued Fuzzy
Sets and Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence. This algorithm has been developed
for a recommendation system named TalkMine.

 <dc:description>  We give the first algorithmic study of a class of ``covering tour'' problems
related to the geometric Traveling Salesman Problem: Find a polygonal tour for
a cutter so that it sweeps out a specified region (``pocket''), in order to
minimize a cost that depends mainly on the number of em turns. These problems
arise naturally in manufacturing applications of computational geometry to
automatic tool path generation and automatic inspection systems, as well as arc
routing (``postman'') problems with turn penalties. We prove the
NP-completeness of minimum-turn milling and give efficient approximation
algorithms for several natural versions of the problem, including a
polynomial-time approximation scheme based on a novel adaptation of the
m-guillotine method.

 <dc:title>Reliable and Efficient Inference of Bayesian Networks from Sparse Data

 <dc:subject>K.3.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To learn (statistical) dependencies among random variables requires
exponentially large sample size in the number of observed random variables if
any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur.
  We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities
can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i.e., by a graph with small
in-degree \Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high
confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set
of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to
select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on
the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous
paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.
  The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree
\Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for
constant \Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can
be found by convex optimization.

 <dc:description>  Within the literature on non-cooperative game theory, there have been a
number of attempts to propose logorithms which will compute Nash equilibria.
Rather than derive a new algorithm, this paper shows that the family of
algorithms known as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can be used to calculate
Nash equilibria. MCMC is a type of Monte Carlo simulation that relies on Markov
chains to ensure its regularity conditions. MCMC has been widely used
throughout the statistics and optimization literature, where variants of this
algorithm are known as simulated annealing. This paper shows that there is
interesting connection between the trembles that underlie the functioning of
this algorithm and the type of Nash refinement known as trembling hand
perfection.

 <dc:description>  We characterize the set of planar locally finite Cayley graphs, and give a
finite representation of these graphs by a special kind of finite state
automata called labeling schemes. As a result, we are able to enumerate and
describe all planar locally finite Cayley graphs of a given degree. This
analysis allows us to solve the problem of decision of the locally finite
planarity for a word-problem-decidable presentation.

 <dc:description>  Solving a system of nonlinear inequalities is an important problem for which
conventional numerical analysis has no satisfactory method. With a
box-consistency algorithm one can compute a cover for the solution set to
arbitrarily close approximation. Because of difficulties in the use of
propagation for complex arithmetic expressions, box consistency is computed
with interval arithmetic. In this paper we present theorems that support a
simple modification of propagation that allows complex arithmetic expressions
to be handled efficiently. The version of box consistency that is obtained in
this way is stronger than when interval arithmetic is used.

driven by spoken queries. This collection was produced in the subtask of the
NTCIR-3 Web retrieval task, which was performed in a TREC-style evaluation
workshop. The search topics and document collection for the Web retrieval task
were used to produce spoken queries and language models for speech recognition,
respectively. We used this collection to evaluate the performance of our
retrieval system. Experimental results showed that (a) the use of target
documents for language modeling and (b) enhancement of the vocabulary size in
speech recognition were effective in improving the system performance.

\cite{mezard:parisi:zecchina:02,mezard:zecchina:02}, we derive the various
threshold values for the number of clauses per variable of the random
$K$-satisfiability problem, generalizing the previous results to $K \ge 4$. We
also give an analytic solution of the equations, and some closed expressions
for these thresholds, in an expansion around large $K$. The stability of the
solution is also computed. For any $K$, the satisfiability threshold is found
to be in the stable region of the solution, which adds further credit to the
conjecture that this computation gives the exact satisfiability threshold.

selectively view specific segments of lecture videos by submitting text
queries. Users can easily formulate queries by using the textbook associated
with a target lecture, even if they cannot come up with effective keywords. Our
system extracts the audio track from a target lecture video, generates a
transcription by large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, and produces a
text index. Experimental results showed that by adapting speech recognition to
the topic of the lecture, the recognition accuracy increased and the retrieval

 <dc:description>  W3C's XML-Query language offers a powerful instrument for information
retrieval on XML repositories. This article describes an implementation of this
retrieval in a real world's scenario. Distributed XML-Query processing reduces
load on every single attending node to an acceptable level. The network allows
every participant to control their computing load themselves. Furthermore
XML-repositories may stay at the rights holder, so every Data-Provider can
decide, whether to process critical queries or not. If Data-Providers keep
redundant information, this distributed network improves reliability of
information with duplicates removed.

 <dc:description>  The mu-calculus is a powerful tool for specifying and verifying transition
systems, including those with both demonic and angelic choice; its quantitative
generalisation qMu extends that to probabilistic choice.
  We show that for a finite-state system the logical interpretation of qMu, via
fixed-points in a domain of real-valued functions into [0,1], is equivalent to
an operational interpretation given as a turn-based gambling game between two
players.
  The logical interpretation provides direct access to axioms, laws and
meta-theorems. The operational, game- based interpretation aids the intuition
and continues in the more general context to provide a surprisingly practical
specification tool.
  A corollary of our proofs is an extension of Everett's singly-nested games
result in the finite turn-based case: we prove well-definedness of the minimax
value, and existence of fixed memoriless strategies, for all qMu
games/formulae, of arbitrary (including alternating) nesting structure.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we develop an evidential force aggregation method intended for
classification of evidential intelligence into recognized force structures. We
assume that the intelligence has already been partitioned into clusters and use
the classification method individually in each cluster. The classification is
based on a measure of fitness between template and fused intelligence that
makes it possible to handle intelligence reports with multiple nonspecific and
uncertain propositions. With this measure we can aggregate on a level-by-level
basis, starting from general intelligence to achieve a complete force structure
with recognized units on all hierarchical levels.

 <dc:title>A thought experiment on Quantum Mechanics and Distributed Failure

 <dc:description>  One of the biggest problems in current distributed systems is that presented
by one machine attempting to determine the liveness of another in a timely
manner. Unfortunately, the symptoms exhibited by a failed machine can also be
the result of other causes, e.g., an overloaded machine or network which drops
messages, making it impossible to detect a machine failure with cetainty until
that machine recovers. This is a well understood problem and one which has led
to a large body of research into failure suspectors: since it is not possible
to detect a failure, the best one can do is suspect a failure and program
accordingly. However, one machine's suspicions may not be the same as
another's; therefore, these algorithms spend a considerable effort in ensuring
a consistent view among all available machines of who is suspects of being
failed. This paper describes a thought experiment on how quantum mechanics may
be used to provide a failure detector that is guaranteed to give both accurate
and instantaneous information about the liveness of machines, no matter the
distances involved.

 <dc:description>  Over the past decades automated debugging has seen major achievements.
However, as debugging is by necessity attached to particular programming
paradigms, the results are scattered. To alleviate this problem, the Automated
and Algorithmic Debugging workshop (AADEBUG for short) was organised in 1993 in
Link&quot;oping (Sweden). As this workshop proved to be successful, subsequent
workshops have been organised in 1995 (Saint-Malo, France), 1997 (again in
Link&quot;oping, Sweden) and 2000 (Munich, Germany). In 2003, the workshop is
organised in Ghent, Belgium, the proceedings of which you are reading right
now.

 <dc:description>  We present cTI, the first system for universal left-termination inference of
logic programs. Termination inference generalizes termination analysis and
checking. Traditionally, a termination analyzer tries to prove that a given
class of queries terminates. This class must be provided to the system, for
instance by means of user annotations. Moreover, the analysis must be redone
every time the class of queries of interest is updated. Termination inference,
in contrast, requires neither user annotations nor recomputation. In this
approach, terminating classes for all predicates are inferred at once. We
describe the architecture of cTI and report an extensive experimental
evaluation of the system covering many classical examples from the logic
programming termination literature and several Prolog programs of respectable
size and complexity.

 <dc:title>Instrumenting self-modifying code</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Adding small code snippets at key points to existing code fragments is called
instrumentation. It is an established technique to debug certain otherwise hard
to solve faults, such as memory management issues and data races. Dynamic
instrumentation can already be used to analyse code which is loaded or even
generated at run time.With the advent of environments such as the Java Virtual
Machine with optimizing Just-In-Time compilers, a new obstacle arises:
self-modifying code. In order to instrument this kind of code correctly, one
must be able to detect modifications and adapt the instrumentation code
accordingly, preferably without incurring a high penalty speedwise. In this
paper we propose an innovative technique that uses the hardware page protection
mechanism of modern processors to detect such modifications. We also show how
an instrumentor can adapt the instrumented version depending on the kind of
modificiations as well as an experimental evaluation of said techniques.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces an automatic debugging framework that relies on
model-based reasoning techniques to locate faults in programs. In particular,
model-based diagnosis, together with an abstract interpretation based conflict
detection mechanism is used to derive diagnoses, which correspond to possible
faults in programs. Design information and partial specifications are applied
to guide a model revision process, which allows for automatic detection and
correction of structural faults.

 <dc:description>  Many programmers have had to deal with an overwritten variable resulting for
example from an aliasing problem. The culprit is obviously the last
write-access to that memory location before the manifestation of the bug. The
usual technique for removing such bugs starts with the debugger by (1) finding
the last write and (2) moving the control point of execution back to that time
by re-executing the program from the beginning. We wish to automate this. Step
(2) is easy if we can somehow mark the last write found in step (1) and control
the execution-point to move it back to this time.
  In this paper we propose a new concept, position, that is, a point in the
program execution trace, as needed for step (2) above. The position enables
debuggers to automate the control of program execution to support common
debugging activities. We have implemented position in C by modifying GCC and in
Java with a bytecode transformer. Measurements show that position can be
provided with an acceptable amount of overhead.

 <dc:description>  The paper proposes a theoretical approach of the debugging of constraint
programs based on a notion of explanation tree. The proposed approach is an
attempt to adapt algorithmic debugging to constraint programming. In this
theoretical framework for domain reduction, explanations are proof trees
explaining value removals. These proof trees are defined by inductive
definitions which express the removals of values as consequences of other value
removals. Explanations may be considered as the essence of constraint
programming. They are a declarative view of the computation trace. The
diagnosis consists in locating an error in an explanation rooted by a symptom.

 <dc:description>  We consider a fundamental problem in data structures, static predecessor
searching: Given a subset S of size n from the universe [m], store S so that
queries of the form &quot;What is the predecessor of x in S?&quot; can be answered
efficiently. We study this problem in the cell probe model introduced by Yao.
Recently, Beame and Fich obtained optimal bounds on the number of probes needed
by any deterministic query scheme if the associated storage scheme uses only
n^{O(1)} cells of word size (\log m)^{O(1)} bits. We give a new lower bound
proof for this problem that matches the bounds of Beame and Fich. Our lower
bound proof has the following advantages: it works for randomised query schemes
too, while Beame and Fich's proof works for deterministic query schemes only.
It also extends to `quantum address-only' query schemes that we define in this
paper, and is simpler than Beame and Fich's proof. We prove our lower bound
using the round elimination approach of Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson.
Using tools from information theory, we prove a strong round elimination lemma
for communication complexity that enables us to obtain a tight lower bound for
the predecessor problem. Our strong round elimination lemma also extends to
quantum communication complexity. We also use our round elimination lemma to
obtain a rounds versus communication tradeoff for the `greater-than' problem,
improving on the tradeoff in Miltersen et al. We believe that our round
elimination lemma is of independent interest and should have other
applications.

 <dc:description>  The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation.
Positive semantic orientation indicates praise (e.g., &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;intrepid&quot;) and
negative semantic orientation indicates criticism (e.g., &quot;disturbing&quot;,
&quot;superfluous&quot;). Semantic orientation varies in both direction (positive or
negative) and degree (mild to strong). An automated system for measuring
semantic orientation would have application in text classification, text
filtering, tracking opinions in online discussions, analysis of survey
responses, and automated chat systems (chatbots). This paper introduces a
method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical
association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words. Two instances
of this approach are evaluated, based on two different statistical measures of
word association: pointwise mutual information (PMI) and latent semantic
analysis (LSA). The method is experimentally tested with 3,596 words (including
adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs) that have been manually labeled positive
(1,614 words) and negative (1,982 words). The method attains an accuracy of
82.8% on the full test set, but the accuracy rises above 95% when the algorithm
is allowed to abstain from classifying mild words.

 <dc:description>  Existing statistical approaches to natural language problems are very coarse
approximations to the true complexity of language processing. As such, no
single technique will be best for all problem instances. Many researchers are
examining ensemble methods that combine the output of successful, separately
developed modules to create more accurate solutions. This paper examines three
merging rules for combining probability distributions: the well known mixture
rule, the logarithmic rule, and a novel product rule. These rules were applied
with state-of-the-art results to two problems commonly used to assess human
mastery of lexical semantics -- synonym questions and analogy questions. All
three merging rules result in ensembles that are more accurate than any of
their component modules. The differences among the three rules are not
statistically significant, but it is suggestive that the popular mixture rule
is not the best rule for either of the two problems.

 <dc:description>  A ternary/binary data coding algorithm and conditions under which Hopfield
networks implement optimal convolutional or Hamming decoding algorithms has
been described. Using the coding/decoding approach (an optimal Binary Signal
Detection Theory, BSDT) introduced a Neural Network Assembly Memory Model
(NNAMM) is built. The model provides optimal (the best) basic memory
performance and demands the use of a new memory unit architecture with
two-layer Hopfield network, N-channel time gate, auxiliary reference memory,
and two nested feedback loops. NNAMM explicitly describes the dependence on
time of a memory trace retrieval, gives a possibility of metamemory simulation,
generalized knowledge representation, and distinct description of conscious and
unconscious mental processes. A model of smallest inseparable part or an &quot;atom&quot;
of consciousness is also defined. The NNAMM's neurobiological backgrounds and
its applications to solving some interdisciplinary problems are shortly
discussed. BSDT could implement the &quot;best neural code&quot; used in nervous tissues
of animals and humans.

 <dc:title>Postmortem Object Type Identification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cantrill, Bryan M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.2.5</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel technique for the automatic type identification
of arbitrary memory objects from a memory dump. Our motivating application is
debugging memory corruption problems in optimized, production systems -- a
problem domain largely unserved by extant methodologies. We describe our
algorithm as applicable to any typed language, and we discuss it with respect
to the formidable obstacles posed by C. We describe the heuristics that we have
developed to overcome these difficulties and achieve effective type
identification on C-based systems. We further describe the implementation of
our heuristics on one C-based system -- the Solaris operating system kernel --
and describe the extensions that we have added to the Solaris postmortem
debugger to allow for postmortem type identification. We show that our
implementation yields a sufficiently high rate of type identification to be
useful for debugging memory corruption problems. Finally, we discuss some of
the novel automated debugging mechanisms that can be layered upon postmortem
type identification.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel evolutionary formulation of the problem of finding a
maximum independent set of a graph. The new formulation is based on the
relationship that exists between a graph's independence number and its acyclic
orientations. It views such orientations as individuals and evolves them with
the aid of evolutionary operators that are very heavily based on the structure
of the graph and its acyclic orientations. The resulting heuristic has been
tested on some of the Second DIMACS Implementation Challenge benchmark graphs,
and has been found to be competitive when compared to several of the other
heuristics that have also been tested on those graphs.

 <dc:description>  We introduce two novel evolutionary formulations of the problem of coloring
the nodes of a graph. The first formulation is based on the relationship that
exists between a graph's chromatic number and its acyclic orientations. It
views such orientations as individuals and evolves them with the aid of
evolutionary operators that are very heavily based on the structure of the
graph and its acyclic orientations. The second formulation, unlike the first
one, does not tackle one graph at a time, but rather aims at evolving a
`program' to color all graphs belonging to a class whose members all have the
same number of nodes and other common attributes. The heuristics that result
from these formulations have been tested on some of the Second DIMACS
Implementation Challenge benchmark graphs, and have been found to be
competitive when compared to the several other heuristics that have also been
tested on those graphs.

 <dc:description>  We consider a connected undirected graph $G(n,m)$ with $n$ nodes and $m$
edges. A $k$-dominating set $D$ in $G$ is a set of nodes having the property
that every node in $G$ is at most $k$ edges away from at least one node in $D$.
Finding a $k$-dominating set of minimum size is NP-hard. We give a new
synchronous distributed algorithm to find a $k$-dominating set in $G$ of size
no greater than $\lfloor n/(k+1)\rfloor$. Our algorithm requires $O(k\log^*n)$
time and $O(m\log k+n\log k\log^*n)$ messages to run. It has the same time
complexity as the best currently known algorithm, but improves on that
algorithm's message complexity and is, in addition, conceptually simpler.

 <dc:description>  We show that a realization of a closed connected PL-manifold of dimension n-1
in n-dimensional Euclidean space (n&gt;2) is the boundary of a convex polyhedron
(finite or infinite) if and only if the interior of each (n-3)-face has a
point, which has a neighborhood lying on the boundary of an n-dimensional
convex body. No initial assumptions about the topology or orientability of the
input surface are made. The theorem is derived from a refinement and
generalization of Van Heijenoort's theorem on locally convex manifolds to
spherical spaces. Our convexity criterion for PL-manifolds implies an easy
polynomial-time algorithm for checking convexity of a given PL-surface in
n-dimensional Euclidean or spherical space, n&gt;2. The algorithm is worst case
optimal with respect to both the number of operations and the algebraic degree.
The algorithm works under significantly weaker assumptions and is easier to
implement than convexity verification algorithms suggested by Mehlhorn et al
(1996-1999), and Devillers et al.(1998). A paradigm of approximate convexity is
suggested and a simplified algorithm of smaller degree and complexity is
suggested for approximate floating point convexity verification.

 <dc:description>Comment: 10 pages (abbreviated version). Significantly different from all

  have been substantially rewritten and errors fixed. This preprint is close to

 <dc:description>  Matrix clocks are a generalization of the notion of vector clocks that allows
the local representation of causal precedence to reach into an asynchronous
distributed computation's past with depth $x$, where $x\ge 1$ is an integer.
Maintaining matrix clocks correctly in a system of $n$ nodes requires that
everymessage be accompanied by $O(n^x)$ numbers, which reflects an exponential
dependency of the complexity of matrix clocks upon the desired depth $x$. We
introduce a novel type of matrix clock, one that requires only $nx$ numbers to
be attached to each message while maintaining what for many applications may be
the most significant portion of the information that the original matrix clock
carries. In order to illustrate the new clock's applicability, we demonstrate
its use in the monitoring of certain resource-sharing computations.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel definition of approximate palindromes in strings, and
provide an algorithm to find all maximal approximate palindromes in a string
with up to $k$ errors. Our definition is based on the usual edit operations of
approximate pattern matching, and the algorithm we give, for a string of size
$n$ on a fixed alphabet, runs in $O(k^2 n)$ time. We also discuss two
implementation-related improvements to the algorithm, and demonstrate their
efficacy in practice by means of both experiments and an average-case analysis.

the combinatorial structures and concepts that underlie the various deadlock
models that have been proposed, the design of algorithms and deadlock-handling
policies, and concurrency issues. These structures are mostly graph-theoretic
in nature, or partially ordered sets for the establishment of priorities among
processes and acquisition orders on resources. We also discuss graph-coloring
concepts as they relate to resource sharing.

widely recognized in various areas of Computer Science. These data structures
have been analyzed from an axiomatic point of view with a parametric approach
in (*) where the relevant unification algorithms have been developed. In this
paper we extend these results considering more general constraints including
not only equality but also membership constraints as well as their negative

 <dc:title>The Liar and Related Paradoxes: Fuzzy Truth Value Assignment for

 <dc:description>  We study self-referential sentences of the type related to the Liar paradox.
In particular, we consider the problem of assigning consistent fuzzy truth
values to collections of self-referential sentences. We show that the problem
can be reduced to the solution of a system of nonlinear equations. Furthermore,
we prove that, under mild conditions, such a system always has a solution (i.e.
a consistent truth value assignment) and that, for a particular implementation
of logical ``and'', ``or'' and ``negation'', the ``mid-point'' solution is
always consistent. Next we turn to computational issues and present several
truth-value assignment algorithms; we argue that these algorithms can be
understood as generalized sequential reasoning. In an Appendix we present a
large number of examples of self-referential collections (including the Liar
and the Strengthened Liar), we formulate the corresponding truth value
equations and solve them analytically and/ or numerically.

 <dc:description>  Debugging is commonly understood as finding and fixing the cause of a

that a cause is a cause--or even ``the'' cause? This paper defines common terms
in debugging, highlights the principal techniques, their capabilities and

 <dc:title>Goedel Machines: Self-Referential Universal Problem Solvers Making
  Provably Optimal Self-Improvements</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present the first class of mathematically rigorous, general, fully
self-referential, self-improving, optimally efficient problem solvers. Inspired
by Kurt Goedel's celebrated self-referential formulas (1931), such a problem
solver rewrites any part of its own code as soon as it has found a proof that
the rewrite is useful, where the problem-dependent utility function and the
hardware and the entire initial code are described by axioms encoded in an
initial proof searcher which is also part of the initial code. The searcher
systematically and efficiently tests computable proof techniques (programs
whose outputs are proofs) until it finds a provably useful, computable
self-rewrite. We show that such a self-rewrite is globally optimal - no local
maxima! - since the code first had to prove that it is not useful to continue
the proof search for alternative self-rewrites. Unlike previous
non-self-referential methods based on hardwired proof searchers, ours not only
boasts an optimal order of complexity but can optimally reduce any slowdowns
hidden by the O()-notation, provided the utility of such speed-ups is provable
at all.

 <dc:description>  The main goal of Fiddle, a distributed debugging engine, is to provide a
flexible platform for developing debugging tools. Fiddle provides a layered set
of interfaces with a minimal set of debugging functionalities, for the
inspection and control of distributed and multi-threaded applications.
  This paper illustrates how Fiddle is used to support integrated testing and
debugging. The approach described is based on a tool, called Deipa, that
interprets sequences of commands read from an input file, generated by an
independent testing tool. Deipa acts as a Fiddle client, in order to enforce
specific execution paths in a distributed PVM program. Other Fiddle clients may
be used along with Deipa for the fine debugging at process level. Fiddle and
Deipa functionalities and architectures are described, and a working example
shows a step-by-step application of these tools.

 <dc:title>New Lattice Based Cryptographic Constructions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Regev, Oded</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>E.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce the use of Fourier analysis on lattices as an integral part of a
lattice based construction. The tools we develop provide an elegant description
of certain Gaussian distributions around lattice points. Our results include
two cryptographic constructions which are based on the worst-case hardness of
the unique shortest vector problem. The main result is a new public key
cryptosystem whose security guarantee is considerably stronger than previous
results ($O(n^{1.5})$ instead of $O(n^7)$). This provides the first alternative
to Ajtai and Dwork's original 1996 cryptosystem. Our second result is a family
of collision resistant hash functions which, apart from improving the security
in terms of the unique shortest vector problem, is also the first example of an
analysis which is not based on Ajtai's iterative step. Surprisingly, both
results are derived from one theorem which presents two indistinguishable
distributions on the segment $[0,1)$. It seems that this theorem can have
further applications and as an example we mention how it can be used to solve
an open problem related to quantum computation.

 <dc:description>  A situation calculus is presented that provides a solution to the frame
problem for hierarchical situations, that is, situations that have a modular
structure in which parts of the situation behave in a relatively independent
manner. This situation calculus is given in a relational, functional, and modal
logic form. Each form permits both a single level hierarchy or a multiple level
hierarchy, giving six versions of the formalism in all, and a number of
sub-versions of these. For multiple level hierarchies, it is possible to give
equations between parts of the situation to impose additional structure on the
problem. This approach is compared to others in the literature.

 <dc:title>Active Internet Traffic Filtering: Real-time Response to Denial of

 <dc:description>  Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are one of the most challenging threats to
Internet security. An attacker typically compromises a large number of
vulnerable hosts and uses them to flood the victim's site with malicious
traffic, clogging its tail circuit and interfering with normal traffic. At
present, the network operator of a site under attack has no other resolution
but to respond manually by inserting filters in the appropriate edge routers to
drop attack traffic. However, as DoS attacks become increasingly sophisticated,
manual filter propagation becomes unacceptably slow or even infeasible.
  In this paper, we present Active Internet Traffic Filtering, a new automatic
filter propagation protocol. We argue that this system provides a guaranteed,
significant level of protection against DoS attacks in exchange for a
reasonable, bounded amount of router resources. We also argue that the proposed
system cannot be abused by a malicious node to interfere with normal Internet
operation. Finally, we argue that it retains its efficiency in the face of
continued Internet growth.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework for automated bug
localization. This framework can be briefly summarized as follows. A program
execution can be represented as a rooted acyclic directed graph. We define an
execution snapshot by a cut-set on the graph. A program state can be regarded
as a conjunction of labels on edges in a cut-set. Then we argue that a
debugging task is a pruning process of the execution graph by using cut-sets. A
pruning algorithm, i.e., a debugging task, is also presented.

 <dc:description>  Performance problems are often observed in embedded software systems. The
reasons for poor performance are frequently not obvious. Bottlenecks can occur
in any of the software components along the execution path. Therefore it is
important to instrument and monitor the different components contributing to
the runtime behavior of an embedded software system. Performance analysis tools
can help locate performance bottlenecks in embedded software systems by
monitoring the software's execution and producing easily understandable
performance data. We maintain and further develop a tool for analyzing the
performance of Nokia mobile phone software. The user can select among four
performance analysis reports to be generated: average processor load, processor
utilization, task execution time statistics, and task execution timeline. Each
of these reports provides important information about where execution time is
being spent. The demo will show how the tool helps to identify performance
bottlenecks in Nokia mobile phone software and better understand areas of poor
performance.

 <dc:description>  Massive data sets have radically changed our understanding of how to design
efficient algorithms; the streaming paradigm, whether it in terms of number of
passes of an external memory algorithm, or the single pass and limited memory
of a stream algorithm, appears to be the dominant method for coping with large
data.
  A very different kind of massive computation has had the same effect at the
level of the CPU. The most prominent example is that of the computations
performed by a graphics card. The operations themselves are very simple, and
require very little memory, but require the ability to perform many
computations extremely fast and in parallel to whatever degree possible. What
has resulted is a stream processor that is highly optimized for stream
computations. An intriguing side effect of this is the growing use of a
graphics card as a general purpose stream processing engine. In an
ever-increasing array of applications, researchers are discovering that
performing a computation on a graphics card is far faster than performing it on
a CPU, and so are using a GPU as a stream co-processor.

 <dc:description>  We consider several problems relating to strongly-connected directed networks
of identical finite-state processors that work synchronously in discrete time
steps. The conceptually simplest of these is the Wake Up and Report Problem;
this is the problem of having a unique &quot;root&quot; processor send a signal to all
other processors in the network and then enter a special &quot;done&quot; state only when
all other processors have received the signal. The most difficult of the
problems we consider is the classic Firing Squad Synchronization Problem; this
is the much-studied problem of achieving macro-synchronization in a network
given micro-synchronization. We show via a complex algorithmic application of
the &quot;snake&quot; data structure first introduced in Even, Litman, and Winkler [ELW],
that these two problems are asymptotically time-equivalent up to a constant
factor. This result leads immediately to the inclusion of several other related
problems into this new asymptotic time-class.

 <dc:description>  We consider strongly-connected directed networks of identical synchronous,
finite-state processors with in- and out-degree uniformly bounded by a network
constant. Via a straightforward extension of Ostrovsky and Wilkerson's
Backwards Communication Algorithm in [OW], we exhibit a protocol which solves
the Global Topology Determination Problem, the problem of having the root
processor map the global topology of a network of unknown size and topology,
with running time O(ND) where N represents the number of processors and D
represents the diameter of the network. A simple counting argument suffices to
show that the Global Topology Determination Problem has time-complexity Omega(N
logN) which makes the protocol presented asymptotically time-optimal for many
large networks.

 <dc:description>  We apply the optimization algorithm Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) to the
problem of analyzing data on a large population and selecting the best model to
predict that an individual with various traits will have a particular disease.
We compare ASA with traditional forward and backward regression on computer
simulated data. We find that the traditional methods of modeling are better for
smaller data sets whereas a numerically stable ASA seems to perform better on
larger and more complicated data sets.

 <dc:description>  A group of senior database researchers gathers every few years to assess the
state of database research and to point out problem areas that deserve
additional focus. This report summarizes the discussion and conclusions of the
sixth ad-hoc meeting held May 4-6, 2003 in Lowell, Mass. It observes that
information management continues to be a critical component of most complex
software systems. It recommends that database researchers increase focus on:
integration of text, data, code, and streams; fusion of information from
heterogeneous data sources; reasoning about uncertain data; unsupervised data
mining for interesting correlations; information privacy; and self-adaptation
and repair.

 <dc:description>  Due to the increased complexity of parallel and distributed programs,
debugging of them is considered to be the most difficult and time consuming
part of the software lifecycle. Tool support is hence a crucial necessity to
hide complexity from the user. However, most existing tools seem inadequate as
soon as the program under consideration exploits more than a few processors
over a long execution time. This problem is addressed by the novel debugging
tool DeWiz (Debugging Wizard), whose focus lies on scalability. DeWiz has a
modular, scalable architecture, and uses the event graph model as a
representation of the investigated program. DeWiz provides a set of modules,
which can be combined to generate, analyze, and visualize event graph data.
Within this processing pipeline the toolset tries to extract useful
information, which is presented to the user at an arbitrary level of
abstraction. Additionally, DeWiz is a framework, which can be used to easily
implement arbitrary user-defined modules.

 <dc:title>On Interference of Signals and Generalization in Feedforward Neural
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rataj, Artur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies how the generalization ability of neurons can be affected
by mutual processing of different signals. This study is done on the basis of a
feedforward artificial neural network. The mutual processing of signals can
possibly be a good model of patterns in a set generalized by a neural network
and in effect may improve generalization. In this paper it is discussed that
the interference may also cause a highly random generalization. Adaptive
activation functions are discussed as a way of reducing that type of
generalization. A test of a feedforward neural network is performed that shows
the discussed random generalization.

 <dc:description>  The problem of how people find information is studied extensively; however,
the problem of how people organize, re-use, and re-find information that they
have found is not as well understood. Recently, several projects have conducted
in-situ studies to explore how people re-find and re-use information. Here, we
present results and observations from a controlled, laboratory study of
refinding information found on the web.
  Our study was conducted as a collaborative exercise with pairs of
participants. One participant acted as a retriever, helping the other
participant re-find information by telephone. This design allowed us to gain
insight into the strategies that users employed to re-find information, and
into how domain artifacts and contextual information were used to aid the
re-finding process. We also introduced the ability for users to add their own
explicitly artifacts in the form of making annotations on the web pages they
viewed.
  We observe that re-finding often occurs as a two stage, iterative process in
which users first attempt to locate an information source (search), and once
found, begin a process to find the specific information being sought (browse).
Our findings are consistent with research on waypoints; orienteering approaches
to re-finding; and navigation of electronic spaces. Furthermore, we observed
that annotations were utilized extensively, indicating that explicitly added
context by the user can play an important role in re-finding.

 <dc:description>  Spoken Language can be used to provide insights into organisational
processes, unfortunately transcription and coding stages are very time
consuming and expensive. The concept of partial transcription and coding is
proposed in which spoken language is indexed prior to any subsequent
processing. The functional linguistic theory of texture is used to describe the
effects of partial transcription on observational records. The standard used to
encode transcript context and metadata is called CHAT, but a previous XML
schema developed to implement it contains design assumptions that make it
difficult to support partial transcription for example. This paper describes a
more effective XML schema that overcomes many of these problems and is intended
for use in applications that support the rapid development of spoken language
deliverables.

 <dc:title>Debugging Tool for Localizing Faulty Processes in Message Passing

 <dc:description>  In message passing programs, once a process terminates with an unexpected
error, the terminated process can propagate the error to the rest of processes
through communication dependencies, resulting in a program failure. Therefore,
to locate faults, developers must identify the group of processes involved in
the original error and faulty processes that activate faults. This paper
presents a novel debugging tool, named MPI-PreDebugger (MPI-PD), for localizing
faulty processes in message passing programs. MPI-PD automatically
distinguishes the original and the propagated errors by checking communication
errors during program execution. If MPI-PD observes any communication errors,
it backtraces communication dependencies and points out potential faulty
processes in a timeline view. We also introduce three case studies, in which
MPI-PD has been shown to play the key role in their debugging. From these
studies, we believe that MPI-PD helps developers to locate faults and allows
them to concentrate in correcting their programs.

 <dc:title>Debugging Backwards in Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lewis, Bil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.2.5</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  By recording every state change in the run of a program, it is possible to
present the programmer every bit of information that might be desired.
Essentially, it becomes possible to debug the program by going ``backwards in
time,'' vastly simplifying the process of debugging. An implementation of this
idea, the ``Omniscient Debugger,'' is used to demonstrate its viability and has
been used successfully on a number of large programs. Integration with an event
analysis engine for searching and control is presented. Several small-scale
user studies provide encouraging results. Finally performance issues and
implementation are discussed along with possible optimizations.
  This paper makes three contributions of interest: the concept and technique
of ``going backwards in time,'' the GUI which presents a global view of the
program state and has a formal notion of ``navigation through time,'' and the
integration with an event analyzer.

 <dc:description>  Blending schemes based on circles provide smooth `fair' interpolations
between series of points. Here we demonstrate a simple, robust set of
algorithms for performing circle blends for a range of cases. An arbitrary
level of G-continuity can be achieved by simple alterations to the underlying
parameterisation. Our method exploits the computational framework provided by
conformal geometric algebra. This employs a five-dimensional representation of
points in space, in contrast to the four-dimensional representation typically
used in projective geometry. The advantage of the conformal scheme is that
straight lines and circles are treated in a single, unified framework. As a
further illustration of the power of the conformal framework, the basic idea is
extended to the case of sphere blending to interpolate over a surface.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports the findings of a study conducted on the application of an
on-line human-computer dialog system with natural language (chatbot) on the
teaching of foreign languages. A keywords-based human-computer dialog system
makes it possible that the user could chat with the computer using a natural
language, i.e. in English or in German to some extent. So an experiment has
been made using this system online to work as a chat partner with the users
learning the foreign languages. Dialogs between the users and the chatbot are
collected. Findings indicate that the dialogs between the human and the
computer are mostly very short because the user finds the responses from the
computer are mostly repeated and irrelevant with the topics and context and the
program does not understand the language at all. With analysis of the keywords
or pattern-matching mechanism used in this chatbot it can be concluded that
this kind of system can not work as a teaching assistant program in foreign
language learning.

 <dc:description>  This paper details a new algorithm to solve the shortest path problem in
valued graphs. Its complexity is $O(D \log v)$ where $D$ is the graph diameter
and $v$ its number of vertices. This complexity has to be compared to the one
of the Dijkstra's algorithm, which is $O(e\log v)$ where $e$ is the number of
edges of the graph. This new algorithm lies on a hierarchical representation of
the graph, using radix trees. The performances of this algorithm show a major
improvement over the ones of the algorithms known up to now.

 <dc:description>  Relational representation of knowledge makes it possible to perform all the
computations and decision making in a uniform relational way by means of
special relational compositions called triangle and square products. In this
paper some applications in manufacturing related to cost analysis are
described. Testing fuzzy relational structures for various relational
properties allows us to discover dependencies, hierarchies, similarities, and
equivalences of the attributes characterizing technological processes and
manufactured artifacts in their relationship to costs and performance.
  A brief overview of mathematical aspects of BK-relational products is given
in Appendix 1 together with further references in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Let $\orig{A}$ be any matrix and let $A$ be a slight random perturbation of
$\orig{A}$. We prove that it is unlikely that $A$ has large condition number.
Using this result, we prove it is unlikely that $A$ has large growth factor
under Gaussian elimination without pivoting. By combining these results, we
bound the smoothed precision needed by Gaussian elimination without pivoting.
Our results improve the average-case analysis of Gaussian elimination without
pivoting performed by Yeung and Chan (SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 1997).

 <dc:description>  Cyclic debugging requires repeatable executions. As non-deterministic or
real-time systems typically do not have the potential to provide this, special
methods are required. One such method is replay, a process that requires
monitoring of a running system and logging of the data produced by that
monitoring. We shall discuss the process of preparing the replay, a part of the
process that has not been very well described before.

 <dc:description>  Attribute grammars (AGs) are known to be a useful formalism for semantic
analysis and translation. However, debugging AGs is complex owing to inherent
difficulties of AGs, such as recursive grammar structure and attribute
dependency. In this paper, a new systematic method of debugging AGs is
proposed. Our approach is, in principle, based on previously proposed
algorithmic debugging of AGs, but is more general. This easily enables
integration of various query-based systematic debugging methods, including the
slice-based method. The proposed method has been implemented in Aki, a debugger
for AG description. We evaluated our new approach experimentally using Aki,
which demonstrates the usability of our debugging method.

 <dc:description>  We give the first exact algorithmic study of facility location problems that
deal with finding a median for a continuum of demand points. In particular, we
consider versions of the ``continuous k-median (Fermat-Weber) problem'' where
the goal is to select one or more center points that minimize the average
distance to a set of points in a demand region. In such problems, the average
is computed as an integral over the relevant region, versus the usual discrete
sum of distances. The resulting facility location problems are inherently
geometric, requiring analysis techniques of computational geometry. We provide
polynomial-time algorithms for various versions of the L1 1-median
(Fermat-Weber) problem. We also consider the multiple-center version of the L1
k-median problem, which we prove is NP-hard for large k.

 <dc:description>  Given a point query Q in multi-dimensional space, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
queries return the K closest answers according to given distance metric in the
database with respect to Q. In this scenario, it is possible that a majority of
the answers may be very similar to some other, especially when the data has
clusters. For a variety of applications, such homogeneous result sets may not
add value to the user. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing
diversity in the results of KNN queries, that is, to produce the closest result
set such that each answer is sufficiently different from the rest. We first
propose a user-tunable definition of diversity, and then present an algorithm,
called MOTLEY, for producing a diverse result set as per this definition.
Through a detailed experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data, we show
that MOTLEY can produce diverse result sets by reading only a small fraction of
the tuples in the database. Further, it imposes no additional overhead on the
evaluation of traditional KNN queries, thereby providing a seamless interface
between diversity and distance.

 <dc:description>  The I/O access patterns of many parallel applications consist of accesses to
a large number of small, noncontiguous pieces of data. If an application's I/O
needs are met by making many small, distinct I/O requests, however, the I/O
performance degrades drastically. To avoid this problem, MPI-IO allows users to
access noncontiguous data with a single I/O function call, unlike in Unix I/O.
In this paper, we explain how critical this feature of MPI-IO is for high
performance and how it enables implementations to perform optimizations. We
first provide a classification of the different ways of expressing an
application's I/O needs in MPI-IO--we classify them into four levels, called
level~0 through level~3. We demonstrate that, for applications with
noncontiguous access patterns, the I/O performance improves dramatically if
users write their applications to make level-3 requests (noncontiguous,
collective) rather than level-0 requests (Unix style). We then describe how our
MPI-IO implementation, ROMIO, delivers high performance for noncontiguous
requests. We explain in detail the two key optimizations ROMIO performs: data
sieving for noncontiguous requests from one process and collective I/O for
noncontiguous requests from multiple processes. We describe how we have
implemented these optimizations portably on multiple machines and file systems,
controlled their memory requirements, and also achieved high performance. We
demonstrate the performance and portability with performance results for three
applications--an astrophysics-application template (DIST3D), the NAS BTIO
benchmark, and an unstructured code (UNSTRUC)--on five different parallel
machines: HP Exemplar, IBM SP, Intel Paragon, NEC SX-4, and SGI Origin2000.

 <dc:title>A Particular Bug Trap: Execution Replay Using Virtual Machines</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Oppitz, Oliver</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.2.5</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Execution-replay (ER) is well known in the literature but has been restricted
to special system architectures for many years. Improved hardware resources and
the maturity of virtual machine technology promise to make ER useful for a
broader range of development projects.
  This paper describes an approach to create a practical, generic ER
infrastructure for desktop PC systems using virtual machine technology. In the
created VM environment arbitrary application programs will run and be replayed
unmodified, neither instrumentation nor recompilation are required.

 <dc:title>A weak definition of Delaunay triangulation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.3.5</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that the traditional criterion for a simplex to belong to the
Delaunay triangulation of a point set is equivalent to a criterion which is a
priori weaker. The argument is quite general; as well as the classical
Euclidean case, it applies to hyperbolic and hemispherical geometries and to
Edelsbrunner's weighted Delaunay triangulation. In spherical geometry, we
establish a similar theorem under a genericity condition. The weak definition
finds natural application in the problem of approximating a point-cloud data
set with a simplical complex.

 <dc:description>  Higher-dimensional orthogonal packing problems have a wide range of practical
applications, including packing, cutting, and scheduling. Previous efforts for
exact algorithms have been unable to avoid structural problems that appear for
instances in two- or higher-dimensional space. We present a new approach for
modeling packings, using a graph-theoretical characterization of feasible
packings. Our characterization allows it to deal with classes of packings that
share a certain combinatorial structure, instead of having to consider one
packing at a time. In addition, we can make use of elegant algorithmic
properties of certain classes of graphs. This allows our characterization to be
the basis for a successful branch-and-bound framework.
  This is the first in a series of papers describing new approaches to
higher-dimensional packing.

 <dc:title>Minimizing the stabbing number of matchings, trees, and triangulations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The (axis-parallel) stabbing number of a given set of line segments is the
maximum number of segments that can be intersected by any one (axis-parallel)
line. This paper deals with finding perfect matchings, spanning trees, or
triangulations of minimum stabbing number for a given set of points. The
complexity of these problems has been a long-standing open question; in fact,
it is one of the original 30 outstanding open problems in computational
geometry on the list by Demaine, Mitchell, and O'Rourke. The answer we provide
is negative for a number of minimum stabbing problems by showing them NP-hard
by means of a general proof technique. It implies non-trivial lower bounds on
the approximability. On the positive side we propose a cut-based integer
programming formulation for minimizing the stabbing number of matchings and
spanning trees. We obtain lower bounds (in polynomial time) from the
corresponding linear programming relaxations, and show that an optimal
fractional solution always contains an edge of at least constant weight. This
result constitutes a crucial step towards a constant-factor approximation via
an iterated rounding scheme. In computational experiments we demonstrate that
our approach allows for actually solving problems with up to several hundred
points optimally or near-optimally.

 <dc:description>  Users of database-centric Web applications, especially in the e-commerce
domain, often resort to exploratory ``trial-and-error'' queries since the
underlying data space is huge and unfamiliar, and there are several
alternatives for search attributes in this space. For example, scouting for
cheap airfares typically involves posing multiple queries, varying flight
times, dates, and airport locations. Exploratory queries are problematic from
the perspective of both the user and the server. For the database server, it
results in a drastic reduction in effective throughput since much of the
processing is duplicated in each successive query. For the client, it results
in a marked increase in response times, especially when accessing the service
through wireless channels.
  In this paper, we investigate the design of automated techniques to minimize
the need for repetitive exploratory queries. Specifically, we present SAUNA, a
server-side query relaxation algorithm that, given the user's initial range
query and a desired cardinality for the answer set, produces a relaxed query
that is expected to contain the required number of answers. The algorithm
incorporates a range-query-specific distance metric that is weighted to produce
relaxed queries of a desired shape (e.g. aspect ratio preserving), and utilizes
multi-dimensional histograms for query size estimation. A detailed performance
evaluation of SAUNA over a variety of multi-dimensional data sets indicates
that its relaxed queries can significantly reduce the costs associated with
exploratory query processing.

 <dc:description>  We present a linear-system solver that, given an $n$-by-$n$ symmetric
positive semi-definite, diagonally dominant matrix $A$ with $m$ non-zero
entries and an $n$-vector $\bb $, produces a vector $\xxt$ within relative
distance $\epsilon$ of the solution to $A \xx = \bb$ in time $O (m^{1.31} \log
(n \kappa_{f} (A)/\epsilon)^{O (1)})$, where $\kappa_{f} (A)$ is the log of the
ratio of the largest to smallest non-zero eigenvalue of $A$. In particular,
$\log (\kappa_{f} (A)) = O (b \log n)$, where $b$ is the logarithm of the ratio
of the largest to smallest non-zero entry of $A$. If the graph of $A$ has genus
$m^{2\theta}$ or does not have a $K_{m^{\theta}} $ minor, then the exponent of
$m$ can be improved to the minimum of $1 + 5 \theta $ and $(9/8) (1+\theta)$.
The key contribution of our work is an extension of Vaidya's techniques for
constructing and analyzing combinatorial preconditioners.

 <dc:description>  We consider a facility location problem, where the objective is to
``disperse'' a number of facilities, i.e., select a given number k of locations
from a discrete set of n candidates, such that the average distance between
selected locations is maximized. In particular, we present algorithmic results
for the case where vertices are represented by points in d-dimensional space,
and edge weights correspond to rectilinear distances. Problems of this type
have been considered before, with the best result being an approximation
algorithm with performance ratio 2. For the case where k is fixed, we establish
a linear-time algorithm that finds an optimal solution. For the case where k is
part of the input, we present a polynomial-time approximation scheme.

 <dc:description>  Data mining services require accurate input data for their results to be
meaningful, but privacy concerns may influence users to provide spurious
information. To encourage users to provide correct inputs, we recently proposed
a data distortion scheme for association rule mining that simultaneously
provides both privacy to the user and accuracy in the mining results. However,
mining the distorted database can be orders of magnitude more time-consuming as
compared to mining the original database. In this paper, we address this issue
and demonstrate that by (a) generalizing the distortion process to perform
symbol-specific distortion, (b) appropriately choosing the distortion
parameters, and (c) applying a variety of optimizations in the reconstruction
process, runtime efficiencies that are well within an order of magnitude of
undistorted mining can be achieved.

a text collection consisting of Greek texts showed that the algorithm achieves
high segmentation accuracy and appears to be very innovating and promissing.

 <dc:description>  In order to design and implement tracers, one must decide what exactly to
trace and how to produce this trace. On the one hand, trace designs are too
often guided by implementation concerns and are not as useful as they should
be. On the other hand, an interesting trace which cannot be produced
efficiently, is not very useful either. In this article we propose a
methodology which helps to efficiently produce accurate traces. Firstly, design
a formal specification of the trace model. Secondly, derive a prototype tracer
from this specification. Thirdly, analyze the produced traces. Fourthly,
implement an efficient tracer. Lastly, compare the traces of the two tracers.
At each step, problems can be found. In that case one has to iterate the
process. We have successfully applied the proposed methodology to the design
and implementation of a real tracer for constraint logic programming which is
able to efficiently generate information required to build interesting
graphical views of executions.

 <dc:description>  Generally, in the financial literature, the notion of quadratic VaR is
implicitly confused with the Delta-Gamma VaR, because more authors dealt with
portfolios that contains derivatives instruments.
  In this paper, we postpone to estimate the Value-at-Risk of a quadratic
portfolio of securities (i.e equities) without the Delta and Gamma greeks, when
the joint log-returns changes with multivariate elliptic distribution. We have
reduced the estimation of the quadratic VaR of such portfolio to a resolution
of one dimensional integral equation. To illustrate our method, we give special
attention to the mixture of normal and mixture of t-student distribution. For
given VaR, when joint Risk Factors changes with elliptic distribution, we show
how to estimate an Expected Shortfall .

 <dc:title>The Algebra of Utility Inference</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>J.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Richard Cox [1] set the axiomatic foundations of probable inference and the
algebra of propositions. He showed that consistency within these axioms
requires certain rules for updating belief. In this paper we use the analogy
between probability and utility introduced in [2] to propose an axiomatic
foundation for utility inference and the algebra of preferences. We show that
consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating preference.
We discuss a class of utility functions that stems from the axioms of utility
inference and show that this class is the basic building block for any general
multiattribute utility function. We use this class of utility functions
together with the algebra of preferences to construct utility functions
represented by logical operations on the attributes.

 <dc:title>An information theory for preferences</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>J.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent literature in the last Maximum Entropy workshop introduced an analogy
between cumulative probability distributions and normalized utility functions.
Based on this analogy, a utility density function can de defined as the
derivative of a normalized utility function. A utility density function is
non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties form the basis of a
correspondence between utility and probability. A natural application of this
analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility
values. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions
based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps
assign utility values based on partial preference information. This paper
reviews maximum entropy utility and introduces further results that stem from
the duality between probability and utility.

 <dc:description>  A theory of one-tape (one-head) linear-time Turing machines is essentially
different from its polynomial-time counterpart since these machines are closely
related to finite state automata. This paper discusses structural-complexity
issues of one-tape Turing machines of various types (deterministic,
nondeterministic, reversible, alternating, probabilistic, counting, and quantum
Turing machines) that halt in linear time, where the running time of a machine
is defined as the length of any longest computation path. We explore structural
properties of one-tape linear-time Turing machines and clarify how the
machines' resources affect their computational patterns and power.

 <dc:description>  Abduction, first proposed in the setting of classical logics, has been
studied with growing interest in the logic programming area during the last
years.
  In this paper we study abduction with penalization in the logic programming
framework. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously
analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant
problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal
model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the
abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge
representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive
framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from
different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning;
their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We
thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in
the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we
implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the
DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with
penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this
approach is sound and complete.

 <dc:description>  Business systems these days need to be agile to address the needs of a
changing world. In particular the discipline of Enterprise Application
Integration requires business process management to be highly reconfigurable
with the ability to support dynamic workflows, inter-application integration
and process reconfiguration. Basing EAI systems on model-resident or on a
so-called description-driven approach enables aspects of flexibility,
distribution, system evolution and integration to be addressed in a
domain-independent manner. Such a system called CRISTAL is described in this
paper with particular emphasis on its application to EAI problem domains. A
practical example of the CRISTAL technology in the domain of manufacturing
systems, called Agilium, is described to demonstrate the principles of
model-driven system evolution and integration. The approach is compared to
other model-driven development approaches such as the Model-Driven Architecture
of the OMG and so-called Adaptive Object Models.

 <dc:description>  The structure of large networks can be revealed by partitioning them to
smaller parts, which are easier to handle. One of such decompositions is based
on $k$--cores, proposed in 1983 by Seidman. In the paper an efficient, $O(m)$,
$m$ is the number of lines, algorithm for determining the cores decomposition
of a given network is presented.

 <dc:title>Feedforward Neural Networks with Diffused Nonlinear Weight Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rataj, Artur</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, feedforward neural networks are presented that have nonlinear
weight functions based on look--up tables, that are specially smoothed in a
regularization called the diffusion. The idea of such a type of networks is
based on the hypothesis that the greater number of adaptive parameters per a
weight function might reduce the total number of the weight functions needed to
solve a given problem. Then, if the computational complexity of a propagation
through a single such a weight function would be kept low, then the introduced
neural networks might possibly be relatively fast.
  A number of tests is performed, showing that the presented neural networks
may indeed perform better in some cases than the classic neural networks and a
number of other learning machines.

 <dc:description>  In the paper we discuss how to share the secrets, that are graphs. So, far
secret sharing schemes were designed to work with numbers. As the first step,
we propose conditions for &quot;graph to number&quot; conversion methods. Hence, the
existing schemes can be used, without weakening their properties. Next, we show
how graph properties can be used to extend capabilities of secret sharing
schemes. This leads to proposal of using such properties for number based
secret sharing.

 <dc:description>  At the beginning some results from the field of graph theory are presented.
Next we show how to share a secret that is proper n-coloring of the graph, with
the known structure. The graph is described and converted to the form, where
colors assigned to vertices form the number with entries from Zn. A secret
sharing scheme (SSS) for the graph coloring is proposed. The proposed method is
applied to the public-key cryptosystem called &quot;Polly Cracker&quot;. In this case the
graph structure is a public key, while proper 3-colouring of the graph is a
private key. We show how to share the private key. Sharing particular
n-coloring (color-to-vertex assignment) for the known-structure graph is
presented next.

basic calculus, discuss some related theories and present the most important
models of KAD. We demonstrate applicability by two examples: First, an
algebraic reconstruction of Noethericity and well-foundedness; second, an
algebraic reconstruction of propositional Hoare logic.

 <dc:description>  Mace4 is a program that searches for finite models of first-order formulas.
For a given domain size, all instances of the formulas over the domain are
constructed. The result is a set of ground clauses with equality. Then, a
decision procedure based on ground equational rewriting is applied. If
satisfiability is detected, one or more models are printed. Mace4 is a useful
complement to first-order theorem provers, with the prover searching for proofs
and Mace4 looking for countermodels, and it is useful for work on finite
algebras. Mace4 performs better on equational problems than did our previous
model-searching program Mace2.

 <dc:description>  Special technologies need to be used to take advantage of, and overcome, the
challenges associated with acquiring, transforming, storing, processing, and
distributing spoken language resources in organisations. This paper introduces
an application architecture consisting of tools and supporting utilities for
indexing and transcription, and describes how these tools, together with
downstream processing and distribution systems, can be integrated into a
workflow. Two sample applications for this architecture are outlined- the
analysis of decision-making processes in organisations and the deployment of
systems development methods by designers in the field.

 <dc:description>  For several years, MPI has been the de facto standard for writing parallel
applications. One of the most popular MPI implementations is MPICH. Its
successor, MPICH2, features a completely new design that provides more
performance and flexibility. To ensure portability, it has a hierarchical
structure based on which porting can be done at different levels. In this
paper, we present our experiences designing and implementing MPICH2 over
InfiniBand. Because of its high performance and open standard, InfiniBand is
gaining popularity in the area of high-performance computing. Our study focuses
on optimizing the performance of MPI-1 functions in MPICH2. One of our
objectives is to exploit Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) in Infiniband to
achieve high performance. We have based our design on the RDMA Channel
interface provided by MPICH2, which encapsulates architecture-dependent
communication functionalities into a very small set of functions. Starting with
a basic design, we apply different optimizations and also propose a
zero-copy-based design. We characterize the impact of our optimizations and
designs using microbenchmarks. We have also performed an application-level
evaluation using the NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Our optimized MPICH2
implementation achieves 7.6 $\mu$s latency and 857 MB/s bandwidth, which are
close to the raw performance of the underlying InfiniBand layer. Our study
shows that the RDMA Channel interface in MPICH2 provides a simple, yet
powerful, abstraction that enables implementations with high performance by
exploiting RDMA operations in InfiniBand. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first high-performance design and implementation of MPICH2 on InfiniBand
using RDMA support.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this note, we present a puzzle. We prove that Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
is inconsistent by proving, using Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, the false
statement that any algorithm that determines whether any $n \times n$ matrix
over $\mathbb F_2$, the finite field of order 2, is nonsingular must run in
exponential time in the worst-case scenario. The object of the puzzle is to
find the error in the proof.

 <dc:description>  We study local-search satisfiability solvers for propositional logic extended
with cardinality atoms, that is, expressions that provide explicit ways to
model constraints on cardinalities of sets. Adding cardinality atoms to the
language of propositional logic facilitates modeling search problems and often
results in concise encodings. We propose two ``native'' local-search solvers
for theories in the extended language. We also describe techniques to reduce
the problem to standard propositional satisfiability and allow us to use
off-the-shelf SAT solvers. We study these methods experimentally. Our general
finding is that native solvers designed specifically for the extended language
perform better than indirect methods relying on SAT solvers.

 <dc:description>  We investigate mca-programs, that is, logic programs with clauses built of
monotone cardinality atoms of the form kX, where k is a non-negative integer
and X is a finite set of propositional atoms. We develop a theory of
mca-programs. We demonstrate that the operational concept of the one-step
provability operator generalizes to mca-programs, but the generalization
involves nondeterminism. Our main results show that the formalism of
mca-programs is a common generalization of (1) normal logic programming with
its semantics of models, supported models and stable models, (2) logic
programming with cardinality atoms and with the semantics of stable models, as
defined by Niemela, Simons and Soininen, and (3) of disjunctive logic
programming with the possible-model semantics of Sakama and Inoue.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we bring together the areas of combinatorics and propositional
satisfiability. Many combinatorial theorems establish, often constructively,
the existence of positive integer functions, without actually providing their
closed algebraic form or tight lower and upper bounds. The area of Ramsey
theory is especially rich in such results. Using the problem of computing van
der Waerden numbers as an example, we show that these problems can be
represented by parameterized propositional theories in such a way that
decisions concerning their satisfiability determine the numbers (function) in
question. We show that by using general-purpose complete and local-search
techniques for testing propositional satisfiability, this approach becomes
effective -- competitive with specialized approaches. By following it, we were
able to obtain several new results pertaining to the problem of computing van
der Waerden numbers. We also note that due to their properties, especially
their structural simplicity and computational hardness, propositional theories
that arise in this research can be of use in development, testing and
benchmarking of SAT solvers.

 <dc:description>  We introduce top trees as a design of a new simpler interface for data
structures maintaining information in a fully-dynamic forest. We demonstrate
how easy and versatile they are to use on a host of different applications. For
example, we show how to maintain the diameter, center, and median of each tree
in the forest. The forest can be updated by insertion and deletion of edges and
by changes to vertex and edge weights. Each update is supported in O(log n)
time, where n is the size of the tree(s) involved in the update. Also, we show
how to support nearest common ancestor queries and level ancestor queries with
respect to arbitrary roots in O(log n) time. Finally, with marked and unmarked
vertices, we show how to compute distances to a nearest marked vertex. The
later has applications to approximate nearest marked vertex in general graphs,
and thereby to static optimization problems over shortest path metrics.
  Technically speaking, top trees are easily implemented either with
Frederickson's topology trees [Ambivalent Data Structures for Dynamic
2-Edge-Connectivity and k Smallest Spanning Trees, SIAM J. Comput. 26 (2) pp.
484-538, 1997] or with Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic trees [A Data Structure for
Dynamic Trees. J. Comput. Syst. Sc. 26 (3) pp. 362-391, 1983]. However, we
claim that the interface is simpler for many applications, and indeed our new
bounds are quadratic improvements over previous bounds where they exist.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we outline an approach of applying model-based diagnosis to the
field of automatic software debugging of hardware designs. We present our
value-level model for debugging VHDL-RTL designs and show how to localize the
erroneous component responsible for an observed misbehavior. Furthermore, we
discuss an extension of our model that supports the debugging of sequential
circuits, not only at a given point in time, but also allows for considering
the temporal behavior of VHDL-RTL designs. The introduced model is capable of
handling state inherently present in every sequential circuit. The principal
applicability of the new model is outlined briefly and we use industrial-sized
real world examples from the ISCAS'85 benchmark suite to discuss the
scalability of our approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper illustrates how a Prolog program, using chronological backtracking
to find a solution in some search space, can be enhanced to perform intelligent
backtracking. The enhancement crucially relies on the impurity of Prolog that
allows a program to store information when a dead end is reached. To illustrate
the technique, a simple search program is enhanced.

  Keywords: intelligent backtracking, dependency-directed backtracking,
backjumping, conflict-directed backjumping, nogood sets, look-back.

 <dc:title>On The Cost Distribution of a Memory Bound Function</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Memory Bound Functions have been proposed for fighting spam, resisting Sybil
attacks and other purposes. A particular implementation of such functions has
been proposed in which the average effort required to generate a proof of
effort is set by parameters E and l to E * l. The distribution of effort
required to generate an individual proof about this average is fairly broad.
When particular uses of these functions are envisaged, the choice of E and l,
and the system design surrounding the generation and verification of proofs of
effort, need to take the breadth of the distribution into account.
  We show the distribution for this implementation, discuss the system design
issues in the context of two proposed applications, and suggest an improved
implementation.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an exploratory study of college-age students using
two-way, push-to-talk cellular radios. We describe the observed and reported
use of cellular radio by the participants. We discuss how the half-duplex,
lightweight cellular radio communication was associated with reduced
interactional commitment, which meant the cellular radios could be used for a
wide range of conversation styles. One such style, intermittent conversation,
is characterized by response delays. Intermittent conversation is surprising in
an audio medium, since it is typically associated with textual media such as
instant messaging. We present design implications of our findings.

 <dc:title>Parametric Connectives in Disjunctive Logic Programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Disjunctive Logic Programming (\DLP) is an advanced formalism for Knowledge
Representation and Reasoning (KRR). \DLP is very expressive in a precise
mathematical sense: it allows to express every property of finite structures
that is decidable in the complexity class $\SigmaP{2}$ ($\NP^{\NP}$).
Importantly, the \DLP encodings are often simple and natural.
  In this paper, we single out some limitations of \DLP for KRR, which cannot
naturally express problems where the size of the disjunction is not known ``a
priori'' (like N-Coloring), but it is part of the input. To overcome these
limitations, we further enhance the knowledge modelling abilities of \DLP, by
extending this language by {\em Parametric Connectives (OR and AND)}. These
connectives allow us to represent compactly the disjunction/conjunction of a
set of atoms having a given property. We formally define the semantics of the
new language, named $DLP^{\bigvee,\bigwedge}$ and we show the usefulness of the
new constructs on relevant knowledge-based problems. We address implementation
issues and discuss related works.

 <dc:description>  Argumentation has proved a useful tool in defining formal semantics for
assumption-based reasoning by viewing a proof as a process in which proponents
and opponents attack each others arguments by undercuts (attack to an
argument's premise) and rebuts (attack to an argument's conclusion). In this
paper, we formulate a variety of notions of attack for extended logic programs
from combinations of undercuts and rebuts and define a general hierarchy of
argumentation semantics parameterised by the notions of attack chosen by
proponent and opponent. We prove the equivalence and subset relationships
between the semantics and examine some essential properties concerning
consistency and the coherence principle, which relates default negation and
explicit negation. Most significantly, we place existing semantics put forward
in the literature in our hierarchy and identify a particular argumentation
semantics for which we prove equivalence to the paraconsistent well-founded
semantics with explicit negation, WFSX$_p$. Finally, we present a general proof
theory, based on dialogue trees, and show that it is sound and complete with
respect to the argumentation semantics.

 <dc:description>  A numerical method to solve the fractional diffusion equation, which could
also be easily extended to many other fractional dynamics equations, is
considered. These fractional equations have been proposed in order to describe
anomalous transport characterized by non-Markovian kinetics and the breakdown
of Fick's law. In this paper we combine the forward time centered space (FTCS)
method, well known for the numerical integration of ordinary diffusion
equations, with the Grunwald-Letnikov definition of the fractional derivative
operator to obtain an explicit fractional FTCS scheme for solving the
fractional diffusion equation. The resulting method is amenable to a stability
analysis a la von Neumann. We show that the analytical stability bounds are in
excellent agreement with numerical tests. Comparison between exact analytical
solutions and numerical predictions are made.

 <dc:description>  We suggest that 'axial lines' defined by (Hillier and Hanson, 1984) as lines
of uninterrupted movement within urban streetscapes or buildings, appear as
ridges in isovist fields (Benedikt, 1979). These are formed from the maximum
diametric lengths of the individual isovists, sometimes called viewsheds, that
make up these fields (Batty and Rana, 2004). We present an image processing
technique for the identification of lines from ridges, discuss current
strengths and weaknesses of the method, and show how it can be implemented
easily and effectively.

 <dc:description>  Flooding provides important control and route establishment functionality for
a number of unicast and multicast protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks.
Considering its wide use as a building block for other network layer protocols,
the flooding methodology should deliver a packet from one node to all other
network nodes using as few messages as possible. In this paper, we propose the
Optimized Flooding Protocol (OFP), based on a variation of The Covering Problem
that is encountered in geometry, to minimize the unnecessary transmissions
drastically and still be able to cover the whole region. OFP does not need
hello messages and hence OFP saves a significant amount of wireless bandwidth
and incurs lesser overhead. We present simulation results to show the
efficiency of OFP in both ideal cases and randomly distributed networks.
Moreover, OFP is scalable with respect to density; in fact OFP requires lesser
number of transmissions at higher densities. OFP is also resilient to
transmission errors.

 <dc:description>  Various optimality properties of universal sequence predictors based on
Bayes-mixtures in general, and Solomonoff's prediction scheme in particular,
will be studied. The probability of observing $x_t$ at time $t$, given past
observations $x_1...x_{t-1}$ can be computed with the chain rule if the true
generating distribution $\mu$ of the sequences $x_1x_2x_3...$ is known. If
$\mu$ is unknown, but known to belong to a countable or continuous class $\M$
one can base ones prediction on the Bayes-mixture $\xi$ defined as a
$w_\nu$-weighted sum or integral of distributions $\nu\in\M$. The cumulative
expected loss of the Bayes-optimal universal prediction scheme based on $\xi$
is shown to be close to the loss of the Bayes-optimal, but infeasible
prediction scheme based on $\mu$. We show that the bounds are tight and that no
other predictor can lead to significantly smaller bounds. Furthermore, for
various performance measures, we show Pareto-optimality of $\xi$ and give an
Occam's razor argument that the choice $w_\nu\sim 2^{-K(\nu)}$ for the weights
is optimal, where $K(\nu)$ is the length of the shortest program describing
$\nu$. The results are applied to games of chance, defined as a sequence of
bets, observations, and rewards. The prediction schemes (and bounds) are
compared to the popular predictors based on expert advice. Extensions to
infinite alphabets, partial, delayed and probabilistic prediction,
classification, and more active systems are briefly discussed.

 <dc:title>Generic and Efficient Program Monitoring by trace analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Program execution monitoring consists of checking whole executions for given
properties in order to collect global run-time information.
  Monitoring is very useful to maintain programs. However, application
developers face the following dilemma: either they use existing tools which
never exactly fit their needs, or they invest a lot of effort to implement
monitoring code.
  In this article we argue that, when an event-oriented tracer exists, the
compiler developers can enable the application developers to easily code their
own, relevant, monitors which will run efficiently.
  We propose a high-level operator, called foldt, which operates on execution
traces. One of the key advantages of our approach is that it allows a clean
separation of concerns; the definition of monitors is neither intertwined in
the user source code nor in the language compiler.
  We give a number of applications of the foldt operator to compute monitors
for Mercury program executions: execution profiles, graphical abstract views,
and two test coverage measurements. Each example is implemented by a few simple
lines of Mercury.
  Detailed measurements show acceptable performance of the basic mechanism of
foldt for executions of several millions of execution events.

 <dc:description>  We propose an alternative way to represent graphs via OBDDs based on the
observation that a partition of the graph nodes allows sharing among the
employed OBDDs. In the second part of the paper we present a method to compute
at the same time the quotient w.r.t. the maximum bisimulation and the OBDD
representation of a given graph. The proposed computation is based on an
OBDD-rewriting of the notion of Ackermann encoding of hereditarily finite sets
into natural numbers.

 <dc:description>  Deterministic replay is a method for allowing complex multitasking real-time
systems to be debugged using standard interactive debuggers. Even though
several replay techniques have been proposed for parallel, multi-tasking and
real-time systems, the solutions have so far lingered on a prototype academic
level, with very little results to show from actual state-of-the-practice
commercial applications. This paper describes a major deterministic replay
debugging case study performed on a full-scale industrial robot control system,
as well as a minor replay instrumentation case study performed on a military
aircraft radar system. In this article, we will show that replay debugging is
feasible in complex multi-million lines of code software projects running on
top of off-the-shelf real-time operating systems. Furthermore, we will discuss
how replay debugging can be introduced in existing systems without
impracticable analysis efforts. In addition, we will present benchmarking
results from both studies, indicating that the instrumentation overhead is
acceptable and affordable.

 <dc:description>  We address a fundamental problem arising from analysis of biomolecular
sequences. The input consists of two numbers $w_{\min}$ and $w_{\max}$ and a
sequence $S$ of $n$ number pairs $(a_i,w_i)$ with $w_i&gt;0$. Let {\em segment}
$S(i,j)$ of $S$ be the consecutive subsequence of $S$ between indices $i$ and
$j$. The {\em density} of $S(i,j)$ is
$d(i,j)=(a_i+a_{i+1}+...+a_j)/(w_i+w_{i+1}+...+w_j)$. The {\em maximum-density
segment problem} is to find a maximum-density segment over all segments
$S(i,j)$ with $w_{\min}\leq w_i+w_{i+1}+...+w_j \leq w_{\max}$. The best
previously known algorithm for the problem, due to Goldwasser, Kao, and Lu,
runs in $O(n\log(w_{\max}-w_{\min}+1))$ time. In the present paper, we solve
the problem in O(n) time. Our approach bypasses the complicated {\em right-skew
decomposition}, introduced by Lin, Jiang, and Chao. As a result, our algorithm
has the capability to process the input sequence in an online manner, which is
an important feature for dealing with genome-scale sequences. Moreover, for a
type of input sequences $S$ representable in $O(m)$ space, we show how to
exploit the sparsity of $S$ and solve the maximum-density segment problem for
$S$ in $O(m)$ time.

 <dc:title>Temporalized logics and automata for time granularity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Suitable extensions of the monadic second-order theory of k successors have
been proposed in the literature to capture the notion of time granularity. In
this paper, we provide the monadic second-order theories of downward unbounded
layered structures, which are infinitely refinable structures consisting of a
coarsest domain and an infinite number of finer and finer domains, and of
upward unbounded layered structures, which consist of a finest domain and an
infinite number of coarser and coarser domains, with expressively complete and
elementarily decidable temporal logic counterparts.
  We obtain such a result in two steps. First, we define a new class of
combined automata, called temporalized automata, which can be proved to be the
automata-theoretic counterpart of temporalized logics, and show that relevant
properties, such as closure under Boolean operations, decidability, and
expressive equivalence with respect to temporal logics, transfer from component
automata to temporalized ones. Then, we exploit the correspondence between
temporalized logics and automata to reduce the task of finding the temporal
logic counterparts of the given theories of time granularity to the easier one
of finding temporalized automata counterparts of them.

 <dc:description>  In this tool demonstration, we give an overview of the Chameleon type
debugger. The type debugger's primary use is to identify locations within a
source program which are involved in a type error. By further examining these
(potentially) problematic program locations, users gain a better understanding
of their program and are able to work towards the actual mistake which was the
cause of the type error. The debugger is interactive, allowing the user to
provide additional information to narrow down the search space. One of the
novel aspects of the debugger is the ability to explain erroneous-looking
types. In the event that an unexpected type is inferred, the debugger can
highlight program locations which contributed to that result. Furthermore, due
to the flexible constraint-based foundation that the debugger is built upon, it
can naturally handle advanced type system features such as Haskell's type
classes and functional dependencies.

 <dc:description>  The research field of Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) aims to find
abstractions, languages, methodologies and toolkits for modeling, verifying,
validating and prototyping complex applications conceptualized as Multiagent
Systems (MASs). A very lively research sub-field studies how formal methods can
be used for AOSE. This paper presents a detailed survey of six logic-based
executable agent specification languages that have been chosen for their
potential to be integrated in our ARPEGGIO project, an open framework for
specifying and prototyping a MAS. The six languages are ConGoLog, Agent-0, the
IMPACT agent programming language, DyLog, Concurrent METATEM and Ehhf. For each
executable language, the logic foundations are described and an example of use
is shown. A comparison of the six languages and a survey of similar approaches
complete the paper, together with considerations of the advantages of using
logic-based languages in MAS modeling and prototyping.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe our work on enabling fine-grained authorization for
resource usage and management. We address the need of virtual organizations to
enforce their own polices in addition to those of the resource owners, in
regard to both resource consumption and job management. To implement this
design, we propose changes and extensions to the Globus Toolkit's version 2
resource management mechanism. We describe the prototype and the policy
language that we designed to express fine-grained policies, and we present an
analysis of our solution.

 <dc:description>  We propose a generalization of expected utility that we call generalized EU
(GEU), where a decision maker's beliefs are represented by plausibility
measures, and the decision maker's tastes are represented by general (i.e.,not
necessarily real-valued) utility functions. We show that every agent,
``rational'' or not, can be modeled as a GEU maximizer. We then show that we
can customize GEU by selectively imposing just the constraints we want. In
particular, we show how each of Savage's postulates corresponds to constraints
on GEU.

 <dc:description>  This paper adds counterfactuals to the framework of knowledge-based programs
of Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and Vardi. The use of counterfactuals is illustrated
by designing a protocol in which an agent stops sending messages once it knows
that it is safe to do so. Such behavior is difficult to capture in the original
framework because it involves reasoning about counterfactual executions,
including ones that are not consistent with the protocol. Attempts to formalize
these notions without counterfactuals are shown to lead to rather
counterintuitive behavior.

 <dc:description>  Multimodal interfaces are becoming increasingly ubiquitous with the advent of
mobile devices, accessibility considerations, and novel software technologies
that combine diverse interaction media. In addition to improving access and
delivery capabilities, such interfaces enable flexible and personalized dialogs
with websites, much like a conversation between humans. In this paper, we
present a software framework for multimodal web interaction management that
supports mixed-initiative dialogs between users and websites. A
mixed-initiative dialog is one where the user and the website take turns
changing the flow of interaction. The framework supports the functional
specification and realization of such dialogs using staging transformations --
a theory for representing and reasoning about dialogs based on partial input.
It supports multiple interaction interfaces, and offers sessioning, caching,
and co-ordination functions through the use of an interaction manager. Two case
studies are presented to illustrate the promise of this approach.

 <dc:title>Set K-Cover Algorithms for Energy Efficient Monitoring in Wireless

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are emerging as an effective means for
environment monitoring. This paper investigates a strategy for energy efficient
monitoring in WSNs that partitions the sensors into covers, and then activates
the covers iteratively in a round-robin fashion. This approach takes advantage
of the overlap created when many sensors monitor a single area. Our work builds
upon previous work in &quot;Power Efficient Organization of Wireless Sensor
Networks&quot; by Slijepcevic and Potkonjak, where the model is first formulated. We
have designed three approximation algorithms for a variation of the SET K-COVER
problem, where the objective is to partition the sensors into covers such that
the number of covers that include an area, summed over all areas, is maximized.
The first algorithm is randomized and partitions the sensors, in expectation,
within a fraction 1 - 1/e (~.63) of the optimum. We present two other
deterministic approximation algorithms. One is a distributed greedy algorithm
with a 1/2 approximation ratio and the other is a centralized greedy algorithm
with a 1 - 1/e approximation ratio. We show that it is NP-Complete to guarantee
better than 15/16 of the optimal coverage, indicating that all three algorithms
perform well with respect to the best approximation algorithm possible.
Simulations indicate that in practice, the deterministic algorithms perform far
above their worst case bounds, consistently covering more than 72% of what is
covered by an optimum solution. Simulations also indicate that the increase in
longevity is proportional to the amount of overlap amongst the sensors. The
algorithms are fast, easy to use, and according to simulations, significantly
increase the longevity of sensor networks. The randomized algorithm in
particular seems quite practical.

 <dc:title>Towards an Intelligent Database System Founded on the SP Theory of

 <dc:description>  The SP theory of computing and cognition, described in previous publications,
is an attractive model for intelligent databases because it provides a simple
but versatile format for different kinds of knowledge, it has capabilities in
artificial intelligence, and it can also function like established database
models when that is required.
  This paper describes how the SP model can emulate other models used in
database applications and compares the SP model with those other models. The
artificial intelligence capabilities of the SP model are reviewed and its
relationship with other artificial intelligence systems is described. Also
considered are ways in which current prototypes may be translated into an
'industrial strength' working system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we would like to present a very short (possibly the shortest)
self-interpreter, based on a simplistic Turing-complete imperative language.
This interpreter explicitly processes the statements of the language, which
means the interpreter constitutes a description of the language inside that

experience in programming and a vivid imagination are beneficial.

 <dc:description>  Conventional visualization media such as MRI prints and computer screens are
inherently two dimensional, making them incapable of displaying true 3D volume
data sets. By applying only transparency or intensity projection, and ignoring
light-matter interaction, results will likely fail to give optimal results.
Little research has been done on using reflectance functions to visually
separate the various segments of a MRI volume. We will explore if applying
specific reflectance functions to individual anatomical structures can help in
building an intuitive 2D image from a 3D dataset. We will test our hypothesis
by visualizing a statistical analysis of the genetic influences on variations
in human brain morphology because it inherently contains complex and many
different types of data making it a good candidate for our approach

both voice and data access are all examples of communicating devices that uses
wireless communication. Sine TCP/IP (and UDP) is the dominant technology in use
in the internet, it is expected that they will be used (and they are currently)
over wireless connections. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the
TCP (and UDP) over IEEE802.11 wireless MAC protocol. We investigate the
performance of the TCP and UDP assuming three different traffic patterns. First
bulk transmission where the main concern is the throughput. Second real-time
audio (using UDP) in the existence of bulk TCP transmission where the main
concern is the packet loss for audio traffic. Finally web traffic where the
main concern is the response time. We also investigate the effect of using
forward Error Correction (FEC) technique and the MAC sublayer parameters on the
throughput and response time.

 <dc:description>  Frequency counts are a measure of how much use a language makes of a
linguistic unit, such as a phoneme or word. However, what is often important is
not the units themselves, but the contrasts between them. A measure is
therefore needed for how much use a language makes of a contrast, i.e. the
functional load (FL) of the contrast. We generalize previous work in
linguistics and speech recognition and propose a family of measures for the FL
of several phonological contrasts, including phonemic oppositions, distinctive
features, suprasegmentals, and phonological rules. We then test it for
robustness to changes of corpora. Finally, we provide examples in Cantonese,
Dutch, English, German and Mandarin, in the context of historical linguistics,
language acquisition and speech recognition. More information can be found at

 <dc:description>  This paper describes an interactive tool that facilitates following
define-use chains in large codes. The motivation for the work is to support
relative debugging, where it is necessary to iteratively refine a set of
asser-tions between different versions of a program. DUCT is novel because it
exploits the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) that underpins the .NET
Framework. Accordingly, it works on a wide range of programming languages
without any modification. The paper describes the design and implementation of
DUCT, and then illustrates its use with a small case study.

 <dc:description>  We define XPathLog as a Datalog-style extension of XPath. XPathLog provides a
clear, declarative language for querying and manipulating XML whose
perspectives are especially in XML data integration. In our characterization,
the formal semantics is defined wrt. an edge-labeled graph-based model which
covers the XML data model. We give a complete, logic-based characterization of
XML data and the main language concept for XML, XPath. XPath-Logic extends the
XPath language with variable bindings and embeds it into first-order logic.
XPathLog is then the Horn fragment of XPath-Logic, providing a Datalog-style,
rule-based language for querying and manipulating XML data. The model-theoretic
semantics of XPath-Logic serves as the base of XPathLog as a logic-programming
language, whereas also an equivalent answer-set semantics for evaluating
XPathLog queries is given. In contrast to other approaches, the XPath syntax
and semantics is also used for a declarative specification how the database
should be updated: when used in rule heads, XPath filters are interpreted as
specifications of elements and properties which should be added to the
database.

 <dc:description>  In the m-out-of-n oblivious transfer (OT) model, one party Alice sends n bits
to another party Bob, Bob can get only m bits from the n bits. However, Alice
cannot know which m bits Bob received. Y.Mu[MJV02]} and Naor[Naor01] presented
classical m-out-of-n oblivious transfer based on discrete logarithm. As the
work of Shor [Shor94], the discrete logarithm can be solved in polynomial time
by quantum computers, so such OTs are unsafe to the quantum computer. In this
paper, we construct a quantum m-out-of-n OT (QOT) scheme based on the
transmission of polarized light and show that the scheme is robust to general
attacks, i.e. the QOT scheme satisfies statistical correctness and statistical
privacy.

 <dc:description>  Debuggers for logic programming languages have traditionally had a capability
most other debuggers did not: the ability to jump back to a previous state of
the program, effectively travelling back in time in the history of the
computation. This ``retry'' capability is very useful, allowing programmers to
examine in detail a part of the computation that they previously stepped over.
Unfortunately, it also creates a problem: while the debugger may be able to
restore the previous values of variables, it cannot restore the part of the
program's state that is affected by I/O operations. If the part of the
computation being jumped back over performs I/O, then the program will perform
these I/O operations twice, which will result in unwanted effects ranging from
the benign (e.g. output appearing twice) to the fatal (e.g. trying to close an
already closed file). We present a simple mechanism for ensuring that every I/O
action called for by the program is executed at most once, even if the
programmer asks the debugger to travel back in time from after the action to
before the action. The overhead of this mechanism is low enough and can be
controlled well enough to make it practical to use it to debug computations
that do significant amounts of I/O.

 <dc:description>  The increase in the amount of data on the Internet has led to the development
of a new generation of applications based on selective information
dissemination where, data is distributed only to interested clients. Such
applications require a new middleware architecture that can efficiently match
user interests with available information. Middleware that can satisfy this
requirement include event-based architectures such as publish-subscribe
systems. In this demonstration paper we address the problem of semantic
matching. We investigate how current publish/subscribe systems can be extended
with semantic capabilities. Our main contribution is the development and
validation (through demonstration) of a semantic pub/sub system prototype
S-ToPSS (Semantic Toronto Publish/Subscribe System).

 <dc:title>Toward Attribute Efficient Learning Algorithms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Klivans, Adam R.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Servedio, Rocco A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We make progress on two important problems regarding attribute efficient
learnability.
  First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length $k$ over
$n$ variables using $2^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})} \log n$ examples and time
$n^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$. This is the first algorithm for learning decision
lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running
time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship
between attribute efficient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is
based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold
functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction
matches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives
an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree
and weight.
  Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$
out of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$.
For $k=o(\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample
complexity $o(n)$. This is the first polynomial time algorithm for learning
parity on a superconstant number of variables with sublinear sample complexity.

 <dc:description>  We present a program synthesis method based on unfold/fold transformation
rules which can be used for deriving terminating definite logic programs from
formulas of the Weak Monadic Second Order theory of one successor (WS1S). This
synthesis method can also be used as a proof method which is a decision
procedure for closed formulas of WS1S. We apply our synthesis method for
translating CLP(WS1S) programs into logic programs and we use it also as a
proof method for verifying safety properties of infinite state systems.

 <dc:description>  Program specialization is a program transformation methodology which improves
program efficiency by exploiting the information about the input data which are
available at compile time. We show that current techniques for program
specialization based on partial evaluation do not perform well on
nondeterministic logic programs. We then consider a set of transformation rules
which extend the ones used for partial evaluation, and we propose a strategy
for guiding the application of these extended rules so to derive very efficient
specialized programs. The efficiency improvements which sometimes are
exponential, are due to the reduction of nondeterminism and to the fact that
the computations which are performed by the initial programs in different
branches of the computation trees, are performed by the specialized programs
within single branches. In order to reduce nondeterminism we also make use of
mode information for guiding the unfolding process. To exemplify our technique,
we show that we can automatically derive very efficient matching programs and
parsers for regular languages. The derivations we have performed could not have
been done by previously known partial evaluation techniques.

 <dc:title>Unsupervised Grammar Induction in a Framework of Information Compression

 <dc:creator>Wolff, J Gerard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes a novel approach to grammar induction that has been
developed within a framework designed to integrate learning with other aspects
of computing, AI, mathematics and logic. This framework, called &quot;information
compression by multiple alignment, unification and search&quot; (ICMAUS), is founded
on principles of Minimum Length Encoding pioneered by Solomonoff and others.
Most of the paper describes SP70, a computer model of the ICMAUS framework that
incorporates processes for unsupervised learning of grammars. An example is
presented to show how the model can infer a plausible grammar from appropriate
input. Limitations of the current model and how they may be overcome are
briefly discussed.

 <dc:subject>I.2.11</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An abstract architecture for idealized multi-agent systems whose behaviour is
regulated by normative systems is developed and discussed. Agent choices are
determined partially by the preference ordering of possible states and
partially by normative considerations: The agent chooses that act which leads
to the best outcome of all permissible actions. If an action is non-permissible
depends on if the result of performing that action leads to a state satisfying
a condition which is forbidden, according to the norms regulating the
multi-agent system. This idea is formalized by defining set-theoretic
predicates characterizing multi-agent systems. The definition of the predicate
uses decision theory, the Kanger-Lindahl theory of normative positions, and an
algebraic representation of normative systems.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the amount of information on the Internet has increased
exponentially developing great interest in selective information dissemination
systems. The publish/subscribe paradigm is particularly suited for designing
systems for routing information and requests according to their content
throughout wide-area network of brokers. Current publish/subscribe systems use
limited syntax-based content routing but since publishers and subscribers are
anonymous and decoupled in time, space and location, often over wide-area
network boundary, they do not necessarily speak the same language.
Consequently, adding semantics to current publish/subscribe systems is
important. In this paper we identify and examine the issues in developing
semantic-based content routing for publish/subscribe broker networks.

 <dc:description>  We present an unusual algorithm involving classification trees where two
trees are grown in opposite directions so that they are matched at their
leaves. This approach finds application in a new data mining task we formulate,
called &quot;redescription mining&quot;. A redescription is a shift-of-vocabulary, or a
different way of communicating information about a given subset of data; the
goal of redescription mining is to find subsets of data that afford multiple
descriptions. We highlight the importance of this problem in domains such as
bioinformatics, which exhibit an underlying richness and diversity of data
descriptors (e.g., genes can be studied in a variety of ways). Our approach
helps integrate multiple forms of characterizing datasets, situates the
knowledge gained from one dataset in the context of others, and harnesses
high-level abstractions for uncovering cryptic and subtle features of data.
Algorithm design decisions, implementation details, and experimental results
are presented.

 <dc:description>  TCP is the De facto standard for connection oriented transport layer
protocol, while UDP is the De facto standard for transport layer protocol,
which is used with real time traffic for audio and video. Although there have
been many attempts to measure and analyze the performance of the TCP protocol
in wireless networks, very few research was done on the UDP or the interaction
between TCP and UDP traffic over the wireless link. In this paper, we tudy the
performance of TCP and UDP over IEEE802.11 ad hoc network. We used two
topologies, a string and a mesh topology. Our work indicates that IEEE802.11 as
a ad-hoc network is not very suitable for bulk transfer using TCP. It also
indicates that it is much better for real-time audio. Although one has to be
careful here since real-time audio does require much less bandwidth than the
wireless link bandwidth. Careful and detailed studies are needed to further
clarify that issue.

 <dc:description>  The public sector comprises government agencies, ministries, education
institutions, health providers and other types of government, commercial and
not-for-profit organisations. Unlike commercial enterprises, this environment
is highly heterogeneous in all aspects. This forms a complex network which is
not always optimised. A lack of optimisation and communication hinders
information sharing between the network nodes limiting the flow of information.
Another limiting aspect is privacy of personal information and security of
operations of some nodes or segments of the network. Attempts to reorganise the
network or improve communications to make more information available for
sharing and analysis may be hindered or completely halted by public concerns
over privacy, political agendas, social and technological barriers. This paper
discusses a technical solution for information sharing while addressing the
privacy concerns with no need for reorganisation of the existing public sector
infrastructure . The solution is based on imposing an additional layer of
Intelligent Software Agents and Knowledge Bases for data mining and analysis.

 <dc:title>Integrating existing cone-shaped and projection-based cardinal direction
  relations and a TCSP-like decidable generalisation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Isli, Amar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2 (I.2.4)</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-based
calculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general,
integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the
qualitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal
direction atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\alpha ,\beta)(x,y)$,
with $\alpha ,\beta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $(\beta -\alpha)\in [0,\pi ]$: the meaning
of the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the
(convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\alpha$ and
$\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form
$[r_1\vee...\vee r_{n_1}\vee (\alpha_1,\beta_1)\vee...\vee (\alpha
_{n_2},\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\alpha
_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above:
the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$,
$r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. A
conjunction of such general constraints is a $\tcsp$-like CSP, which we will
refer to as an $\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective
solution search algorithm for an $\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1)
constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the
filtering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing
completeness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularly
suited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-like
surveillance of a geographic area.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an augmented situation calculus-based approach to model
autonomous computing paradigm in ubiquitous information services. To make it
practical for commercial development and easier to support autonomous paradigm
imposed by ubiquitous information services, we made improvements based on
Reiter's standard situation calculus. First we explore the inherent
relationship between fluents and evolution: since not all fluents contribute to
systems' evolution and some fluents can be derived from some others, we define
those fluents that are sufficient and necessary to determine evolutional
potential as decisive fluents, and then we prove that their successor states
wrt to deterministic complex actions satisfy Markov property. Then, within the
calculus framework we build, we introduce validity theory to model the
autonomous services with application-specific validity requirements, including:
validity fluents to axiomatize validity requirements, heuristic multiple
alternative service choices ranging from complete acceptance, partial
acceptance, to complete rejection, and validity-ensured policy to comprise such
alternative service choices into organic, autonomously-computable services. Our
approach is demonstrated by a ubiquitous calendaring service, ACS, throughout
the paper.

 <dc:description>  Let $\{w_{i,j}\}_{1\leq i\leq n, 1\leq j\leq s} \subset
L_m=F(X_1,...,X_m)[{\partial \over \partial X_1},..., {\partial \over \partial
X_m}]$ be linear partial differential operators of orders with respect to
${\partial \over \partial X_1},..., {\partial \over \partial X_m}$ at most $d$.
We prove an upper bound n(4m^2d\min\{n,s\})^{4^{m-t-1}(2(m-t))} on the leading
coefficient of the Hilbert-Kolchin polynomial of the left $L_m$-module
$&lt;\{w_{1,j}, ..., w_{n,j}\}_{1\leq j \leq s} &gt; \subset L_m^n$ having the
differential type $t$ (also being equal to the degree of the Hilbert-Kolchin
polynomial). The main technical tool is the complexity bound on solving systems
of linear equations over {\it algebras of fractions} of the form
$$L_m(F[X_1,..., X_m, {\partial \over \partial X_1},..., {\partial \over
\partial X_k}])^{-1}.$$

 <dc:description>  The history of the occupations &quot;author&quot; and &quot;photographer&quot; provides an
insightful perspective on copyright and creativity. The concept of the romantic
author, associated with personal creative genius, gained prominence in the
eighteenth century. However, in the U.S. in 1900 only about three thousand
persons professed their occupation to be &quot;author.&quot; Self-professed
&quot;photographers&quot; were then about ten times as numerous as authors. Being a
photographer was associated with manufacturing and depended only on mastering
technical skills and making a living. Being an author, in contrast, was an
elite status associated with science and literature. Across the twentieth
century, the number of writers and authors grew much more rapidly than the
number of photographers. The relative success of writers and authors in
creating jobs seems to have depended not on differences in copyright or
possibilities for self-production, but on greater occupational innovation.
Creativity in organizing daily work is an important form of creativity.

 <dc:title>The concept of strong and weak virtual reality</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We approach the virtual reality phenomenon by studying its relationship to
set theory, and we investigate the case where this is done using the
wellfoundedness property of sets. Our hypothesis is that non-wellfounded sets
(hypersets) give rise to a different quality of virtual reality than do
familiar wellfounded sets. We initially provide an alternative approach to
virtual reality based on Sommerhoff's idea of first and second order
self-awareness; both categories of self-awareness are considered as necessary
conditions for consciousness in terms of higher cognitive functions. We then
introduce a representation of first and second order self-awareness through
sets, and assume that these sets, which we call events, originally form a
collection of wellfounded sets. Strong virtual reality characterizes virtual
reality environments which have the limited capacity to create only events
associated with wellfounded sets. In contrast, the more general concept of weak
virtual reality characterizes collections of virtual reality mediated events
altogether forming an entirety larger than any collection of wellfounded sets.
By giving reference to Aczel's hyperset theory we indicate that this definition
is not empty, because hypersets encompass wellfounded sets already. Moreover,
we argue that weak virtual reality could be realized in human history through
continued progress in computer technology. Finally, we reformulate our
characterization into a more general framework, and use Baltag's Structural
Theory of Sets (STS) to show that within this general hyperset theory
Sommerhoff's first and second order self-awareness as well as both concepts of
virtual reality admit a consistent mathematical representation.

 <dc:title>On Structuring Proof Search for First Order Linear Logic</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  Full first order linear logic can be presented as an abstract logic
programming language in Miller's system Forum, which yields a sensible
operational interpretation in the 'proof search as computation' paradigm.
However, Forum still has to deal with syntactic details that would normally be
ignored by a reasonable operational semantics. In this respect, Forum improves
on Gentzen systems for linear logic by restricting the language and the form of
inference rules. We further improve on Forum by restricting the class of
formulae allowed, in a system we call G-Forum, which is still equivalent to
full first order linear logic. The only formulae allowed in G-Forum have the
same shape as Forum sequents: the restriction does not diminish expressiveness
and makes G-Forum amenable to proof theoretic analysis. G-Forum consists of two
(big) inference rules, for which we show a cut elimination procedure. This does
not need to appeal to finer detail in formulae and sequents than is provided by
G-Forum, thus successfully testing the internal symmetries of our system.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a hybrid system controller, incorporating a neural and an
LQG controller. The neural controller has been optimized by genetic algorithms
directly on the inverted pendulum system. The failure free optimization process
stipulated a relatively small region of the asymptotic stability of the neural
controller, which is concentrated around the regulation point. The presented
hybrid controller combines benefits of a genetically optimized neural
controller and an LQG controller in a single system controller. High quality of
the regulation process is achieved through utilization of the neural
controller, while stability of the system during transient processes and a wide
range of operation are assured through application of the LQG controller. The
hybrid controller has been validated by applying it to a simulation model of an
inherently unstable system of inverted pendulum.

 <dc:description>  Using naive Bayes for email classification has become very popular within the
last few months. They are quite easy to implement and very efficient. In this
paper we want to present empirical results of email classification using a
combination of naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor searches. Using this
technique we show that the accuracy of a Bayes filter can be improved slightly
for a high number of features and significantly for a small number of features.

 <dc:description>  The latest Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are reported to reach up to
  200 billion floating point operations per second (200 Gflops) and to have
price performance of 0.1 cents per M flop. These facts raise great interest in
the plausibility of extending the GPUs' use to non-graphics applications, in
particular numerical simulations on structured grids (lattice).
  We review previous work on using GPUs for non-graphics applications,
implement probability-based simulations on the GPU, namely the
  Ising and percolation models, implement vector operation benchmarks for the
GPU, and finally compare the CPU's and GPU's performance.
  A general conclusion from the results obtained is that moving computations
from the CPU to the GPU is feasible, yielding good time and price performance,
for certain lattice computations.
  Preliminary results also show that it is feasible to use them in parallel

 <dc:description>  We define counting classes #P_R and #P_C in the Blum-Shub-Smale setting of
computations over the real or complex numbers, respectively. The problems of
counting the number of solutions of systems of polynomial inequalities over R,
or of systems of polynomial equalities over C, respectively, turn out to be
natural complete problems in these classes. We investigate to what extent the
new counting classes capture the complexity of computing basic topological
invariants of semialgebraic sets (over R) and algebraic sets (over C). We prove
that the problem of computing the (modified) Euler characteristic of
semialgebraic sets is FP_R^{#P_R}-complete, and that the problem of computing
the geometric degree of complex algebraic sets is FP_C^{#P_C}-complete. We also
define new counting complexity classes in the classical Turing model via taking
Boolean parts of the classes above, and show that the problems to compute the
Euler characteristic and the geometric degree of (semi)algebraic sets given by
integer polynomials are complete in these classes. We complement the results in
the Turing model by proving, for all k in N, the FPSPACE-hardness of the
problem of computing the k-th Betti number of the zet of real zeros of a given
integer polynomial. This holds with respect to the singular homology as well as
for the Borel-Moore homology.

 <dc:description>  Although more and more language pairs are covered by machine translation
services, there are still many pairs that lack translation resources.
Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is an application which needs
translation functionality of a relatively low level of sophistication since
current models for information retrieval (IR) are still based on a
bag-of-words. The Web provides a vast resource for the automatic construction
of parallel corpora which can be used to train statistical translation models
automatically. The resulting translation models can be embedded in several ways
in a retrieval model. In this paper, we will investigate the problem of
automatically mining parallel texts from the Web and different ways of
integrating the translation models within the retrieval process. Our
experiments on standard test collections for CLIR show that the Web-based
translation models can surpass commercial MT systems in CLIR tasks. These
results open the perspective of constructing a fully automatic query
translation device for CLIR at a very low cost.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents a method for failure free genetic algorithm optimization
of a system controller. Genetic algorithms present a powerful tool that
facilitates producing near-optimal system controllers. Applied to such methods
of computational intelligence as neural networks or fuzzy logic, these methods
are capable of combining the non-linear mapping capabilities of the latter with
learning the system behavior directly, that is, without a prior model. At the
same time, genetic algorithms routinely produce solutions that lead to the
failure of the controlled system. Such solutions are generally unacceptable for
applications where safe operation must be guaranteed. We present here a method
of design, which allows failure-free application of genetic algorithms through
utilization of SAFE and LEARNING controllers in tandem, where the SAFE
controller recovers the system from dangerous states while the LEARNING
controller learns its behavior. The method has been validated by applying it to
an inherently unstable system of inverted pendulum.

 <dc:description>  Interfaces that support multi-lingual content can reach a broader community.
We wish to extend the reach of CITIDEL, a digital library for computing
education materials, to support multiple languages. By doing so, we hope that
it will increase the number of users, and in turn the number of resources. This
paper discusses three approaches to translation (automated translation,
developer-based, and community-based), and a brief evaluation of these
approaches. It proposes a design for an online community translation center
where volunteers help translate interface components and educational materials
available in CITIDEL.

 <dc:description>  We report on an effort to develop methodologies for formal verification of
parts of the Multi-Purpose Daemon (MPD) parallel process management system. MPD
is a distributed collection of communicating processes. While the individual
components of the collection execute simple algorithms, their interaction leads
to unexpected errors that are difficult to uncover by conventional means. Two
verification approaches are discussed here: the standard model checking
approach using the software model checker SPIN and the nonstandard use of a
general-purpose first-order resolution-style theorem prover OTTER to conduct
the traditional state space exploration. We compare modeling methodology and
analyze performance and scalability of the two methods with respect to
verification of MPD.

 <dc:description>  Shape analysis concerns the problem of determining &quot;shape invariants&quot; for
programs that perform destructive updating on dynamically allocated storage. In
recent work, we have shown how shape analysis can be performed, using an
abstract interpretation based on 3-valued first-order logic. In that work,
concrete stores are finite 2-valued logical structures, and the sets of stores
that can possibly arise during execution are represented (conservatively) using
a certain family of finite 3-valued logical structures. In this paper, we show
how 3-valued structures that arise in shape analysis can be characterized using
formulas in first-order logic with transitive closure.
  We also define a non-standard (&quot;supervaluational&quot;) semantics for 3-valued
first-order logic that is more precise than a conventional 3-valued semantics,
and demonstrate that the supervaluational semantics can be effectively
implemented using existing theorem provers.

 <dc:description>  Soft linear logic ([Lafont02]) is a subsystem of linear logic characterizing
the class PTIME. We introduce Soft lambda-calculus as a calculus typable in the
intuitionistic and affine variant of this logic. We prove that the (untyped)
terms of this calculus are reducible in polynomial time. We then extend the
type system of Soft logic with recursive types. This allows us to consider
non-standard types for representing lists. Using these datatypes we examine the
concrete expressivity of Soft lambda-calculus with the example of the insertion
sort algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We present the first study to explore the use of out-of-turn interaction in
websites. Out-of-turn interaction is a technique which empowers the user to
supply unsolicited information while browsing. This approach helps flexibly
bridge any mental mismatch between the user and the website, in a manner
fundamentally different from faceted browsing and site-specific search tools.
We built a user interface (Extempore) which accepts out-of-turn input via voice
or text; and employed it in a US congressional website, to determine if users
utilize out-of-turn interaction for information-finding tasks, and their
rationale for doing so. The results indicate that users are adept at discerning
when out-of-turn interaction is necessary in a particular task, and actively
interleaved it with browsing. However, users found cascading information across
information-finding subtasks challenging. Therefore, this work not only
improves our understanding of out-of-turn interaction, but also suggests
further opportunities to enrich browsing experiences for users.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of proving properties of infinite
behaviour of formalisms suitable to describe (infinite state) systems with
recursion and parallelism. As a formal setting, we consider the framework of
Process Rewriting Systems (PRSs). For a meaningfull fragment of PRSs, allowing
to accommodate both Pushdown Automata and Petri Nets, we state decidability
results for a class of properties about infinite derivations (infinite term
rewritings). The given results can be exploited for the automatic verification
of some classes of linear time properties of infinite state systems described
by PRSs. In order to exemplify the assessed results, we introduce a meaningful
automaton based formalism which allows to express both recursion and
multi--treading.

 <dc:title>Modeling Object Oriented Constraint Programs in Z</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Object oriented constraint programs (OOCPs) emerge as a leading evolution of
constraint programming and artificial intelligence, first applied to a range of
industrial applications called configuration problems. The rich variety of
technical approaches to solving configuration problems (CLP(FD), CC(FD), DCSP,
Terminological systems, constraint programs with set variables ...) is a source
of difficulty. No universally accepted formal language exists for communicating
about OOCPs, which makes the comparison of systems difficult. We present here a
Z based specification of OOCPs which avoids the falltrap of hidden object
semantics. The object system is part of the specification, and captures all of
the most advanced notions from the object oriented modeling standard UML. The
paper illustrates these issues and the conciseness and precision of Z by the
specification of a working OOCP that solves an historical AI problem : parsing
a context free grammar. Being written in Z, an OOCP specification also supports
formal proofs. The whole builds the foundation of an adaptative and evolving
framework for communicating about constrained object models and programs.

 <dc:description>  The past century ended with an unexpected explosion of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT), both in planning/managing public policies,
and in exchanging knowledge. However, the extent to which ICT-based tools
increase the level of public knowledge, or help decision makers is still
uncertain. Although indirectly, the overload of unfiltered Web-based
information seems able to hamper the knowledge growth of people, particularly
in some developing communities, whereas Decision Support Systems (DSS) and
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) prove to be ineffective if managed by
unskilled planning bodies. Given such warns, this paper outlines how the
different social and cultural awareness of local communities can affect the
outcomes of ICT-based tools. It further explores the impacts of ICT-based tools
on community development and spatial planning, emphasizing the role of proper
literacy and education for effective management.

 <dc:description>  Email has emerged as a dominant form of electronic communication between
people. Spam is a major problem for email users, with estimates of up to 56% of
email falling into that category. Control of Spam is being attempted with
technical and legislative methods. In this paper we look at email and spam from
a supply-demand perspective. We propose Gridemail, an email system based on an
economy of communicating parties, where participants? motivations are
represented as pricing policies and profiles. This system is expected to help
people regulate their personal communications to suit their conditions, and
help in removing unwanted messages.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the inference of modes for which a logic program is
guaranteed to terminate. This generalises traditional termination analysis
where an analyser tries to verify termination for a specified mode. Our
contribution is a methodology in which components of traditional termination
analysis are combined with backwards analysis to obtain an analyser for
termination inference. We identify a condition on the components of the
analyser which guarantees that termination inference will infer all modes which
can be checked to terminate. The application of this methodology to enhance a
traditional termination analyser to perform also termination inference is
demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  This paper gives an absolute new search system that builds the information
retrieval infrastructure for Internet. Now most search engine companies are
mainly concerned with how to make profit from company users by advertisement
and ranking prominence, but never consider what its real customers will feel.
Few web search engines can sell billions dollars just at the cost of
inconvenience of most Internet users, but not its high quality of search
service. When we have to bear the bothersome advertisements in the awful
results and have no choices, Internet as the kind of public good will surely be
undermined. If current Internet can't fully ensure our right to know, it may
need some sound improvements or a revolution.

 <dc:description>  Security protocols stipulate how the remote principals of a computer network
should interact in order to obtain specific security goals. The crucial goals
of confidentiality and authentication may be achieved in various forms, each of
different strength. Using soft (rather than crisp) constraints, we develop a
uniform formal notion for the two goals. They are no longer formalised as mere
yes/no properties as in the existing literature, but gain an extra parameter,
the security level. For example, different messages can enjoy different levels
of confidentiality, or a principal can achieve different levels of
authentication with different principals.
  The goals are formalised within a general framework for protocol analysis
that is amenable to mechanisation by model checking. Following the application
of the framework to analysing the asymmetric Needham-Schroeder protocol, we
have recently discovered a new attack on that protocol as a form of retaliation
by principals who have been attacked previously. Having commented on that
attack, we then demonstrate the framework on a bigger, largely deployed
protocol consisting of three phases, Kerberos.

 <dc:description>  Binary logic programs can be obtained from ordinary logic programs by a
binarizing transformation. In most cases, binary programs obtained this way are
less efficient than the original programs. (Demoen, 1992) showed an interesting
example of a logic program whose computational behaviour was improved when it
was transformed to a binary program and then specialized by partial deduction.
The class of B-stratifiable logic programs is defined. It is shown that for
every B-stratifiable logic program, binarization and subsequent partial
deduction produce a binary program which does not contain variables for
continuations introduced by binarization. Such programs usually have a better
computational behaviour than the original ones. Both binarization and partial
deduction can be easily automated. A comparison with other related approaches
to program transformation is given.

 <dc:description>  An open ended list is a well known data structure in Prolog programs. It is
frequently used to represent a value changing over time, while this value is
referred to from several places in the data structure of the application. A
weak point in this technique is that the time complexity is linear in the
number of updates to the value represented by the open ended list. In this
programming pearl we present a variant of the open ended list, namely an open
ended tree, with an update and access time complexity logarithmic in the number
of updates to the value.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a variant of stable model semantics for disjunctive
logic programming and deductive databases. The semantics, called minimal
founded, generalizes stable model semantics for normal (i.e. non disjunctive)
programs but differs from disjunctive stable model semantics (the extension of
stable model semantics for disjunctive programs). Compared with disjunctive
stable model semantics, minimal founded semantics seems to be more intuitive,
it gives meaning to programs which are meaningless under stable model semantics
and is no harder to compute. More specifically, minimal founded semantics
differs from stable model semantics only for disjunctive programs having
constraint rules or rules working as constraints. We study the expressive power
of the semantics and show that for general disjunctive datalog programs it has
the same power as disjunctive stable model semantics.

 <dc:title>Strong Equivalence Made Easy: Nested Expressions and Weight Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>D.1.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Logic programs P and Q are strongly equivalent if, given any program R,
programs P union R and Q union R are equivalent (that is, have the same answer
sets). Strong equivalence is convenient for the study of equivalent
transformations of logic programs: one can prove that a local change is correct
without considering the whole program. Lifschitz, Pearce and Valverde showed
that Heyting's logic of here-and-there can be used to characterize strong
equivalence for logic programs with nested expressions (which subsume the
better-known extended disjunctive programs). This note considers a simpler,
more direct characterization of strong equivalence for such programs, and shows
that it can also be applied without modification to the weight constraint
programs of Niemela and Simons. Thus, this characterization of strong
equivalence is convenient for the study of equivalent transformations of logic
programs written in the input languages of answer set programming systems dlv
and smodels. The note concludes with a brief discussion of results that can be
used to automate reasoning about strong equivalence, including a novel encoding
that reduces the problem of deciding the strong equivalence of a pair of weight
constraint programs to that of deciding the inconsistency of a weight
constraint program.

the sentences in English given from the users via Internet, but also reasonably
and individually speak with the users. At first the related works in this
research field are analyzed. Then we introduce the system goals and the system
framework, i.e., the natural language understanding mechanism (NLML, NLOMJ and
NLDB) and the communicational response (CR). Finally we give the syntactic and
semantic content of this instruction system, i.e. some important notations of
English grammar used in it and their relations with the NLOMJ.

 <dc:description>  We discuss from a practical point of view a number of issues involved in
writing distributed Internet and WWW applications using LP/CLP systems. We
describe PiLLoW, a public-domain Internet and WWW programming library for
LP/CLP systems that we have designed in order to simplify the process of
writing such applications. PiLLoW provides facilities for accessing documents
and code on the WWW; parsing, manipulating and generating HTML and XML
structured documents and data; producing HTML forms; writing form handlers and
CGI-scripts; and processing HTML/XML templates. An important contribution of
PiLLoW is to model HTML/XML code (and, thus, the content of WWW pages) as
terms. The PiLLoW library has been developed in the context of the Ciao Prolog
system, but it has been adapted to a number of popular LP/CLP systems,
supporting most of its functionality. We also describe the use of concurrency
and a high-level model of client-server interaction, Ciao Prolog's active
modules, in the context of WWW programming. We propose a solution for
client-side downloading and execution of Prolog code, using generic browsers.
Finally, we also provide an overview of related work on the topic.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes learning in a compiler for algorithms solving classes of
the logic minimization problem MINSAT, where the underlying propositional
formula is in conjunctive normal form (CNF) and where costs are associated with
the True/False values of the variables. Each class consists of all instances
that may be derived from a given propositional formula and costs for True/False
values by fixing or deleting variables, and by deleting clauses. The learning
step begins once the compiler has constructed a solution algorithm for a given
class. The step applies that algorithm to comparatively few instances of the
class, analyses the performance of the algorithm on these instances, and
modifies the underlying propositional formula, with the goal that the algorithm
will perform much better on all instances of the class.

 <dc:description>  A {k,n}-threshold scheme based on two-dimensional memory cellular automata is
proposed to share images in a secret way. This method allows to encode an image
into n shared images so that only qualified subsets of k or more shares can
recover the secret image, but any k-1 or fewer of them gain no information
about the original image. The main characteristics of this new scheme are: each
shared image has the same size that the original one, and the recovered image
is exactly the same than the secret image; i.e., there is no loss of
resolution.

various types. The NESSIE project was a three year long project and has been
divided into two phases. The first was finished in June 2001r. CAMELLIA, RC6,
SAFER++128 and SHACAL were accepted for the second phase of the evaluation
process. HIEROCRYPT-3 had key schedule problems, and there were attacks for up
to 3,5 rounds out of 6, at least hardware implementations of this cipher were
extremely slow [12]. HIEROCRYPT-3 was not selected to Phase II. CAMELLIA was
selected as an algorithm suggested for future standard. In the paper we present
the hardware implementations these two algorithms with 128-bit blocks and
128-bit keys, using ALTERA devices and their comparisons.

 <dc:description>  Even when a system is proven to be correct with respect to a specification,
there is still a question of how complete the specification is, and whether it
really covers all the behaviors of the system. Coverage metrics attempt to
check which parts of a system are actually relevant for the verification
process to succeed. Recent work on coverage in model checking suggests several
coverage metrics and algorithms for finding parts of the system that are not
covered by the specification. The work has already proven to be effective in
practice, detecting design errors that escape early verification efforts in
industrial settings. In this paper, we relate a formal definition of causality
given by Halpern and Pearl [2001] to coverage. We show that it gives
significant insight into unresolved issues regarding the definition of coverage
and leads to potentially useful extensions of coverage. In particular, we
introduce the notion of responsibility, which assigns to components of a system
a quantitative measure of their relevance to the satisfaction of the
specification.

 <dc:description>  Expectation is a central notion in probability theory. The notion of
expectation also makes sense for other notions of uncertainty. We introduce a
propositional logic for reasoning about expectation, where the semantics
depends on the underlying representation of uncertainty. We give sound and
complete axiomatizations for the logic in the case that the underlying
representation is (a) probability, (b) sets of probability measures, (c) belief
functions, and (d) possibility measures. We show that this logic is more
expressive than the corresponding logic for reasoning about likelihood in the
case of sets of probability measures, but equi-expressive in the case of
probability, belief, and possibility. Finally, we show that satisfiability for
these logics is NP-complete, no harder than satisfiability for propositional
logic.

 <dc:description>  Causality is typically treated an all-or-nothing concept; either A is a cause
of B or it is not. We extend the definition of causality introduced by Halpern
and Pearl [2001] to take into account the degree of responsibility of A for B.
For example, if someone wins an election 11--0, then each person who votes for
him is less responsible for the victory than if he had won 6--5. We then define
a notion of degree of blame, which takes into account an agent's epistemic
state. Roughly speaking, the degree of blame of A for B is the expected degree
of responsibility of A for B, taken over the epistemic state of an agent.

 <dc:title>Uniform test of algorithmic randomness over a general space</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The algorithmic theory of randomness is well developed when the underlying
space is the set of finite or infinite sequences and the underlying probability
distribution is the uniform distribution or a computable distribution. These
restrictions seem artificial. Some progress has been made to extend the theory
to arbitrary Bernoulli distributions (by Martin-Loef), and to arbitrary
distributions (by Levin). We recall the main ideas and problems of Levin's
theory, and report further progress in the same framework.
  - We allow non-compact spaces (like the space of continuous functions,
underlying the Brownian motion).
  - The uniform test (deficiency of randomness) d_P(x) (depending both on the
outcome x and the measure P should be defined in a general and natural way.
  - We see which of the old results survive: existence of universal tests,
conservation of randomness, expression of tests in terms of description
complexity, existence of a universal measure, expression of mutual information
as &quot;deficiency of independence.
  - The negative of the new randomness test is shown to be a generalization of
complexity in continuous spaces; we show that the addition theorem survives.
  The paper's main contribution is introducing an appropriate framework for
studying these questions and related ones (like statistics for a general family
of distributions).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we suggest an architecture for a software agent which operates
a physical device and is capable of making observations and of testing and
repairing the device's components. We present simplified definitions of the
notions of symptom, candidate diagnosis, and diagnosis which are based on the
theory of action language ${\cal AL}$. The definitions allow one to give a
simple account of the agent's behavior in which many of the agent's tasks are
reduced to computing stable models of logic programs.

 <dc:description>  In the design of algorithms, the greedy paradigm provides a powerful tool for
solving efficiently classical computational problems, within the framework of
procedural languages. However, expressing these algorithms within the
declarative framework of logic-based languages has proven a difficult research
challenge. In this paper, we extend the framework of Datalog-like languages to
obtain simple declarative formulations for such problems, and propose effective
implementation techniques to ensure computational complexities comparable to
those of procedural formulations. These advances are achieved through the use
of the &quot;choice&quot; construct, extended with preference annotations to effect the
selection of alternative stable-models and nondeterministic fixpoints. We show
that, with suitable storage structures, the differential fixpoint computation
of our programs matches the complexity of procedural algorithms in classical
search and optimization problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we analyze declarative deterministic and non-deterministic
semantics for active rules. In particular we consider several (partial) stable
model semantics, previously defined for deductive rules, such as well-founded,
max deterministic, unique total stable model, total stable model, and maximal
stable model semantics. The semantics of an active program AP is given by first
rewriting it into a deductive program P, then computing a model M defining the
declarative semantics of P and, finally, applying `consistent' updates
contained in M to the source database. The framework we propose permits a
natural integration of deductive and active rules and can also be applied to
queries with function symbols or to queries over infinite databases.

 <dc:title>On A Theory of Probabilistic Deductive Databases</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for modeling uncertainty where both belief and doubt
can be given independent, first-class status. We adopt probability theory as
the mathematical formalism for manipulating uncertainty. An agent can express
the uncertainty in her knowledge about a piece of information in the form of a
confidence level, consisting of a pair of intervals of probability, one for
each of her belief and doubt. The space of confidence levels naturally leads to
the notion of a trilattice, similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices.
Intuitively, thep oints in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth,
information, or precision. We develop a framework for probabilistic deductive
databases by associating confidence levels with the facts and rules of a
classical deductive database. While the trilattice structure offers a variety
of choices for defining the semantics of probabilistic deductive databases, our
choice of semantics is based on the truth-ordering, which we find to be closest
to the classical framework for deductive databases. In addition to proposing a
declarative semantics based on valuations and an equivalent semantics based on
fixpoint theory, we also propose a proof procedure and prove it sound and
complete. We show that while classical Datalog query programs have a polynomial
time data complexity, certain query programs in the probabilistic deductive
database framework do not even terminate on some input databases. We identify a
large natural class of query programs of practical interest in our framework,
and show that programs in this class possess polynomial time data complexity,
i.e., not only do they terminate on every input database, they are guaranteed
to do so in a number of steps polynomial in the input database size.

 <dc:description>  We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method
doesn't use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as
follows: First, we determine a universal similarity distance, the normalized
compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files
(singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical
clustering method. The NCD is universal in that it is not restricted to a
specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A
theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one
of the authors, is provably optimal but uses the non-computable notion of
Kolmogorov complexity. We propose precise notions of similarity metric, normal
compressor, and show that the NCD based on a normal compressor is a similarity
metric that approximates universality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from
the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (binary tree) by a new quartet
method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and
available as public software, and is robust under choice of different
compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we
report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics,
virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and
combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical,
dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics we presented new
evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on
whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta
hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.

 <dc:description>  We compare two recent extensions of the answer set (stable model) semantics
of logic programs. One of them, due to Lifschitz, Tang and Turner, allows the
bodies and heads of rules to contain nested expressions. The other, due to
Niemela and Simons, uses weight constraints. We show that there is a simple,
modular translation from the language of weight constraints into the language
of nested expressions that preserves the program's answer sets. Nested
expressions can be eliminated from the result of this translation in favor of
additional atoms. The translation makes it possible to compute answer sets for
some programs with weight constraints using satisfiability solvers, and to
prove the strong equivalence of programs with weight constraints using the
logic of here-and there.

 <dc:description>  We show that database schema validation and update processing problems such
as view updating, materialized view maintenance, integrity constraint checking,
integrity constraint maintenance or condition monitoring can be classified as
problems of either abductive or deductive nature, according to the reasoning
paradigm that inherently suites them. This is done by performing abductive and
deductive reasoning on the event rules [Oli91], a set of rules that define the
difference between consecutive database states In this way, we show that it is
possible to provide methods able to deal with all these problems as a whole. We
also show how some existing general deductive and abductive procedures may be
used to reason on the event rules. In this way, we show that these procedures
can deal with all database schema validation and update processing problems
considered in this paper.

 <dc:description>  Websites of a particular class form increasingly complex networks, and new
tools are needed to map and understand them. A way of visualizing this complex
network is by mapping it. A map highlights which members of the community have
similar interests, and reveals the underlying social network. In this paper, we
will map a network of websites using Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM), a
neural-net like method generally used for clustering and visualization of
complex data sets. The set of websites considered has been the Blogalia weblog
hosting site (based at http://www.blogalia.com/), a thriving community of
around 200 members, created in January 2002. In this paper we show how SOM
discovers interesting community features, its relation with other
community-discovering algorithms, and the way it highlights the set of
communities formed over the network.

 <dc:description>  Non-deductive reasoning systems are often {\em representation dependent}:
representing the same situation in two different ways may cause such a system
to return two different answers. Some have viewed this as a significant
problem. For example, the principle of maximum entropy has been subjected to
much criticism due to its representation dependence. There has, however, been
almost no work investigating representation dependence. In this paper, we
formalize this notion and show that it is not a problem specific to maximum
entropy. In fact, we show that any representation-independent probabilistic
inference procedure that ignores irrelevant information is essentially
entailment, in a precise sense. Moreover, we show that representation
independence is incompatible with even a weak default assumption of
independence. We then show that invariance under a restricted class of
representation changes can form a reasonable compromise between representation
independence and other desiderata, and provide a construction of a family of
inference procedures that provides such restricted representation independence,
using relative entropy.

 <dc:title>Using virtual processors for SPMD parallel programs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Argentini, Gianluca</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>F.1.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper I describe some results on the use of virtual processors
technology for parallelize some SPMD computational programs. The tested
technology is the INTEL Hyper Threading on real processors, and the programs
are MATLAB scripts for floating points computation. The conclusions of the work
concern on the utility and limits of the used approach. The main result is that
using virtual processors is a good technique for improving parallel programs
not only for memory-based computations, but in the case of massive disk-storage
operations too.

 <dc:description>  The main aim of this paper is to introduce automated generation of scripted
dialogue as a worthwhile topic of investigation. In particular the fact that
scripted dialogue involves two layers of communication, i.e., uni-directional
communication between the author and the audience of a scripted dialogue and
bi-directional pretended communication between the characters featuring in the
dialogue, is argued to raise some interesting issues. Our hope is that the
combined study of the two layers will forge links between research in text
generation and dialogue processing. The paper presents a first attempt at
creating such links by studying three types of strategies for the automated
generation of scripted dialogue. The strategies are derived from examples of
human-authored and naturally occurring dialogue.

 <dc:description>  This paper explains why scripted dialogue shares some crucial properties with
discourse. In particular, when scripted dialogues are generated by a Natural
Language Generation system, the generator can apply revision strategies that
cannot normally be used when the dialogue results from an interaction between
autonomous agents (i.e., when the dialogue is not scripted). The paper explains
that the relevant revision operators are best applied at the level of a
dialogue plan and discusses how the generator may decide when to apply a given
revision operator.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  (We apologize for pidgin LaTeX) Schlipf \cite{sch91} proved that Stable Logic
Programming (SLP) solves all $\mathit{NP}$ decision problems. We extend
Schlipf's result to prove that SLP solves all search problems in the class
$\mathit{NP}$. Moreover, we do this in a uniform way as defined in \cite{mt99}.
Specifically, we show that there is a single $\mathrm{DATALOG}^{\neg}$ program
$P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ such that given any Turing machine $M$, any polynomial $p$
with non-negative integer coefficients and any input $\sigma$ of size $n$ over
a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, there is an extensional database
$\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ such that there is a one-to-one correspondence
between the stable models of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$
and the accepting computations of the machine $M$ that reach the final state in
at most $p(n)$ steps. Moreover, $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ can be computed in
polynomial time from $p$, $\sigma$ and the description of $M$ and the decoding
of such accepting computations from its corresponding stable model of
$\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ can be computed in linear
time. A similar statement holds for Default Logic with respect to
$\Sigma_2^\mathrm{P}$-search problems\footnote{The proof of this result
involves additional technical complications and will be a subject of another
publication.}.

 <dc:description>  We introduce several modifications of the partitioning schemes used in
Hoare's quicksort and quickselect algorithms, including ternary schemes which
identify keys less or greater than the pivot. We give estimates for the numbers
of swaps made by each scheme. Our computational experiments indicate that
ternary schemes allow quickselect to identify all keys equal to the selected

more than four is two. All of our algorithms run in O(n) time, where n is the
number of vertices in the graph. In our proofs, we present an embedding
algorithm for graphs with maximum degree three that uses an n x n grid and a
more complex algorithm for embedding a graph with maximum degree four. We also
show a variation using orthogonal edges for maximum degree four graphs that
also uses an n x n grid. The results have implications in graph theory, graph
drawing, and VLSI design.

 <dc:description>  Abductive logic programming offers a formalism to declaratively express and
solve problems in areas such as diagnosis, planning, belief revision and
hypothetical reasoning. Tabled logic programming offers a computational
mechanism that provides a level of declarativity superior to that of Prolog,
and which has supported successful applications in fields such as parsing,
program analysis, and model checking. In this paper we show how to use tabled
logic programming to evaluate queries to abductive frameworks with integrity
constraints when these frameworks contain both default and explicit negation.
The result is the ability to compute abduction over well-founded semantics with
explicit negation and answer sets. Our approach consists of a transformation
and an evaluation method. The transformation adjoins to each objective literal
$O$ in a program, an objective literal $not(O)$ along with rules that ensure
that $not(O)$ will be true if and only if $O$ is false. We call the resulting
program a {\em dual} program. The evaluation method, \wfsmeth, then operates on
the dual program. \wfsmeth{} is sound and complete for evaluating queries to
abductive frameworks whose entailment method is based on either the
well-founded semantics with explicit negation, or on answer sets. Further,
\wfsmeth{} is asymptotically as efficient as any known method for either class
of problems. In addition, when abduction is not desired, \wfsmeth{} operating
on a dual program provides a novel tabling method for evaluating queries to
ground extended programs whose complexity and termination properties are
similar to those of the best tabling methods for the well-founded semantics. A
publicly available meta-interpreter has been developed for \wfsmeth{} using the
XSB system.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the potential of identifying lexical paraphrases within a
single corpus, focusing on the extraction of verb paraphrases. Most previous
approaches detect individual paraphrase instances within a pair (or set) of
comparable corpora, each of them containing roughly the same information, and
rely on the substantial level of correspondence of such corpora. We present a
novel method that successfully detects isolated paraphrase instances within a
single corpus without relying on any a-priori structure and information. A
comparison suggests that an instance-based approach may be combined with a
vector based approach in order to assess better the paraphrase likelihood for
many verb pairs.

 <dc:description>  A new approach to the construction of general persistent polyhierarchical
classifications is proposed. It is based on implicit description of category
polyhierarchy by a generating polyhierarchy of classification criteria.
Similarly to existing approaches, the classification categories are defined by
logical functions encoded by attributive expressions. However, the generating
hierarchy explicitly predefines domains of criteria applicability, and the
semantics of relations between categories is invariant to changes in the
universe composition, extending variety of criteria, and increasing their
cardinalities. The generating polyhierarchy is an independent, compact,
portable, and re-usable information structure serving as a template
classification. It can be associated with one or more particular sets of
objects, included in more general classifications as a standard component, or
used as a prototype for more comprehensive classifications. The approach
dramatically simplifies development and unplanned modifications of persistent
hierarchical classifications compared with tree, DAG, and faceted schemes. It
can be efficiently implemented in common DBMS, while considerably reducing
amount of computer resources required for storage, maintenance, and use of
complex polyhierarchies.

 <dc:description>  We use a Dynamic Bayesian Network to represent compactly a variety of
sublexical and contextual features relevant to Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging.
The outcome is a flexible tagger (LegoTag) with state-of-the-art performance
(3.6% error on a benchmark corpus). We explore the effect of eliminating
redundancy and radically reducing the size of feature vocabularies. We find
that a small but linguistically motivated set of suffixes results in improved
cross-corpora generalization. We also show that a minimal lexicon limited to
function words is sufficient to ensure reasonable performance.

 <dc:description>  The proliferation of the Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting (OAI-PMH) has resulted in the creation of a large number of service
providers, all harvesting from either data providers or aggregators. If data
were available regarding the similarity of metadata records, service providers
could track redundant records across harvests from multiple sources as well as
provide additional end-user services. Due to the large number of metadata
formats and the diverse mapping strategies employed by data providers,
similarity calculation requirements necessitate the use of information
retrieval strategies. We describe an OAI-PMH aggregator implementation that
uses the optional ``&lt;about&gt;'' container to re-export the results of similarity
calculations. Metadata records (3751) were harvested from a NASA data provider
and similarities for the records were computed. The results were useful for
detecting duplicates, similarities and metadata errors.

 <dc:description>  The author taught two courses on cryptography, one at Duke University aimed
at non-mathematics majors and one at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology aimed
at mathematics and computer science majors. Both tried to incorporate technical
and societal aspects of cryptography, with varying emphases. This paper will
discuss the strengths and weaknesses of both courses and compare the
differences in the author's approach.

 <dc:description>  We show that several versions of Floyd and Rivest's algorithm Select [Comm.\
ACM {\bf 18} (1975) 173] for finding the $k$th smallest of $n$ elements require
at most $n+\min\{k,n-k\}+o(n)$ comparisons on average, even when equal elements
occur. This parallels our recent analysis of another variant due to Floyd and
Rivest [Comm. ACM {\bf 18} (1975) 165--172]. Our computational results suggest
that both variants perform well in practice, and may compete with other
selection methods, such as Hoare's Find or quickselect with median-of-3 pivots.

 <dc:description>  In this paper I describe some results on the use of virtual processors
technology for parallelize some SPMD computational programs in a cluster
environment. The tested technology is the INTEL Hyper Threading on real
processors, and the programs are MATLAB 6.5 Release 13 scripts for floating
points computation. By the use of this technology, I tested that a cluster can
run with benefit a number of concurrent processes double the amount of physical
processors. The conclusions of the work concern on the utility and limits of
the used approach. The main result is that using virtual processors is a good
technique for improving parallel programs not only for memory-based
computations, but in the case of massive disk-storage operations too.

 <dc:description>  Interfaces that support multi-lingual content can reach a broader community.
We wish to extend the reach of CITIDEL, a digital library for computing
education materials, to support multiple languages. By doing so, we hope that
it will increase the number of users, and in turn the number of resources. This
paper discusses three approaches to translation (automated translation,
developer-based, and community-based), and a brief evaluation of these
approaches. It proposes a design for an online community translation center
where volunteers help translate interface components and educational materials
available in CITIDEL.

 <dc:description>  Fortran 77 programs for the computation of modified Bessel functions of
purely imaginary order are presented. The codes compute the functions
$K_{ia}(x)$, $L_{ia}(x)$ and their derivatives for real $a$ and positive $x$;
these functions are independent solutions of the differential equation $x^2 w''
+x w' +(a^2 -x^2)w=0$. The code also computes exponentially scaled functions.
The range of computation is $(x,a)\in (0,1500]\times [-1500,1500]$ when scaled
functions are considered and it is larger than $(0,500]\times [-400,400]$ for
standard IEEE double precision arithmetic. The relative accuracy is better than
$10^{-13}$ in the range $(0,200]\times [-200,200]$ and close to $10^{-12}$ in
$(0,1500]\times [-1500,1500]$.

 <dc:description>  This book develops the conjecture that all kinds of information processing in
computers and in brains may usefully be understood as &quot;information compression
by multiple alignment, unification and search&quot;. This &quot;SP theory&quot;, which has
been under development since 1987, provides a unified view of such things as
the workings of a universal Turing machine, the nature of 'knowledge', the
interpretation and production of natural language, pattern recognition and
best-match information retrieval, several kinds of probabilistic reasoning,
planning and problem solving, unsupervised learning, and a range of concepts in
mathematics and logic. The theory also provides a basis for the design of an
'SP' computer with several potential advantages compared with traditional
digital computers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we model the cost incurred by each peer participating in a
peer-to-peer network. Such a cost model allows to gauge potential disincentives
for peers to collaborate, and provides a measure of the ``total cost'' of a
network, which is a possible benchmark to distinguish between proposals. We
characterize the cost imposed on a node as a function of the experienced load
and the node connectivity, and show how our model applies to a few proposed
routing geometries for distributed hash tables (DHTs). We further outline a
number of open questions this research has raised.

 <dc:description>  An analysis of the average-case complexity of solving random 3-Satisfiability
(SAT) instances with backtrack algorithms is presented. We first interpret
previous rigorous works in a unifying framework based on the statistical
physics notions of dynamical trajectories, phase diagram and growth process. It
is argued that, under the action of the Davis--Putnam--Loveland--Logemann
(DPLL) algorithm, 3-SAT instances are turned into 2+p-SAT instances whose
characteristic parameters (ratio alpha of clauses per variable, fraction p of
3-clauses) can be followed during the operation, and define resolution
trajectories. Depending on the location of trajectories in the phase diagram of
the 2+p-SAT model, easy (polynomial) or hard (exponential) resolutions are
generated. Three regimes are identified, depending on the ratio alpha of the
3-SAT instance to be solved. Lower sat phase: for small ratios, DPLL almost
surely finds a solution in a time growing linearly with the number N of
variables. Upper sat phase: for intermediate ratios, instances are almost
surely satisfiable but finding a solution requires exponential time (2 ^ (N
omega) with omega&gt;0) with high probability. Unsat phase: for large ratios,
there is almost always no solution and proofs of refutation are exponential. An
analysis of the growth of the search tree in both upper sat and unsat regimes
is presented, and allows us to estimate omega as a function of alpha. This
analysis is based on an exact relationship between the average size of the
search tree and the powers of the evolution operator encoding the elementary
steps of the search heuristic.

The two automata have the same behaviour.

 <dc:title>Verification of Process Rewrite Systems in normal form</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bozzelli, Laura</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>68Q60</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of model--checking for Process Rewrite Systems (PRSs)
in normal form. In a PRS in normal form every rewrite rule either only deals
with procedure calls and procedure termination, possibly with value return,
(this kind of rules allows to capture Pushdown Processes), or only deals with
dynamic activation of processes and synchronization (this kind of rules allows
to capture Petri Nets). The model-checking problem for PRSs and action-based
linear temporal logic (ALTL) is undecidable. However, decidability of
model--checking for PRSs and some interesting fragment of ALTL remains an open
question. In this paper we state decidability results concerning generalized
acceptance properties about infinite derivations (infinite term rewritings) in
PRSs in normal form. As a consequence, we obtain decidability of the
model-checking (restricted to infinite runs) for PRSs in normal form and a
meaningful fragment of ALTL.

 <dc:title>Nested Intervals with Farey Fractions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>H.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Relational Databases are universally conceived as an advance over their
predecessors Network and Hierarchical models. Superior in every querying
respect, they turned out to be surprisingly incomplete when modeling transitive
dependencies. Almost every couple of months a question how to model a tree in
the database surfaces at comp.database.theory newsgroup. This article completes
a series of articles exploring Nested Intervals Model. Previous articles
introduced tree encoding with Binary Rational Numbers. However, binary encoding
grows exponentially, both in breadth and in depth. In this article, we'll
leverage Farey fractions in order to overcome this problem. We'll also
demonstrate that our implementation scales to a tree with 1M nodes.

 <dc:description>  The problem of answering queries posed to a peer who is a member of a
peer-to-peer data exchange system is studied. The answers have to be consistent
wrt to both the local semantic constraints and the data exchange constraints
with other peers; and must also respect certain trust relationships between
peers. A semantics for peer consistent answers under exchange constraints and
trust relationships is introduced and some techniques for obtaining those
answers are presented.

 <dc:description>  Standard abstract model checking relies on abstract Kripke structures which
approximate concrete models by gluing together indistinguishable states, namely
by a partition of the concrete state space. Strong preservation for a
specification language L encodes the equivalence of concrete and abstract model
checking of formulas in L. We show how abstract interpretation can be used to
design abstract models that are more general than abstract Kripke structures.
Accordingly, strong preservation is generalized to abstract
interpretation-based models and precisely related to the concept of
completeness in abstract interpretation. The problem of minimally refining an
abstract model in order to make it strongly preserving for some language L can
be formulated as a minimal domain refinement in abstract interpretation in
order to get completeness w.r.t. the logical/temporal operators of L. It turns
out that this refined strongly preserving abstract model always exists and can
be characterized as a greatest fixed point. As a consequence, some well-known
behavioural equivalences, like bisimulation, simulation and stuttering, and
their corresponding partition refinement algorithms can be elegantly
characterized in abstract interpretation as completeness properties and
refinements.

 <dc:title>Better Foreground Segmentation Through Graph Cuts</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>I.4.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For many tracking and surveillance applications, background subtraction
provides an effective means of segmenting objects moving in front of a static
background. Researchers have traditionally used combinations of morphological
operations to remove the noise inherent in the background-subtracted result.
Such techniques can effectively isolate foreground objects, but tend to lose
fidelity around the borders of the segmentation, especially for noisy input.
This paper explores the use of a minimum graph cut algorithm to segment the
foreground, resulting in qualitatively and quantitiatively cleaner
segmentations. Experiments on both artificial and real data show that the
graph-based method reduces the error around segmented foreground objects. A
MATLAB code implementation is available at

 <dc:description>  While it is well known that a Turing machine equipped with the ability to
flip a fair coin cannot compute more that a standard Turing machine, we show
that this is not true for a biased coin. Indeed, any oracle set $X$ may be
coded as a probability $p_{X}$ such that if a Turing machine is given a coin
which lands heads with probability $p_{X}$ it can compute any function
recursive in $X$ with arbitrarily high probability. We also show how the
assumption of a non-recursive bias can be weakened by using a sequence of
increasingly accurate recursive biases or by choosing the bias at random from a
distribution with a non-recursive mean. We conclude by briefly mentioning some
implications regarding the physical realisability of such methods.

 <dc:title>Presynaptic modulation as fast synaptic switching: state-dependent

 <dc:description>  Neuromodulatory receptors in presynaptic position have the ability to
suppress synaptic transmission for seconds to minutes when fully engaged. This
effectively alters the synaptic strength of a connection. Much work on
neuromodulation has rested on the assumption that these effects are uniform at
every neuron. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that
presynaptic regulation may be in effect synapse-specific. This would define a
second &quot;weight modulation&quot; matrix, which reflects presynaptic receptor efficacy
at a given site. Here we explore functional consequences of this hypothesis. By
analyzing and comparing the weight matrices of networks trained on different
aspects of a task, we identify the potential for a low complexity &quot;modulation
matrix&quot;, which allows to switch between differently trained subtasks while
retaining general performance characteristics for the task. This means that a
given network can adapt itself to different task demands by regulating its
release of neuromodulators. Specifically, we suggest that (a) a network can
provide optimized responses for related classification tasks without the need
to train entirely separate networks and (b) a network can blend a &quot;memory mode&quot;
which aims at reproducing memorized patterns and a &quot;novelty mode&quot; which aims to
facilitate classification of new patterns. We relate this work to the known
effects of neuromodulators on brain-state dependent processing.

 <dc:description>  It is well-known that freeness and linearity information positively interact
with aliasing information, allowing both the precision and the efficiency of
the sharing analysis of logic programs to be improved. In this paper we present
a novel combination of set-sharing with freeness and linearity information,
which is characterized by an improved abstract unification operator. We provide
a new abstraction function and prove the correctness of the analysis for both
the finite tree and the rational tree cases. Moreover, we show that the same
notion of redundant information as identified in (Bagnara et al. 2002;
Zaffanella et al. 2002) also applies to this abstract domain combination: this
allows for the implementation of an abstract unification operator running in
polynomial time and achieving the same precision on all the considered
observable properties.

 <dc:description>  Sharing, an abstract domain developed by D. Jacobs and A. Langen for the
analysis of logic programs, derives useful aliasing information. It is
well-known that a commonly used core of techniques, such as the integration of
Sharing with freeness and linearity information, can significantly improve the
precision of the analysis. However, a number of other proposals for refined
domain combinations have been circulating for years. One feature that is common
to these proposals is that they do not seem to have undergone a thorough
experimental evaluation even with respect to the expected precision gains. In
this paper we experimentally evaluate: helping Sharing with the definitely
ground variables found using Pos, the domain of positive Boolean formulas; the
incorporation of explicit structural information; a full implementation of the
reduced product of Sharing and Pos; the issue of reordering the bindings in the
computation of the abstract mgu; an original proposal for the addition of a new
mode recording the set of variables that are deemed to be ground or free; a
refined way of using linearity to improve the analysis; the recovery of hidden
information in the combination of Sharing with freeness information. Finally,
we discuss the issue of whether tracking compoundness allows the computation of
more sharing information.

 <dc:description>  We embark in a program of studying the problem of better approximating
surfaces by triangulations(triangular meshes) by considering the approximating
triangulations as finite metric spaces and the target smooth surface as their
Haussdorff-Gromov limit. This allows us to define in a more natural way the
relevant elements, constants and invariants s.a. principal directions and
principal values, Gaussian and Mean curvature, etc. By a &quot;natural way&quot; we mean
an intrinsic, discrete, metric definitions as opposed to approximating or
paraphrasing the differentiable notions. In this way we hope to circumvent
computational errors and, indeed, conceptual ones, that are often inherent to
the classical, &quot;numerical&quot; approach. In this first study we consider the
problem of determining the Gaussian curvature of a polyhedral surface, by using
the {\em embedding curvature} in the sense of Wald (and Menger). We present two
modalities of employing these definitions for the computation of Gaussian
curvature.

 <dc:description>  Object-oriented programming languages such as Java and Objective C have
become popular for implementing agent-based and other object-based simulations
since objects in those languages can {\em reflect} (i.e. make runtime queries
of an object's structure). This allows, for example, a fairly trivial {\em
serialisation} routine (conversion of an object into a binary representation
that can be stored or passed over a network) to be written. However C++ does
not offer this ability, as type information is thrown away at compile time. Yet
C++ is often a preferred development environment, whether for performance
reasons or for its expressive features such as operator overloading.
  In this paper, we present the {\em Classdesc} system which brings many of the
benefits of object reflection to C++.

 <dc:description>  Objective-C is still the language of choice if users want to run their
simulation efficiently under the Swarm environment since the Swarm environment
itself was written in Objective-C. The language is a fast, object-oriented and
easy to learn. However, the language is less well known than, less expressive
than, and lacks support for many important features of C++ (eg. OpenMP for high
performance computing application). In this paper, we present a methodology and
software tools that we have developed for auto generating an Objective-C object
template (and all the necessary interfacing functions) from a given C++ model,
utilising the Classdesc's object description technology, so that the C++ model
can both be run and accessed under the Objective-C and C++ environments. We
also present a methodology for modifying an existing Swarm application to make
part of the model (eg. the heatbug's step method) run under the C++
environment.

 <dc:description>  ClassdescMP is a distributed memory parallel programming system for use with
C++ and MPI. It uses the Classdesc reflection system to ease the task of
building complicated messages to be sent between processes. It doesn't hide the
underlying MPI API, so it is an augmentation of MPI capabilities. Users can
still call standard MPI function calls if needed for performance reasons.

 <dc:description>  We describe a system used by the NASA Astrophysics Data System to identify
bibliographic references obtained from scanned article pages by OCR methods
with records in a bibliographic database. We analyze the process generating the
noisy references and conclude that the three-step procedure of correcting the
OCR results, parsing the corrected string and matching it against the database
provides unsatisfactory results. Instead, we propose a method that allows a
controlled merging of correction, parsing and matching, inspired by dependency
grammars. We also report on the effectiveness of various heuristics that we
have employed to improve recall.

 <dc:description>  We discuss a methodology to dynamically generate links among digital objects
by means of an unsupervised learning mechanism which analyzes user link
traversal patterns. We performed an experiment with a test bed of 150 complex
data objects, referred to as buckets. Each bucket manages its own content,
provides methods to interact with users and individually maintains a set of
links to other buckets. We demonstrate that buckets were capable of dynamically
adjusting their links to other buckets according to user link selections,
thereby generating a meaningful network of bucket relations. Our results
indicate such adaptive networks of linked buckets approximate the collective
link preferences of a community of user

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>E.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper study counter-dependent pseudorandom generators; the latter are
generators such that their state transition function (and output function) is
being modified dynamically while working: For such a generator the recurrence
sequence of states satisfies a congruence $x_{i+1}\equiv f_i(x_i)\pmod{2^n}$,
while its output sequence is of the form $z_{i}=F_i(u_i)$. The paper introduces
techniques and constructions that enable one to compose generators that output
uniformly distributed sequences of a maximum period length and with high linear
and 2-adic spans. The corresponding stream chipher is provably strong against a
known plaintext attack (up to a plausible conjecture). Both state transition
function and output function could be key-dependent, so the only information
available to a cryptanalyst is that these functions belong to some
(exponentially large) class. These functions are compositions of standard
machine instructions (such as addition, multiplication, bitwise logical
operations, etc.) The compositions should satisfy rather loose conditions; so
the corresponding generators are flexible enough and could be easily
implemented as computer programs.

 <dc:description>  Mobile access to information is a considerable problem for many users,
especially to information found on the Web. In this paper, we explore how a
voice-controlled service, accessible by telephone, could support mobile users'
needs for refinding specific information previously found on the Web. We
outline challenges in creating such a service and describe architectural and
user interfaces issues discovered in an exploratory prototype we built called
WebContext.
  We also present the results of a study, motivated by our experience with
WebContext, to explore what people remember about information that they are
trying to refind and how they express information refinding requests in a
collaborative conversation. As part of the study, we examine how
end-usercreated Web page annotations can be used to help support mobile
information re-finding. We observed the use of URLs, page titles, and
descriptions of page contents to help identify waypoints in the search process.
Furthermore, we observed that the annotations were utilized extensively,
indicating that explicitly added context by the user can play an important role
in re-finding.

 <dc:title>Deciding Disjunctive Linear Arithmetic with SAT</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Strichman, Ofer</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>B.1.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Disjunctive Linear Arithmetic (DLA) is a major decidable theory that is
supported by almost all existing theorem provers. The theory consists of
Boolean combinations of predicates of the form $\Sigma_{j=1}^{n}a_j\cdot x_j
\le b$, where the coefficients $a_j$, the bound $b$ and the variables $x_1 &gt;...
x_n$ are of type Real ($\mathbb{R}$). We show a reduction to propositional
logic from disjunctive linear arithmetic based on Fourier-Motzkin elimination.
While the complexity of this procedure is not better than competing techniques,
it has practical advantages in solving verification problems. It also promotes
the option of deciding a combination of theories by reducing them to this
logic. Results from experiments show that this method has a strong advantage
over existing techniques when there are many disjunctions in the formula.

 <dc:title>Semantic Optimization of Preference Queries</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The notion of preference is becoming more and more ubiquitous in present-day
information systems. Preferences are primarily used to filter and personalize
the information reaching the users of such systems. In database systems,
preferences are usually captured as preference relations that are used to build
preference queries. In our approach, preference queries are relational algebra
or SQL queries that contain occurrences of the winnow operator (&quot;find the most
preferred tuples in a given relation&quot;).
  We present here a number of semantic optimization techniques applicable to
preference queries. The techniques make use of integrity constraints, and make
it possible to remove redundant occurrences of the winnow operator and to apply
a more efficient algorithm for the computation of winnow. We also study the
propagation of integrity constraints in the result of the winnow. We have
identified necessary and sufficient conditions for the applicability of our
techniques, and formulated those conditions as constraint satisfiability
problems.

 <dc:description>  In 1998, M. S. Baptista proposed a chaotic cryptosystem, which has attracted
much attention from the chaotic cryptography community: some of its
modifications and also attacks have been reported in recent years. In [Phys.
Lett. A 307 (2003) 22], we suggested a method to enhance the security of
Baptista-type cryptosystem, which can successfully resist all proposed attacks.
However, the enhanced Baptista-type cryptosystem has a nontrivial defect, which
produces errors in the decrypted data with a generally small but nonzero
probability, and the consequent error propagation exists. In this Letter, we
analyze this defect and discuss how to rectify it. In addition, we point out
some newly-found problems existing in all Baptista-type cryptosystems and
consequently propose corresponding countermeasures.

 <dc:description>  Breast cancer as a medical condition and mammograms as images exhibit many
dimensions of variability across the population. Similarly, the way diagnostic
systems are used and maintained by clinicians varies between imaging centres
and breast screening programmes, and so does the appearance of the mammograms
generated. A distributed database that reflects the spread of pathologies
across the population is an invaluable tool for the epidemiologist and the
understanding of the variation in image acquisition protocols is essential to a
radiologist in a screening programme. Exploiting emerging grid technology, the
aim of the MammoGrid [1] project is to develop a Europe-wide database of
mammograms that will be used to investigate a set of important healthcare
applications and to explore the potential of the grid to support effective
co-working between healthcare professionals.

 <dc:description>  CERN's (European Organization for Nuclear Research) WISDOM project uses XML
for the replication of data between different data repositories in a
heterogeneous operating system environment. For exchanging data from
Web-resident databases, the data needs to be transformed into XML and back to
the database format. Many different approaches are employed to do this
transformation. This paper addresses issues that make this job more efficient
and robust than existing approaches. It incorporates the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) XML Schema specification in the database-XML relationship.
Incorporation of the XML Schema exhibits significant improvements in XML
content usage and reduces the limitations of DTD-based database XML services.
Secondly the paper explores the possibility of database independent
transformation of data between XML and different databases. It proposes a
standard XML format that every serialized object should follow. This makes it
possible to use objects of heterogeneous database seamlessly using XML.

 <dc:description>  We report on the application of the use-case modeling technique to identify
and specify the user requirements of the MammoGrid project in an incremental
and controlled iterative approach. Modeling has been carried out in close
collaboration with clinicians and radiologists with no prior experience of use
cases. The study reveals the advantages and limitations of applying this
technique to requirements specification in the domains of breast cancer
screening and mammography research, with implications for medical imaging more
generally. In addition, this research has shown a return on investment in
use-case modeling in shorter gaps between phases of the requirements
engineering process. The qualitative result of this analysis leads us to
propose that a use-case modeling approach may result in reducing the cycle of
the requirements engineering process for medical imaging.

 <dc:description>  The past decade has witnessed order of magnitude increases in computing
power, data storage capacity and network speed, giving birth to applications
which may handle large data volumes of increased complexity, distributed over
the Internet. Grids computing promises to resolve many of the difficulties in
facilitating medical image analysis to allow radiologists to collaborate
without having to co-locate. The EU-funded MammoGrid project aims to
investigate the feasibility of developing a Grid-enabled European database of
mammograms and provide an information infrastructure which federates multiple
mammogram databases. This will enable clinicians to develop new common,
collaborative and co-operative approaches to the analysis of mammographic data.
This paper focuses on one of the key requirements for large-scale distributed
mammogram analysis: resolving queries across a grid-connected federation of
images.

 <dc:description>  ACL2 was used to prove properties of two simplification procedures. The
procedures differ in complexity but solve the same programming problem that
arises in the context of a resolution/paramodulation theorem proving system.
Term rewriting is at the core of the two procedures, but details of the
rewriting procedure itself are irrelevant. The ACL2 encapsulate construct was
used to assert the existence of the rewriting function and to state some of its
properties. Termination, irreducibility, and soundness properties were
established for each procedure. The availability of the encapsulation mechanism
in ACL2 is considered essential to rapid and efficient verification of this
kind of algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Based on measurements of the Internet topology data, we found out that there
are two mechanisms which are necessary for the correct modeling of the Internet
topology at the Autonomous Systems (AS) level: the Interactive Growth of new
nodes and new internal links, and a nonlinear preferential attachment, where
the preference probability is described by a positive-feedback mechanism. Based
on the above mechanisms, we introduce the Positive-Feedback Preference (PFP)
model which accurately reproduces many topological properties of the AS-level
Internet, including: degree distribution, rich-club connectivity, the maximum
degree, shortest path length, short cycles, disassortative mixing and
betweenness centrality. The PFP model is a phenomenological model which
provides a novel insight into the evolutionary dynamics of real complex
networks.

 <dc:description>  It is shown that, in a precise sense, if there is no bound on the number of
faulty processes in a system with unreliable but fair communication, Uniform
Distributed Coordination (UDC) can be attained if and only if a system has
perfect failure detectors. This result is generalized to the case where there
is a bound t on the number of faulty processes. It is shown that a certain type
of generalized failure detector is necessary and sufficient for achieving UDC
in a context with at most t faulty processes. Reasoning about processes'
knowledge as to which other processes are faulty plays a key role in the
analysis.

 <dc:title>Corollaries on the fixpoint completion: studying the stable semantics by

 <dc:description>  The fixpoint completion fix(P) of a normal logic program P is a program
transformation such that the stable models of P are exactly the models of the
Clark completion of fix(P). This is well-known and was studied by Dung and
Kanchanasut (1989). The correspondence, however, goes much further: The
Gelfond-Lifschitz operator of P coincides with the immediate consequence
operator of fix(P), as shown by Wendt (2002), and even carries over to standard
operators used for characterizing the well-founded and the Kripke-Kleene
semantics. We will apply this knowledge to the study of the stable semantics,
and this will allow us to almost effortlessly derive new results concerning
fixed-point and metric-based semantics, and neural-symbolic integration.

 <dc:description>  Physics analysis in astroparticle experiments requires the capability of
recognizing new phenomena; in order to establish what is new, it is important
to develop tools for automatic classification, able to compare the final result
with data from different detectors. A typical example is the problem of Gamma
Ray Burst detection, classification, and possible association to known sources:
for this task physicists will need in the next years tools to associate data
from optical databases, from satellite experiments (EGRET, GLAST), and from
Cherenkov telescopes (MAGIC, HESS, CANGAROO, VERITAS).

 <dc:description>  The Function Points Analysis (FPA) of A.J. Albrecht is a method to determine
the functional size of software products. The International Function Point
Users Group, (IFPUG), establishes the FPA like a standard in the software
functional size measurement. The IFPUG [3] [4] method follows the Albrecht's
method and incorporates in its succesive versions modifications to the rules
and hints with the intention of improving it [7]. The required documentation
level to apply the method is the functional specification which corresponds to
level I in the Rudolph's clasification [8]. This documentation is avalaible
with some difficulty for those companies which are dedicated to develop
software for third parties when they have to prepare the appropiate budget for
this development. Then, we face the need of developing an early method [6] [9]
for measuring the functional size of a software product that we will name to
abbreviate it Early Method or EFPM (Early Function Point Method). The required
documentation to apply the EFPM would be the User Requirements or some
analogous documentations. This is a part of a research work now in process in
Oviedo University. In this article we only show the following, results:
  From the measurements of a set of projects using the IFPUG method v. 4.1 we
obtain the linear correlation coefficients between the total number of Function
Points for each project and the counters of the ILFs number, ILFs+EIFs number
and EIs+EOs+EQs number.
  Using the preliminary results we compute the regression functions. This
results we will allow us to determine the factors to be considered in the
development of EFPM and to estimate the function points.

 <dc:description>  Astrophysics has become a domain extremely rich of scientific data. Data
mining tools are needed for information extraction from such large datasets.
This asks for an approach to data management emphasizing the efficiency and
simplicity of data access; efficiency is obtained using multidimensional access
methods and simplicity is achieved by properly handling metadata. Moreover,
clustering and classification techniques on large datasets pose additional
requirements in terms of computation and memory scalability and
interpretability of results. In this study we review some possible solutions.

 <dc:description>  Computational grids that couple geographically distributed resources are
becoming the de-facto computing platform for solving large-scale problems in
science, engineering, and commerce. Software to enable grid computing has been
primarily written for Unix-class operating systems, thus severely limiting the
ability to effectively utilize the computing resources of the vast majority of
desktop computers i.e. those running variants of the Microsoft Windows
operating system. Addressing Windows-based grid computing is particularly
important from the software industry's viewpoint where interest in grids is
emerging rapidly. Microsoft's .NET Framework has become near-ubiquitous for
implementing commercial distributed systems for Windows-based platforms,
positioning it as the ideal platform for grid computing in this context. In
this paper we present Alchemi, a .NET-based grid computing framework that
provides the runtime machinery and programming environment required to
construct desktop grids and develop grid applications. It allows flexible
application composition by supporting an object-oriented grid application
programming model in addition to a grid job model. Cross-platform support is
provided via a web services interface and a flexible execution model supports
dedicated and non-dedicated (voluntary) execution by grid nodes.

 <dc:description>  Peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies have been widely used for content sharing,
popularly called &quot;file-swapping&quot; networks. This chapter gives a broad overview
of content sharing P2P technologies. It starts with the fundamental concept of
P2P computing followed by the analysis of network topologies used in
peer-to-peer systems. Next, three milestone peer-to-peer technologies: Napster,
Gnutella, and Fasttrack are explored in details, and they are finally concluded
with the comparison table in the last section.

 <dc:description>  Most cities in Germany regularly publish a booklet called the {\em
Mietspiegel}. It basically contains a verbal description of an expert system.
It allows the calculation of the estimated fair rent for a flat. By hand, one
may need a weekend to do so. With our computerized version, the {\em Munich
Rent Advisor}, the user just fills in a form in a few minutes and the rent is
calculated immediately. We also extended the functionality and applicability of
the {\em Mietspiegel} so that the user need not answer all questions on the
form. The key to computing with partial information using high-level
programming was to use constraint logic programming. We rely on the internet,
and more specifically the World Wide Web, to provide this service to a broad
user group. More than ten thousand people have used our service in the last
three years. This article describes the experiences in implementing and using
the {\em Munich Rent Advisor}. Our results suggests that logic programming with
constraints can be an important ingredient in intelligent internet systems.

 <dc:description>  Despite encouraging recent progresses in ensemble approaches, classification
methods seem to have reached a plateau in development. Further advances depend
on a better understanding of geometrical and topological characteristics of
point sets in high-dimensional spaces, the preservation of such characteristics
under feature transformations and sampling processes, and their interaction
with geometrical models used in classifiers. We discuss an attempt to measure
such properties from data sets and relate them to classifier accuracies.

 <dc:description>  Studies on ensemble methods for classification suffer from the difficulty of
modeling the complementary strengths of the components. Kleinberg's theory of
stochastic discrimination (SD) addresses this rigorously via mathematical
notions of enrichment, uniformity, and projectability of an ensemble. We
explain these concepts via a very simple numerical example that captures the
basic principles of the SD theory and method. We focus on a fundamental
symmetry in point set covering that is the key observation leading to the
foundation of the theory. We believe a better understanding of the SD method
will lead to developments of better tools for analyzing other ensemble methods.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to automatically generate interfaces supporting
personalized interaction with digital libraries; these interfaces augment the
user-DL dialog by empowering the user to (optionally) supply out-of-turn
information during an interaction, flatten or restructure the dialog, and
enquire about dialog options. Interfaces generated using this approach for
CITIDEL are described.

 <dc:description>  Grid-based technologies are emerging as a potential open-source
standards-based solution for managing and collabo-rating distributed resources.
In view of these new computing solutions, the Mammogrid project is developing a
service-based and Grid-aware application which manages a Euro-pean-wide
database of mammograms. Medical conditions such as breast cancer, and
mammograms as images, are ex-tremely complex with many dimensions of
variability across the population. An effective solution for the management of
disparate mammogram data sources is a federation of autonomous multi-centre
sites which transcends national boundaries. The Mammogrid solution utilizes the
Grid tech-nologies to integrate geographically distributed data sets. The
Mammogrid application will explore the potential of the Grid to support
effective co-working among radiologists through-out the EU. This paper outlines
the Mammogrid service-based approach in managing a federation of grid-connected
mam-mography databases.

 <dc:description>  One of the main factors driving object-oriented software development for
information systems is the requirement for systems to be tolerant to change. To
address this issue in designing systems, this paper proposes a pattern-based,
object-oriented, description-driven system (DDS) architecture as an extension
to the standard UML four-layer meta-model. A DDS architecture is proposed in
which aspects of both static and dynamic systems behavior can be captured via
descriptive models and meta-models. The proposed architecture embodies four
main elements - firstly, the adoption of a multi-layered meta-modeling
architecture and reflective meta-level architecture, secondly the
identification of four data modeling relationships that can be made explicit
such that they can be modified dynamically, thirdly the identification of five
design patterns which have emerged from practice and have proved essential in
providing reusable building blocks for data management, and fourthly the
encoding of the structural properties of the five design patterns by means of
one fundamental pattern, the Graph pattern. A practical example of this
philosophy, the CRISTAL project, is used to demonstrate the use of
description-driven data objects to handle system evolution.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a perspective on the Healthgrid initiative which involves
European projects deploying pioneering applications of grid technology in the
health sector. In the last couple of years, several grid projects have been
funded on health related issues at national and European levels. A crucial
issue is to maximize their cross fertilization in the context of an environment
where data of medical interest can be stored and made easily available to the
different actors in healthcare, physicians, healthcare centres and
administrations, and of course the citizens. The Healthgrid initiative,
represented by the Healthgrid association (http://www.healthgrid.org), was
initiated to bring the necessary long term continuity, to reinforce and promote
awareness of the possibilities and advantages linked to the deployment of GRID
technologies in health. Technologies to address the specific requirements for
medical applications are under development. Results from the DataGrid and other
projects are given as examples of early applications.

 <dc:description>  Modern interconnects often have programmable processors in the network
interface that can be utilized to offload communication processing from host
CPU. In this paper, we explore different schemes to support collective
operations at the network interface and propose a new collective protocol. With
barrier as an initial case study, we have demontrated that much of the
communication processing can be greatly simplified with this collective
protocol. Accordingly, %with our proposed collective processing scheme, we have
designed and implemented efficient and scalable NIC-based barrier operations
over two high performance interconnects, Quadrics and Myrinet.
  Our evaluation shows that, over a Quadrics cluster of 8 nodes with ELan3
Network, the NIC-based barrier operation achieves a barrier latency of only
5.60$\mu$s. This result is a 2.48 factor of improvement over the Elanlib
tree-based barrier operation. Over a Myrinet cluster of 8 nodes with LANai-XP
NIC cards, a barrier latency of 14.20$\mu$s over 8 nodes is achieved. This is a
2.64 factor of improvement over the host-based barrier algorithm. Furthermore,
an analytical model developed for the proposed scheme indicates that a
NIC-based barrier operation on a 1024-node cluster can be performed with only
22.13$\mu$s latency over Quadrics and with 38.94$\mu$s latency over Myrinet.
These results indicate the potential for developing high performance
communication subsystems for next generation clusters.

 <dc:description>  Scientific research is highly dynamic. New areas of science continually
evolve;others gain or lose importance, merge or split. Due to the steady
increase in the number of scientific publications it is hard to keep an
overview of the structure and dynamic development of one's own field of
science, much less all scientific domains. However, knowledge of hot topics,
emergent research frontiers, or change of focus in certain areas is a critical
component of resource allocation decisions in research labs, governmental
institutions, and corporations. This paper demonstrates the utilization of
Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm, co-word occurrence analysis, and graph
layout techniques to generate maps that support the identification of major
research topics and trends. The approach was applied to analyze and map the
complete set of papers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences (PNAS) in the years 1982-2001. Six domain experts examined and
commented on the resulting maps in an attempt to reconstruct the evolution of
major research areas covered by PNAS.

 <dc:description>  We discuss the computational complexity of random 2D Ising spin glasses,
which represent an interesting class of constraint satisfaction problems for
black box optimization. Two extremal cases are considered: (1) the +/- J spin
glass, and (2) the Gaussian spin glass. We also study a smooth transition
between these two extremal cases. The computational complexity of all studied
spin glass systems is found to be dominated by rare events of extremely hard
spin glass samples. We show that complexity of all studied spin glass systems
is closely related to Frechet extremal value distribution. In a hybrid
algorithm that combines the hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA)
with a deterministic bit-flip hill climber, the number of steps performed by
both the global searcher (hBOA) and the local searcher follow Frechet
distributions. Nonetheless, unlike in methods based purely on local search, the
parameters of these distributions confirm good scalability of hBOA with local
search. We further argue that standard performance measures for optimization
algorithms--such as the average number of evaluations until convergence--can be
misleading. Finally, our results indicate that for highly multimodal constraint
satisfaction problems, such as Ising spin glasses, recombination-based search
can provide qualitatively better results than mutation-based search.

 <dc:description>  The parameter-less hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (hBOA)
enables the use of hBOA without the need for tuning parameters for solving each
problem instance. There are three crucial parameters in hBOA: (1) the selection
pressure, (2) the window size for restricted tournaments, and (3) the
population size. Although both the selection pressure and the window size
influence hBOA performance, performance should remain low-order polynomial with
standard choices of these two parameters. However, there is no standard
population size that would work for all problems of interest and the population
size must thus be eliminated in a different way. To eliminate the population
size, the parameter-less hBOA adopts the population-sizing technique of the
parameter-less genetic algorithm. Based on the existing theory, the
parameter-less hBOA should be able to solve nearly decomposable and
hierarchical problems in quadratic or subquadratic number of function
evaluations without the need for setting any parameters whatsoever. A number of
experiments are presented to verify scalability of the parameter-less hBOA.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes how fitness inheritance can be used to estimate fitness
for a proportion of newly sampled candidate solutions in the Bayesian
optimization algorithm (BOA). The goal of estimating fitness for some candidate
solutions is to reduce the number of fitness evaluations for problems where
fitness evaluation is expensive. Bayesian networks used in BOA to model
promising solutions and generate the new ones are extended to allow not only
for modeling and sampling candidate solutions, but also for estimating their
fitness. The results indicate that fitness inheritance is a promising concept
in BOA, because population-sizing requirements for building appropriate models
of promising solutions lead to good fitness estimates even if only a small
proportion of candidate solutions is evaluated using the actual fitness
function. This can lead to a reduction of the number of actual fitness
evaluations by a factor of 30 or more.

 <dc:title>Recycling Computed Answers in Rewrite Systems for Abduction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In rule-based systems, goal-oriented computations correspond naturally to the
possible ways that an observation may be explained. In some applications, we
need to compute explanations for a series of observations with the same domain.
The question whether previously computed answers can be recycled arises. A yes
answer could result in substantial savings of repeated computations. For
systems based on classic logic, the answer is YES. For nonmonotonic systems
however, one tends to believe that the answer should be NO, since recycling is
a form of adding information. In this paper, we show that computed answers can
always be recycled, in a nontrivial way, for the class of rewrite procedures
that we proposed earlier for logic programs with negation. We present some
experimental results on an encoding of the logistics domain.

 <dc:description>  We study partitions of Fra\&quot;{\i}ss\'{e} limits of classes of finite
relational structures where the partitions are encoded by infinite binary
sequences which are random in the sense of Kolmogorov, Chaitin and Solomonoff.
It is shown that partition by a random sequence of a Fra\&quot;{\i}ss\'{e} limit
preserves the limit property of the object.

 <dc:title>Memory As A Monadic Control Construct In Problem-Solving</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chauvet, Jean-Marie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>6Q655</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent advances in programming languages study and design have established a
standard way of grounding computational systems representation in category
theory. These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control
and side-effects in functional and imperative languages. This framework can be
successfully applied to the investigation of the performance of Artificial
Intelligence (AI) inference and cognitive systems. In this paper, we delineate
a categorical formalisation of memory as a control structure driving
performance in inference systems. Abstracting away control mechanisms from
three widely used representations of memory in cognitive systems (scripts,
production rules and clusters) we explain how categorical triples capture the
interaction between learning and problem-solving.

 <dc:title>The pre-history of quantum computation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Potgieter, P. H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - General Literature</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The main ideas behind developments in the theory and technology of quantum
computation were formulated in the late 1970s and early 1980s by two physicists
in the West and a mathematician in the former Soviet Union. It is not generally
known in the West that the subject has roots in the Russian technical
literature. The author hopes to present as impartial a synthesis as possible of
the early history of thought on this subject. The role of reversible and
irreversible computational processes is examined briefly as it relates to the
origins of quantum computing and the so-called Information Paradox in physics.

 <dc:description>  The inequations of the delays of the asynchronous circuits are written, by
making use of pseudo-Boolean differential calculus. We consider these efforts
to be a possible starting point in the semi-formalized reconstruction of the
digital electrical engineering (which is a non-formalized theory).

 <dc:description>  We provide a framework for reasoning about information-hiding requirements in
multiagent systems and for reasoning about anonymity in particular. Our
framework employs the modal logic of knowledge within the context of the runs
and systems framework, much in the spirit of our earlier work on secrecy
[Halpern and O'Neill 2002]. We give several definitions of anonymity with
respect to agents, actions, and observers in multiagent systems, and we relate
our definitions of anonymity to other definitions of information hiding, such
as secrecy. We also give probabilistic definitions of anonymity that are able
to quantify an observer s uncertainty about the state of the system. Finally,
we relate our definitions of anonymity to other formalizations of anonymity and
information hiding, including definitions of anonymity in the process algebra
CSP and definitions of information hiding using function views.

 <dc:title>A General Framework for Bounds for Higher-Dimensional Orthogonal Packing

 <dc:description>  Higher-dimensional orthogonal packing problems have a wide range of practical
applications, including packing, cutting, and scheduling. In the context of a
branch-and-bound framework for solving these packing problems to optimality, it
is of crucial importance to have good and easy bounds for an optimal solution.
Previous efforts have produced a number of special classes of such bounds.
Unfortunately, some of these bounds are somewhat complicated and hard to
generalize. We present a new approach for obtaining classes of lower bounds for
higher-dimensional packing problems; our bounds improve and simplify several
well-known bounds from previous literature. In addition, our approach provides
an easy framework for proving correctness of new bounds.

 <dc:description>  An optimization problem that naturally arises in the study of swarm robotics
is the Freeze-Tag Problem (FTP) of how to awaken a set of ``asleep'' robots, by
having an awakened robot move to their locations. Once a robot is awake, it can
assist in awakening other slumbering robots.The objective is to have all robots
awake as early as possible. While the FTP bears some resemblance to problems
from areas in combinatorial optimization such as routing, broadcasting,
scheduling, and covering, its algorithmic characteristics are surprisingly
different. We consider both scenarios on graphs and in geometric
environments.In graphs, robots sleep at vertices and there is a length function
on the edges. Awake robots travel along edges, with time depending on edge
length. For most scenarios, we consider the offline version of the problem, in
which each awake robot knows the position of all other robots. We prove that
the problem is NP-hard, even for the special case of star graphs. We also
establish hardness of approximation, showing that it is NP-hard to obtain an
approximation factor better than 5/3, even for graphs of bounded degree.These
lower bounds are complemented with several positive algorithmic results,
including: (1) We show that the natural greedy strategy on star graphs has a
tight worst-case performance of 7/3 and give a polynomial-time approximation
scheme (PTAS) for star graphs. (2) We give a simple O(log D)-competitive online
algorithm for graphs with maximum degree D and locally bounded edge weights.
(3) We give a PTAS, running in nearly linear time, for geometrically embedded
instances.

 <dc:description>  Unsolicited bulk email (aka. spam) is a major problem on the Internet. To
counter spam, several techniques, ranging from spam filters to mail protocol
extensions like hashcash, have been proposed. In this paper we investigate the
effectiveness of several spam filtering techniques and technologies. Our
analysis was performed by simulating email traffic under different conditions.
We show that genetic algorithm based spam filters perform best at server level
and naive Bayesian filters are the most appropriate for filtering at user
level.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a parameter-less optimization framework that uses the
extended compact genetic algorithm (ECGA) and iterated local search (ILS), but
is not restricted to these algorithms. The presented optimization algorithm
(ILS+ECGA) comes as an extension of the parameter-less genetic algorithm (GA),
where the parameters of a selecto-recombinative GA are eliminated. The approach
that we propose is tested on several well known problems. In the absence of
domain knowledge, it is shown that ILS+ECGA is a robust and easy-to-use
optimization method.

 <dc:description>  We propose a set of transformation rules for constraint logic programs with
negation. We assume that every program is locally stratified and, thus, it has
a unique perfect model. We give sufficient conditions which ensure that the
proposed set of transformation rules preserves the perfect model of the
programs. Our rules extend in some respects the rules for logic programs and
constraint logic programs already considered in the literature and, in
particular, they include a rule for unfolding a clause with respect to a
negative literal.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an architecture which is suitable for a massive
parallelization of the compact genetic algorithm. The resulting scheme has
three major advantages. First, it has low synchronization costs. Second, it is
fault tolerant, and third, it is scalable.
  The paper argues that the benefits that can be obtained with the proposed
approach is potentially higher than those obtained with traditional parallel
genetic algorithms. In addition, the ideas suggested in the paper may also be
relevant towards parallelizing more complex probabilistic model building
genetic algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper makes a number of connections between life and various facets of
genetic and evolutionary algorithms research. Specifically, it addresses the
topics of adaptation, multiobjective optimization, decision making, deception,
and search operators, among others. It argues that human life, from birth to
death, is an adaptive or dynamic optimization problem where people are
continuously searching for happiness. More important, the paper speculates that
genetic algorithms can be used as a source of inspiration for helping people
make decisions in their everyday life.

 <dc:description>  Extending the classical Legendre's result, we describe all solutions of the
inequality |x - a/b| &lt; c/b^2 in terms of convergents of continued fraction
expansion of x. Namely, we show that a/b = (rp_{m+1} +- sp_m) / (rq_{m+1} +-
sq_m) for some nonnegative integers m,r,s such that rs &lt; 2c.
  As an application of this result, we describe a modification of Verheul and
van Tilborg variant of Wiener's attack on RSA cryptosystem with small secret
exponent.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the complexity of solving a problem when a solution of
a similar instance is known. This problem is relevant whenever instances may
change from time to time, and known solutions may not remain valid after the
change. We consider two scenarios: in the first one, what is known is only a
solution of the problem before the change; in the second case, we assume that
some additional information, found during the search for this solution, is also
known. In the first setting, the techniques from the theory of NP-completeness
suffice to show complexity results. In the second case, negative results can
only be proved using the techniques of compilability, and are often related to
the size of considered changes.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the security of the
Yi-Tan-Siew chaotic cipher proposed in [IEEE TCAS-I 49(12):1826-1829 (2002)]. A
differential chosen-plaintext attack and a differential chosen-ciphertext
attack are suggested to break the sub-key K, under the assumption that the time
stamp can be altered by the attacker, which is reasonable in such attacks.
Also, some security Problems about the sub-keys $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are
clarified, from both theoretical and experimental points of view. Further
analysis shows that the security of this cipher is independent of the use of
the chaotic tent map, once the sub-key $K$ is removed via the proposed
suggested differential chosen-plaintext attack.

 <dc:description>  A discrete-time discrete-value pseudo-chaotic encoder/decoder system is
presented. The pseudo-chaotic module is a 3D discrete version of the well-known
Lorenz dynamical system. Scaling and biasing transformations as well as natural
number arithmetics are employed in order to simplify realizations on a small
size Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA. The encryption ability is improved by
using only the least significant byte of one of the pseudo chaotic state
variables as the key to encrypt the plain text. The key is periodically
perturbed by another chaotic state variable. The statistical properties of the
pseudo chaotic cipher are compared with those of other pseudo-random generators
available in the literature. As an example of applicability of the technique, a
full duplex communication system is designed and constructed using FPGA's as
technological framework.

 <dc:description>  The field of machine learning (ML) is concerned with the question of how to
construct algorithms that automatically improve with experience. In recent
years many successful ML applications have been developed, such as datamining
programs, information-filtering systems, etc. Although ML algorithms allow the
detection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of
problems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they
rely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.
  In the last years defeasible argumentation has proven to be a sound setting
to formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined
with other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning
theory.
  In this paper we outline different alternatives for combining defeasible
argumentation and machine learning techniques. We suggest how different aspects
of a generic argument-based framework can be integrated with other ML-based
approaches.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new type system for lambda-calculus ensuring that well-typed
programs can be executed in polynomial time: Dual light affine logic (DLAL).
  DLAL has a simple type language with a linear and an intuitionistic type
arrow, and one modality. It corresponds to a fragment of Light affine logic
(LAL). We show that contrarily to LAL, DLAL ensures good properties on
lambda-terms: subject reduction is satisfied and a well-typed term admits a
polynomial bound on the reduction by any strategy. We establish that as LAL,
DLAL allows to represent all polytime functions. Finally we give a type
inference procedure for propositional DLAL.

 <dc:description>  The paper study counter-dependent pseudorandom number generators based on
$m$-variate ($m&gt;1$) ergodic mappings of the space of 2-adic integers $\Z_2$.
The sequence of internal states of these generators is defined by the
recurrence law $\mathbf x_{i+1}= H^B_i(\mathbf x_i)\bmod{2^n}$, whereas their
output sequence is %while its output sequence is of the $\mathbf
z_{i}=F^B_i(\mathbf x_i)\mod 2^n$; here $\mathbf x_j, \mathbf z_j$ are
$m$-dimensional vectors over $\Z_2$. It is shown how the results obtained for a
univariate case could be extended to a multivariate case.

 <dc:description>  Self-organizing complex systems typically are comprised of a large number of
frequently similar components or events. Through their process, a pattern at
the global-level of a system emerges solely from numerous interactions among
the lower-level components of the system. Moreover, the rules specifying
interactions among the system's components are executed using only local
information, without reference to the global pattern, which, as in many
real-world problems is not easily accessible or possible to be found.
Stigmergy, a kind of indirect communication and learning by the environment
found in social insects is a well know example of self-organization, providing
not only vital clues in order to understand how the components can interact to
produce a complex pattern, as can pinpoint simple biological non-linear rules
and methods to achieve improved artificial intelligent adaptive categorization
systems, critical for Data-Mining. On the present work it is our intention to
show that a new type of Data-Mining can be designed based on Stigmergic
paradigms, taking profit of several natural features of this phenomenon. By
hybridizing bio-inspired Swarm Intelligence with Evolutionary Computation we
seek for an entire distributed, adaptive, collective and cooperative
self-organized Data-Mining. As a real-world, real-time test bed for our
proposal, World-Wide-Web Mining will be used. Having that purpose in mind, Web
usage Data was collected from the Monash University's Web site (Australia),
with over 7 million hits every week. Results are compared to other recent
systems, showing that the system presented is by far promising.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Stable model semantics has become a very popular approach for the management
of negation in logic programming. This approach relies mainly on the closed
world assumption to complete the available knowledge and its formulation has
its basis in the so-called Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation.
  The primary goal of this work is to present an alternative and
epistemic-based characterization of stable model semantics, to the
Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation. In particular, we show that stable model
semantics can be defined entirely as an extension of the Kripke-Kleene
semantics. Indeed, we show that the closed world assumption can be seen as an
additional source of `falsehood' to be added cumulatively to the Kripke-Kleene
semantics. Our approach is purely algebraic and can abstract from the
particular formalism of choice as it is based on monotone operators (under the
knowledge order) over bilattices only.

 <dc:description>  Recently, researchers have applied genetic algorithms (GAs) to address some
problems in quantum computation. Also, there has been some works in the
designing of genetic algorithms based on quantum theoretical concepts and
techniques. The so called Quantum Evolutionary Programming has two major
sub-areas: Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithms (QIGAs) and Quantum Genetic
Algorithms (QGAs). The former adopts qubit chromosomes as representations and
employs quantum gates for the search of the best solution. The later tries to
solve a key question in this field: what GAs will look like as an
implementation on quantum hardware? As we shall see, there is not a complete
answer for this question. An important point for QGAs is to build a quantum
algorithm that takes advantage of both the GA and quantum computing parallelism
as well as true randomness provided by quantum computers. In the first part of
this paper we present a survey of the main works in GAs plus quantum computing
including also our works in this area. Henceforth, we review some basic
concepts in quantum computation and GAs and emphasize their inherent
parallelism. Next, we review the application of GAs for learning quantum
operators and circuit design. Then, quantum evolutionary programming is
considered. Finally, we present our current research in this field and some
perspectives.

 <dc:title>New Visualization of Surfaces in Parallel Coordinates - Eliminating
  Ambiguity and Some &quot;Over-Plotting&quot;</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  $\cal{A}$ point $P \in \Real^n$ is represented in Parallel Coordinates by a
polygonal line $\bar{P}$ (see \cite{Insel99a} for a recent survey). Earlier
\cite{inselberg85plane}, a surface $\sigma$ was represented as the {\em
envelope} of the polygonal lines representing it's points. This is ambiguous in
the sense that {\em different} surfaces can provide the {\em same} envelopes.
Here the ambiguity is eliminated by considering the surface $\sigma$ as the
envelope of it's {\em tangent planes} and in turn, representing each of these
planes by $n$-1 points \cite{Insel99a}. This, with some future extension, can
yield a new and unambiguous representation, $\bar{\sigma}$, of the surface
consisting of $n$-1 planar regions whose properties correspond lead to the {\em
recognition} of the surfaces' properties i.e. developable, ruled etc.
\cite{hung92smooth}) and {\em classification} criteria.
  It is further shown that the image (i.e. representation) of an algebraic
surface of degree 2 in $\Real^n$ is a region whose boundary is also an
algebraic curve of degree 2. This includes some {\em non-convex} surfaces which
with the previous ambiguous representation could not be treated. An efficient
construction algorithm for the representation of the quadratic surfaces (given
either by {\em explicit} or {\em implicit} equation) is provided. The results
obtained are suitable for applications, to be presented in a future paper, and
in particular for the approximation of complex surfaces based on their {\em
planar} images. An additional benefit is the elimination of the
``over-plotting'' problem i.e. the ``bunching'' of polygonal lines which often
obscure part of the parallel-coordinate display.

 <dc:title>Algebraic Curves in Parallel Coordinates - Avoiding the &quot;Over-Plotting&quot;

 <dc:description>  ${\cal U}$ntil now the representation (i.e. plotting) of curve in Parallel
Coordinates is constructed from the point $\leftrightarrow$ line duality. The
result is a ``line-curve'' which is seen as the envelope of it's tangents.
Usually this gives an unclear image and is at the heart of the
``over-plotting'' problem; a barrier in the effective use of Parallel
Coordinates. This problem is overcome by a transformation which provides
directly the ``point-curve'' representation of a curve. Earlier this was
applied to conics and their generalizations. Here the representation, also
called dual, is extended to all planar algebraic curves. Specifically, it is
shown that the dual of an algebraic curve of degree $n$ is an algebraic of
degree at most $n(n - 1)$ in the absence of singular points. The result that
conics map into conics follows as an easy special case. An algorithm, based on
algebraic geometry using resultants and homogeneous polynomials, is obtained
which constructs the dual image of the curve. This approach has potential
generalizations to multi-dimensional algebraic surfaces and their
approximation. The ``trade-off'' price then for obtaining {\em planar}
representation of multidimensional algebraic curves and hyper-surfaces is the
higher degree of the image's boundary which is also an algebraic curve in
$\|$-coords.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of the development of representations and their
relationship to the environment. We study a software agent which develops in a
network a representation of its simple environment which captures and
integrates the relationships between agent and environment through a closure
mechanism. The inclusion of a variable behavior modifier allows better
representation development. This can be confirmed with an internal description
of the closure mechanism, and with an external description of the properties of
the representation network.

 <dc:description>  Microreboots restart fine-grained components of software systems &quot;with a
clean slate,&quot; and only take a fraction of the time needed for full system
reboot. Microreboots provide an application-generic recovery technique for
Internet services, which can be supported entirely in middleware and requires
no changes to the applications or any a priori knowledge of application
semantics.
  This paper investigates the effect of microreboots on end-users of an
eBay-like online auction application; we find that microreboots are nearly as
effective as full reboots, but are significantly less disruptive in terms of
downtime and lost work. In our experiments, microreboots reduced the number of
failed user requests by 65% and the perceived downtime by 78% compared to a
server process restart. We also show how to replace user-visible transient
failures with transparent call-retry, at the cost of a slight increase in
end-user-visible latency during recovery. Due to their low cost, microreboots
can be used aggressively, even when their necessity is less than certain, hence
adding to the reduced recovery time a reduction in the fault detection time,
which further improves availability.

 <dc:description>  Given a quadratic map Q : K^n -&gt; K^k defined over a computable subring D of a
real closed field K, and a polynomial p(Y_1,...,Y_k) of degree d, we consider
the zero set Z=Z(p(Q(X)),K^n) of the polynomial p(Q(X_1,...,X_n)). We present a
procedure that computes, in (dn)^O(k) arithmetic operations in D, a set S of
(real univariate representations of) sampling points in K^n that intersects
nontrivially each connected component of Z. As soon as k=o(n), this is faster
than the standard methods that all have exponential dependence on n in the
complexity. In particular, our procedure is polynomial-time for constant k. In
contrast, the best previously known procedure (due to A.Barvinok) is only
capable of deciding in n^O(k^2) operations the nonemptiness (rather than
constructing sampling points) of the set Z in the case of p(Y)=sum_i Y_i^2 and
homogeneous Q.
  A by-product of our procedure is a bound (dn)^O(k) on the number of connected
components of Z.
  The procedure consists of exact symbolic computations in D and outputs
vectors of algebraic numbers. It involves extending K by infinitesimals and
subsequent limit computation by a novel procedure that utilizes knowledge of an
explicit isomorphism between real algebraic sets.

 <dc:description>  Lambda Prolog is known to be well-suited for expressing and implementing
logics and inference systems. We show that lemmas and definitions in such
logics can be implemented with a great economy of expression. We encode a
higher-order logic using an encoding that maps both terms and types of the
object logic (higher-order logic) to terms of the metalanguage (Lambda Prolog).
We discuss both the Terzo and Teyjus implementations of Lambda Prolog. We also
encode the same logic in Twelf and compare the features of these two
metalanguages for our purposes.

 <dc:description>  Many functional logic languages are based on narrowing, a unification-based
goal-solving mechanism which subsumes the reduction mechanism of functional
languages and the resolution principle of logic languages. Needed narrowing is
an optimal evaluation strategy which constitutes the basis of modern
(narrowing-based) lazy functional logic languages. In this work, we present the
fundamentals of partial evaluation in such languages. We provide correctness
results for partial evaluation based on needed narrowing and show that the nice
properties of this strategy are essential for the specialization process. In
particular, the structure of the original program is preserved by partial
evaluation and, thus, the same evaluation strategy can be applied for the
execution of specialized programs. This is in contrast to other partial
evaluation schemes for lazy functional logic programs which may change the
program structure in a negative way. Recent proposals for the partial
evaluation of declarative multi-paradigm programs use (some form of) needed
narrowing to perform computations at partial evaluation time. Therefore, our
results constitute the basis for the correctness of such partial evaluators.

 <dc:description>  Often adaptive, distributed control can be viewed as an iterated game between
independent players. The coupling between the players' mixed strategies,
arising as the system evolves from one instant to the next, is determined by
the system designer. Information theory tells us that the most likely joint
strategy of the players, given a value of the expectation of the overall
control objective function, is the minimizer of a Lagrangian function of the
joint strategy. So the goal of the system designer is to speed evolution of the
joint strategy to that Lagrangian minimizing point, lower the expectated value
of the control objective function, and repeat. Here we elaborate the theory of
algorithms that do this using local descent procedures, and that thereby
achieve efficient, adaptive, distributed control.

 <dc:title>Predictable Software -- A Shortcut to Dependable Computing ?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many dependability techniques expect certain behaviors from the underlying
subsystems and fail in chaotic ways if these expectations are not met. Under
expected circumstances, however, software tends to work quite well. This paper
suggests that, instead of fixing elusive bugs or rewriting software, we improve
the predictability of conditions faced by our programs. This approach might be
a cheaper and faster way to improve dependability of software. After
identifying some of the common triggers of unpredictability, the paper
describes three engineering principles that hold promise in combating
unpredictability, suggests a way to benchmark predictability, and outlines a
brief research agenda.

 <dc:description>  Similarity searching finds application in a wide variety of domains including
multilingual databases, computational biology, pattern recognition and text
retrieval. Similarity is measured in terms of a distance function, edit
distance, in general metric spaces, which is expensive to compute. Indexing
techniques can be used reduce the number of distance computations. We present
an analysis of various existing similarity indexing structures for the same.
The performance obtained using the index structures studied was found to be
unsatisfactory . We propose an indexing technique that combines the features of
clustering with M tree(MTB) and the results indicate that this gives better
performance.

 <dc:description>  We describe the present status of the computing system in the Belle
experiment at the KEKB $e^+e^-$ asymmetric-energy collider. So far, we have
logged more than 160 fb$^{-1}$ of data, corresponding to the world's largest
data sample of 170M $B\bar{B}$ pairs at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ energy region. A
large amount of event data has to be processed to produce an analysis event
sample in a timely fashion. In addition, Monte Carlo events have to be created
to control systematic errors accurately. This requires stable and efficient
usage of computing resources. Here we review our computing model and then
describe how we efficiently proceed DST/MC productions in our system.

 <dc:description>  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey science database is approaching 2TB. While the
vast majority of queries normally execute in seconds or minutes, this
interactive execution time can be disproportionately increased by a small
fraction of queries that take hours or days to run; either because they require
non-index scans of the largest tables or because they request very large result
sets. In response to this, we added a multi-queue job submission and tracking
system. The transfer of very large result sets from queries over the network is
another serious problem. Statistics suggested that much of this data transfer
is unnecessary; users would prefer to store results locally in order to allow
further cross matching and filtering. To allow local analysis, we implemented a
system that gives users their own personal database (MyDB) at the portal site.
Users may transfer data to their MyDB, and then perform further analysis before
extracting it to their own machine.
  We intend to extend the MyDB and asynchronous query ideas to multiple NVO
nodes. This implies development, in a distributed manner, of several features,
which have been demonstrated for a single node in the SDSS Batch Query System
(CasJobs). The generalization of asynchronous queries necessitates some form of
MyDB storage as well as workflow tracking services on each node and
coordination strategies among nodes.

 <dc:description>  Most scientific data will never be directly examined by scientists; rather it
will be put into online databases where it will be analyzed and summarized by
computer programs. Scientists increasingly see their instruments through online
scientific archives and analysis tools, rather than examining the raw data.
Today this analysis is primarily driven by scientists asking queries, but
scientific archives are becoming active databases that self-organize and
recognize interesting and anomalous facts as data arrives. In some fields, data
from many different archives can be cross-correlated to produce new insights.
Astronomy presents an excellent example of these trends; and, federating
Astronomy archives presents interesting challenges for computer scientists.

 <dc:description>  Computing economics are changing. Today there is rough price parity between
(1) one database access, (2) ten bytes of network traffic, (3) 100,000
instructions, (4) 10 bytes of disk storage, and (5) a megabyte of disk
bandwidth. This has implications for how one structures Internet-scale
distributed computing: one puts computing as close to the data as possible in
order to avoid expensive network traffic.

 <dc:description>  The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Science Archive is the first in a series of
multi-Terabyte digital archives in Astronomy and other data-intensive sciences.
To facilitate data mining in the SDSS archive, we adapted a commercial database
engine and built specialized tools on top of it. Originally we chose an
object-oriented database management system due to its data organization
capabilities, platform independence, query performance and conceptual fit to
the data. However, after using the object database for the first couple of
years of the project, it soon began to fall short in terms of its query support
and data mining performance. This was as much due to the inability of the
database vendor to respond our demands for features and bug fixes as it was due
to their failure to keep up with the rapid improvements in hardware
performance, particularly faster RAID disk systems. In the end, we were forced
to abandon the object database and migrate our data to a relational database.
We describe below the technical issues that we faced with the object database
and how and why we migrated to relational technology.

 <dc:description>  We have been investigating the use of low-cost, commodity components for
multi-terabyte SQL Server databases. Dubbed storage bricks, these servers are
white box PCs containing the largest ATA drives, value-priced AMD or Intel
processors, and inexpensive ECC memory. One issue has been the wiring mess, air
flow problems, length restrictions, and connector failures created by seven or
more parallel ATA (PATA) ribbon cables and drives in]a tower or 3U rack-mount
chassis. Large capacity Serial ATA (SATA) drives have recently become widely
available for the PC environment at a reasonable price. In addition to being
faster, the SATA connectors seem more reliable, have a more reasonable length
restriction (1m) and allow better airflow. We tested two drive brands along
with two RAID controllers to evaluate SATA drive performance and reliablility.
This paper documents our results so far.

 <dc:description>  We provide elementary and uniform proofs of order independence for various
strategy elimination procedures for finite strategic games, both for dominance
by pure and by mixed strategies. The proofs follow the same pattern and focus
on the structural properties of the dominance relations. They rely on Newman's

 <dc:description>  Mutual information is widely used, in a descriptive way, to measure the
stochastic dependence of categorical random variables. In order to address
questions such as the reliability of the descriptive value, one must consider
sample-to-population inferential approaches. This paper deals with the
posterior distribution of mutual information, as obtained in a Bayesian
framework by a second-order Dirichlet prior distribution. The exact analytical
expression for the mean, and analytical approximations for the variance,
skewness and kurtosis are derived. These approximations have a guaranteed
accuracy level of the order O(1/n^3), where n is the sample size. Leading order
approximations for the mean and the variance are derived in the case of
incomplete samples. The derived analytical expressions allow the distribution
of mutual information to be approximated reliably and quickly. In fact, the
derived expressions can be computed with the same order of complexity needed
for descriptive mutual information. This makes the distribution of mutual
information become a concrete alternative to descriptive mutual information in
many applications which would benefit from moving to the inductive side. Some
of these prospective applications are discussed, and one of them, namely
feature selection, is shown to perform significantly better when inductive
mutual information is used.

 <dc:description>  Software engineering (SE) and usability engineering (UE), as disciplines,
have reached substantial levels of maturity. Each of these two disciplines is
now well represented with respect to most computer science (CS) curricula. But,
the two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing oppurtunities
to collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and
thereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several
ingredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user
interface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of
the human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model
to integrate the UI experts' UE development efforts with that of SE. This in
turn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of
education and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration
and coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the
current approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and
analyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having
substantial interactive components. We then propose four major themes of
learning for a comprehensive computing curriculum integrating SE, UE, and
system architectures in a project environment.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce a fuzzy version of symport/antiport membrane
systems. Our fuzzy membrane systems handle possibly inexact copies of reactives
and their rules are endowed with threshold functions that determine whether a
rule can be applied or not to a given set of objects, depending of the degree
of accuracy of these objects to the reactives specified in the rule. We prove
that these fuzzy membrane systems generate exactly the recursively enumerable
finite-valued fuzzy sets of natural numbers.

 <dc:description>  We describe here a simple application of rational trees to the implementation
of an interpreter for a procedural language written in a logic programming
language. This is possible in languages designed to support rational trees
(such as Prolog II and its descendants), but also in traditional Prolog, whose
data structures are initially based on Herbrand terms, but in which
implementations often omit the occurs check needed to avoid the creation of
infinite data structures. We provide code implementing two interpreters, one of
which needs non-occurs-check unification, which makes it faster (and more
economic). We provide experimental data supporting this, and we argue that
rational trees are interesting enough as to receive thorough support inside the
language.

 <dc:description>  Input buffered switches with Virtual Output Queueing (VOQ) can be unstable
when presented with unbalanced loads. Existing scheduling algorithms, including
iSLIP for Input Queued (IQ) switches and Round Robin (RR) for Combined Input
and Crossbar Queued (CICQ) switches, exhibit instability for some schedulable
loads. We investigate the use of a queue length threshold and bursting
mechanism to achieve stability without requiring internal speed-up. An
analytical model is developed to prove that the burst stabilization protocol
achieves stability and to predict the minimum burst value needed as a function
of offered load. The analytical model is shown to have very good agreement with
simulation results. These results show the advantage of the RR/RR CICQ switch
as a contender for the next generation of high-speed switches.

 <dc:description>  Most input buffered packet switches internally segment variable-length
packets into fixed-length cells. The last cell in a segmented packet will
contain overhead bytes if the packet length is not evenly divisible by the cell
length. Switch speed-up is used to compensate for this overhead. In this paper,
we develop an analytical model of a single-server queue where an input stream
of packets is segmented into cells for service. Analytical models are developed
for M/M/1, M/H2/1, and M/E2/1 queues with a discretized (or quantized) service
time. These models and simulation using real packet traces are used to evaluate
the effect of speed-up on mean queue length. We propose and evaluate a new
method of segmenting a packet trailer and subsequent packet header into a
single cell. This cell merging method reduces the required speed-up. No changes
to switch-matrix scheduling algorithms are needed. Simulation with a packet
trace shows a reduction in the needed speed-up for an iSLIP scheduled input
buffered switch.

 <dc:title>Concept of E-machine: How does a &quot;dynamical&quot; brain learn to process

 <dc:description>  The human brain has many remarkable information processing characteristics
that deeply puzzle scientists and engineers. Among the most important and the
most intriguing of these characteristics are the brain's broad universality as
a learning system and its mysterious ability to dynamically change
(reconfigure) its behavior depending on a combinatorial number of different
contexts.
  This paper discusses a class of hypothetically brain-like dynamically
reconfigurable associative learning systems that shed light on the possible
nature of these brain's properties. The systems are arranged on the general
principle referred to as the concept of E-machine.
  The paper addresses the following questions:
  1. How can &quot;dynamical&quot; neural networks function as universal programmable
&quot;symbolic&quot; machines?
  2. What kind of a universal programmable symbolic machine can form
arbitrarily complex software in the process of programming similar to the
process of biological associative learning?
  3. How can a universal learning machine dynamically reconfigure its software
depending on a combinatorial number of possible contexts?

 <dc:description>  Reiter's original definition of default logic allows for the application of a
default that contradicts a previously applied one. We call failure this
condition. The possibility of generating failures has been in the past
considered as a semantical problem, and variants have been proposed to solve
it. We show that it is instead a computational feature that is needed to encode
some domains into default logic.

 <dc:description>  Computer Aided Design systems provide tools for building and manipulating
models of solid objects. Some also provide access to programming languages so
that parametrised designs can be expressed. There is a sharp distinction,
therefore, between building models, a concrete graphical editing activity, and
programming, an abstract, textual, algorithm-construction activity. The
recently proposed Language for Structured Design (LSD) was motivated by a
desire to combine the design and programming activities in one language. LSD
achieves this by extending a visual logic programming language to incorporate
the notions of solids and operations on solids. Here we investigate another
aspect of the LSD approach; namely, that by using visual logic programming as
the engine to drive the parametrised assembly of objects, we also gain the
powerful symbolic problem-solving capability that is the forte of logic
programming languages. This allows the designer/programmer to work at a higher
level, giving declarative specifications of a design in order to obtain the
design descriptions. Hence LSD integrates problem solving, design synthesis,
and prototype assembly in a single homogeneous programming/design environment.
We demonstrate this specification-to-final-assembly capability using the
masterkeying problem for designing systems of locks and keys.

 <dc:description>  We investigate a technique from the literature, called the phantom-types
technique, that uses parametric polymorphism, type constraints, and unification
of polymorphic types to model a subtyping hierarchy. Hindley-Milner type
systems, such as the one found in Standard ML, can be used to enforce the
subtyping relation, at least for first-order values. We show that this
technique can be used to encode any finite subtyping hierarchy (including
hierarchies arising from multiple interface inheritance). We formally
demonstrate the suitability of the phantom-types technique for capturing
first-order subtyping by exhibiting a type-preserving translation from a simple
calculus with bounded polymorphism to a calculus embodying the type system of
SML.

 <dc:description>  Search engine is main access to the largest information source in this world,
Internet. Now Internet is changing every aspect of our life. Information
retrieval service may be its most important services. But for common user,
internet search service is still far from our expectation, too many unrelated
search results, old information, etc. To solve these problems, a new system,
search engine based on DNS is proposed. The original idea, detailed content and
implementation of this system all are introduced in this paper.

a hierarchical distributed Internet information retrieval system. This system
will solve some bottleneck problems such as long update interval, poor coverage

 <dc:description>  We study here schedulers for a class of rules that naturally arise in the
context of rule-based constraint programming. We systematically derive a
scheduler for them from a generic iteration algorithm of [Apt 2000]. We apply
this study to so-called membership rules of [Apt and Monfroy 2001]. This leads
to an implementation that yields a considerably better performance for these
rules than their execution as standard CHR rules. Finally, we show how
redundant rules can be identified and how appropriately reduced sets of rules
can be computed.

 <dc:description>  In evolutionary algorithms a critical parameter that must be tuned is that of
selection pressure. If it is set too low then the rate of convergence towards
the optimum is likely to be slow. Alternatively if the selection pressure is
set too high the system is likely to become stuck in a local optimum due to a
loss of diversity in the population. The recent Fitness Uniform Selection
Scheme (FUSS) is a conceptually simple but somewhat radical approach to
addressing this problem - rather than biasing the selection towards higher
fitness, FUSS biases selection towards sparsely populated fitness levels. In
this paper we compare the relative performance of FUSS with the well known
tournament selection scheme on a range of problems.

system. The compiler converts a set of rules into a finite-state transducer
(FST). The input and output of the FST are subject to parameterization, so that
the system can be applied to strings and sequences of feature-structures. The
resulting transducer is guaranteed to realize a function (as opposed to a
relation), and therefore can be implemented as a deterministic device (either a
deterministic FST or a bimachine).

 <dc:title>A Theory of Computation Based on Quantum Logic (I)</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The (meta)logic underlying classical theory of computation is Boolean
(two-valued) logic. Quantum logic was proposed by Birkhoff and von Neumann as a
logic of quantum mechanics more than sixty years ago. The major difference
between Boolean logic and quantum logic is that the latter does not enjoy
distributivity in general. The rapid development of quantum computation in
recent years stimulates us to establish a theory of computation based on
quantum logic. The present paper is the first step toward such a new theory and
it focuses on the simplest models of computation, namely finite automata. It is
found that the universal validity of many properties of automata depend heavily
upon the distributivity of the underlying logic. This indicates that these
properties does not universally hold in the realm of quantum logic. On the
other hand, we show that a local validity of them can be recovered by imposing
a certain commutativity to the (atomic) statements about the automata under
consideration. This reveals an essential difference between the classical
theory of computation and the computation theory based on quantum logic.

 <dc:description>  A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack can flood a victim site with
malicious traffic, causing service disruption or even complete failure.
Public-access sites like amazon or ebay are particularly vulnerable to such
attacks, because they have no way of a priori blocking unauthorized traffic.
  We present Active Internet Traffic Filtering (AITF), a mechanism that
protects public-access sites from highly distributed attacks by causing
undesired traffic to be blocked as close as possible to its sources. We
identify filters as a scarce resource and show that AITF protects a significant
amount of the victim's bandwidth, while requiring from each participating
router a number of filters that can be accommodated by today's routers. AITF is
incrementally deployable, because it offers a substantial benefit even to the
first sites that deploy it.

 <dc:title>Stream cipher based on quasigroup string transformations in $Z_p^*$</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>E.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we design a stream cipher that uses the algebraic structure of
the multiplicative group $\bbbz_p^*$ (where p is a big prime number used in
ElGamal algorithm), by defining a quasigroup of order $p-1$ and by doing
quasigroup string transformations. The cryptographical strength of the proposed
stream cipher is based on the fact that breaking it would be at least as hard
as solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations modulo big prime number
$p$ which is NP-hard problem and there are no known fast randomized or
deterministic algorithms for solving it. Unlikely the speed of known ciphers
that work in $\bbbz_p^*$ for big prime numbers $p$, the speed of this stream
cipher both in encryption and decryption phase is comparable with the fastest
symmetric-key stream ciphers.

 <dc:title>Scalable Probabilistic Models for 802.11 Protocol Verification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The IEEE 802.11 protocol is a popular standard for wireless local area
networks. Its medium access control layer (MAC) is a carrier sense multiple
access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) design and includes an exponential
backoff mechanism that makes it a possible target for probabilistic model
checking. In this work, we identify ways to increase the scope of application
of probabilistic model checking to the 802.11 MAC. Current techniques do not
scale to networks of even moderate size. To work around this problem, we
identify properties of the protocol that can be used to simplify the models and
make verification feasible. Using these observations, we directly optimize the
probabilistic timed automata models while preserving probabilistic reachability
measures. We substantiate our claims of significant reduction by our results
from using the probabilistic model checker PRISM.

 <dc:title>On the Practicality of Intrinsic Reconfiguration As a Fault Recovery

 <dc:description>  Evolvable hardware combines the powerful search capability of evolutionary
algorithms with the flexibility of reprogrammable devices, thereby providing a
natural framework for reconfiguration. This framework has generated an interest
in using evolvable hardware for fault-tolerant systems because reconfiguration
can effectively deal with hardware faults whenever it is impossible to provide
spares. But systems cannot tolerate faults indefinitely, which means
reconfiguration does have a deadline. The focus of previous evolvable hardware
research relating to fault-tolerance has been primarily restricted to restoring
functionality, with no real consideration of time constraints. In this paper we
are concerned with evolvable hardware performing reconfiguration under deadline
constraints. In particular, we investigate reconfigurable hardware that
undergoes intrinsic evolution. We show that fault recovery done by intrinsic
reconfiguration has some restrictions, which designers cannot ignore.

 <dc:description>  We review existing approaches to mathematical modeling and analysis of
multi-agent systems in which complex collective behavior arises out of local
interactions between many simple agents. Though the behavior of an individual
agent can be considered to be stochastic and unpredictable, the collective
behavior of such systems can have a simple probabilistic description. We show
that a class of mathematical models that describe the dynamics of collective
behavior of multi-agent systems can be written down from the details of the
individual agent controller. The models are valid for Markov or memoryless
agents, in which each agents future state depends only on its present state and
not any of the past states. We illustrate the approach by analyzing in detail
applications from the robotics domain: collaboration and foraging in groups of
robots.

 <dc:description>  U-Datalog has been developed with the aim of providing a set-oriented logical
update language, guaranteeing update parallelism in the context of a
Datalog-like language. In U-Datalog, updates are expressed by introducing
constraints (+p(X), to denote insertion, and [minus sign]p(X), to denote
deletion) inside Datalog rules. A U-Datalog program can be interpreted as a CLP
program. In this framework, a set of updates (constraints) is satisfiable if it
does not represent an inconsistent theory, that is, it does not require the
insertion and the deletion of the same fact. This approach resembles a very
simple form of negation. However, on the other hand, U-Datalog does not provide
any mechanism to explicitly deal with negative information, resulting in a
language with limited expressive power. In this paper, we provide a semantics,
based on stratification, handling the use of negated atoms in U-Datalog
programs, and we show which problems arise in defining a compositional
semantics.

 <dc:description>  In secure communications networks there are a great number of user
behavioural problems, which need to be dealt with. Curious players pose a very
real and serious threat to the integrity of such a network. By traversing a
network a Curious player could uncover secret information, which that user has
no need to know, by simply posing as a loyalty check. Loyalty checks are done
simply to gauge the integrity of the network with respect to players who act in
a malicious manner. We wish to propose a method, which can deal with Curious
players trying to obtain &quot;Need to Know&quot; information using a combined
Fault-tolerant, Cryptographic and Game Theoretic Approach.

 <dc:description>  Blocking of foreign Web content by Internet access providers has been a hot
topic for the last 18 months in Germany. Since fall 2001 the state of
North-Rhine-Westphalia very actively tries to mandate such blocking. This paper
will take a technical view on the problems imposed by the blocking orders and
blocking content at access or network provider level in general. It will also
give some empirical data on the effects of the blocking orders to help in the
legal assessment of the orders.

 <dc:description>  Making a linguistic theory is like making a programming language: one
typically devises a type system to delineate the acceptable utterances and a
denotational semantics to explain observations on their behavior. Via this
connection, the programming language concept of delimited continuations can
help analyze natural language phenomena such as quantification and polarity
sensitivity. Using a logical metalanguage whose syntax includes control
operators and whose semantics involves evaluation order, these analyses can be
expressed in direct style rather than continuation-passing style, and these
phenomena can be thought of as computational side effects.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel, type-logical analysis of_polarity sensitivity_: how
negative polarity items (like &quot;any&quot; and &quot;ever&quot;) or positive ones (like &quot;some&quot;)
are licensed or prohibited. It takes not just scopal relations but also linear
order into account, using the programming-language notions of delimited
continuations and evaluation order, respectively. It thus achieves greater
empirical coverage than previous proposals.

 <dc:description>  We want to achieve efficiency for the exact computation of the dot product of
two vectors over word-size finite fields. We therefore compare the practical
behaviors of a wide range of implementation techniques using different
representations. The techniques used include oating point representations,
discrete logarithms, tabulations, Montgomery reduction, delayed modulus.

 <dc:description>  We present an extensive analysis of long-term statistics of the queries to
websites using logs collected on several web caches in Russian academic
networks and on US IRCache caches. We check the sensitivity of the statistics
to several parameters: (1) duration of data collection, (2) geographical
location of the cache server collecting data, and (3) the year of data
collection. We propose a two-parameter modification of the Zipf law and
interpret the parameters. We find that the rank distribution of websites is
stable when approximated by the modified Zipf law. We suggest that website
popularity may be a universal property of Internet.

 <dc:description>  P2P clusters like the Grid and PlanetLab enable in principle the same
statistical multiplexing efficiency gains for computing as the Internet
provides for networking. The key unsolved problem is resource allocation.
Existing solutions are not economically efficient and require high latency to
acquire resources. We designed and implemented Tycoon, a market based
distributed resource allocation system based on an Auction Share scheduling
algorithm. Preliminary results show that Tycoon achieves low latency and high
fairness while providing incentives for truth-telling on the part of strategic
users.

 <dc:description>  The High Level Trigger (HLT) of the future ALICE heavy-ion experiment has to
reduce its input data rate of up to 25 GB/s to at most 1.25 GB/s for output
before the data is written to permanent storage. To cope with these data rates
a large PC cluster system is being designed to scale to several 1000 nodes,
connected by a fast network. For the software that will run on these nodes a
flexible data transport and distribution software framework, described in this
thesis, has been developed. The framework consists of a set of separate
components, that can be connected via a common interface. This allows to
construct different configurations for the HLT, that are even changeable at
runtime. To ensure a fault-tolerant operation of the HLT, the framework
includes a basic fail-over mechanism that allows to replace whole nodes after a
failure. The mechanism will be further expanded in the future, utilizing the
runtime reconnection feature of the framework's component interface. To connect
cluster nodes a communication class library is used that abstracts from the
actual network technology and protocol used to retain flexibility in the
hardware choice. It contains already two working prototype versions for the TCP
protocol as well as SCI network adapters. Extensions can be added to the
library without modifications to other parts of the framework. Extensive tests
and measurements have been performed with the framework. Their results as well
as conclusions drawn from them are also presented in this thesis. Performance
tests show very promising results for the system, indicating that it can
fulfill ALICE's requirements concerning the data transport.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the different effects of chaotic switching on
Parrondo's games, as compared to random and periodic switching. The rate of
winning of Parrondo's games with chaotic switching depends on coefficient(s)
defining the chaotic generator, initial conditions of the chaotic sequence and
the proportion of Game A played. Maximum rate of winning can be obtained with
all the above mentioned factors properly set, and this occurs when chaotic
switching approaches periodic behavior.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary computation algorithms are increasingly being used to solve
optimization problems as they have many advantages over traditional
optimization algorithms. In this paper we use evolutionary computation to study
the trade-off between pleiotropy and redundancy in a client-server based
network. Pleiotropy is a term used to describe components that perform multiple
tasks, while redundancy refers to multiple components performing one same task.
Pleiotropy reduces cost but lacks robustness, while redundancy increases
network reliability but is more costly, as together, pleiotropy and redundancy
build flexibility and robustness into systems. Therefore it is desirable to
have a network that contains a balance between pleiotropy and redundancy. We
explore how factors such as link failure probability, repair rates, and the
size of the network influence the design choices that we explore using genetic
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present NLML (Natural Language Markup Language), a markup
language to describe the syntactic and semantic structure of any grammatically
correct English expression. At first the related works are analyzed to
demonstrate the necessity of the NLML: simple form, easy management and direct
storage. Then the description of the English grammar with NLML is introduced in
details in three levels: sentences (with different complexities, voices, moods,
and tenses), clause (relative clause and noun clause) and phrase (noun phrase,
verb phrase, prepositional phrase, adjective phrase, adverb phrase and
predicate phrase). At last the application fields of the NLML in NLP are shown
with two typical examples: NLOJM (Natural Language Object Modal in Java) and
NLDB (Natural Language Database).

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the use of genetic algorithms for the design of networks,
where the demands on the network fluctuate in time. For varying network
constraints, we find the best network using the standard genetic algorithm
operators such as inversion, mutation and crossover. We also examine how the
choice of genetic algorithm operators affects the quality of the best network
found. Such networks typically contain redundancy in servers, where several
servers perform the same task and pleiotropy, where servers perform multiple
tasks. We explore this trade-off between pleiotropy versus redundancy on the
cost versus reliability as a measure of the quality of the network.

 <dc:title>A treatment of higher-order features in logic programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The logic programming paradigm provides the basis for a new intensional view
of higher-order notions. This view is realized primarily by employing the terms
of a typed lambda calculus as representational devices and by using a richer
form of unification for probing their structures. These additions have
important meta-programming applications but they also pose non-trivial
implementation problems. One issue concerns the machine representation of
lambda terms suitable to their intended use: an adequate encoding must
facilitate comparison operations over terms in addition to supporting the usual
reduction computation. Another aspect relates to the treatment of a unification
operation that has a branching character and that sometimes calls for the
delaying of the solution of unification problems. A final issue concerns the
execution of goals whose structures become apparent only in the course of
computation. These various problems are exposed in this paper and solutions to
them are described. A satisfactory representation for lambda terms is developed
by exploiting the nameless notation of de Bruijn as well as explicit encodings
of substitutions. Special mechanisms are molded into the structure of
traditional Prolog implementations to support branching in unification and
carrying of unification problems over other computation steps; a premium is
placed in this context on exploiting determinism and on emulating usual
first-order behaviour. An extended compilation model is presented that treats
higher-order unification and also handles dynamically emergent goals. The ideas
described here have been employed in the Teyjus implementation of the Lambda
Prolog language, a fact that is used to obtain a preliminary assessment of
their efficacy.

 <dc:description>  Many different definitions of computational universality for various types of
dynamical systems have flourished since Turing's work. We propose a general
definition of universality that applies to arbitrary discrete time symbolic
dynamical systems. Universality of a system is defined as undecidability of a
model-checking problem. For Turing machines, counter machines and tag systems,
our definition coincides with the classical one. It yields, however, a new
definition for cellular automata and subshifts. Our definition is robust with
respect to initial condition, which is a desirable feature for physical
realizability.
  We derive necessary conditions for undecidability and universality. For
instance, a universal system must have a sensitive point and a proper
subsystem. We conjecture that universal systems have infinite number of
subsystems. We also discuss the thesis according to which computation should
occur at the `edge of chaos' and we exhibit a universal chaotic system.

 <dc:subject>I.4.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm that transforms color visual images, like
photographs or paintings, into tactile graphics. In the algorithm, the edges of
objects are detected and colors of the objects are estimated. Then, the edges
and the colors are encoded into lines and textures in the output tactile image.
Design of the method is substantiated by various qualities of haptic
recognizing of images. Also, means of presentation of the tactile images in
printouts are discussed. Example translated images are shown.

 <dc:description>  In the same sense as classical logic is a formal theory of truth, the
recently initiated approach called computability logic is a formal theory of
computability. It understands (interactive) computational problems as games
played by a machine against the environment, their computability as existence
of a machine that always wins the game, logical operators as operations on
computational problems, and validity of a logical formula as being a scheme of
&quot;always computable&quot; problems. The present contribution gives a detailed
exposition of a soundness and completeness proof for an axiomatization of one
of the most basic fragments of computability logic. The logical vocabulary of
this fragment contains operators for the so called parallel and choice
operations, and its atoms represent elementary problems, i.e. predicates in the
standard sense. This article is self-contained as it explains all relevant
concepts. While not technically necessary, however, familiarity with the
foundational paper &quot;Introduction to computability logic&quot; [Annals of Pure and
Applied Logic 123 (2003), pp.1-99] would greatly help the reader in
understanding the philosophy, underlying motivations, potential and utility of
computability logic, -- the context that determines the value of the present
results. Online introduction to the subject is available at

 <dc:description>  Computability logic is a formal theory of (interactive) computability in the

initiated very recently in &quot;Introduction to computability logic&quot; (Annals of

computability logic in a more compact and less technical way. It is written in
a semitutorial style with a general computer science, logic or mathematics
audience in mind. An Internet source on the subject is available at

 <dc:description>  The Eureka-147 Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) standard defines the 'dynamic
labels' data field for holding information about the transmission content.
However, this information does not follow a well-defined structure since it is
designed to carry text for direct output to displays, for human interpretation.
This poses a problem when machine interpretation of DAB content information is
desired. Extensible Markup Language (XML) was developed to allow for the
well-defined, structured machine-to-machine exchange of data over computer
networks. This article proposes a novel technique of machine-interpretable DAB
content annotation and receiver hardware control, involving the utilisation of
XML as metadata in the transmitted DAB frames.

 <dc:description>  Grids aim at exploiting synergies that result from cooperation of autonomous
distributed entities. The synergies that result from grid cooperation include
the sharing, exchange, selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed
resources such as computers, data bases, software, and scientific instruments
for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. For
this cooperation to be sustainable, participants need to have economic
incentive. Therefore, &quot;incentive&quot; mechanisms should be considered as one of key
design parameters of Grid architectures. In this article, we present an
overview and status of an open source Grid toolkit, called Gridbus, whose
architecture is fundamentally driven by the requirements of Grid economy.
Gridbus technologies provide services for both computational and data grids
that power the emerging eScience and eBusiness applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the problem of how resilient networks are to node
faults. Specifically, we investigate the question of how many faults a network
can sustain so that it still contains a large (i.e. linear-sized) connected
component that still has approximately the same expansion as the original
fault-free network. For this we apply a pruning technique which culls away
parts of the faulty network which have poor expansion. This technique can be
applied to both adversarial faults and to random faults. For adversarial faults
we prove that for every network with expansion alpha, a large connected
component with basically the same expansion as the original network exists for
up to a constant times alpha n faults. This result is tight in the sense that
every graph G of size n and uniform expansion alpha(.), i.e. G has an expansion
of alpha(n) and every subgraph G' of size m of G has an expansion of
O(alpha(m)), can be broken into sublinear components with omega(alpha(n) n)
faults.
  For random faults we observe that the situation is significantly different,
because in this case the expansion of a graph only gives a very weak bound on
its resilience to random faults. More specifically, there are networks of
uniform expansion O(sqrt{n}) that are resilient against a constant fault
probability but there are also networks of uniform expansion Omega(1/log n)
that are not resilient against a O(1/log n) fault probability. Thus, a
different parameter is needed. For this we introduce the span of a graph which
allows us to determine the maximum fault probability in a much better way than
the expansion can. We use the span to show the first known results for the
effect of random faults on the expansion of d-dimensional meshes.

the tree structure of XML implies the logical structure of concepts as defined
by attributional calculus. Especially, the attribute-value representation is
implementable in the XML framework. Since the attribute-value representation is
an important way to represent knowledge in AI, the framework offers a further
and simpler way than the powerful RDF technology.

 <dc:description>  Characterisations of interval graphs, comparability graphs, co-comparability
graphs, permutation graphs, and split graphs in terms of linear orderings of
the vertex set are presented. As an application, it is proved that interval
graphs, co-comparability graphs, AT-free graphs, and split graphs have
bandwidth bounded by their maximum degree.

 <dc:title>When Do Differences Matter? On-Line Feature Extraction Through Cognitive

 <dc:description>  For an intelligent agent to be truly autonomous, it must be able to adapt its
representation to the requirements of its task as it interacts with the world.
Most current approaches to on-line feature extraction are ad hoc; in contrast,
this paper presents an algorithm that bases judgments of state compatibility
and state-space abstraction on principled criteria derived from the
psychological principle of cognitive economy. The algorithm incorporates an
active form of Q-learning, and partitions continuous state-spaces by merging
and splitting Voronoi regions. The experiments illustrate a new methodology for
testing and comparing representations by means of learning curves. Results from
the puck-on-a-hill task demonstrate the algorithm's ability to learn effective
representations, superior to those produced by some other, well-known, methods.

 <dc:description>  In a variety of applications, we need to keep track of the development of a
data set over time. For maintaining and querying this multi version data
I/O-efficiently, external memory data structures are required. In this paper,
we present a probabilistic self-balancing persistent data structure in external
memory called the persistent buffer tree, which supports insertions, updates
and deletions of data items at the present version and range queries for any
version, past or present. The persistent buffer tree is I/O-optimal in the
sense that the expected amortized I/O performance bounds are asymptotically the
same as the deterministic amortized bounds of the (single version) buffer tree
in the worst case.

 <dc:description>  Numerical analysis has no satisfactory method for the more realistic
optimization models. However, with constraint programming one can compute a
cover for the solution set to arbitrarily close approximation. Because the use
of constraint propagation for composite arithmetic expressions is
computationally expensive, consistency is computed with interval arithmetic. In
this paper we present theorems that support, selective initialization, a simple
modification of constraint propagation that allows composite arithmetic
expressions to be handled efficiently.

 <dc:description>  We present some measurements and ideas for response time statistics in ERP
systems. It is shown that the response time distribution of a given transaction
in a given system is generically a log-normal distribution or, in some
situations, a sum of two or more log-normal distributions. We present some
arguments for this form of the distribution based on heuristic rules for
response times, and we show data from performance measurements in actual
systems to support the log-normal form. Deviations of the log-normal form can
often be traced back to performance problems in the system. Consequences for
the interpretation of response time data and for service level agreements are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  We discuss online strategies for visibility-based searching for an object
hidden behind a corner, using Kurt3D, a real autonomous mobile robot. This task
is closely related to a number of well-studied problems. Our robot uses a
three-dimensional laser scanner in a stop, scan, plan, go fashion for building
a virtual three-dimensional environment. Besides planning trajectories and
avoiding obstacles, Kurt3D is capable of identifying objects like a chair. We
derive a practically useful and asymptotically optimal strategy that guarantees
a competitive ratio of 2, which differs remarkably from the well-studied
scenario without the need of stopping for surveying the environment. Our
strategy is used by Kurt3D, documented in a separate video.

 <dc:description>  Component-based software development has posed a serious challenge to system
verification since externally-obtained components could be a new source of
system failures. This issue can not be completely solved by either
model-checking or traditional software testing techniques alone due to several
reasons:
  1) externally obtained components are usually unspecified/partially
specified; 2)it is generally difficult to establish an adequacy criteria for
testing a component; 3)components may be used to dynamically upgrade a system.
  This paper introduces a new approach (called {\em model-checking driven
black-box testing}) that combines model-checking with traditional black-box
software testing to tackle the problem in a complete, sound, and automatic way.
  The idea is to, with respect to some requirement (expressed in CTL or LTL)
about the system, use model-checking techniques to derive a condition
(expressed in communication graphs) for an unspecified component such that the
system satisfies the requirement iff the condition is satisfied by the
component, and which can be established by testing the component with test
cases generated from the condition on-the-fly. In this paper, we present
model-checking driven black-box testing algorithms to handle both CTL and LTL
requirements.
  We also illustrate the idea through some examples.

 <dc:title>2-Sat Sub-Clauses and the Hypernodal Structure of the 3-Sat Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Like simpler graphs, nested (hypernodal) graphs consist of two components: a
set of nodes and a set of edges, where each edge connects a pair of nodes. In
the hypernodal graph model, however, a node may contain other graphs, so that a
node may be contained in a graph that it contains. The inherently recursive
structure of the hypernodal graph model aptly characterizes both the structure
and dynamic of the 3-sat problem, a broadly applicable, though intractable,
computer science problem. In this paper I first discuss the structure of the
3-sat problem, analyzing the relation of 3-sat to 2-sat, a related, though
tractable problem. I then discuss sub-clauses and sub-clause thresholds and the
transformation of sub-clauses into implication graphs, demonstrating how
combinations of implication graphs are equivalent to hypernodal graphs. I
conclude with a brief discussion of the use of hypernodal graphs to model the
3-sat problem, illustrating how hypernodal graphs model both the conditions for
satisfiability and the process by which particular 3-sat assignments either
succeed or fail.

 <dc:description>  After reviewing unnormalized and normalized information distances based on
incomputable notions of Kolmogorov complexity, we discuss how Kolmogorov
complexity can be approximated by data compression algorithms. We argue that
optimal algorithms for data compression with side information can be
successfully used to approximate the normalized distance. Next, we discuss an
alternative information distance, which is based on relative entropy rate (also
known as Kullback-Leibler divergence), and compression-based algorithms for its
estimation. Based on available biological and linguistic data, we arrive to
unexpected conclusion that in Bioinformatics and Computational Linguistics this
alternative distance is more relevant and important than the ones based on
Kolmogorov complexity.

 <dc:description>  A growing body of literature in networked systems research relies on game
theory and mechanism design to model and address the potential lack of
cooperation between self-interested users. Most game-theoretic models applied
to system research only describe competitive equilibria in terms of pure Nash
equilibria, that is, a situation where the strategy of each user is
deterministic, and is her best response to the strategies of all the other
users. However, the assumptions necessary for a pure Nash equilibrium to hold
may be too stringent for practical systems. Using three case studies on
computer security, TCP congestion control, and network formation, we outline
the limits of game-theoretic models relying on Nash equilibria, and we argue
that considering competitive equilibria of a more general form may help
reconcile predictions from game-theoretic models with empirically observed
behavior.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present NLOMJ--a natural language object model in Java with
English as the experiment language. This modal describes the grammar elements
of any permissible expression in a natural language and their complicated
relations with each other with the concept &quot;Object&quot; in OOP(Object Oriented
Programming). Directly mapped to the syntax and semantics of the natural
language, it can be used in information retrieval as a linguistic method.
Around the UML diagram of the NLOMJ the important classes(Sentence, Clause and
Phrase) and their sub classes are introduced and their syntactic and semantic
meanings are explained.

 <dc:description>  Benchmarking; by which I mean any computer system that is driven by a
controlled workload, is the ultimate in performance testing and simulation.
Aside from being a form of institutionalized cheating, it also offer countless
opportunities for systematic mistakes in the way the workloads are applied and
the resulting measurements interpreted. Right test, wrong conclusion is a
ubiquitous mistake that happens because test engineers tend to treat data as
divine. Such reverence is not only misplaced, it's also a sure ticket to
production hell when the application finally goes live. I demonstrate how such
mistakes can be avoided by means of two war stories that are real WOPRs. (a)
How to resolve benchmark flaws over the psychic hotline and (b) How benchmarks
can go flat with too much Java juice. In each case I present simple performance
models and show how they can be applied to correctly assess benchmark data.

 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we use resource-bounded dimension theory to investigate
polynomial size circuits. We show that for every $i\geq 0$, $\Ppoly$ has $i$th
order scaled $\pthree$-strong dimension 0. We also show that $\Ppoly^\io$ has
$\pthree$-dimension 1/2, $\pthree$-strong dimension 1. Our results improve
previous measure results of Lutz (1992) and dimension results of Hitchcock and
Vinodchandran (2004).

 <dc:description>  A speculative overview of a future topic of research. The paper is a
collection of ideas concerning two related areas:
  1) Graph computation machines (&quot;computing with graphs&quot;). This is the class of
models of computation in which the state of the computation is represented as a
graph or network.
  2) Arc-based neural networks, which store information not as activation in
the nodes, but rather by adding and deleting arcs. Sometimes the arcs may be
interpreted as synchronization.
  Warnings to readers: this is not the sort of thing that one might submit to a
journal or conference. No proofs are presented. The presentation is informal,
and written at an introductory level. You'll probably want to wait for a more
concise presentation.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the application of some well known two-dimensional
geometrical shape descriptors for the visualisation of the structure of
architectural open spaces. The paper demonstrates the use of visibility
measures such as distance to obstacles and amount of visible space to calculate
shape descriptors such as convexity and skeleton of the open space. The aim of
the paper is to indicate a simple, objective and quantifiable approach to
understand the structure of open spaces otherwise impossible due to the complex
construction of built structures.

 <dc:description>  In this work I present a technique of construction and fast evaluation of a
family of cubic polynomials for analytic smoothing and graphical rendering of
particles trajectories for flows in a generic geometry. The principal result of
the work was implementation and test of a method for interpolating 3D points by
regular parametric curves and their fast and efficient evaluation for a good
resolution of rendering. For the purpose I have used a parallel environment
using a multiprocessor cluster architecture. The efficiency of the used method
is good, mainly reducing the number of floating-points computations by caching
the numerical values of some line-parameter's powers, and reducing the
necessity of communication among processes. This work has been developed for
the Research and Development Department of my company for planning advanced
customized models of industrial burners.

 <dc:description>  Cousot and Cousot introduced and studied a general past/future-time
specification language, called mu*-calculus, featuring a natural time-symmetric
trace-based semantics. The standard state-based semantics of the mu*-calculus
is an abstract interpretation of its trace-based semantics, which turns out to
be incomplete (i.e., trace-incomplete), even for finite systems. As a
consequence, standard state-based model checking of the mu*-calculus is
incomplete w.r.t. trace-based model checking. This paper shows that any
refinement or abstraction of the domain of sets of states induces a
corresponding semantics which is still trace-incomplete for any propositional
fragment of the mu*-calculus. This derives from a number of results, one for
each incomplete logical/temporal connective of the mu*-calculus, that
characterize the structure of models, i.e. transition systems, whose
corresponding state-based semantics of the mu*-calculus is trace-complete.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a methodology for summarization from multiple documents
which are about a specific topic. It is based on the specification and
identification of the cross-document relations that occur among textual
elements within those documents. Our methodology involves the specification of
the topic-specific entities, the messages conveyed for the specific entities by
certain textual elements and the specification of the relations that can hold
among these messages. The above resources are necessary for setting up a
specific topic for our query-based summarization approach which uses these
resources to identify the query-specific messages within the documents and the
query-specific relations that connect these messages across documents.

 <dc:title>A General Framework For Lazy Functional Logic Programming With Algebraic

 <dc:description>  We propose a general framework for first-order functional logic programming,
supporting lazy functions, non-determinism and polymorphic datatypes whose data
constructors obey a set C of equational axioms. On top of a given C, we specify
a program as a set R of C-based conditional rewriting rules for defined
functions. We argue that equational logic does not supply the proper semantics
for such programs. Therefore, we present an alternative logic which includes
C-based rewriting calculi and a notion of model. We get soundness and
completeness for C-based rewriting w.r.t. models, existence of free models for
all programs, and type preservation results. As operational semantics, we
develop a sound and complete procedure for goal solving, which is based on the
combination of lazy narrowing with unification modulo C. Our framework is quite
expressive for many purposes, such as solving action and change problems, or
realizing the GAMMA computation model.

actions to increase an agent's knowledge of the world and non-deterministic
actions to remove knowledge. We include complex plans involving conditionals
and loops in our query language for hypothetical reasoning. We also present a
translation of Ak domain descriptions into epistemic logic programs.

 <dc:description>  Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and Hereditary Harrop formulas (HH) are
two well known ways to enhance the expressivity of Horn clauses. In this paper,
we present a novel combination of these two approaches. We show how to enrich
the syntax and proof theory of HH with the help of a given constraint system,
in such a way that the key property of HH as a logic programming language
(namely, the existence of uniform proofs) is preserved. We also present a
procedure for goal solving, showing its soundness and completeness for
computing answer constraints. As a consequence of this result, we obtain a new
strong completeness theorem for CLP that avoids the need to build disjunctions
of computed answers, as well as a more abstract formulation of a known
completeness theorem for HH.

 <dc:description>  Logic languages based on the theory of rational, possibly infinite, trees
have much appeal in that rational trees allow for faster unification (due to
the safe omission of the occurs-check) and increased expressivity (cyclic terms
can provide very efficient representations of grammars and other useful
objects). Unfortunately, the use of infinite rational trees has problems. For
instance, many of the built-in and library predicates are ill-defined for such
trees and need to be supplemented by run-time checks whose cost may be
significant. Moreover, some widely-used program analysis and manipulation
techniques are correct only for those parts of programs working over finite
trees. It is thus important to obtain, automatically, a knowledge of the
program variables (the finite variables) that, at the program points of
interest, will always be bound to finite terms. For these reasons, we propose
here a new data-flow analysis, based on abstract interpretation, that captures
such information.

 <dc:description>  The objective of this paper is to develop a functional programming language
for quantum computers. We develop a lambda calculus for the classical control
model, following the first author's work on quantum flow-charts. We define a
call-by-value operational semantics, and we give a type system using affine
intuitionistic linear logic. The main results of this paper are the safety
properties of the language and the development of a type inference algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We study the properties of the Minimum Description Length principle for
sequence prediction, considering a two-part MDL estimator which is chosen from
a countable class of models. This applies in particular to the important case
of universal sequence prediction, where the model class corresponds to all
algorithms for some fixed universal Turing machine (this correspondence is by
enumerable semimeasures, hence the resulting models are stochastic). We prove
convergence theorems similar to Solomonoff's theorem of universal induction,
which also holds for general Bayes mixtures. The bound characterizing the
convergence speed for MDL predictions is exponentially larger as compared to
Bayes mixtures. We observe that there are at least three different ways of
using MDL for prediction. One of these has worse prediction properties, for
which predictions only converge if the MDL estimator stabilizes. We establish
sufficient conditions for this to occur. Finally, some immediate consequences
for complexity relations and randomness criteria are proven.

 <dc:description>  We study an interesting family of cooperating coroutines, which is able to
generate all patterns of bits that satisfy certain fairly general ordering
constraints, changing only one bit at a time. (More precisely, the directed
graph of constraints is required to be cycle-free when it is regarded as an
undirected graph.) If the coroutines are implemented carefully, they yield an
algorithm that needs only a bounded amount of computation per bit change,
thereby solving an open problem in the field of combinatorial pattern
generation.

 <dc:title>Toward a New Policy for Scientific and Technical Communication: the Case
  of Kyrgyz Republic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Djenchuraev, Nurlan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The objective of this policy paper is to formulate a new policy in the field
of scientific and technical information (STI) in Kyrgyz Republic in the light
of emergence and rapid development of electronic scientific communication. The
major problem with communication in science in the Republic is lack of adequate
access to information by scientists. An equally serious problem is poor
visibility of research conducted in Kyrgyzstan and, as consequence, negligible
research impact on academic society globally. The paper proposes an integrated
approach to formulation of a new STI policy based on a number of policy
components: telecommunication networks, computerization, STI systems,
legislation &amp; standards, and education &amp; trainings. Two alternatives were
considered: electronic vs. paper-based scientific communication and development
of the national STI system vs. cross-national virtual collaboration. The study
results in suggesting a number of policy recommendations for identified
stakeholders.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that, under certain conditions, it is possible to split
logic programs under stable model semantics, i.e. to divide such a program into
a number of different &quot;levels&quot;, such that the models of the entire program can
be constructed by incrementally constructing models for each level. Similar
results exist for other non-monotonic formalisms, such as auto-epistemic logic
and default logic. In this work, we present a general, algebraicsplitting
theory for logics with a fixpoint semantics. Together with the framework of
approximation theory, a general fixpoint theory for arbitrary operators, this
gives us a uniform and powerful way of deriving splitting results for each
logic with a fixpoint semantics. We demonstrate the usefulness of these
results, by generalizing existing results for logic programming, auto-epistemic
logic and default logic.

 <dc:title>Model checking for Process Rewrite Systems and a class of action--based

 <dc:creator>Bozzelli, Laura</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>68Q60</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the model checking problem for Process Rewrite Systems (PRSs), an
infinite-state formalism (non Turing-powerful) which subsumes many common
models such as Pushdown Processes and Petri Nets. PRSs can be adopted as formal
models for programs with dynamic creation and synchronization of concurrent
processes, and with recursive procedures. The model-checking problem for PRSs
and action-based linear temporal logic (ALTL) is undecidable. However,
decidability for some interesting fragment of ALTL remains an open question. In
this paper we state decidability results concerning generalized acceptance
properties about infinite derivations (infinite term rewriting) in PRSs. As a
consequence, we obtain decidability of the model-checking (restricted to
infinite runs) for PRSs and a meaningful fragment of ALTL.

 <dc:description>  Maximum-likelihood decoding is one of the central algorithmic problems in
coding theory. It has been known for over 25 years that maximum-likelihood
decoding of general linear codes is NP-hard. Nevertheless, it was so far
unknown whether maximum- likelihood decoding remains hard for any specific
family of codes with nontrivial algebraic structure. In this paper, we prove
that maximum-likelihood decoding is NP-hard for the family of Reed-Solomon
codes. We moreover show that maximum-likelihood decoding of Reed-Solomon codes
remains hard even with unlimited preprocessing, thereby strengthening a result
of Bruck and Naor.

 <dc:description>  We describe in this paper a new method for building an efficient algorithm
for scheduling jobs in a cluster. Jobs are considered as parallel tasks (PT)
which can be scheduled on any number of processors. The main feature is to
consider two criteria that are optimized together. These criteria are the
makespan and the weighted minimal average completion time (minsum). They are
chosen for their complementarity, to be able to represent both user-oriented
objectives and system administrator objectives. We propose an algorithm based
on a batch policy with increasing batch sizes, with a smart selection of jobs
in each batch. This algorithm is assessed by intensive simulation results,
compared to a new lower bound (obtained by a relaxation of ILP) of the optimal
schedules for both criteria separately. It is currently implemented in an
actual real-size cluster platform.

 <dc:description>  Spam, also known as Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), is the bane of email
communication. Many data mining researchers have addressed the problem of
detecting spam, generally by treating it as a static text classification
problem. True in vivo spam filtering has characteristics that make it a rich
and challenging domain for data mining. Indeed, real-world datasets with these
characteristics are typically difficult to acquire and to share. This paper
demonstrates some of these characteristics and argues that researchers should
pursue in vivo spam filtering as an accessible domain for investigating them.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we examine the performance of four fuzzy rule generation
methods on Wisconsin breast cancer data. The first method generates fuzzy if
then rules using the mean and the standard deviation of attribute values. The
second approach generates fuzzy if then rules using the histogram of attributes
values. The third procedure generates fuzzy if then rules with certainty of
each attribute into homogeneous fuzzy sets. In the fourth approach, only
overlapping areas are partitioned. The first two approaches generate a single
fuzzy if then rule for each class by specifying the membership function of each
antecedent fuzzy set using the information about attribute values of training
patterns. The other two approaches are based on fuzzy grids with homogeneous
fuzzy partitions of each attribute. The performance of each approach is
evaluated on breast cancer data sets. Simulation results show that the Modified
grid approach has a high classification rate of 99.73 %.

 <dc:description>  The integration of different learning and adaptation techniques to overcome
individual limitations and to achieve synergetic effects through the
hybridization or fusion of these techniques has, in recent years, contributed
to a large number of new intelligent system designs. Computational intelligence
is an innovative framework for constructing intelligent hybrid architectures
involving Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), Probabilistic
Reasoning (PR) and derivative free optimization techniques such as Evolutionary
Computation (EC). Most of these hybridization approaches, however, follow an ad
hoc design methodology, justified by success in certain application domains.
Due to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the
various hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance
comparatively. This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for
integrating intelligent systems. The designing aspects and perspectives of
different hybrid archirectures like NN-FIS, EC-FIS, EC-NN, FIS-PR and NN-FIS-EC
systems are presented. Some conclusions are also provided towards the end.

 <dc:subject>I.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neuro-fuzzy systems have attracted growing interest of researchers in various
scientific and engineering areas due to the increasing need of intelligent
systems. This paper evaluates the use of two popular soft computing techniques
and conventional statistical approach based on Box--Jenkins autoregressive
integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict electricity demand in the
State of Victoria, Australia. The soft computing methods considered are an
evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN) and an artificial neural network (ANN)
trained using scaled conjugate gradient algorithm (CGA) and backpropagation
(BP) algorithm. The forecast accuracy is compared with the forecasts used by
Victorian Power Exchange (VPX) and the actual energy demand. To evaluate, we
considered load demand patterns for 10 consecutive months taken every 30 min
for training the different prediction models. Test results show that the
neuro-fuzzy system performed better than neural networks, ARIMA model and the
VPX forecasts.

 <dc:description>  Fusion of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS)
have attracted the growing interest of researchers in various scientific and
engineering areas due to the growing need of adaptive intelligent systems to
solve the real world problems. ANN learns from scratch by adjusting the
interconnections between layers. FIS is a popular computing framework based on
the concept of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy if-then rules, and fuzzy reasoning. The
advantages of a combination of ANN and FIS are obvious. There are several
approaches to integrate ANN and FIS and very often it depends on the
application. We broadly classify the integration of ANN and FIS into three
categories namely concurrent model, cooperative model and fully fused model.
This paper starts with a discussion of the features of each model and
generalize the advantages and deficiencies of each model. We further focus the
review on the different types of fused neuro-fuzzy systems and citing the
advantages and disadvantages of each model.

 <dc:description>  Long-term rainfall prediction is a challenging task especially in the modern
world where we are facing the major environmental problem of global warming. In
general, climate and rainfall are highly non-linear phenomena in nature
exhibiting what is known as the butterfly effect. While some regions of the
world are noticing a systematic decrease in annual rainfall, others notice
increases in flooding and severe storms. The global nature of this phenomenon
is very complicated and requires sophisticated computer modeling and simulation
to predict accurately. In this paper, we report a performance analysis for
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)and artificial neural networks
for one month ahead prediction of rainfall. To evaluate the prediction
efficiency, we made use of 87 years of rainfall data in Kerala state, the
southern part of the Indian peninsula situated at latitude -longitude pairs
(8o29'N - 76o57' E). We used an artificial neural network trained using the
scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. The neural network and MARS were trained
with 40 years of rainfall data. For performance evaluation, network predicted
outputs were compared with the actual rainfall data. Simulation results reveal
that MARS is a good forecasting tool and performed better than the considered
neural network.

 <dc:description>  Classification of texture pattern is one of the most important problems in
pattern recognition. In this paper, we present a classification method based on
the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients of texture image. As DCT works
on gray level image, the color scheme of each image is transformed into gray
levels. For classifying the images using DCT we used two popular soft computing
techniques namely neurocomputing and neuro-fuzzy computing. We used a
feedforward neural network trained using the backpropagation learning and an
evolving fuzzy neural network to classify the textures. The soft computing
models were trained using 80% of the texture data and remaining was used for
testing and validation purposes. A performance comparison was made among the
soft computing models for the texture classification problem. We also analyzed
the effects of prolonged training of neural networks. It is observed that the
proposed neuro-fuzzy model performed better than neural network.

 <dc:description>  Sorting by reversals is an important problem in inferring the evolutionary
relationship between two genomes. The problem of sorting unsigned permutation
has been proven to be NP-hard. The best guaranteed error bounded is the 3/2-
approximation algorithm. However, the problem of sorting signed permutation can
be solved easily. Fast algorithms have been developed both for finding the
sorting sequence and finding the reversal distance of signed permutation. In
this paper, we present a way to view the problem of sorting unsigned
permutation as signed permutation. And the problem can then be seen as
searching an optimal signed permutation in all n2 corresponding signed
permutations. We use genetic algorithm to conduct the search. Our experimental
result shows that the proposed method outperform the 3/2-approximation
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Reconfigurable computing refers to the use of processors, such as Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), that can be modified at the hardware level to
take on different processing tasks. A reconfigurable computing platform
describes the hardware and software base on top of which modular extensions can
be created, depending on the desired application. Such reconfigurable computing
platforms can take on varied designs and implementations, according to the
constraints imposed and features desired by the scope of applications. This
paper introduces a PC-based reconfigurable computing platform software
frameworks that is flexible and extensible enough to abstract the different
hardware types and functionality that different PCs may have. The requirements
of the software platform, architectural issues addressed, rationale behind the
decisions made, and frameworks design implemented are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Past few years have witnessed a growing recognition of intelligent techniques
for the construction of efficient and reliable intrusion detection systems. Due
to increasing incidents of cyber attacks, building effective intrusion
detection systems (IDS) are essential for protecting information systems
security, and yet it remains an elusive goal and a great challenge. In this
paper, we report a performance analysis between Multivariate Adaptive
Regression Splines (MARS), neural networks and support vector machines. The
MARS procedure builds flexible regression models by fitting separate splines to
distinct intervals of the predictor variables. A brief comparison of different
neural network learning algorithms is also given.

 <dc:description>  The aim of our research was to apply well-known data mining techniques (such
as linear neural networks, multi-layered perceptrons, probabilistic neural
networks, classification and regression trees, support vector machines and
finally a hybrid decision tree neural network approach) to the problem of
predicting the quality of service in call centers; based on the performance
data actually collected in a call center of a large insurance company. Our aim
was two-fold. First, to compare the performance of models built using the
above-mentioned techniques and, second, to analyze the characteristics of the
input sensitivity in order to better understand the relationship between the
perform-ance evaluation process and the actual performance and in this way help
improve the performance of call centers. In this paper we summarize our
findings.

 <dc:title>Modeling Chaotic Behavior of Stock Indices Using Intelligent Paradigms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The use of intelligent systems for stock market predictions has been widely
established. In this paper, we investigate how the seemingly chaotic behavior
of stock markets could be well represented using several connectionist
paradigms and soft computing techniques. To demonstrate the different
techniques, we considered Nasdaq-100 index of Nasdaq Stock MarketS and the S&amp;P
CNX NIFTY stock index. We analyzed 7 year's Nasdaq 100 main index values and 4
year's NIFTY index values. This paper investigates the development of a
reliable and efficient technique to model the seemingly chaotic behavior of
stock markets. We considered an artificial neural network trained using
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Takagi-Sugeno
neuro-fuzzy model and a Difference Boosting Neural Network (DBNN). This paper
briefly explains how the different connectionist paradigms could be formulated
using different learning methods and then investigates whether they can provide
the required level of performance, which are sufficiently good and robust so as
to provide a reliable forecast model for stock market indices. Experiment
results reveal that all the connectionist paradigms considered could represent
the stock indices behavior very accurately.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Fuzzy-Linear Programming Approach for Multi Criteria Decision

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to point to the usefulness of applying a linear
mathematical formulation of fuzzy multiple criteria objective decision methods
in organising business activities. In this respect fuzzy parameters of linear
programming are modelled by preference-based membership functions. This paper
begins with an introduction and some related research followed by some
fundamentals of fuzzy set theory and technical concepts of fuzzy multiple
objective decision models. Further a real case study of a manufacturing plant
and the implementation of the proposed technique is presented. Empirical
results clearly show the superiority of the fuzzy technique in optimising
individual objective functions when compared to non-fuzzy approach.
Furthermore, for the problem considered, the optimal solution helps to infer
that by incorporating fuzziness in a linear programming model either in
constraints, or both in objective functions and constraints, provides a similar
(or even better) level of satisfaction for obtained results compared to
non-fuzzy linear programming.

integer d&gt;2 and real epsilon &gt; 0; consider the probability that a random
d-regular graph on n vertices has the second eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix
greater than 2 sqrt(d-1) + epsilon; then this probability goes to zero as n
tends to infinity.
  We prove the conjecture for a number of notions of random d-regular graph,
including models for d odd. We also estimate the aforementioned probability
more precisely, showing in many cases and models (but not all) that it decays
like a polynomial in 1/n.

 <dc:description>  The multi-homogeneous Bezout number is a bound for the number of solutions of
a system of multi-homogeneous polynomial equations, in a suitable product of
projective spaces.
  Given an arbitrary, not necessarily multi-homogeneous system, one can ask for
the optimal multi-homogenization that would minimize the Bezout number.
  In this paper, it is proved that the problem of computing, or even estimating
the optimal multi-homogeneous Bezout number is actually NP-hard.
  In terms of approximation theory for combinatorial optimization, the problem
of computing the best multi-homogeneous structure does not belong to APX,
unless P = NP.
  Moreover, polynomial time algorithms for estimating the minimal
multi-homogeneous Bezout number up to a fixed factor cannot exist even in a
randomized setting, unless BPP contains NP.

does not compromise the system. However, we demonstrate that the cipher is

 <dc:description>  The next generation of scientific experiments and studies, popularly called
as e-Science, is carried out by large collaborations of researchers distributed
around the world engaged in analysis of huge collections of data generated by
scientific instruments. Grid computing has emerged as an enabler for e-Science
as it permits the creation of virtual organizations that bring together
communities with common objectives. Within a community, data collections are
stored or replicated on distributed resources to enhance storage capability or
efficiency of access. In such an environment, scientists need to have the
ability to carry out their studies by transparently accessing distributed data
and computational resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a Grid
broker that mediates access to distributed resources by (a) discovering
suitable data sources for a given analysis scenario, (b) suitable computational
resources, (c) optimally mapping analysis jobs to resources, (d) deploying and
monitoring job execution on selected resources, (e) accessing data from local
or remote data source during job execution and (f) collating and presenting
results. The broker supports a declarative and dynamic parametric programming
model for creating grid applications. We have used this model in grid-enabling
a high energy physics analysis application (Belle Analysis Software Framework).
The broker has been used in deploying Belle experiment data analysis jobs on a
grid testbed, called Belle Analysis Data Grid, having resources distributed
across Australia interconnected through GrangeNet.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present MLEANN (Meta-Learning Evolutionary Artificial
Neural Network), an automatic computational framework for the adaptive
optimization of artificial neural networks wherein the neural network
architecture, activation function, connection weights; learning algorithm and
its parameters are adapted according to the problem. We explored the
performance of MLEANN and conventionally designed artificial neural networks
for function approximation problems. To evaluate the comparative performance,
we used three different well-known chaotic time series. We also present the
state of the art popular neural network learning algorithms and some
experimentation results related to convergence speed and generalization
performance. We explored the performance of backpropagation algorithm;
conjugate gradient algorithm, quasi-Newton algorithm and Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm for the three chaotic time series. Performances of the different
learning algorithms were evaluated when the activation functions and
architecture were changed. We further present the theoretical background,
algorithm, design strategy and further demonstrate how effective and inevitable
is the proposed MLEANN framework to design a neural network, which is smaller,
faster and with a better generalization performance.

 <dc:title>The Largest Compatible Subset Problem for Phylogenetic Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The phylogenetic tree construction is to infer the evolutionary relationship
between species from the experimental data. However, the experimental data are
often imperfect and conflicting each others. Therefore, it is important to
extract the motif from the imperfect data. The largest compatible subset
problem is that, given a set of experimental data, we want to discard the
minimum such that the remaining is compatible. The largest compatible subset
problem can be viewed as the vertex cover problem in the graph theory that has
been proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Evolutionary
Computing (EC) method for this problem. The proposed method combines the EC
approach and the algorithmic approach for special structured graphs. As a
result, the complexity of the problem is dramatically reduced. Experiments were
performed on randomly generated graphs with different edge densities. The
vertex covers produced by the proposed method were then compared to the vertex
covers produced by a 2-approximation algorithm. The experimental results showed
that the proposed method consistently outperformed a classical 2- approximation
algorithm. Furthermore, a significant improvement was found when the graph
density was small.

 <dc:description>  Decision-making is a process of choosing among alternative courses of action
for solving complicated problems where multi-criteria objectives are involved.
The past few years have witnessed a growing recognition of Soft Computing
technologies that underlie the conception, design and utilization of
intelligent systems. Several works have been done where engineers and
scientists have applied intelligent techniques and heuristics to obtain optimal
decisions from imprecise information. In this paper, we present a concurrent
fuzzy-neural network approach combining unsupervised and supervised learning
techniques to develop the Tactical Air Combat Decision Support System (TACDSS).
Experiment results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
technique.

 <dc:description>  An approach to robotics called layered evolution and merging features from
the subsumption architecture into evolutionary robotics is presented, and its
advantages are discussed. This approach is used to construct a layered
controller for a simulated robot that learns which light source to approach in
an environment with obstacles. The evolvability and performance of layered
evolution on this task is compared to (standard) monolithic evolution,
incremental and modularised evolution. To corroborate the hypothesis that a
layered controller performs at least as well as an integrated one, the evolved
layers are merged back into a single network. On the grounds of the test
results, it is argued that layered evolution provides a superior approach for
many tasks, and it is suggested that this approach may be the key to scaling up
evolutionary robotics.

 <dc:title>Analysis of Hybrid Soft and Hard Computing Techniques for Forex
  Monitoring Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abraham, Ajith</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>1.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a universe with a single currency, there would be no foreign exchange
market, no foreign exchange rates, and no foreign exchange. Over the past
twenty-five years, the way the market has performed those tasks has changed
enormously. The need for intelligent monitoring systems has become a necessity
to keep track of the complex forex market. The vast currency market is a
foreign concept to the average individual. However, once it is broken down into
simple terms, the average individual can begin to understand the foreign
exchange market and use it as a financial instrument for future investing. In
this paper, we attempt to compare the performance of hybrid soft computing and
hard computing techniques to predict the average monthly forex rates one month
ahead. The soft computing models considered are a neural network trained by the
scaled conjugate gradient algorithm and a neuro-fuzzy model implementing a
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system. We also considered Multivariate Adaptive
Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and a
hybrid CART-MARS technique. We considered the exchange rates of Australian
dollar with respect to US dollar, Singapore dollar, New Zealand dollar,
Japanese yen and United Kingdom pounds. The models were trained using 70% of
the data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. It is
observed that the proposed hybrid models could predict the forex rates more
accurately than all the techniques when applied individually. Empirical results
also reveal that the hybrid hard computing approach also improved some of our
previous work using a neuro-fuzzy approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new framework for one-dimensional contour extraction from
discrete two-dimensional data sets is presented. Contour extraction is
important in many scientific fields such as digital image processing, computer
vision, pattern recognition, etc. This novel framework includes (but is not
limited to) algorithms for dilated contour extraction, contour displacement,
shape skeleton extraction, contour continuation, shape feature based contour
refinement and contour simplification. Many of the new techniques depend
strongly on the application of a Delaunay tessellation. In order to demonstrate
the versatility of this novel toolbox approach, the contour extraction
techniques presented here are applied to scientific problems in material
science, biology and heavy ion physics.

 <dc:description>  The rapid e-commerce growth has made both business community and customers
face a new situation. Due to intense competition on one hand and the customer's
option to choose from several alternatives business community has realized the
necessity of intelligent marketing strategies and relationship management. Web
usage mining attempts to discover useful knowledge from the secondary data
obtained from the interactions of the users with the Web. Web usage mining has
become very critical for effective Web site management, creating adaptive Web
sites, business and support services, personalization, network traffic flow
analysis and so on. In this paper, we present the important concepts of Web
usage mining and its various practical applications. We further present a novel
approach 'intelligent-miner' (i-Miner) to optimize the concurrent architecture
of a fuzzy clustering algorithm (to discover web data clusters) and a fuzzy
inference system to analyze the Web site visitor trends. A hybrid evolutionary
fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper to optimally segregate
similar user interests. The clustered data is then used to analyze the trends
using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system learned using a combination of
evolutionary algorithm and neural network learning. Proposed approach is
compared with self-organizing maps (to discover patterns) and several function
approximation techniques like neural networks, linear genetic programming and
Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system (to analyze the clusters). The results are
graphically illustrated and the practical significance is discussed in detail.
Empirical results clearly show that the proposed Web usage-mining framework is
efficient.

 <dc:description>  Several adaptation techniques have been investigated to optimize fuzzy
inference systems. Neural network learning algorithms have been used to
determine the parameters of fuzzy inference system. Such models are often
called as integrated neuro-fuzzy models. In an integrated neuro-fuzzy model
there is no guarantee that the neural network learning algorithm converges and
the tuning of fuzzy inference system will be successful. Success of
evolutionary search procedures for optimization of fuzzy inference system is
well proven and established in many application areas. In this paper, we will
explore how the optimization of fuzzy inference systems could be further
improved using a meta-heuristic approach combining neural network learning and
evolutionary computation. The proposed technique could be considered as a
methodology to integrate neural networks, fuzzy inference systems and
evolutionary search procedures. We present the theoretical frameworks and some
experimental results to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique.

 <dc:subject>1.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evolutionary artificial neural networks (EANNs) refer to a special class of
artificial neural networks (ANNs) in which evolution is another fundamental
form of adaptation in addition to learning. Evolutionary algorithms are used to
adapt the connection weights, network architecture and learning algorithms
according to the problem environment. Even though evolutionary algorithms are
well known as efficient global search algorithms, very often they miss the best
local solutions in the complex solution space. In this paper, we propose a
hybrid meta-heuristic learning approach combining evolutionary learning and
local search methods (using 1st and 2nd order error information) to improve the
learning and faster convergence obtained using a direct evolutionary approach.
The proposed technique is tested on three different chaotic time series and the
test results are compared with some popular neuro-fuzzy systems and a recently
developed cutting angle method of global optimization. Empirical results reveal
that the proposed technique is efficient in spite of the computational
complexity.

 <dc:description>  Key predistribution is a well-known technique for ensuring secure
communication via encryption among sensors deployed in an ad-hoc manner to form
a sensor network. In this paper, we propose a novel 2-Phase technique for key
predistribution based on a combination of inherited and random key assignments
from the given key pool to individual sensor nodes. We also develop an
analytical framework for measuring security-performance tradeoffs of different
key distribution schemes by providing metrics for measuring sensornet
connectivity and resiliency to enemy attacks. In particular, we show
analytically that the 2-Phase scheme provides better average connectivity and
superior $q$-composite connectivity than the random scheme. We then prove that
the invulnerability of a communication link under arbitrary number of node
captures by an adversary is higher under the 2-Phase scheme. The probability of
a communicating node pair having an exclusive key also scales better with
network size under the 2-Phase scheme. We also show analytically that the
vulnerability of an arbitrary communication link in the sensornet to single
node capture is lower under 2-Phase assuming both network-wide as well as
localized capture. Simulation results also show that the number of exclusive
keys shared between any two nodes is higher while the number of $q$-composite
links compromised when a given number of nodes are captured by the enemy is
smaller under the 2-Phase scheme as compared to the random one.

 <dc:description>  Triangle strips have been widely used for efficient rendering. It is
NP-complete to test whether a given triangulated model can be represented as a
single triangle strip, so many heuristics have been proposed to partition
models into few long strips. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for
creating a single triangle loop or strip from a triangulated model. Our method
applies a dual graph matching algorithm to partition the mesh into cycles, and
then merges pairs of cycles by splitting adjacent triangles when necessary. New
vertices are introduced at midpoints of edges and the new triangles thus formed
are coplanar with their parent triangles, hence the visual fidelity of the
geometry is not changed. We prove that the increase in the number of triangles
due to this splitting is 50% in the worst case, however for all models we
tested the increase was less than 2%. We also prove tight bounds on the number
of triangles needed for a single-strip representation of a model with holes on
its boundary. Our strips can be used not only for efficient rendering, but also
for other applications including the generation of space filling curves on a
manifold of any arbitrary topology.

 <dc:description>  A probabilistic model for computer-based generation of a machine translation
system on the basis of English-Russian parallel text corpora is suggested. The
model is trained using parallel text corpora with pre-aligned source and target
sentences. The training of the model results in a bilingual dictionary of words
and &quot;word blocks&quot; with relevant translation probability.

 <dc:description>  The framework of algorithmic knowledge assumes that agents use algorithms to
compute the facts they explicitly know. In many cases of interest, a deductive
system, rather than a particular algorithm, captures the formal reasoning used
by the agents to compute what they explicitly know. We introduce a logic for
reasoning about both implicit and explicit knowledge with the latter defined
with respect to a deductive system formalizing a logical theory for agents. The
highly structured nature of deductive systems leads to very natural
axiomatizations of the resulting logic when interpreted over any fixed
deductive system. The decision problem for the logic, in the presence of a
single agent, is NP-complete in general, no harder than propositional logic. It
remains NP-complete when we fix a deductive system that is decidable in
nondeterministic polynomial time. These results extend in a straightforward way
to multiple agents.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of modeling the content structure of texts within a
specific domain, in terms of the topics the texts address and the order in
which these topics appear. We first present an effective knowledge-lean method
for learning content models from un-annotated documents, utilizing a novel
adaptation of algorithms for Hidden Markov Models. We then apply our method to
two complementary tasks: information ordering and extractive summarization. Our
experiments show that incorporating content models in these applications yields
substantial improvement over previously-proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  In order to cope with situations in which a plant's dynamics are not
precisely known, we consider the problem of supervisory control for a class of
discrete event systems modelled by fuzzy automata. The behavior of such
discrete event systems is described by fuzzy languages; the supervisors are
event feedback and can disable only controllable events with any degree. The
concept of discrete event system controllability is thus extended by
incorporating fuzziness. In this new sense, we present a necessary and
sufficient condition for a fuzzy language to be controllable. We also study the
supremal controllable fuzzy sublanguage and the infimal controllable fuzzy
superlanguage when a given pre-specified desired fuzzy language is
uncontrollable. Our framework generalizes that of Ramadge-Wonham and reduces to
Ramadge-Wonham framework when membership grades in all fuzzy languages must be
either 0 or 1. The theoretical development is accompanied by illustrative
numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks benefit from communication protocols that reduce
power requirements by avoiding frame collision. Time Division Media Access
methods schedule transmission in slots to avoid collision, however these
methods often lack scalability when implemented in \emph{ad hoc} networks
subject to node failures and dynamic topology. This paper reports a distributed
algorithm for TDMA slot assignment that is self-stabilizing to transient faults
and dynamic topology change. The expected local convergence time is O(1) for
any size network satisfying a constant bound on the size of a node
neighborhood.

 <dc:description>  When applying aggregating strategies to Prediction with Expert Advice, the
learning rate must be adaptively tuned. The natural choice of
sqrt(complexity/current loss) renders the analysis of Weighted Majority
derivatives quite complicated. In particular, for arbitrary weights there have
been no results proven so far. The analysis of the alternative &quot;Follow the
Perturbed Leader&quot; (FPL) algorithm from Kalai (2003} (based on Hannan's
algorithm) is easier. We derive loss bounds for adaptive learning rate and both
finite expert classes with uniform weights and countable expert classes with
arbitrary weights. For the former setup, our loss bounds match the best known
results so far, while for the latter our results are (to our knowledge) new.

 <dc:description>  Most previous work on the recently developed language-modeling approach to
information retrieval focuses on document-specific characteristics, and
therefore does not take into account the structure of the surrounding corpus.
We propose a novel algorithmic framework in which information provided by
document-based language models is enhanced by the incorporation of information
drawn from clusters of similar documents. Using this framework, we develop a
suite of new algorithms. Even the simplest typically outperforms the standard
language-modeling approach in precision and recall, and our new interpolation
algorithm posts statistically significant improvements for both metrics over
all three corpora tested.

 <dc:description>  The global audience for software products includes members of different
countries, religions, and cultures: people who speak different languages, have
different life styles, and have different perceptions and expectations of any
given product. A major impediment in interface development is that there is
inadequate empirical evidence for the effects of culture in the usability
engineering methods used for developing user interfaces. This paper presents a
controlled study investigating the effects of culture on the effectiveness of
structured interviews in usability testing. The experiment consisted of
usability testing of a website with two independent groups of Indian
participants by two interviewers; one belonging to the Indian culture and the
other to the Anglo-American culture. Participants found more usability problems
and made more suggestions to an interviewer who was a member of the same
(Indian) culture than to the foreign (Anglo-American) interviewer. The results
of the study empirically establish that culture significantly affects the
efficacy of structured interviews during international user testing. The
implications of this work for usability engineering are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Security of computers and the networks that connect them is increasingly
becoming of great significance. Computer security is defined as the protection
of computing systems against threats to confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. There are two types of intruders: external intruders, who are
unauthorized users of the machines they attack, and internal intruders, who
have permission to access the system with some restrictions. This chapter
presents a soft computing approach to detect intrusions in a network. Among the
several soft computing paradigms, we investigated fuzzy rule-based classifiers,
decision trees, support vector machines, linear genetic programming and an
ensemble method to model fast and efficient intrusion detection systems.
Empirical results clearly show that soft computing approach could play a major
role for intrusion detection.

expressed in storage of all parameters of the design in one element of the

modulus from these parameters. The common principles of the system organization
of extensions developing are described: separation of the part of the design to

views, generally views of 3D projections or slices of a higher dimensional
data, are tightly coupled not only by their specific order but also by a view
synchronizing interaction style, and an internally defined interaction
language. The tight coupling of the different views allows a fast and
well-coordinated exploration of the data. In particular, the visualization
allowed us to easily make consistency checks of the 4D QCD data and to infer
the correctness of particle properties calculations. The software developed was
also successfully applied in material studies, in particular studies of
meteorite properties. Our implementation uses the VTK API. To handle a large
number of views (slices/projections) and to still maintain good resolution, we
use IBM T221 display (3840 X 2400 pixels).

 <dc:description>  The academic literature suggests that the extent of exporting by
multinational corporation subsidiaries (MCS) depends on their product
manufactured, resources, tax protection, customers and markets, involvement
strategy, financial independence and suppliers' relationship with a
multinational corporation (MNC). The aim of this paper is to model the complex
export pattern behaviour using a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system in order
to determine the actual volume of MCS export output (sales exported). The
proposed fuzzy inference system is optimised by using neural network learning
and evolutionary computation. Empirical results clearly show that the proposed
approach could model the export behaviour reasonable well compared to a direct
neural network approach.

 <dc:description>  The costs of fatalities and injuries due to traffic accident have a great
impact on society. This paper presents our research to model the severity of
injury resulting from traffic accidents using artificial neural networks and
decision trees. We have applied them to an actual data set obtained from the
National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) General Estimates System (GES).
Experiment results reveal that in all the cases the decision tree outperforms
the neural network. Our research analysis also shows that the three most
important factors in fatal injury are: driver's seat belt usage, light
condition of the roadway, and driver's alcohol usage.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a comparative study of six soft computing models namely
multilayer perceptron networks, Elman recurrent neural network, radial basis
function network, Hopfield model, fuzzy inference system and hybrid fuzzy
neural network for the hourly electricity demand forecast of Czech Republic.
The soft computing models were trained and tested using the actual hourly load
data for seven years. A comparison of the proposed techniques is presented for
predicting 2 day ahead demands for electricity. Simulation results indicate
that hybrid fuzzy neural network and radial basis function networks are the
best candidates for the analysis and forecasting of electricity demand.

 <dc:description>  Decision-making is a process of choosing among alternative courses of action
for solving complicated problems where multi-criteria objectives are involved.
The past few years have witnessed a growing recognition of Soft Computing (SC)
technologies that underlie the conception, design and utilization of
intelligent systems. In this paper, we present different SC paradigms involving
an artificial neural network trained using the scaled conjugate gradient
algorithm, two different fuzzy inference methods optimised using neural network
learning/evolutionary algorithms and regression trees for developing
intelligent decision support systems. We demonstrate the efficiency of the
different algorithms by developing a decision support system for a Tactical Air
Combat Environment (TACE). Some empirical comparisons between the different
algorithms are also provided.

 <dc:description>  A new parallel algorithm for simulating Ising spin systems is presented. The
sequential prototype is the n-fold way algorithm cite{BKL75}, which is
efficient but is hard to parallelize using conservative methods. Our parallel
algorithm is optimistic. Unlike other optimistic algorithms, e.g., Time Warp,
our algorithm is synchronous. It also belongs to the class of simulations known
as ``relaxation'' cite{CS8 hence it is named ``synchronous relaxation.'' We
derive performance guarantees for this algorithm. If N is the number of PEs,
then under weak assumptions we show that the number of correct events processed
per unit of time is, on average, at least of order N/log(N). All communication
delays, processing time, and busy waits are taken into account.

a CAD system is described, intended for automatic specifications making of
elements of the drawings, with usage of the electronic catalogs. The model is
created for needs of a CAD system of reconstruction of the industrial plants,
where the result of designing are the drawings, which include the
specifications of different types. The adequate simulation of the specification
tables is ensured with technology of storing in the drawing of the visible
geometric elements and invisible parametric representation, sufficient for

 <dc:description>  We consider a crucial aspect of self-organization of a sensor network
consisting of a large set of simple sensor nodes with no location hardware and
only very limited communication range. After having been distributed randomly
in a given two-dimensional region, the nodes are required to develop a sense
for the environment, based on a limited amount of local communication. We
describe algorithmic approaches for determining the structure of boundary nodes
of the region, and the topology of the region. We also develop methods for
determining the outside boundary, the distance to the closest boundary for each
point, the Voronoi diagram of the different boundaries, and the geometric
thickness of the network. Our methods rely on a number of natural assumptions
that are present in densely distributed sets of nodes, and make use of a
combination of stochastics, topology, and geometry. Evaluation requires only a
limited number of simple local computations.

 <dc:description>  A Meyniel graph is a graph in which every odd cycle of length at least five
has two chords. In the manuscript &quot;Coloring Meyniel graphs in linear time&quot; we
claimed that our algorithm MCColor produces an optimal coloring for every
Meyniel graph. But later we found a mistake in the proof and a couterexample to
the optimality, which we present here. MCColor can still be used to find a
stable set that intersects all maximal cliques of a Meyniel graph in linear
time. Consequently it can be used to find an optimal coloring in time O(nm),
and the same holds for Algorithm MCS+Color. This is explained in the manuscript
&quot;A linear algorithm to find a strong stable set in a Meyniel graph&quot; but this is
equivalent to Hertz's algorithm. The current best algorithm for coloring
Meyniel graphs is the O(n^2) algorithm LexColor due to Roussel and Rusu. The
question of finding a linear-time algorithm to color Meyniel graphs is still
open.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel encryption-less algorithm to enhance
security in transmission of data in networks. The algorithm uses an intuitively
simple idea of a 'jigsaw puzzle' to break the transformed data into multiple
parts where these parts form the pieces of the puzzle. Then these parts are
packaged into packets and sent to the receiver. A secure and efficient
mechanism is provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining
the original data at the receiver-end from its parts in the packets, that is,
for solving the 'jigsaw puzzle'. The algorithm is designed to provide
information-theoretic (that is, unconditional) security by the use of a
one-time pad like scheme so that no intermediate or unintended node can obtain
the entire data. An authentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of
every packet.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two different efficiency-enhancement techniques for
probabilistic model building genetic algorithms. The first technique proposes
the use of a mutation operator which performs local search in the sub-solution
neighborhood identified through the probabilistic model. The second technique
proposes building and using an internal probabilistic model of the fitness
along with the probabilistic model of variable interactions. The fitness values
of some offspring are estimated using the probabilistic model, thereby avoiding
computationally expensive function evaluations. The scalability of the
aforementioned techniques are analyzed using facetwise models for convergence
time and population sizing. The speed-up obtained by each of the methods is
predicted and verified with empirical results. The results show that for
additively separable problems the competent mutation operator requires O(k 0.5
logm)--where k is the building-block size, and m is the number of building
blocks--less function evaluations than its selectorecombinative counterpart.
The results also show that the use of an internal probabilistic fitness model
reduces the required number of function evaluations to as low as 1-10% and
yields a speed-up of 2--50.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the relative advantages between crossover and mutation on
a class of deterministic and stochastic additively separable problems. This
study assumes that the recombination and mutation operators have the knowledge
of the building blocks (BBs) and effectively exchange or search among competing
BBs. Facetwise models of convergence time and population sizing have been used
to determine the scalability of each algorithm. The analysis shows that for
additively separable deterministic problems, the BB-wise mutation is more
efficient than crossover, while the crossover outperforms the mutation on
additively separable problems perturbed with additive Gaussian noise. The
results show that the speed-up of using BB-wise mutation on deterministic
problems is O(k^{0.5}logm), where k is the BB size, and m is the number of BBs.
Likewise, the speed-up of using crossover on stochastic problems with fixed
noise variance is O(mk^{0.5}log m).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a competent selectomutative genetic algorithm (GA), that
adapts linkage and solves hard problems quickly, reliably, and accurately. A
probabilistic model building process is used to automatically identify key
building blocks (BBs) of the search problem. The mutation operator uses the
probabilistic model of linkage groups to find the best among competing building
blocks. The competent selectomutative GA successfully solves additively
separable problems of bounded difficulty, requiring only subquadratic number of
function evaluations. The results show that for additively separable problems
the probabilistic model building BB-wise mutation scales as O(2^km^{1.5}), and
requires O(k^{0.5}logm) less function evaluations than its selectorecombinative
counterpart, confirming theoretical results reported elsewhere (Sastry &amp;
Goldberg, 2004).

 <dc:description>  This paper studies fitness inheritance as an efficiency enhancement technique
for a class of competent genetic algorithms called estimation distribution
algorithms. Probabilistic models of important sub-solutions are developed to
estimate the fitness of a proportion of individuals in the population, thereby
avoiding computationally expensive function evaluations. The effect of fitness
inheritance on the convergence time and population sizing are modeled and the
speed-up obtained through inheritance is predicted. The results show that a
fitness-inheritance mechanism which utilizes information on building-block
fitnesses provides significant efficiency enhancement. For additively separable
problems, fitness inheritance reduces the number of function evaluations to
about half and yields a speed-up of about 1.75--2.25.

 <dc:description>  We present a logic for reasoning about licenses, which are ``terms of use''
for digital resources. The logic provides a language for writing both
properties of licenses and specifications that govern a client's actions. We
discuss the complexity of checking properties and specifications written in our
logic and propose a technique for verification. A key feature of our approach
is that it is essentially parameterized by the language in which the licenses
are written, provided that this language can be given a trace-based semantics.
We consider two license languages to illustrate this flexibility.

 <dc:description>  Fuzzy discrete event systems as a generalization of (crisp) discrete event
systems have been introduced in order that it is possible to effectively
represent uncertainty, imprecision, and vagueness arising from the dynamic of
systems. A fuzzy discrete event system has been modelled by a fuzzy automaton;
its behavior is described in terms of the fuzzy language generated by the
automaton. In this paper, we are concerned with the supervisory control problem
for fuzzy discrete event systems with partial observation. Observability,
normality, and co-observability of crisp languages are extended to fuzzy
languages. It is shown that the observability, together with controllability,
of the desired fuzzy language is a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of a partially observable fuzzy supervisor. When a decentralized
solution is desired, it is proved that there exist local fuzzy supervisors if
and only if the fuzzy language to be synthesized is controllable and
co-observable. Moreover, the infimal controllable and observable fuzzy
superlanguage, and the supremal controllable and normal fuzzy sublanguage are
also discussed. Simple examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical
development.

 <dc:description>  Mining frequent itemsets is at the core of mining association rules, and is
by now quite well understood algorithmically. However, most algorithms for
mining frequent itemsets assume that the main memory is large enough for the
data structures used in the mining, and very few efficient algorithms deal with
the case when the database is very large or the minimum support is very low.
Mining frequent itemsets from a very large database poses new challenges, as
astronomical amounts of raw data is ubiquitously being recorded in commerce,
science and government. In this paper, we discuss approaches to mining frequent
itemsets when data structures are too large to fit in main memory. Several
divide-and-conquer algorithms are given for mining from disks. Many novel
techniques are introduced. Experimental results show that the techniques reduce
the required disk accesses by orders of magnitude, and enable truly scalable
data mining.

traffic-driven dynamics and generates weighted directed graphs exhibiting the
statistical properties observed in the Web. In particular, the model yields a
non-trivial time evolution of vertices and heavy-tail distributions for the
topological and traffic properties. The generated graphs exhibit a complex
architecture with a hierarchy of cohesiveness levels similar to those observed
in the analysis of real data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a state-based regression function for planning
domains where an agent does not have complete information and may have sensing
actions. We consider binary domains and employ the 0-approximation [Son &amp; Baral
2001] to define the regression function. In binary domains, the use of
0-approximation means using 3-valued states. Although planning using this
approach is incomplete with respect to the full semantics, we adopt it to have
a lower complexity. We prove the soundness and completeness of our regression
formulation with respect to the definition of progression. More specifically,
we show that (i) a plan obtained through regression for a planning problem is
indeed a progression solution of that planning problem, and that (ii) for each
plan found through progression, using regression one obtains that plan or an
equivalent one. We then develop a conditional planner that utilizes our
regression function. We prove the soundness and completeness of our planning
algorithm and present experimental results with respect to several well known
planning problems in the literature.

 <dc:description>  The MammoGrid project aims to prove that Grid infrastructures can be used for
collaborative clinical analysis of database-resident but geographically
distributed medical images. This requires: a) the provision of a
clinician-facing front-end workstation and b) the ability to service real-world
clinician queries across a distributed and federated database. The MammoGrid
project will prove the viability of the Grid by harnessing its power to enable
radiologists from geographically dispersed hospitals to share standardized
mammograms, to compare diagnoses (with and without computer aided detection of
tumours) and to perform sophisticated epidemiological studies across national
boundaries. This paper outlines the approach taken in MammoGrid to seamlessly
connect radiologist workstations across a Grid using an &quot;information
infrastructure&quot; and a DICOM-compliant object model residing in multiple
distributed data stores in Italy and the UK

 <dc:description>  The MammoGrid project has recently delivered its first proof-of-concept
prototype using a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)-based Grid application to
enable distributed computing spanning national borders. The underlying AliEn
Grid infrastructure has been selected because of its practicality and because
of its emergence as a potential open source standards-based solution for
managing and coordinating distributed resources. The resultant prototype is
expected to harness the use of huge amounts of medical image data to perform
epidemiological studies, advanced image processing, radiographic education and
ultimately, tele-diagnosis over communities of medical virtual organisations.
The MammoGrid prototype comprises a high-quality clinician visualization
workstation used for data acquisition and inspection, a DICOM-compliant
interface to a set of medical services (annotation, security, image analysis,
data storage and querying services) residing on a so-called Grid-box and secure
access to a network of other Grid-boxes connected through Grid middleware. This
paper outlines the MammoGrid approach in managing a federation of
Grid-connected mammography databases in the context of the recently delivered
prototype and will also describe the next phase of prototyping.

 <dc:title>Reduction Strategies in Lambda Term Normalization and their Effects on
  Heap Usage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Qi, Xiaochu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Higher-order representations of objects such as programs, proofs, formulas
and types have become important to many symbolic computation tasks. Systems
that support such representations usually depend on the implementation of an
intensional view of the terms of some variant of the typed lambda-calculus.
Various notations have been proposed for lambda-terms to explicitly treat
substitutions as basis for realizing such implementations. There are, however,
several choices in the actual reduction strategies. The most common strategy
utilizes such notations only implicitly via an incremental use of environments.
This approach does not allow the smaller substitution steps to be intermingled
with other operations of interest on lambda-terms. However, a naive strategy
explicitly using such notations can also be costly: each use of the
substitution propagation rules causes the creation of a new structure on the
heap that is often discarded in the immediately following step. There is thus a
tradeoff between these two approaches. This thesis describes the actual
realization of the two approaches, discusses their tradeoffs based on this and,
finally, offers an amalgamated approach that utilizes recursion in rewrite rule
application but also suspends substitution operations where necessary.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces an abductive framework for updating knowledge bases
represented by extended disjunctive programs. We first provide a simple
transformation from abductive programs to update programs which are logic
programs specifying changes on abductive hypotheses. Then, extended abduction,
which was introduced by the same authors as a generalization of traditional
abduction, is computed by the answer sets of update programs. Next, different
types of updates, view updates and theory updates are characterized by
abductive programs and computed by update programs. The task of consistency
restoration is also realized as special cases of these updates. Each update
problem is comparatively assessed from the computational complexity viewpoint.
The result of this paper provides a uniform framework for different types of
knowledge base updates, and each update is computed using existing procedures
of logic programming.

 <dc:description>  A computer simulation has to be fast to be helpful, if it is employed to
study the behavior of a multicomponent dynamic system. This paper discusses
modeling concepts and algorithmic techniques useful for creating such fast
simulations. Concrete examples of simulations that range from econometric
modeling to communications to material science are used to illustrate these
techniques and concepts. The algorithmic and modeling methods discussed include
event-driven processing, ``anticipating'' data structures, and ``lazy''
evaluation, Poisson dispenser, parallel processing by cautious advancements and
by synchronous relaxations. The paper gives examples of how these techniques
and models are employed in assessing efficiency of capacity management methods
in wireless and wired networks, in studies of magnetization, crystalline
structure, and sediment formation in material science, in studies of
competition in economics.

 <dc:description>  Generative Programming (GP) is a computing paradigm allowing automatic
creation of entire software families utilizing the configuration of elementary
and reusable components. GP can be projected on different technologies, e.g.
C++-templates, Java-Beans, Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), or Frame
technology. This paper focuses on Frame Technology, which aids the possible
implementation and completion of software components. The purpose of this paper
is to introduce the GP paradigm in the area of GUI application generation. It
demonstrates how automatically customized executable applications with GUI
parts can be generated from an abstract specification.

 <dc:description>  We present a concurrent framework for Win32 programming based on Concurrent
ML, a concurrent language with higher-order functions, static typing,
lightweight threads and synchronous communication channels. The key points of
the framework are the move from an event loop model to a threaded model for the
processing of window messages, and the decoupling of controls notifications
from the system messages. This last point allows us to derive a general way of
writing controls that leads to easy composition, and can accommodate ActiveX
Controls in a transparent way.

 <dc:description>  Reactive systems are systems that maintain an ongoing interaction with their
environment, activated by receiving input events from the environment and
producing output events in response. Modern programming languages designed to
program such systems use a paradigm based on the notions of instants and
activations. We describe a library for Standard ML that provides basic
primitives for programming reactive systems. The library is a low-level system
upon which more sophisticated reactive behaviors can be built, which provides a
convenient framework for prototyping extensions to existing reactive languages.

 <dc:description>  We present in this paper the preliminary design of a module system based on a
notion of components such as they are found in COM. This module system is
inspired from that of Standard ML, and features first-class instances of
components, first-class interfaces, and interface-polymorphic functions, as
well as allowing components to be both imported from the environment and
exported to the environment using simple mechanisms. The module system
automates the memory management of interfaces and hides the IUnknown interface
and QueryInterface mechanisms from the programmer, favoring instead a
higher-level approach to handling interfaces.

 <dc:description>  Practical implementations of high-level languages must provide access to
libraries and system services that have APIs specified in a low-level language
(usually C). An important characteristic of such mechanisms is the
foreign-interface policy that defines how to bridge the semantic gap between
the high-level language and C. For example, IDL-based tools generate code to
marshal data into and out of the high-level representation according to user
annotations. The design space of foreign-interface policies is large and there
are pros and cons to each approach. Rather than commit to a particular policy,
we choose to focus on the problem of supporting a gamut of interoperability
policies. In this paper, we describe a framework for language interoperability
that is expressive enough to support very efficient implementations of a wide
range of different foreign-interface policies. We describe two tools that
implement substantially different policies on top of our framework and present
benchmarks that demonstrate their efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Recent results of Bucciarelli show that the semilattice of degrees of
parallelism of first-order boolean functions in PCF has both infinite chains
and infinite antichains. By considering a simple subclass of Sieber's
sequentiality relations, we identify levels in the semilattice and derive
inexpressibility results concerning functions on different levels. This allows
us to further explore the structure of the semilattice of degrees of
parallelism: we identify semilattices characterized by simple level properties,
and show the existence of new infinite hierarchies which are in a certain sense
natural with respect to the levels.

 <dc:description>  We develop a new Lagrangian material particle -- dynamical domain
decomposition method (MPD^3) for large scale parallel molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation of nonstationary heterogeneous systems on a heterogeneous computing
net. MPD^3 is based on Voronoi decomposition of simulated matter. The map of
Voronoi polygons is known as the Dirichlet tessellation and used for grid
generation in computational fluid dynamics. From the hydrodynamics point of
view the moving Voronoi polygon looks as a material particle (MP). MPs can
exchange particles and information. To balance heterogeneous computing
conditions the MP centers should be dependent on timing data. We propose a
simple and efficient iterative algorithm which based on definition of the
timing-dependent balancing displacement of MP center for next simulation step.
  The MPD^3 program was tested in various computing environments and physical
problems. We have demonstrated that MPD^3 is a high-adaptive decomposition
algorithm for MD simulation. It was shown that the well-balanced decomposition
can result from dynamical Voronoi polygon tessellation. One would expect the
similar approach can be successfully applied for other particle methods like
Monte Carlo, particle-in-cell, and smooth-particle-hydrodynamics.

 <dc:description>  The storage and manipulation of digital images and the analysis of the
information held in those images are essential requirements for next-generation
medical information systems. The medical community has been exploring
collaborative approaches for managing image data and exchanging knowledge and
Grid technology [1] is a promising approach to enabling distributed analysis
across medical institutions and for developing new collaborative and
cooperative approaches for image analysis without the necessity for clinicians
to co-locate. The EU-funded MammoGrid project [2] is one example of this and it
aims to develop a Europe-wide database of mammograms to support effective
co-working between healthcare professionals across the EU. The MammoGrid
prototype comprises a high-quality clinician visualization workstation (for
data acquisition and inspection), a DICOM-compliant interface to a set of
medical services (annotation, security, image analysis, data storage and
querying services) residing on a so-called Grid-box and secure access to a
network of other Grid-boxes connected through Grid middleware. One of the main
deliverables of the project is a Grid-enabled infrastructure that manages
federated mammogram databases across Europe. This paper outlines the MammoGrid
Information Infrastructure (MII) for meta-data analysis and knowledge discovery
in the medical imaging domain.

 <dc:description>  We describe a scheme for moving living code between a set of distributed
processes coordinated with unification based Linda operations, and its
application to building a comprehensive Logic programming based Internet
programming framework. Mobile threads are implemented by capturing first order
continuations in a compact data structure sent over the network. Code is
fetched lazily from its original base turned into a server as the continuation
executes at the remote site. Our code migration techniques, in combination with
a dynamic recompilation scheme, ensure that heavily used code moves up smoothly
on a speed hierarchy while volatile dynamic code is kept in a quickly updatable
form. Among the examples, we describe how to build programmable client and
server components (Web servers, in particular) and mobile agents.

 <dc:description>  Defeasible logic is a rule-based nonmonotonic logic, with both strict and
defeasible rules, and a priority relation on rules. We show that inference in
the propositional form of the logic can be performed in linear time. This
contrasts markedly with most other propositional nonmonotonic logics, in which
inference is intractable.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a programming language which includes paradigms that are
usually associated with declarative languages, such as sets, rules and search,
into an imperative (functional) language. Although these paradigms are
separately well known and are available under various programming environments,
the originality of the CLAIRE language comes from the tight integration, which
yields interesting run-time performances, and from the richness of this
combination, which yields new ways in which to express complex algorithmic
patterns with few elegant lines. To achieve the opposite goals of a high
abstraction level (conciseness and readability) and run-time performance
(CLAIRE is used as a C++ preprocessor), we have developed two kinds of
compiler: first, a pattern pre-processor handles iterations over both concrete
and abstract sets (data types and program fragments), in a completely
user-extensible manner; secondly, an inference compiler transforms a set of
logical rules into a set of functions (demons that are used through procedural
attachment).

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a generic technique for improving hybrid algorithms
through the discovery of and tuning of meta-heuristics. The idea is to
represent a family of push/pull heuristics that are based upon inserting and
removing tasks in a current solution, with an algebra. We then let a learning
algorithm search for the best possible algebraic term, which represents a
hybrid algorithm for a given set of problems and an optimization criterion. In
a previous paper, we described this algebra in detail and provided a set of
preliminary results demonstrating the utility of this approach, using vehicle
routing with time windows (VRPTW) as a domain example. In this paper we expand
upon our results providing a more robust experimental framework and learning
algorithms, and report on some new results using the standard Solomon
benchmarks. In particular, we show that our learning algorithm is able to
achieve results similar to the best-published algorithms using only a fraction
of the CPU time. We also show that the automatic tuning of the best hybrid
combination of such techniques yields a better solution than hand tuning, with
considerably less effort.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Maximum Matroid-Greedoid Intersection and Weighted

 <dc:description>  The maximum intersection problem for a matroid and a greedoid, given by
polynomial-time oracles, is shown $NP$-hard by expressing the satisfiability of
boolean formulas in 3-conjunctive normal form as such an intersection. The
corresponding approximation problems are shown $NP$-hard for certain
approximation performance bounds. Moreover, some natural parameterized variants
of the problem are shown $W[P]$-hard. The results are in contrast with the
maximum matroid-matroid intersection which is solvable in polynomial time by an
old result of Edmonds. We also prove that it is $NP$-hard to approximate the
weighted greedoid maximization within $2^{n^{O(1)}}$ where $n$ is the size of
the domain of the greedoid.

Intersection'' appeared in Proc. FCT 2001, LNCS 2138, pp. 535--539,

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a blind detection and compensation technique for camera
lens geometric distortions. The lens distortion introduces higher-order
correlations in the frequency domain and in turn it can be detected using
higher-order spectral analysis tools without assuming any specific calibration
target. The existing blind lens distortion removal method only considered a
single-coefficient radial distortion model. In this paper, two coefficients are
considered to model approximately the geometric distortion. All the models
considered have analytical closed-form inverse formulae.

 <dc:description>  Kleene algebra with tests is an extension of Kleene algebra, the algebra of
regular expressions, which can be used to reason about programs. We develop a
coalgebraic theory of Kleene algebra with tests, along the lines of the
coalgebraic theory of regular expressions based on deterministic automata.
Since the known automata-theoretic presentation of Kleene algebra with tests
does not lend itself to a coalgebraic theory, we define a new interpretation of
Kleene algebra with tests expressions and a corresponding automata-theoretic
presentation. One outcome of the theory is a coinductive proof principle, that
can be used to establish equivalence of our Kleene algebra with tests
expressions.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a logic for reasoning about evidence that essentially views
evidence as a function from prior beliefs (before making an observation) to
posterior beliefs (after making the observation). We provide a sound and
complete axiomatization for the logic, and consider the complexity of the
decision problem. Although the reasoning in the logic is mainly propositional,
we allow variables representing numbers and quantification over them. This
expressive power seems necessary to capture important properties of evidence.

 <dc:description>  Now no web search engine can cover more than 60 percent of all the pages on
Internet. The update interval of most pages database is almost one month. This
condition hasn't changed for many years. Converge and recency problems have
become the bottleneck problem of current web search engine. To solve these
problems, a new system, search engine based on DNS is proposed in this paper.
This system adopts the hierarchical distributed architecture like DNS, which is
different from any current commercial search engine. In theory, this system can
cover all the web pages on Internet. Its update interval could even be one day.
The original idea, detailed content and implementation of this system all are

 <dc:description>  We present a prescriptive type system with parametric polymorphism and
subtyping for constraint logic programs. The aim of this type system is to
detect programming errors statically. It introduces a type discipline for
constraint logic programs and modules, while maintaining the capabilities of
performing the usual coercions between constraint domains, and of typing
meta-programming predicates, thanks to the flexibility of subtyping. The
property of subject reduction expresses the consistency of a prescriptive type
system w.r.t. the execution model: if a program is &quot;well-typed&quot;, then all
derivations starting from a &quot;well-typed&quot; goal are again &quot;well-typed&quot;. That
property is proved w.r.t. the abstract execution model of constraint
programming which proceeds by accumulation of constraints only, and w.r.t. an
enriched execution model with type constraints for substitutions. We describe
our implementation of the system for type checking and type inference. We
report our experimental results on type checking ISO-Prolog, the (constraint)
libraries of Sicstus Prolog and other Prolog programs.

 <dc:description>  This note illustrates theoretical worst-case scenarios for groundness
analyses obtained through abstract interpretation over the abstract domains of
definite (Def) and positive (Pos) Boolean functions. For Def, an example is
given for which any Def-based abstract interpretation for groundness analysis
follows a chain which is exponential in the number of argument positions as
well as in the number of clauses but sub-exponential in the size of the
program. For Pos, we strengthen a previous result by illustrating an example
for which any Pos-based abstract interpretation for groundness analysis follows
a chain which is exponential in the size of the program. It remains an open
problem to determine if the worst case for Def is really as bad as that for
Pos.

 <dc:description>  How to extract negative information from programs is an important issue in
logic programming. Here we address the problem for functional logic programs,
from a proof-theoretic perspective. The starting point of our work is CRWL
(Constructor based ReWriting Logic), a well established theoretical framework
for functional logic programming, whose fundamental notion is that of
non-strict non-deterministic function. We present a proof calculus, CRWLF,
which is able to deduce negative information from CRWL-programs. In particular,
CRWLF is able to prove finite failure of reduction within CRWL.

 <dc:description>  A system is data-independent with respect to a data type X iff the operations
it can perform on values of type X are restricted to just equality testing. The
system may also store, input and output values of type X. We study model
checking of systems which are data-independent with respect to two distinct
type variables X and Y, and may in addition use arrays with indices from X and
values from Y . Our main interest is the following parameterised model-checking
problem: whether a given program satisfies a given temporal-logic formula for
all non-empty nite instances of X and Y . Initially, we consider instead the
abstraction where X and Y are infinite and where partial functions with finite
domains are used to model arrays. Using a translation to data-independent
systems without arrays, we show that the u-calculus model-checking problem is
decidable for these systems. From this result, we can deduce properties of all
systems with finite instances of X and Y . We show that there is a procedure
for the above parameterised model-checking problem of the universal fragment of
the u-calculus, such that it always terminates but may give false negatives. We
also deduce that the parameterised model-checking problem of the universal
disjunction-free fragment of the u-calculus is decidable. Practical motivations
for model checking data-independent systems with arrays include verification of
memory and cache systems, where X is the type of memory addresses, and Y the
type of storable values. As an example we verify a fault-tolerant memory
interface over a set of unreliable memories.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge reduction, includes attribute reduction and value reduction, is an
important topic in rough set literature. It is also closely relevant to other
fields, such as machine learning and data mining. In this paper, an algorithm
called TWI-SQUEEZE is proposed. It can find a reduct, or an irreducible
attribute subset after two scans. Its soundness and computational complexity
are given, which show that it is the fastest algorithm at present. A measure of
variety is brought forward, of which algorithm TWI-SQUEEZE can be regarded as
an application. The author also argues the rightness of this measure as a
measure of information, which can make it a unified measure for
&quot;differentiation, a concept appeared in cognitive psychology literature. Value
reduction is another important aspect of knowledge reduction. It is interesting
that using the same algorithm we can execute a complete value reduction
efficiently. The complete knowledge reduction, which results in an irreducible
table, can therefore be accomplished after four scans of table. The byproducts
of reduction are two classifiers of different styles. In this paper, various
cases and models will be discussed to prove the efficiency and effectiveness of
the algorithm. Some topics, such as how to integrate user preference to find a
local optimal attribute subset will also be discussed.

 <dc:description>  The proposed election system lies in ensuring that it is transparent and
impartial.Thus while the electoral system may vary from country to country, It
has to take into account the peculiarities of every society while at the same
time incorporating remedies to problems prevailing in the system.
  The Electoral process expressed serious concerns regarding the independence
of the Election Commission of Pakistan, the restrictions on political parties
and their candidates, the misuse of state resources, some unbalanced coverage
in the state media, deficiencies in the compilation of the voting register and
significant problems relating to the provision of ID cards.
  The holding of a general election does not in itself guarantee the
restoration of democracy. The unjustified interference with electoral
arrangements, as detailed above, irrespective of the alleged motivation,
resulted in serious flaws being inflicted on the electoral process.
Additionally, questions remain as to whether or not there will be a full
transfer of power from a military to civilian administration.
  The Independent study research has following modules:
  Login/Subscription Module Candidate Subscription Module Vote casting Module
Administration Module Intelligent decision data analysis Module

 <dc:description>  Defeasible argumentation has experienced a considerable growth in AI in the
last decade. Theoretical results have been combined with development of
practical applications in AI &amp; Law, Case-Based Reasoning and various
knowledge-based systems. However, the dialectical process associated with
inference is computationally expensive. This paper focuses on speeding up this
inference process by pruning the involved search space. Our approach is
twofold. On one hand, we identify distinguished literals for computing defeat.
On the other hand, we restrict ourselves to a subset of all possible
conflicting arguments by introducing dialectical constraints.

 <dc:description>  In the last years, there has been an increasing demand of a variety of
logical systems, prompted mostly by applications of logic in AI and other
related areas. Labeled Deductive Systems (LDS) were developed as a flexible
methodology to formalize such a kind of complex logical systems. Defeasible
argumentation has proven to be a successful approach to formalizing commonsense
reasoning, encompassing many other alternative formalisms for defeasible
reasoning. Argument-based frameworks share some common notions (such as the
concept of argument, defeater, etc.) along with a number of particular features
which make it difficult to compare them with each other from a logical
viewpoint. This paper introduces LDSar, a LDS for defeasible argumentation in
which many important issues concerning defeasible argumentation are captured
within a unified logical framework. We also discuss some logical properties and
extensions that emerge from the proposed framework.

 <dc:description>  In current presence or availability systems, the method of presenting a
user's state often supposes an instantaneous notion of that state - for
example, a visualization is rendered or an inference is made about the
potential actions that might be consistent with a user's state. Drawing on
observational research on the use of existing communication technology, we
argue (as have others in the past) that determination of availability is often
a joint process, and often one that takes the form of a negotiation (whether
implicit or explicit). We briefly describe our current research on applying
machine learning to infer degrees of conversational engagement from observed
conversational behavior. Such inferences can be applied to facilitate the
implicit negotiation of conversational engagement - in effect, helping users to
weave together the act of contact with the act of determining availability.

 <dc:description>  Consider the commonly known puzzle, given $k$ glass balls, find an optimal
algorithm to determine the lowest floor of a building of $n$ floors from which
a thrown glass ball will break. This puzzle was originally posed in its
original form in \cite{focs1980}and was later cited in the book \cite{algthc}.
There are several internet sites that presents this puzzle and its solution to
the special case of $k=2$ balls. This is the first such analysis of the puzzle
in its general form. Several variations of this puzzle have been studied with
applications in Network Loading \cite{cgstctl} which analyzes a case similar to
a scenario where an adversary is changing the lowest floor with time. Although
the algorithm specified in \cite{algthc} solves the problem, it is not an
efficient algorithm. In this paper another algorithm for the same problem is
analyzed. It is shown that if $m$ is the minimum number of attempts required
then for $k \geq m$ we have $m = \log (n+1)$ and for $k &lt; m$ we have, $1 +
\sum_{i=1}^{k}{{m-1}\choose{i}} &lt; n \leq \sum_{i=1}^{k}{{m}\choose{i}}$

which malign peers conspire to waste loyal peers' resources. We describe
several defenses for LOCKSS, a peer-to-peer digital preservation system, that
help ensure that application-level attacks even from powerful adversaries are
less effective than simple network-level attacks, and that network-level
attacks must be intense, wide-spread, and prolonged to impair the system.

 <dc:description>  Turbo coding is a powerful class of forward error correcting codes, which can
achieve performances close to the Shannon limit. The turbo principle can be
applied to the problem of side-information source coding, and we investigate
here its application to the reconciliation problem occurring in a
continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocol.

 <dc:description>  This report defines various operations for weighted multi-tape automata
(WMTAs) and describes algorithms that have been implemented for those
operations in the WFSC toolkit. Some algorithms are new, others are known or
similar to known algorithms. The latter will be recalled to make this report
more complete and self-standing. We present a new approach to multi-tape
intersection, meaning the intersection of a number of tapes of one WMTA with
the same number of tapes of another WMTA. In our approach, multi-tape
intersection is not considered as an atomic operation but rather as a sequence
of more elementary ones, which facilitates its implementation. We show an
example of multi-tape intersection, actually transducer intersection, that can
be compiled with our approach but not with several other methods that we
analysed. To show the practical relavance of our work, we include an example of
application: the preservation of intermediate results in transduction cascades.

 <dc:description>  The financial services industry is rapidly changing. Factors such as
globalization, deregulation, mergers and acquisitions, competition from
non-financial institutions, and technological innovation, have forced companies
to re-think their business.Many large companies have been using Business
Intelligence (BI) computer software for some years to help them gain
competitive advantage. With the introduction of cheaper and more generalized
products to the market place BI is now in the reach of smaller and medium sized
companies. Business Intelligence is also known as knowledge management,
management information systems (MIS), Executive information systems (EIS) and
On-line analytical Processing (OLAP).

 <dc:description>  A significant fraction of software failures in large-scale Internet systems
are cured by rebooting, even when the exact failure causes are unknown.
However, rebooting can be expensive, causing nontrivial service disruption or
downtime even when clusters and failover are employed. In this work we separate
process recovery from data recovery to enable microrebooting -- a fine-grain
technique for surgically recovering faulty application components, without
disturbing the rest of the application.
  We evaluate microrebooting in an Internet auction system running on an
application server. Microreboots recover most of the same failures as full
reboots, but do so an order of magnitude faster and result in an order of
magnitude savings in lost work. This cheap form of recovery engenders a new
approach to high availability: microreboots can be employed at the slightest
hint of failure, prior to node failover in multi-node clusters, even when
mistakes in failure detection are likely; failure and recovery can be masked
from end users through transparent call-level retries; and systems can be
rejuvenated by parts, without ever being shut down.

 <dc:title>Dichotomy Theorems for Alternation-Bounded Quantified Boolean Formulas</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hemaspaandra, Edith</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 1978, Schaefer proved his famous dichotomy theorem for generalized
satisfiability problems. He defined an infinite number of propositional
satisfiability problems, showed that all these problems are either in P or
NP-complete, and gave a simple criterion to determine which of the two cases
holds. This result is surprising in light of Ladner's theorem, which implies
that there are an infinite number of complexity classes between P and
NP-complete (under the assumption that P is not equal to NP).
  Schaefer also stated a dichotomy theorem for quantified generalized Boolean
formulas, but this theorem was only recently proven by Creignou, Khanna, and
Sudan, and independently by Dalmau: Determining truth of quantified Boolean
formulas is either PSPACE-complete or in P.
  This paper looks at alternation-bounded quantified generalized Boolean
formulas. In their unrestricted forms, these problems are the canonical
problems complete for the levels of the polynomial hierarchy. In this paper, we
prove dichotomy theorems for alternation-bounded quantified generalized Boolean
formulas, by showing that these problems are either $\Sigma_i^p$-complete or in
P, and we give a simple criterion to determine which of the two cases holds.
This is the first result that obtains dichotomy for an infinite number of
classes at once.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of Distribution Algorithms have been proposed as a new paradigm
for evolutionary optimization. This paper focuses on the parallelization of
Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. More specifically, the paper discusses
how to predict performance of parallel Mixed Bayesian Optimization Algorithm
(MBOA) that is based on parallel construction of Bayesian networks with
decision trees. We determine the time complexity of parallel Mixed Bayesian
Optimization Algorithm and compare this complexity with experimental results
obtained by solving the spin glass optimization problem. The empirical results
fit well the theoretical time complexity, so the scalability and efficiency of
parallel Mixed Bayesian Optimization Algorithm for unknown instances of spin
glass benchmarks can be predicted. Furthermore, we derive the guidelines that
can be used to design effective parallel Estimation of Distribution Algorithms
with the speedup proportional to the number of variables in the problem.

 <dc:title>Image compression by rectangular wavelet transform</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zavadsky, Vyacheslav</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study image compression by a separable wavelet basis
$\big\{\psi(2^{k_1}x-i)\psi(2^{k_2}y-j),$ $\phi(x-i)\psi(2^{k_2}y-j),$
$\psi(2^{k_1}(x-i)\phi(y-j),$ $\phi(x-i)\phi(y-i)\big\},$ where $k_1, k_2 \in
\mathbb{Z}_+$; $i,j\in\mathbb{Z}$; and $\phi,\psi$ are elements of a standard
biorthogonal wavelet basis in $L_2(\mathbb{R})$. Because $k_1\ne k_2$, the
supports of the basis elements are rectangles, and the corresponding transform
is known as the {\em rectangular wavelet transform}. We prove that if
one-dimensional wavelet basis has $M$ dual vanishing moments then the rate of
approximation by $N$ coefficients of rectangular wavelet transform is
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-M}\log^C N)$ for functions with mixed derivative of order $M$
in each direction.
  The square wavelet transform yields the approximation rate is
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-M/2})$ for functions with all derivatives of the total order
$M$. Thus, the rectangular wavelet transform can outperform the square one if
an image has a mixed derivative. We provide experimental comparison of image
compression which shows that rectangular wavelet transform outperform the
square one.

 <dc:description>  The Game of Life cellular automaton is a classical example of a massively
parallel collision-based computing device. The automaton exhibits mobile
patterns, gliders, and generators of the mobile patterns, glider guns, in its
evolution. We show how to construct the basic logical operations, AND, OR, NOT

complicated Boolean functions is discussed. Advantages of our technique are
demonstrated on an example of binary adder, realized via collision of glider

 <dc:description>  We present a new method for nonlinear prediction of discrete random sequences
under minimal structural assumptions. We give a mathematical construction for
optimal predictors of such processes, in the form of hidden Markov models. We
then describe an algorithm, CSSR (Causal-State Splitting Reconstruction), which
approximates the ideal predictor from data. We discuss the reliability of CSSR,
its data requirements, and its performance in simulations. Finally, we compare
our approach to existing methods using variable-length Markov models and
cross-validated hidden Markov models, and show theoretically and experimentally
that our method delivers results superior to the former and at least comparable
to the latter.

 <dc:description>  LogicWeb mobile code consists of Prolog-like rules embedded in Web pages,
thereby adding logic programming behaviour to those pages. Since LogicWeb
programs are downloaded from foreign hosts and executed locally, there is a
need to protect the client from buggy or malicious code. A security model is
crucial for making LogicWeb mobile code safe to execute. This paper presents
such a model, which supports programs of varying trust levels by using
different resource access policies. The implementation of the model derives
from an extended operational semantics for the LogicWeb language, which
provides a precise meaning of safety.

 <dc:title>Optimization of Bound Disjunctive Queries with Constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  &quot;To Appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)&quot; This paper
presents a technique for the optimization of bound queries over disjunctive
deductive databases with constraints. The proposed approach is an extension of
the well-known Magic-Set technique and is well-suited for being integrated in
current bottom-up (stable) model inference engines. More specifically, it is
based on the exploitation of binding propagation techniques which reduce the
size of the data relevant to answer the query and, consequently, reduces both
the complexity of computing a single model and the number of models to be
considered. The motivation of this work stems from the observation that
traditional binding propagation optimization techniques for bottom-up model
generator systems, simulating the goal driven evaluation of top-down engines,
are only suitable for positive (disjunctive) queries, while hard problems are
expressed using unstratified negation. The main contribution of the paper
consists in the extension of a previous technique, defined for positive
disjunctive queries, to queries containing both disjunctive heads and
constraints (a simple and expressive form of unstratified negation). As the
usual way of expressing declaratively hard problems is based on the
guess-and-check technique, where the guess part is expressed by means of
disjunctive rules and the check part is expressed by means of constraints, the
technique proposed here is highly relevant for the optimization of queries
expressing hard problems. The value of the technique has been proved by several
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Imperative programmers often use cyclically linked trees in order to achieve
O(1) navigation time to neighbours. Some logic programmers believe that cyclic
terms are necessary to achieve the same in logic-based languages. An old but
little-known technique provides O(1) time and space navigation without cyclic
links, in the form of reversible predicates. A small modification provides O(1)
amortised time and space editing.

 <dc:title>Zipf's law and the creation of musical context</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zanette, Damian H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Statistical Mechanics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article discusses the extension of the notion of context from
linguistics to the domain of music. In language, the statistical regularity
known as Zipf's law -which concerns the frequency of usage of different words-
has been quantitatively related to the process of text generation. This
connection is established by Simon's model, on the basis of a few assumptions
regarding the accompanying creation of context. Here, it is shown that the
statistics of note usage in musical compositions are compatible with the
predictions of Simon's model. This result, which gives objective support to the
conceptual likeness of context in language and music, is obtained through
automatic analysis of the digital versions of several compositions. As a
by-product, a quantitative measure of context definiteness is introduced and
used to compare tonal and atonal works.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an extension of the XQuery language, FluX, that supports
event-based query processing and the conscious handling of main memory buffers.
Purely event-based queries of this language can be executed on streaming XML
data in a very direct way. We then develop an algorithm that allows to
efficiently rewrite XQueries into the event-based FluX language. This algorithm
uses order constraints from a DTD to schedule event handlers and to thus
minimize the amount of buffering required for evaluating a query. We discuss
the various technical aspects of query optimization and query evaluation within
our framework. This is complemented with an experimental evaluation of our
approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper it is shown how to map a data manifold into a simpler form by
progressively discarding small degrees of freedom. This is the key to
self-organising data fusion, where the raw data is embedded in a very
high-dimensional space (e.g. the pixel values of one or more images), and the
requirement is to isolate the important degrees of freedom which lie on a
low-dimensional manifold. A useful advantage of the approach used in this paper
is that the computations are arranged as a feed-forward processing chain, where
all the details of the processing in each stage of the chain are learnt by
self-organisation. This approach is demonstrated using hierarchically
correlated data, which causes the processing chain to split the data into
separate processing channels, and then to progressively merge these channels
wherever they are correlated with each other. This is the key to
self-organising data fusion.

 <dc:description>  Wireless technology can provide many benefits to computing including faster
response to queries, reduced time spent on paperwork, increased online time for
users, just-in-time and real time control, tighter communications between
clients and hosts. Wireless Computing is governed by two general forces:
Technology, which provides a set of basic building blocks and User
Applications, which determine a set of operations that must be carried out
efficiently on demand. This paper summarizes technological changes that are
underway and describes their impact on wireless computing development and
implementation. It also describes the applications that influence the
development and implementation of wireless computing and shows what current
systems offer.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of providing service guarantees in a high-speed
packet switch. As basic requirements, the switch should be scalable to high
speeds per port, a large number of ports and a large number of traffic flows
with independent guarantees. Existing scalable solutions are based on Virtual
Output Queuing, which is computationally complex when required to provide
service guarantees for a large number of flows.
  We present a novel architecture for packet switching that provides support
for such service guarantees. A cost-effective fabric with small external
speedup is combined with a feedback mechanism that enables the fabric to be
virtually lossless, thus avoiding packet drops indiscriminate of flows. Through
analysis and simulation, we show that this architecture provides accurate
support for service guarantees, has low computational complexity and is
scalable to very high port speeds.

 <dc:description>  We examine the problem of approximating, in the Frobenius-norm sense, a
positive, semidefinite symmetric matrix by a rank-one matrix, with an upper
bound on the cardinality of its eigenvector. The problem arises in the
decomposition of a covariance matrix into sparse factors, and has wide
applications ranging from biology to finance. We use a modification of the
classical variational representation of the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric
matrix, where cardinality is constrained, and derive a semidefinite programming
based relaxation for our problem. We also discuss Nesterov's smooth
minimization technique applied to the SDP arising in the direct sparse PCA
method.

 <dc:description>  The ontological and epistemological positions adopted by information systems
design methods are incommensur-able when pushed to their extremes. Information
systems research has therefore tended to focus on the similarities between
different positions, usually in search of a single, unifying position. However,
by focusing on the similari-ties, the clarity of argument provided by any one
philoso-phical position is necessarily diminished. Consequently, researchers
often treat the philosophical foundations of design methods as being of only
minor importance. In this paper, we have deliberately chosen to focus on the
differences between various philosophical positions. From this focus, we
believe we can offer a clearer under-standing of the empirical behaviour of
software as viewed from particular philosophical positions. Since the
em-pirical evidence does not favour any single position, we conclude by arguing
for the validity of ad hoc approaches to software design which we believe
provides a stronger and more theoretically grounded approach to software
design.

 <dc:description>  Design methods in information systems frequently create software descriptions
using formal languages. Nonetheless, most software designers prefer to describe
software using natural languages. This distinction is not simply a matter of
convenience. Natural languages are not the same as formal languages; in
particular, natural languages do not follow the notions of equivalence used by
formal languages. In this paper, we show both the existence and coexistence of
different notions of equivalence by extending the no-tion of oracles used in
formal languages. This allows distinctions to be made between the trustworthy
oracles assumed by formal languages and the untrust-worthy oracles used by
natural languages. By examin-ing the notion of equivalence, we hope to
encourage designers of software to rethink the place of ambiguity in software
design.

 <dc:description>  A \emph{queue layout} of a graph consists of a total order of the vertices,
and a partition of the edges into \emph{queues}, such that no two edges in the
same queue are nested. The minimum number of queues in a queue layout of a
graph is its \emph{queue-number}. A \emph{three-dimensional (straight-line
grid) drawing} of a graph represents the vertices by points in $\mathbb{Z}^3$
and the edges by non-crossing line-segments. This paper contributes three main
results:
  (1) It is proved that the minimum volume of a certain type of
three-dimensional drawing of a graph $G$ is closely related to the queue-number
of $G$. In particular, if $G$ is an $n$-vertex member of a proper minor-closed
family of graphs (such as a planar graph), then $G$ has a $O(1)\times
O(1)\times O(n)$ drawing if and only if $G$ has O(1) queue-number.
  (2) It is proved that queue-number is bounded by tree-width, thus resolving
an open problem due to Ganley and Heath (2001), and disproving a conjecture of
Pemmaraju (1992). This result provides renewed hope for the positive resolution
of a number of open problems in the theory of queue layouts.
  (3) It is proved that graphs of bounded tree-width have three-dimensional
drawings with O(n) volume. This is the most general family of graphs known to
admit three-dimensional drawings with O(n) volume.
  The proofs depend upon our results regarding \emph{track layouts} and
\emph{tree-partitions} of graphs, which may be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Bounds consistency is usually enforced on continuous constraints by first
decomposing them into binary and ternary primitives. This decomposition has
long been shown to drastically slow down the computation of solutions. To
tackle this, Benhamou et al. have introduced an algorithm that avoids formally
decomposing constraints. Its better efficiency compared to the former method
has already been experimentally demonstrated. It is shown here that their
algorithm implements a strategy to enforce on a continuous constraint a
consistency akin to Directional Bounds Consistency as introduced by Dechter and
Pearl for discrete problems. The algorithm is analyzed in this framework, and
compared with algorithms that enforce bounds consistency. These theoretical
results are eventually contrasted with new experimental results on standard
benchmarks from the interval constraint community.

 <dc:description>  Refactoring is an established technique from the OO-community to restructure
code: it aims at improving software readability, maintainability and
extensibility. Although refactoring is not tied to the OO-paradigm in
particular, its ideas have not been applied to Logic Programming until now.
  This paper applies the ideas of refactoring to Prolog programs. A catalogue
is presented listing refactorings classified according to scope. Some of the
refactorings have been adapted from the OO-paradigm, while others have been
specifically designed for Prolog. Also the discrepancy between intended and
operational semantics in Prolog is addressed by some of the refactorings.
  In addition, ViPReSS, a semi-automatic refactoring browser, is discussed and
the experience with applying \vipress to a large Prolog legacy system is
reported. Our main conclusion is that refactoring is not only a viable
technique in Prolog but also a rather desirable one.

 <dc:description>  Due to the transient nature of peers, any Peer-to-Peer network is in peril to
falling apart if peers do not receive routing table updates periodically. To
this end, maintenance, which affects every peer, ensures connectedness and
sustained data operation performance. However, a high rate of change in peer
population usually incurs lots of network maintenance messages and can severely
degrade overall performance. We discuss three methods how to tackle and
mitigate the effect of peer fluctuation on a tree-based distributed hash table.

 <dc:description>  A nearly logarithmic lower bound on the randomized competitive ratio for the
metrical task systems problem is presented. This implies a similar lower bound
for the extensively studied k-server problem. The proof is based on Ramsey-type
theorems for metric spaces, that state that every metric space contains a large
subspace which is approximately a hierarchically well-separated tree (and in
particular an ultrametric). These Ramsey-type theorems may be of independent
interest.

 <dc:description>  An abstract framework of canonical inference is used to explore how different
proof orderings induce different variants of saturation and completeness.
Notions like completion, paramodulation, saturation, redundancy elimination,
and rewrite-system reduction are connected to proof orderings. Fairness of
deductive mechanisms is defined in terms of proof orderings, distinguishing
between (ordinary) &quot;fairness,&quot; which yields completeness, and &quot;uniform
fairness,&quot; which yields saturation.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a standalone, publicly-available implementation of the
Resolution of Anaphora Procedure (RAP) given by Lappin and Leass (1994). The
RAP algorithm resolves third person pronouns, lexical anaphors, and identifies
pleonastic pronouns. Our implementation, JavaRAP, fills a current need in
anaphora resolution research by providing a reference implementation that can
be benchmarked against current algorithms. The implementation uses the
standard, publicly available Charniak (2000) parser as input, and generates a
list of anaphora-antecedent pairs as output. Alternately, an in-place
annotation or substitution of the anaphors with their antecedents can be
produced. Evaluation on the MUC-6 co-reference task shows that JavaRAP has an
accuracy of 57.9%, similar to the performance given previously in the
literature (e.g., Preiss 2002).

 <dc:title>A Dynamic Clustering-Based Markov Model for Web Usage Mining</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Markov models have been widely utilized for modelling user web navigation
behaviour. In this work we propose a dynamic clustering-based method to
increase a Markov model's accuracy in representing a collection of user web
navigation sessions. The method makes use of the state cloning concept to
duplicate states in a way that separates in-links whose corresponding
second-order probabilities diverge. In addition, the new method incorporates a
clustering technique which determines an effcient way to assign in-links with
similar second-order probabilities to the same clone. We report on experiments
conducted with both real and random data and we provide a comparison with the
N-gram Markov concept. The results show that the number of additional states
induced by the dynamic clustering method can be controlled through a threshold
parameter, and suggest that the method's performance is linear time in the size
of the model.

 <dc:description>  We describe algorithmic results for two crucial aspects of allocating
resources on computational hardware devices with partial reconfigurability. By
using methods from the field of computational geometry, we derive a method that
allows correct maintainance of free and occupied space of a set of n
rectangular modules in optimal time Theta(n log n); previous approaches needed
a time of O(n^2) for correct results and O(n) for heuristic results. We also
show that finding an optimal feasible communication-conscious placement (which
minimizes the total weighted Manhattan distance between the new module and
existing demand points) can be computed in Theta(n log n). Both resulting
algorithms are practically easy to implement and show convincing experimental
behavior.

 <dc:description>  Computability logic is a formal theory of computational tasks and resources.
Its formulas represent interactive computational problems, logical operators
stand for operations on computational problems, and validity of a formula is
understood as being a scheme of problems that always have algorithmic
solutions. A comprehensive online source on the subject is available at
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html . The earlier article &quot;Propositional
computability logic I&quot; proved soundness and completeness for the (in a sense)
minimal nontrivial fragment CL1 of computability logic. The present paper
extends that result to the significantly more expressive propositional system
CL2. What makes CL2 more expressive than CL1 is the presence of two sorts of
atoms in its language: elementary atoms, representing elementary computational
problems (i.e. predicates), and general atoms, representing arbitrary
computational problems. CL2 conservatively extends CL1, with the latter being
nothing but the general-atom-free fragment of the former.

 <dc:title>A New Approach to Draw Detection by Move Repetition in Computer Chess
  Programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very
important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article -
the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has
so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional
matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of
the so-called bitboard format.
  The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using
variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree
expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more
efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions
with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine
language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The
routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in
its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo,
based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000
games altogether).

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Let A(q,n,d) denote the maximum size of a q-ary code of length n and distance
d. We study the minimum asymptotic redundancy \rho(q,n,d)=n-log_q A(q,n,d) as n
grows while q and d are fixed. For any d and q&lt;=d-1, long algebraic codes are
designed that improve on the BCH codes and have the lowest asymptotic
redundancy \rho(q,n,d) &lt;= ((d-3)+1/(d-2)) log_q n known to date. Prior to this
work, codes of fixed distance that asymptotically surpass BCH codes and the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound were designed only for distances 4,5 and 6.

 <dc:description>  We present a static analysis technique for non-termination inference of logic
programs. Our framework relies on an extension of the subsumption test, where
some specific argument positions can be instantiated while others are
generalized. We give syntactic criteria to statically identify such argument
positions from the text of a program. Atomic left looping queries are generated
bottom-up from selected subsets of the binary unfoldings of the program of
interest. We propose a set of correct algorithms for automating the approach.
Then, non-termination inference is tailored to attempt proofs of optimality of
left termination conditions computed by a termination inference tool. An
experimental evaluation is reported. When termination and non-termination
analysis produce complementary results for a logic procedure, then with respect
to the leftmost selection rule and the language used to describe sets of atomic
queries, each analysis is optimal and together, they induce a characterization
of the operational behavior of the logic procedure.

 <dc:description>  The paper proposes a new methodology for defining business process measures
and their computation. The approach is based on metamodeling according to MOF.
Especially, a metamodel providing precise definitions of typical process
measures for UML activity diagram-like notation is proposed, including precise
definitions how measures should be aggregated for composite process elements.
The proposed approach allows defining values in a natural way, and measurement
of data, which are of interest to business, without deep investigation into
specific technical solutions. This provides new possibilities for business
process measurement, decreasing the gap between technical solutions and asset
management methodologies.

 <dc:description>  In this report we study the problem of determining three-dimensional
orientations for noisy projections of randomly oriented identical particles.
The problem is of central importance in the tomographic reconstruction of the
density map of macromolecular complexes from electron microscope images and it
has been studied intensively for more than 30 years.
  We analyze the computational complexity of the orientation problem and show
that while several variants of the problem are $NP$-hard, inapproximable and
fixed-parameter intractable, some restrictions are polynomial-time approximable
within a constant factor or even solvable in logarithmic space. The orientation
search problem is formalized as a constrained line arrangement problem that is
of independent interest. The negative complexity results give a partial
justification for the heuristic methods used in orientation search, and the
positive complexity results on the orientation search have some positive
implications also to the problem of finding functionally analogous genes.
  A preliminary version ``The Computational Complexity of Orientation Search in
Cryo-Electron Microscopy'' appeared in Proc. ICCS 2004, LNCS 3036, pp.

 <dc:description>  We consider vertex colorings of graphs in which adjacent vertices have
distinct colors. A graph is $s$-chromatic if it is colorable in $s$ colors and
any coloring of it uses at least $s$ colors. The forcing chromatic number
$F(G)$ of an $s$-chromatic graph $G$ is the smallest number of vertices which
must be colored so that, with the restriction that $s$ colors are used, every
remaining vertex has its color determined uniquely. We estimate the
computational complexity of $F(G)$ relating it to the complexity class US
introduced by Blass and Gurevich. We prove that recognizing if $F(G)\le 2$ is
US-hard with respect to polynomial-time many-one reductions. Moreover, this
problem is coNP-hard even under the promises that $F(G)\le 3$ and $G$ is
3-chromatic. On the other hand, recognizing if $F(G)\le k$, for each constant
$k$, is reducible to a problem in US via disjunctive truth-table reduction.
  Similar results are obtained also for forcing variants of the clique and the
domination numbers of a graph.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of searching for an object on a line at an unknown
distance OPT from the original position of the searcher, in the presence of a
cost of d for each time the searcher changes direction. This is a
generalization of the well-studied linear-search problem. We describe a
strategy that is guaranteed to find the object at a cost of at most 9*OPT + 2d,
which has the optimal competitive ratio 9 with respect to OPT plus the minimum
corresponding additive term. Our argument for upper and lower bound uses an
infinite linear program, which we solve by experimental solution of an infinite
series of approximating finite linear programs, estimating the limits, and
solving the resulting recurrences. We feel that this technique is interesting
in its own right and should help solve other searching problems. In particular,
we consider the star search or cow-path problem with turn cost, where the
hidden object is placed on one of m rays emanating from the original position
of the searcher. For this problem we give a tight bound of
(1+(2(m^m)/((m-1)^(m-1))) OPT + m ((m/(m-1))^(m-1) - 1) d. We also discuss
tradeoff between the corresponding coefficients, and briefly consider
randomized strategies on the line.

 <dc:description>  Cluster hash tables (CHTs) are a key persistent-storage component of many
large-scale Internet services due to their high performance and scalability. We
show that a correctly-designed CHT can also be as easy to manage as a farm of
stateless servers. Specifically, we trade away some consistency to obtain
reboot-based recovery that is simple, maintains full data availability, and
only has modest impact on performance. This simplifies management in two ways.
First, it simplifies failure detection by lowering the cost of acting on false
positives, allowing us to use simple but aggressive statistical techniques to
quickly detect potential failures and node degradations; even when a false
alarm is raised or when rebooting will not fix the problem, attempting recovery
by rebooting is relatively non-intrusive to system availability and
performance. Second, it allows us to re-cast online repartitioning as failure
plus recovery, simplifying dynamic scaling and capacity planning. These
properties make it possible for the system to be continuously self-adjusting, a
key property of self-managing, autonomic systems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the behavior of iteratively decoded low-density
parity-check codes over the binary erasure channel in the so-called ``waterfall
region.&quot; We show that the performance curves in this region follow a very basic
scaling law. We conjecture that essentially the same scaling behavior applies
in a much more general setting and we provide some empirical evidence to
support this conjecture. The scaling law, together with the error floor
expressions developed previously, can be used for fast finite-length
optimization.

 <dc:title>Stable Outcomes for Two-Sided Contract Choice Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lahiri, Somdeb</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show, that a simple generalization of the Deferred Acceptance Procedure
with firms proposing due to Gale and Shapley(1962), yeild outcomes for a
two-sided contract choice problem, which necessarily belong to the core and are
Weakly Pareto Optimal for firms. Under additional assumptions: (a) given any
two distinct workers, the set of yields acheivable by a firm with the first
worker is disjoint from the set of yields acheivable by it with the second, and
(b) the contract choice problem is pair-wise efficient, we prove that there is
no stable outcome at which a firm can get more than what it gets at the unique
outcome of our procedure.

 <dc:description>  It is usually assumed that Honeynets are hard to detect and that attempts to
detect or disable them can be unconditionally monitored. We scrutinize this
assumption and demonstrate a method how a host in a honeynet can be completely
controlled by an attacker without any substantial logging taking place.

 <dc:description>  A critical problem in the emerging high-throughput genotyping protocols is to
minimize the number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers required to
amplify the single nucleotide polymorphism loci of interest. In this paper we
study PCR primer set selection with amplification length and uniqueness
constraints from both theoretical and practical perspectives. We give a greedy
algorithm that achieves a logarithmic approximation factor for the problem of
minimizing the number of primers subject to a given upperbound on the length of
PCR amplification products. We also give, using randomized rounding, the first
non-trivial approximation algorithm for a version of the problem that requires
unique amplification of each amplification target. Empirical results on
randomly generated testcases as well as testcases extracted from the from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information's genomic databases show that our
algorithms are highly scalable and produce better results compared to previous
heuristics.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses the problems and possibility of collecting bee dance

Zipf's law and entropy statistics to decide on the question whether the dance
carries information of any kind. We describe this against the historical

 <dc:title>Web Services: A Process Algebra Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ferrara, Andrea</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is now well-admitted that formal methods are helpful for many issues
raised in the Web service area. In this paper we present a framework for the
design and verification of WSs using process algebras and their tools. We
define a two-way mapping between abstract specifications written using these
calculi and executable Web services written in BPEL4WS. Several choices are
available: design and correct errors in BPEL4WS, using process algebra
verification tools, or design and correct in process algebra and automatically
obtaining the corresponding BPEL4WS code. The approaches can be combined.
Process algebra are not useful only for temporal logic verification: we remark
the use of simulation/bisimulation both for verification and for the
hierarchical refinement design method. It is worth noting that our approach
allows the use of any process algebra depending on the needs of the user at
different levels (expressiveness, existence of reasoning tools, user
expertise).

 <dc:description>  Electronic bait (honeypots) are network resources whose value consists of
being attacked and compromised. These are often computers which do not have a
task in the network, but are otherwise indestinguishable from regular
computers. Such bait systems could be interconnected (honeynets). These
honeynets are equipped with special software, facilitating forensic anylisis of
incidents. Taking average of the wide variety of recorded data it is possible
to learn considerable more about the behaviour of attackers in networks than
with traditional methods. This article is an introduction into electronic bait
and a description of the setup and first experiences of such a network deployed
at RWTH Aachen University.
  -----
  Als elektronische Koeder (honeypots) bezeichnet man Netzwerkressourcen, deren
Wert darin besteht, angegriffen und kompromittiert zu werden. Oft sind dies
Computer, die keine spezielle Aufgabe im Netzwerk haben, aber ansonsten nicht
von regulaeren Rechnern zu unterscheiden sind. Koeder koennen zu
Koeder-Netzwerken (honeynets) zusammengeschlossen werden. Sie sind mit
spezieller Software ausgestattet, die die Forensik einer eingetretenen
Schutzzielverletzung erleichtert. Durch die Vielfalt an mitgeschnittenen Daten
kann man deutlich mehr ueber das Verhalten von Angreifern in Netzwerken lernen
als mit herkoemmlichen forensischen Methoden. Dieser Beitrag stellt die
Philosophie der Koeder-Netzwerke vor und beschreibt die ersten Erfahrungen, die
mit einem solchen Netzwerk an der RWTH Aachen gemacht wurden.

 <dc:description>  Two natural decision problems regarding the XML query language XQuery are
well-definedness and semantic type-checking. We study these problems in the
setting of a relational fragment of XQuery. We show that well-definedness and
semantic type-checking are undecidable, even in the positive-existential case.
Nevertheless, for a ``pure'' variant of XQuery, in which no identification is
made between an item and the singleton containing that item, the problems
become decidable. We also consider the analogous problems in the setting of the
nested relational calculus.

 <dc:title>The Complexity of Agreement</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Aaronson, Scott</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  A celebrated 1976 theorem of Aumann asserts that honest, rational Bayesian
agents with common priors will never &quot;agree to disagree&quot;: if their opinions
about any topic are common knowledge, then those opinions must be equal.
Economists have written numerous papers examining the assumptions behind this
theorem. But two key questions went unaddressed: first, can the agents reach
agreement after a conversation of reasonable length? Second, can the
computations needed for that conversation be performed efficiently? This paper
answers both questions in the affirmative, thereby strengthening Aumann's
original conclusion.
  We first show that, for two agents with a common prior to agree within
epsilon about the expectation of a [0,1] variable with high probability over
their prior, it suffices for them to exchange order 1/epsilon^2 bits. This
bound is completely independent of the number of bits n of relevant knowledge
that the agents have. We then extend the bound to three or more agents; and we
give an example where the economists' &quot;standard protocol&quot; (which consists of
repeatedly announcing one's current expectation) nearly saturates the bound,
while a new &quot;attenuated protocol&quot; does better. Finally, we give a protocol that
would cause two Bayesians to agree within epsilon after exchanging order
1/epsilon^2 messages, and that can be simulated by agents with limited
computational resources. By this we mean that, after examining the agents'
knowledge and a transcript of their conversation, no one would be able to
distinguish the agents from perfect Bayesians. The time used by the simulation
procedure is exponential in 1/epsilon^6 but not in n.

 <dc:description>  Grid is an infrastructure that involves the integrated and collaborative use
of computers, networks, databases and scientific instruments owned and managed
by multiple organizations. Grid applications often involve large amounts of
data and/or computing resources that require secure resource sharing across
organizational boundaries. This makes Grid application management and
deployment a complex undertaking. Grid middlewares provide users with seamless
computing ability and uniform access to resources in the heterogeneous Grid
environment. Several software toolkits and systems have been developed, most of
which are results of academic research projects, all over the world. This
chapter will focus on four of these middlewares--UNICORE, Globus, Legion and
Gridbus. It also presents our implementation of a resource broker for UNICORE
as this functionality was not supported in it. A comparison of these systems on
the basis of the architecture, implementation model and several other features
is included.

O(n) time. When people run Insertion Sort in the physical world, they leave
gaps between items to accelerate insertions. Gaps help in computers as well.
This paper shows that Gapped Insertion Sort has insertion times of O(log n)
with high probability, yielding a total running time of O(n log n) with high
probability.

 <dc:description>  Zero-Error communication investigates communication without any error. By
defining channels without probabilities, results from Elias can be used to
completely characterize which channel can simulate which other channels. We
introduce the ambiguity of a channel, which completely characterizes the
possibility in principle of a channel to simulate any other channel. In the
second part we will look at networks of players connected by channels, while
some players may be corrupted. We will show how the ambiguity of a virtual
channel connecting two arbitrary players can be calculated. This means that we
can exactly specify what kind of zero-error communication is possible between
two players in any network of players connected by channels.

 <dc:title>Statistical Machine Translation by Generalized Parsing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Designers of statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have begun to
employ tree-structured translation models. Systems involving tree-structured
translation models tend to be complex. This article aims to reduce the
conceptual complexity of such systems, in order to make them easier to design,
implement, debug, use, study, understand, explain, modify, and improve. In
service of this goal, the article extends the theory of semiring parsing to
arrive at a novel abstract parsing algorithm with five functional parameters: a
logic, a grammar, a semiring, a search strategy, and a termination condition.
The article then shows that all the common algorithms that revolve around
tree-structured translation models, including hierarchical alignment, inference
for parameter estimation, translation, and structured evaluation, can be
derived by generalizing two of these parameters -- the grammar and the logic.
The article culminates with a recipe for using such generalized parsers to
train, apply, and evaluate an SMT system that is driven by tree-structured
translation models.

 <dc:title>Predicate Abstraction with Indexed Predicates</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Predicate abstraction provides a powerful tool for verifying properties of
infinite-state systems using a combination of a decision procedure for a subset
of first-order logic and symbolic methods originally developed for finite-state
model checking. We consider models containing first-order state variables,
where the system state includes mutable functions and predicates. Such a model
can describe systems containing arbitrarily large memories, buffers, and arrays
of identical processes. We describe a form of predicate abstraction that
constructs a formula over a set of universally quantified variables to describe
invariant properties of the first-order state variables. We provide a formal
justification of the soundness of our approach and describe how it has been
used to verify several hardware and software designs, including a
directory-based cache coherence protocol.

 <dc:description>  The semijoin algebra is the variant of the relational algebra obtained by
replacing the join operator by the semijoin operator. We discuss some
interesting connections between the semijoin algebra and the guarded fragment
of first-order logic. We also provide an Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game,
characterizing the discerning power of the semijoin algebra. This game gives a
method for showing that certain queries are not expressible in the semijoin
algebra.

 <dc:description>  Learning to respond to voice-text input involves the subject's ability in
understanding the phonetic and text based contents and his/her ability to
communicate based on his/her experience. The neuro-cognitive facility of the
subject has to support two important domains in order to make the learning
process complete. In many cases, though the understanding is complete, the
response is partial. This is one valid reason why we need to support the
information from the subject with scalable techniques such as Natural Language
Processing (NLP) for abstraction of the contents from the output. This paper
explores the feasibility of using NLP modules interlaced with Neural Networks
to perform the required task in autogenic training related to medical
applications.

 <dc:description>  Searching techniques for Case Based Reasoning systems involve extensive
methods of elimination. In this paper, we look at a new method of arriving at
the right solution by performing a series of transformations upon the data.
These involve N-gram based comparison and deduction of the input data with the
case data, using Morphemes and Phonemes as the deciding parameters. A similar
technique for eliminating possible errors using a noise removal function is
performed. The error tracking and elimination is performed through a
statistical analysis of obtained data, where the entire data set is analyzed as
sub-categories of various etymological derivatives. A probability analysis for
the closest match is then performed, which yields the final expression. This
final expression is referred to the Case Base. The output is redirected through
an Expert System based on best possible match. The threshold for the match is
customizable, and could be set by the Knowledge-Architect.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of bounding below the probability of error under
maximum likelihood decoding of a binary code with a known distance distribution
used on a binary symmetric channel. An improved upper bound is given for the
maximum attainable exponent of this probability (the reliability function of
the channel). In particular, we prove that the ``random coding exponent'' is
the true value of the channel reliability for code rate $R$ in some interval
immediately below the critical rate of the channel. An analogous result is
obtained for the Gaussian channel.

 <dc:description>  The concept of coupling geographically distributed resources for solving
large scale problems is becoming increasingly popular forming what is popularly
called grid computing. Management of resources in the Grid environment becomes
complex as the resources are geographically distributed, heterogeneous in
nature and owned by different individuals and organizations each having their
own resource management policies and different access and cost models. There
have been many projects that have designed and implemented the resource
management systems with a variety of architectures and services. In this paper
we have presented the general requirements that a Resource Management system
should satisfy. The taxonomy has also been defined based on which survey of
resource management systems in different existing Grid projects has been
conducted to identify the key areas where these systems lack the desired
functionality.

 <dc:description>  Handheld devices, while growing rapidly, are inherently constrained and lack
the capability of executing resource hungry applications. This paper presents
the design and implementation of distributed analysis and load-balancing system
for hand-held devices using multi-agents system. This system enables low
resource mobile handheld devices to act as potential clients for Grid enabled
applications and analysis environments. We propose a system, in which mobile
agents will transport, schedule, execute and return results for heavy
computational jobs submitted by handheld devices. Moreover, in this way, our
system provides high throughput computing environment for hand-held devices.

 <dc:description>  Revisiting the thirty years-old notions of resource-bounded immunity and
simplicity, we investigate the structural characteristics of various immunity
notions: strong immunity, almost immunity, and hyperimmunity as well as their
corresponding simplicity notions. We also study limited immunity and
simplicity, called k-immunity and feasible k-immunity, and their simplicity
notions. Finally, we propose the k-immune hypothesis as a working hypothesis
that guarantees the existence of simple sets in NP.

application of their actions. As computing the perfect value function is
typically intractable, a heuristic approximation is acquired instead. Most
studies of learning in real-time search (and reinforcement learning) assume
that a simple value-function-greedy policy is used to select actions. This is
in contrast to practice, where high-performance is usually attained by
interleaving planning and acting via a lookahead search of a non-trivial depth.
In this paper, we take a step toward bridging this gap and propose a novel
algorithm that (i) learns a heuristic function to be used specifically with a
lookahead-based policy, (ii) selects the lookahead depth adaptively in each
state, (iii) gives the user control over the trade-off between exploration and
exploitation. We extensively evaluate the algorithm in the sliding tile puzzle
testbed comparing it to the classical LRTA* and the more recent weighted LRTA*,
bounded LRTA*, and FALCONS. Improvements of 5 to 30 folds in convergence speed
are observed.

 <dc:description>  We describe a distributed processing cluster of inexpensive Linux machines
developed jointly by the Astronomy and Computer Science departments at
Haverford College which has been successfully used to search a large volume of
data from a recent radio pulsar survey. Analysis of radio pulsar surveys
requires significant computational resources to handle the demanding data
storage and processing needs. One goal of this project was to explore issues
encountered when processing a large amount of pulsar survey data with limited
computational resources. This cluster, which was developed and activated in
only a few weeks by supervised undergraduate summer research students, used
existing decommissioned computers, the campus network, and a script-based,
client-oriented, self-scheduled data distribution approach to process the data.
This setup provided simplicity, efficiency, and &quot;on-the-fly&quot; scalability at low
cost. The entire 570 GB data set from the pulsar survey was processed at
Haverford over the course of a ten-week summer period using this cluster. We
conclude that this cluster can serve as a useful computational model in cases
where data processing must be carried out on a limited budget. We have also
constructed a DVD archive of the raw survey data in order to investigate the
feasibility of using DVD as an inexpensive and easily accessible raw data
storage format for pulsar surveys. DVD-based storage has not been widely
explored in the pulsar community, but it has several advantages. The DVD
archive we have constructed is reliable, portable, inexpensive, and can be
easily read by any standard modern machine.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new two-dimensional meshing algorithm called PINW able to
generate meshes that accurately approximate the distance between any two domain
points by paths composed only of cell edges. This technique is based on an
extension of pinwheel tilings proposed by Radin and Conway. We prove that the
algorithm produces triangles of bounded aspect ratio. This kind of mesh would
be useful in cohesive interface finite element modeling when the crack
propagation pathis an outcome of a simulation process.

 <dc:title>Minimum Enclosing Polytope in High Dimensions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Panigrahy, Rina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of covering a given set of $n$ points in a high,
$d$-dimensional space by the minimum enclosing polytope of a given arbitrary
shape. We present algorithms that work for a large family of shapes, provided
either only translations and no rotations are allowed, or only rotation about a
fixed point is allowed; that is, one is allowed to only scale and translate a
given shape, or scale and rotate the shape around a fixed point. Our algorithms
start with a polytope guessed to be of optimal size and iteratively moves it
based on a greedy principle: simply move the current polytope directly towards
any outside point till it touches the surface. For computing the minimum
enclosing ball, this gives a simple greedy algorithm with running time
$O(nd/\eps)$ producing a ball of radius $1+\eps$ times the optimal. This simple
principle generalizes to arbitrary convex shape when only translations are
allowed, requiring at most $O(1/\eps^2)$ iterations. Our algorithm implies that
{\em core-sets} of size $O(1/\eps^2)$ exist not only for minimum enclosing ball
but also for any convex shape with a fixed orientation. A {\em Core-Set} is a
small subset of $poly(1/\eps)$ points whose minimum enclosing polytope is
almost as large as that of the original points. Although we are unable to
combine our techniques for translations and rotations for general shapes, for
the min-cylinder problem, we give an algorithm similar to the one in
\cite{HV03}, but with an improved running time of $2^{O(\frac{1}{\eps^2}\log
\frac{1}{\eps})} nd$.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Jadbabaie, Lin, and Morse (IEEE TAC, 48(6)2003:988-1001) offered a
mathematical analysis of the discrete time model of groups of mobile autonomous
agents raised by Vicsek et al. in 1995. In their paper, Jadbabaie et al. showed
that all agents shall move in the same heading, provided that these agents are
periodically linked together. This paper sharpens this result by showing that
coordination will be reached under a very weak condition that requires all
agents are finally linked together. This condition is also strictly weaker than
the one Jadbabaie et al. desired.

 <dc:description>  We consider linear systems arising from the use of the finite element method
for solving scalar linear elliptic problems. Our main result is that these
linear systems, which are symmetric and positive semidefinite, are well
approximated by symmetric diagonally dominant matrices. Our framework for
defining matrix approximation is support theory. Significant graph theoretic
work has already been developed in the support framework for preconditioners in
the diagonally dominant case, and in particular it is known that such systems
can be solved with iterative methods in nearly linear time. Thus, our
approximation result implies that these graph theoretic techniques can also
solve a class of finite element problems in nearly linear time. We show that
the support number bounds, which control the number of iterations in the
preconditioned iterative solver, depend on mesh quality measures but not on the
problem size or shape of the domain.

 <dc:title>Efficient Hashing with Lookups in two Memory Accesses</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Panigrahy, Rina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>E.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The study of hashing is closely related to the analysis of balls and bins. It
is well-known that instead of using a single hash function if we randomly hash
a ball into two bins and place it in the smaller of the two, then this
dramatically lowers the maximum load on bins. This leads to the concept of
two-way hashing where the largest bucket contains $O(\log\log n)$ balls with
high probability. The hash look up will now search in both the buckets an item
hashes to. Since an item may be placed in one of two buckets, we could
potentially move an item after it has been initially placed to reduce maximum
load. with a maximum load of We show that by performing moves during inserts, a
maximum load of 2 can be maintained on-line, with high probability, while
supporting hash update operations. In fact, with $n$ buckets, even if the space
for two items are pre-allocated per bucket, as may be desirable in hardware
implementations, more than $n$ items can be stored giving a high memory
utilization. We also analyze the trade-off between the number of moves
performed during inserts and the maximum load on a bucket. By performing at
most $h$ moves, we can maintain a maximum load of $O(\frac{\log \log n}{h
\log(\log\log n/h)})$. So, even by performing one move, we achieve a better
bound than by performing no moves at all.

 <dc:description>  Fairly rapid environmental changes call for continuous surveillance and
on-line decision making. There are two main areas where IT technologies can be
valuable. In this paper we present a multi-agent system for monitoring and
assessing air-quality attributes, which uses data coming from a meteorological
station. A community of software agents is assigned to monitor and validate
measurements coming from several sensors, to assess air-quality, and, finally,
to fire alarms to appropriate recipients, when needed. Data mining techniques
have been used for adding data-driven, customized intelligence into agents. The
architecture of the developed system, its domain ontology, and typical agent
interactions are presented. Finally, the deployment of a real-world test case
is demonstrated.

 <dc:description>  Agent Academy (AA) aims to develop a multi-agent society that can train new
agents for specific or general tasks, while constantly retraining existing
agents in a recursive mode. The system is based on collecting information both
from the environment and the behaviors of the acting agents and their related
successes/failures to generate a body of data, stored in the Agent Use
Repository, which is mined by the Data Miner module, in order to generate
useful knowledge about the application domain. Knowledge extracted by the Data
Miner is used by the Agent Training Module as to train new agents or to enhance
the behavior of agents already running. In this paper the Agent Academy
framework is introduced, and its overall architecture and functionality are
presented. Training issues as well as agent ontologies are discussed. Finally,
a scenario, which aims to provide environmental alerts to both individuals and
public authorities, is described an AA-based use case.

 <dc:description>  We are developing an automatic method to compile an encyclopedic corpus from
the Web. In our previous work, paragraph-style descriptions for a term are
extracted from Web pages and organized based on domains. However, these
descriptions are independent and do not comprise a condensed text as in
hand-crafted encyclopedias. To resolve this problem, we propose a summarization
method, which produces a single text from multiple descriptions. The resultant
summary concisely describes a term from different viewpoints. We also show the
effectiveness of our method by means of experiments.

 <dc:description>  We are developing a cross-media information retrieval system, in which users
can view specific segments of lecture videos by submitting text queries. To
produce a text index, the audio track is extracted from a lecture video and a
transcription is generated by automatic speech recognition. In this paper, to
improve the quality of our retrieval system, we extensively investigate the
effects of adapting acoustic and language models on speech recognition. We
perform an MLLR-based method to adapt an acoustic model. To obtain a corpus for
language model adaptation, we use the textbook for a target lecture to search a
Web collection for the pages associated with the lecture topic. We show the
effectiveness of our method by means of experiments.

 <dc:description>  We integrate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and question answering (QA)
to realize a speech-driven QA system, and evaluate its performance. We adapt an
N-gram language model to natural language questions, so that the input of our
system can be recognized with a high accuracy. We target WH-questions which
consist of the topic part and fixed phrase used to ask about something. We
first produce a general N-gram model intended to recognize the topic and
emphasize the counts of the N-grams that correspond to the fixed phrases. Given
a transcription by the ASR engine, the QA engine extracts the answer candidates
from target documents. We propose a passage retrieval method robust against
recognition errors in the transcription. We use the QA test collection produced
in NTCIR, which is a TREC-style evaluation workshop, and show the effectiveness
of our method by means of experiments.

 <dc:title>Static versus Dynamic Arbitrage Bounds on Multivariate Option Prices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>d'Aspremont, Alexandre</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We compare static arbitrage price bounds on basket calls, i.e. bounds that
only involve buy-and-hold trading strategies, with the price range obtained
within a multi-variate generalization of the Black-Scholes model. While there
is no gap between these two sets of prices in the univariate case, we observe
here that contrary to our intuition about model risk for at-the-money calls,
there is a somewhat large gap between model prices and static arbitrage prices,
hence a similarly large set of prices on which a multivariate Black-Scholes
model cannot be calibrated but where no conclusion can be drawn on the presence
or not of a static arbitrage opportunity.

 <dc:title>Scheduling with Fuzzy Methods</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eiden, Wolfgang Anthony</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Nowadays, manufacturing industries -- driven by fierce competition and rising
customer requirements -- are forced to produce a broader range of individual
products of rising quality at the same (or preferably lower) cost. Meeting
these demands implies an even more complex production process and thus also an
appropriately increasing request to its scheduling. Aggravatingly, vagueness of
scheduling parameters -- such as times and conditions -- are often inherent in
the production process. In addition, the search for an optimal schedule
normally leads to very difficult problems (NP-hard problems in the complexity
theoretical sense), which cannot be solved effciently. With the intent to
minimize these problems, the introduced heuristic method combines standard
scheduling methods with fuzzy methods to get a nearly optimal schedule within
an appropriate time considering vagueness adequately.

 <dc:title>On Modal Logics of Partial Recursive Functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Naumov, Pavel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The classical propositional logic is known to be sound and complete with
respect to the set semantics that interprets connectives as set operations. The
paper extends propositional language by a new binary modality that corresponds
to partial recursive function type constructor under the above interpretation.
The cases of deterministic and non-deterministic functions are considered and
for both of them semantically complete modal logics are described and
decidability of these logics is established.

 <dc:description>  Many reconfigurable platforms require that applications be written
specifically to take advantage of the reconfigurable hardware. In a PC-based
environment, this presents an undesirable constraint in that the many already
available applications cannot leverage on such hardware. Greatest benefit can
only be derived from reconfigurable devices if even native OS applications can
transparently utilize reconfigurable devices as they would normal full-fledged
hardware devices. This paper presents how Proteus Virtual Devices are used to
expose reconfigurable hardware in a transparent manner for use by typical
native OS applications.

 <dc:description>  A \emph{$(k,t)$-track layout} of a graph $G$ consists of a (proper) vertex
$t$-colouring of $G$, a total order of each vertex colour class, and a
(non-proper) edge $k$-colouring such that between each pair of colour classes
no two monochromatic edges cross. This structure has recently arisen in the
study of three-dimensional graph drawings. This paper presents the beginnings
of a theory of track layouts. First we determine the maximum number of edges in
a $(k,t)$-track layout, and show how to colour the edges given fixed linear
orderings of the vertex colour classes. We then describe methods for the
manipulation of track layouts. For example, we show how to decrease the number
of edge colours in a track layout at the expense of increasing the number of
tracks, and vice versa. We then study the relationship between track layouts
and other models of graph layout, namely stack and queue layouts, and geometric
thickness. One of our principle results is that the queue-number and
track-number of a graph are tied, in the sense that one is bounded by a
function of the other. As corollaries we prove that acyclic chromatic number is
bounded by both queue-number and stack-number. Finally we consider track
layouts of planar graphs. While it is an open problem whether planar graphs
have bounded track-number, we prove bounds on the track-number of outerplanar
graphs, and give the best known lower bound on the track-number of planar
graphs.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the computational complexity of problems related to case-based
planning: planning when a plan for a similar instance is known, and planning
from a library of plans. We prove that planning from a single case has the same
complexity than generative planning (i.e., planning &quot;from scratch&quot;); using an
extended definition of cases, complexity is reduced if the domain stored in the
case is similar to the one to search plans for. Planning from a library of
cases is shown to have the same complexity. In both cases, the complexity of
planning remains, in the worst case, PSPACE-complete.

 <dc:title>A Framework for High-Accuracy Privacy-Preserving Mining</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To preserve client privacy in the data mining process, a variety of
techniques based on random perturbation of data records have been proposed
recently. In this paper, we present a generalized matrix-theoretic model of
random perturbation, which facilitates a systematic approach to the design of
perturbation mechanisms for privacy-preserving mining. Specifically, we
demonstrate that (a) the prior techniques differ only in their settings for the
model parameters, and (b) through appropriate choice of parameter settings, we
can derive new perturbation techniques that provide highly accurate mining
results even under strict privacy guarantees. We also propose a novel
perturbation mechanism wherein the model parameters are themselves
characterized as random variables, and demonstrate that this feature provides
significant improvements in privacy at a very marginal cost in accuracy.
  While our model is valid for random-perturbation-based privacy-preserving
mining in general, we specifically evaluate its utility here with regard to
frequent-itemset mining on a variety of real datasets. The experimental results
indicate that our mechanisms incur substantially lower identity and support
errors as compared to the prior techniques.

 <dc:title>All Maximal Independent Sets and Dynamic Dominance for Sparse Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We describe algorithms, based on Avis and Fukuda's reverse search paradigm,
for listing all maximal independent sets in a sparse graph in polynomial time
and delay per output. For bounded degree graphs, our algorithms take constant
time per set generated; for minor-closed graph families, the time is O(n) per
set, and for more general sparse graph families we achieve subquadratic time
per set. We also describe new data structures for maintaining a dynamic vertex
set S in a sparse or minor-closed graph family, and querying the number of
vertices not dominated by S; for minor-closed graph families the time per
update is constant, while it is sublinear for any sparse graph family. We can
also maintain a dynamic vertex set in an arbitrary m-edge graph and test the
independence of the maintained set in time O(sqrt m) per update. We use the
domination data structures as part of our enumeration algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We survey existing approaches to the formal verification of statecharts using
model checking. Although the semantics and subset of statecharts used in each
approach varies considerably, along with the model checkers and their
specification languages, most approaches rely on translating the hierarchical
structure into the flat representation of the input language of the model
checker. This makes model checking difficult to scale to industrial models, as
the state space grows exponentially with flattening. We look at current
approaches to model checking hierarchical structures and find that their
semantics is significantly different from statecharts. We propose to address
the problem of state space explosion using a combination of techniques, which
are proposed as directions for further research.

 <dc:description>  We consider the Minimum Description Length principle for online sequence
prediction. If the underlying model class is discrete, then the total expected
square loss is a particularly interesting performance measure: (a) this
quantity is bounded, implying convergence with probability one, and (b) it
additionally specifies a `rate of convergence'. Generally, for MDL only
exponential loss bounds hold, as opposed to the linear bounds for a Bayes
mixture. We show that this is even the case if the model class contains only
Bernoulli distributions. We derive a new upper bound on the prediction error
for countable Bernoulli classes. This implies a small bound (comparable to the
one for Bayes mixtures) for certain important model classes. The results apply
to many Machine Learning tasks including classification and hypothesis testing.
We provide arguments that our theorems generalize to countable classes of
i.i.d. models.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present and evaluate a search strategy called Decomposition
Based Search (DBS) which is based on two steps: subproblem generation and
subproblem solution. The generation of subproblems is done through value
ranking and domain splitting. Subdomains are explored so as to generate,
according to the heuristic chosen, promising subproblems first.
  We show that two well known search strategies, Limited Discrepancy Search
(LDS) and Iterative Broadening (IB), can be seen as special cases of DBS. First
we present a tuning of DBS that visits the same search nodes as IB, but avoids
restarts. Then we compare both theoretically and computationally DBS and LDS
using the same heuristic. We prove that DBS has a higher probability of being
successful than LDS on a comparable number of nodes, under realistic
assumptions. Experiments on a constraint satisfaction problem and an
optimization problem show that DBS is indeed very effective if compared to LDS.

 <dc:description>  Constraint programming uses enumeration and search tree pruning to solve
combinatorial optimization problems. In order to speed up this solution
process, we investigate the use of semidefinite relaxations within constraint
programming. In principle, we use the solution of a semidefinite relaxation to
guide the traversal of the search tree, using a limited discrepancy search
strategy. Furthermore, a semidefinite relaxation produces a bound for the
solution value, which is used to prune parts of the search tree. Experimental
results on stable set and maximum clique problem instances show that constraint
programming can indeed greatly benefit from semidefinite relaxations.

 <dc:description>  Solution techniques for Constraint Satisfaction and Optimisation Problems
often make use of backtrack search methods, exploiting variable and value
ordering heuristics. In this paper, we propose and analyse a very simple method
to apply in case the value ordering heuristic produces ties: postponing the
branching decision. To this end, we group together values in a tie, branch on
this sub-domain, and defer the decision among them to lower levels of the
search tree. We show theoretically and experimentally that this simple
modification can dramatically improve the efficiency of the search strategy.
Although in practise similar methods may have been applied already, to our
knowledge, no empirical or theoretical study has been proposed in the
literature to identify when and to what extent this strategy should be used.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm that achieves hyper-arc consistency for the
soft alldifferent constraint. To this end, we prove and exploit the equivalence
with a minimum-cost flow problem. Consistency of the constraint can be checked
in O(nm) time, and hyper-arc consistency is achieved in O(m) time, where n is
the number of variables involved and m is the sum of the cardinalities of the
domains. It improves a previous method that did not ensure hyper-arc
consistency.

 <dc:title>Reduced cost-based ranking for generating promising subproblems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an effective search procedure that interleaves two
steps: subproblem generation and subproblem solution. We mainly focus on the
first part. It consists of a variable domain value ranking based on reduced
costs. Exploiting the ranking, we generate, in a Limited Discrepancy Search
tree, the most promising subproblems first. An interesting result is that
reduced costs provide a very precise ranking that allows to almost always find
the optimal solution in the first generated subproblem, even if its dimension
is significantly smaller than that of the original problem. Concerning the
proof of optimality, we exploit a way to increase the lower bound for
subproblems at higher discrepancies. We show experimental results on the TSP
and its time constrained variant to show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach, but the technique could be generalized for other problems.

 <dc:description>  We show that the decidability of the first-order theory of the language that
combines Boolean algebras of sets of uninterpreted elements with Presburger
arithmetic operations. We thereby disprove a recent conjecture that this theory
is undecidable. Our language allows relating the cardinalities of sets to the
values of integer variables, and can distinguish finite and infinite sets. We
use quantifier elimination to show the decidability and obtain an elementary
upper bound on the complexity.
  Precise program analyses can use our decidability result to verify
representation invariants of data structures that use an integer field to
represent the number of stored elements.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows how a machine, which observes stimuli through an
uncharacterized, uncalibrated channel and sensor, can glean machine-independent
information (i.e., channel- and sensor-independent information) about the
stimuli. First, we demonstrate that a machine defines a specific coordinate
system on the stimulus state space, with the nature of that coordinate system
depending on the device's channel and sensor. Thus, machines with different
channels and sensors &quot;see&quot; the same stimulus trajectory through state space,
but in different machine-specific coordinate systems. For a large variety of
physical stimuli, statistical properties of that trajectory endow the stimulus
configuration space with differential geometric structure (a metric and
parallel transfer procedure), which can then be used to represent relative
stimulus configurations in a coordinate-system-independent manner (and,
therefore, in a channel- and sensor-independent manner). The resulting
description is an &quot;inner&quot; property of the stimulus time series in the sense
that it does not depend on extrinsic factors like the observer's choice of a
coordinate system in which the stimulus is viewed (i.e., the observer's choice
of channel and sensor). This methodology is illustrated with analytic examples
and with a numerically simulated experiment. In an intelligent sensory device,
this kind of representation &quot;engine&quot; could function as a &quot;front-end&quot; that
passes channel/sensor-independent stimulus representations to a pattern
recognition module. After a pattern recognizer has been trained in one of these
devices, it could be used without change in other devices having different
channels and sensors.

  the proposed method, have been added to the version submitted on October 27,

 <dc:description>  Computer infections such as viruses and worms spread over networks of
contacts between computers, with different types of networks being exploited by
different types of infections. Here we analyze the structures of several of
these networks, exploring their implications for modes of spread and the
control of infection. We argue that vaccination strategies that focus on a
limited number of network nodes, whether targeted or randomly chosen, are in
many cases unlikely to be effective. An alternative dynamic mechanism for the
control of contagion, called throttling, is introduced and argued to be
effective under a range of conditions.

 <dc:description>  We extend answer set semantics to deal with inconsistent programs (containing
classical negation), by finding a ``best'' answer set. Within the context of
inconsistent programs, it is natural to have a partial order on rules,
representing a preference for satisfying certain rules, possibly at the cost of
violating less important ones. We show that such a rule order induces a natural
order on extended answer sets, the minimal elements of which we call preferred
answer sets. We characterize the expressiveness of the resulting semantics and
show that it can simulate negation as failure, disjunction and some other
formalisms such as logic programs with ordered disjunction. The approach is
shown to be useful in several application areas, e.g. repairing database, where
minimal repairs correspond to preferred answer sets.

 <dc:description>  Hybrid systems are characterized by the hybrid evolution of their state: A
part of the state changes discretely, the other part changes continuously over
time. Typically, modern control applications belong to this class of systems,
where a digital controller interacts with a physical environment. In this
article we illustrate how a combination of the formal method VDM and the
computer algebra system Mathematica can be used to model and simulate both
aspects: the control logic and the physics involved. A new Mathematica package
emulating VDM-SL has been developed that allows the integration of differential
equation systems into formal specifications. The SAFER example from Kelly
(1997) serves to demonstrate the new simulation capabilities Mathematica adds:
After the thruster selection process, the astronaut's actual position and
velocity is calculated by numerically solving Euler's and Newton's equations
for rotation and translation. Furthermore, interactive validation is supported
by a graphical user interface and data animation.

 <dc:title>Bug shallowness in open-source, Macintosh software</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Worley III, G Gordon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Central to the power of open-source software is bug shallowness, the relative
ease of finding and fixing bugs. The open-source movement began with Unix
software, so many users were also programmers capable of finding and fixing
bugs given the source code. But as the open-source movement reaches the
Macintosh platform, bugs may not be shallow because few Macintosh users are
programmers. Based on reports from open-source developers, I, however, conclude
that that bugs are as shallow in open-source, Macintosh software as in any
other open-source software.

 <dc:description>  We present two add-ons for Mathematica for teaching mathematics to
undergraduate and high school students. These two applications, M@th Desktop
(MD) and M@th Desktop Tools (MDTools), include several palettes and notebooks
covering almost every field. The underlying didactic concept is so-called
&quot;blended learning&quot;, in which these tools are meant to be used as a complement
to the professor or teacher rather than as a replacement, which other
e-learning applications do. They enable students to avoid the usual problem of
computer-based learning, namely that too large an amount of time is wasted
struggling with computer and program errors instead of actually learning the
mathematical concepts.
  M@th Desktop Tools is palette-based and provides easily accessible and
user-friendly templates for the most important functions in the fields of
Analysis, Algebra, Linear Algebra and Statistics. M@th Desktop, in contrast, is
a modern, interactive teaching and learning software package for mathematics
classes. It is comprised of modules for Differentiation, Integration, and
Statistics, and each module presents its topic with a combination of
interactive notebooks and palettes.
  Both packages can be obtained from Deltasoft's homepage at

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the architecture of MOSE (My Own Search Engine), a
scalable parallel and distributed engine for searching the web. MOSE was
specifically designed to efficiently exploit affordable parallel architectures,
such as clusters of workstations. Its modular and scalable architecture can
easily be tuned to fulfill the bandwidth requirements of the application at
hand. Both task-parallel and data-parallel approaches are exploited within MOSE
in order to increase the throughput and efficiently use communication, storing
and computational resources. We used a collection of html documents as a
benchmark, and conducted preliminary experiments on a cluster of three SMP
Linux PCs.

 <dc:description>  The recently initiated approach called computability logic is a formal theory
of interactive computation. See a comprehensive online source on the subject at
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~giorgi/cl.html . The present paper contains a
soundness and completeness proof for the deductive system CL3 which axiomatizes
the most basic first-order fragment of computability logic called the
finite-depth, elementary-base fragment. Among the potential application areas
for this result are the theory of interactive computation, constructive applied
theories, knowledgebase systems, systems for resource-bound planning and
action. This paper is self-contained as it reintroduces all relevant
definitions as well as main motivations.

 <dc:title>PELCR: Parallel Environment for Optimal Lambda-Calculus Reduction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this article we present the implementation of an environment supporting
L\'evy's \emph{optimal reduction} for the $\lambda$-calculus \cite{Lev78} on
parallel (or distributed) computing systems. In a similar approach to Lamping's
one in \cite{Lamping90}, we base our work on a graph reduction technique known
as \emph{directed virtual reduction} \cite{DPR97} which is actually a
restriction of Danos-Regnier virtual reduction \cite{DanosRegnier93}.
  The environment, which we refer to as PELCR (Parallel Environment for optimal
Lambda-Calculus Reduction) relies on a strategy for directed virtual reduction,
namely {\em half combustion}, which we introduce in this article. While
developing PELCR we have adopted both a message aggregation technique, allowing
a reduction of the communication overhead, and a fair policy for distributing
dynamically originated load among processors.
  We also present an experimental study demonstrating the ability of PELCR to
definitely exploit parallelism intrinsic to $\lambda$-terms while performing
the reduction. By the results we show how PELCR allows achieving up to 70/80%
of the ideal speedup on last generation multiprocessor computing systems. As a
last note, the software modules have been developed with the {\tt C} language
and using a standard interface for message passing, i.e. MPI, thus making PELCR
itself a highly portable software package.

 <dc:title>On the hardness of distinguishing mixed-state quantum computations</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the following problem. Two mixed-state quantum circuits
Q and R are given, and the goal is to determine which of two possibilities
holds: (i) Q and R act nearly identically on all possible quantum state inputs,
or (ii) there exists some input state that Q and R transform into almost
perfectly distinguishable outputs. This problem may be viewed as an abstraction
of the following problem: given two physical processes described by sequences
of local interactions, are the processes effectively the same or are they
different? We prove that this problem is a complete promise problem for the
class QIP of problems having quantum interactive proof systems, and is
therefore PSPACE-hard. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that the analogous
problem for classical (probabilistic) circuits is in AM, and for unitary
quantum circuits is in QMA.

 <dc:description>  Solomonoff's central result on induction is that the posterior of a universal
semimeasure M converges rapidly and with probability 1 to the true sequence
generating posterior mu, if the latter is computable. Hence, M is eligible as a
universal sequence predictor in case of unknown mu. Despite some nearby results
and proofs in the literature, the stronger result of convergence for all
(Martin-Loef) random sequences remained open. Such a convergence result would
be particularly interesting and natural, since randomness can be defined in
terms of M itself. We show that there are universal semimeasures M which do not
converge for all random sequences, i.e. we give a partial negative answer to
the open problem. We also provide a positive answer for some non-universal
semimeasures. We define the incomputable measure D as a mixture over all
computable measures and the enumerable semimeasure W as a mixture over all
enumerable nearly-measures. We show that W converges to D and D to mu on all
random sequences. The Hellinger distance measuring closeness of two
distributions plays a central role.

 <dc:description>  This paper gives processor-allocation algorithms for minimizing the average
number of communication hops between the assigned processors for grid
architectures, in the presence of occupied cells. The simpler problem of
assigning processors on a free grid has been studied by Karp, McKellar, and
Wong who show that the solutions have nontrivial structure; they left open the
complexity of the problem.
  The associated clustering problem is as follows: Given n points in Re^d, find
k points that minimize their average pairwise L1 distance. We present a natural
approximation algorithm and show that it is a 7/4-approximation for 2D grids.
For d-dimensional space, the approximation guarantee is 2-(1/2d), which is
tight. We also give a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for constant
dimension d, and report on experimental results.

 <dc:title>Tight bounds for LDPC and LDGM codes under MAP decoding</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Montanari, Andrea</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Condensed Matter - Disordered Systems and Neural Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new method for analyzing low density parity check (LDPC) codes and low
density generator matrix (LDGM) codes under bit maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) decoding is introduced. The method is based on a rigorous
approach to spin glasses developed by Francesco Guerra. It allows to construct
lower bounds on the entropy of the transmitted message conditional to the
received one. Based on heuristic statistical mechanics calculations, we
conjecture such bounds to be tight. The result holds for standard irregular
ensembles when used over binary input output symmetric channels. The method is
first developed for Tanner graph ensembles with Poisson left degree
distribution. It is then generalized to `multi-Poisson' graphs, and, by a
completion procedure, to arbitrary degree distribution.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a concept of similarity between vertices of directed graphs. Let
G_A and G_B be two directed graphs. We define a similarity matrix whose (i,
j)-th real entry expresses how similar vertex j (in G_A) is to vertex i (in
G_B. The similarity matrix can be obtained as the limit of the normalized even
iterates of a linear transformation. In the special case where G_A=G_B=G, the
matrix is square and the (i, j)-th entry is the similarity score between the
vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg's &quot;hub and authority&quot; method
to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case
of our definition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a
unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our
similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a
non-negative matrix. Potential applications of our similarity concept are
numerous. We illustrate an application for the automatic extraction of synonyms
in a monolingual dictionary.

 <dc:description>  Monitoring and information services form a key component of a distributed

the performance limitations, advise in the deployment of the monitoring system,
and help evaluate future development work. To this end, we examined the
performance of the Globus Toolkit(reg. trdmrk) Monitoring and Discovery Service
(MDS2) by instrumenting its main services using NetLogger. Our study shows a
strong advantage to caching or prefetching the data, as well as the need to
have primary components at well-connected sites.

base intact, unfold the sides outward, splayed around the base, and attach the

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the National Research Council (NRC) Word Sense
Disambiguation (WSD) system, as applied to the English Lexical Sample (ELS)
task in Senseval-3. The NRC system approaches WSD as a classical supervised
machine learning problem, using familiar tools such as the Weka machine
learning software and Brill's rule-based part-of-speech tagger. Head words are
represented as feature vectors with several hundred features. Approximately
half of the features are syntactic and the other half are semantic. The main
novelty in the system is the method for generating the semantic features, based
on word \hbox{co-occurrence} probabilities. The probabilities are estimated
using the Waterloo MultiText System with a corpus of about one terabyte of
unlabeled text, collected by a web crawler.

 <dc:description>  After an introduction to the sequential version of FORM and the mechanisms
behind, we report on the status of our project of parallelization. We have now
a parallel version of FORM running on Cluster- and SMP-architectures. This
version can be used to run arbitrary FORM programs in parallel.

 <dc:description>  The semantic Web initiates new, high level access schemes to online content
and applications. One area of superior need for a redefined content exploration
is given by on-line educational applications and their concepts of
interactivity in the framework of open hypermedia systems. In the present paper
we discuss aspects and opportunities of gaining interactivity schemes from
semantic notions of components. A transition from standard educational
annotation to semantic statements of hyperlinks is discussed. Further on we
introduce the concept of semantic link contexts as an approach to manage a
coherent rhetoric of linking. A practical implementation is introduced, as
well. Our semantic hyperlink implementation is based on the more general
Multimedia Information Repository MIR, an open hypermedia system supporting the
standards XML, Corba and JNDI.

 <dc:description>  Emerging mobility standards within the next generation Internet Protocol,
IPv6, promise to continuously operate devices roaming between IP networks.
Associated with the paradigm of ubiquitous computing and communication, network
technology is on the spot to deliver voice and videoconferencing as a standard
internet solution. However, current roaming procedures are too slow, to remain
seamless for real-time applications. Multicast mobility still waits for a
convincing design. This paper investigates the temporal behaviour of mobile
IPv6 with dedicated focus on topological impacts. Extending the hierarchical
mobile IPv6 approach we suggest protocol improvements for a continuous
handover, which may serve bidirectional multicast communication, as well. Along
this line a multicast mobility concept is introduced as a service for clients
and sources, as they are of dedicated importance in multipoint conferencing
applications. The mechanisms introduced do not rely on assumptions of any
specific multicast routing protocol in use.

 <dc:title>Multi-Embedding of Metric Spaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bartal, Yair</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mendel, Manor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Metric embedding has become a common technique in the design of algorithms.
Its applicability is often dependent on how high the embedding's distortion is.
For example, embedding finite metric space into trees may require linear
distortion as a function of its size. Using probabilistic metric embeddings,
the bound on the distortion reduces to logarithmic in the size.
  We make a step in the direction of bypassing the lower bound on the
distortion in terms of the size of the metric. We define &quot;multi-embeddings&quot; of
metric spaces in which a point is mapped onto a set of points, while keeping
the target metric of polynomial size and preserving the distortion of paths.
The distortion obtained with such multi-embeddings into ultrametrics is at most
O(log Delta loglog Delta) where Delta is the aspect ratio of the metric. In
particular, for expander graphs, we are able to obtain constant distortion
embeddings into trees in contrast with the Omega(log n) lower bound for all
previous notions of embeddings.
  We demonstrate the algorithmic application of the new embeddings for two
optimization problems: group Steiner tree and metrical task systems.

 <dc:description>  While eLearning systems become more and more popular in daily education,
available applications lack opportunities to structure, annotate and manage
their contents in a high-level fashion. General efforts to improve these
deficits are taken by initiatives to define rich meta data sets and a
semanticWeb layer. In the present paper we introduce Hylos, an online learning
system. Hylos is based on a cellular eLearning Object (ELO) information model
encapsulating meta data conforming to the LOM standard. Content management is
provisioned on this semantic meta data level and allows for variable,
dynamically adaptable access structures. Context aware multifunctional links
permit a systematic navigation depending on the learners and didactic needs,
thereby exploring the capabilities of the semantic web. Hylos is built upon the
more general Multimedia Information Repository (MIR) and the MIR adaptive
context linking environment (MIRaCLE), its linking extension. MIR is an open
system supporting the standards XML, Corba and JNDI. Hylos benefits from
manageable information structures, sophisticated access logic and high-level
authoring tools like the ELO editor responsible for the semi-manual creation of
meta data and WYSIWYG like content editing.

 <dc:description>  In recent times online educational applications more and more are requested
to provide self-consistent learning offers for students at the university
level. Consequently they need to cope with the wide range of complexity and
interrelations university course teaching brings along. An urgent need to
overcome simplistically linked HTMLc ontent pages becomes apparent. In the
present paper we discuss a schematic concept of educational content
construction from information cells and introduce its implementation on the
storage and runtime layer. Starting from cells content is annotated according
to didactic needs, structured for dynamic arrangement, dynamically decorated
with hyperlinks and, as all works are based on XML, open to any presentation
layer. Data can be variably accessed through URIs built on semantic path-names
and edited via an adaptive authoring toolbox. Our content management approach
is based on the more general Multimedia Information Repository MIR. and allows
for personalisation, as well. MIR is an open system supporting the standards
XML, Corba and JNDI.

 <dc:description>  We consider a the general online convex optimization framework introduced by
Zinkevich. In this setting, there is a sequence of convex functions. Each
period, we must choose a signle point (from some feasible set) and pay a cost
equal to the value of the next function on our chosen point. Zinkevich shows
that, if the each function is revealed after the choice is made, then one can
achieve vanishingly small regret relative the best single decision chosen in
hindsight.
  We extend this to the bandit setting where we do not find out the entire
functions but rather just their value at our chosen point. We show how to get
vanishingly small regret in this setting.
  Our approach uses a simple approximation of the gradient that is computed
from evaluating a function at a single (random) point. We show that this
estimate is sufficient to mimic Zinkevich's gradient descent online analysis,
with access to the gradient (only being able to evaluate the function at a
single point).

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study codes on graphs combined with an iterative message passing algorithm
for quantization. Specifically, we consider the binary erasure quantization
(BEQ) problem which is the dual of the binary erasure channel (BEC) coding
problem. We show that duals of capacity achieving codes for the BEC yield codes
which approach the minimum possible rate for the BEQ. In contrast, low density
parity check codes cannot achieve the minimum rate unless their density grows
at least logarithmically with block length. Furthermore, we show that duals of
efficient iterative decoding algorithms for the BEC yield efficient encoding
algorithms for the BEQ. Hence our results suggest that graphical models may
yield near optimal codes in source coding as well as in channel coding and that
duality plays a key role in such constructions.

 <dc:description>  Mobility support in IPv6 networks is ready for release as an RFC, stimulating
major discussions on improvements to meet real-time communication requirements.
Sprawling hot spots of IP-only wireless networks at the same time await voice
and videoconferencing as standard mobile Internet services, thereby adding the
request for multicast support to real-time mobility. This paper briefly
introduces current approaches for seamless multicast extensions to Mobile IPv6.
Key issues of multicast mobility are discussed. Both analytically and in
simulations comparisons are drawn between handover performance characteristics,
dedicating special focus on the M-HMIPv6 approach.

 <dc:title>A Simple Proportional Conflict Redistribution Rule</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One proposes a first alternative rule of combination to WAO (Weighted Average
Operator) proposed recently by Josang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe, called
Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule (denoted PCR1). PCR1 and WAO are
particular cases of WO (the Weighted Operator) because the conflicting mass is
redistributed with respect to some weighting factors. In this first PCR rule,
the proportionalization is done for each non-empty set with respect to the
non-zero sum of its corresponding mass matrix - instead of its mass column
average as in WAO, but the results are the same as Ph. Smets has pointed out.
Also, we extend WAO (which herein gives no solution) for the degenerate case
when all column sums of all non-empty sets are zero, and then the conflicting
mass is transferred to the non-empty disjunctive form of all non-empty sets
together; but if this disjunctive form happens to be empty, then one considers
an open world (i.e. the frame of discernment might contain new hypotheses) and
thus all conflicting mass is transferred to the empty set. In addition to WAO,
we propose a general formula for PCR1 (WAO for non-degenerate cases).

 <dc:description>  Gaze detection and head orientation are an important part of many advanced
human-machine interaction applications. Many systems have been proposed for
gaze detection. Typically, they require some form of user cooperation and
calibration. Additionally, they may require multiple cameras and/or restricted
head positions. We present a new approach for inference of both face
orientation and gaze direction from a single image with no restrictions on the
head position. Our algorithm is based on a face and eye model, deduced from
anthropometric data. This approach allows us to use a single camera and
requires no cooperation from the user. Using a single image avoids the
complexities associated with of a multi-camera system. Evaluation tests show
that our system is accurate, fast and can be used in a variety of applications,
including ones where the user is unaware of the system.

 <dc:description>  We present a new role system for specifying changing referencing
relationships of heap objects. The role of an object depends, in large part, on
its aliasing relationships with other objects, with the role of each object
changing as its aliasing relationships change. Roles therefore capture
important object and data structure properties and provide useful information
about how the actions of the program interact with these properties. Our role
system enables the programmer to specify the legal aliasing relationships that
define the set of roles that objects may play, the roles of procedure
parameters and object fields, and the role changes that procedures perform
while manipulating objects. We present an interprocedural, compositional, and
context-sensitive role analysis algorithm that verifies that a program respects
the role constraints.

 <dc:description>  We introduce regular graph constraints and explore their decidability
properties. The motivation for regular graph constraints is 1) type checking of
changing types of objects in the presence of linked data structures, 2) shape
analysis techniques, and 3) generalization of similar constraints over trees
and grids. We define a subclass of graphs called heaps as an abstraction of the
data structures that a program constructs during its execution. We prove that
determining the validity of implication for regular graph constraints over the
class of heaps is undecidable. We show undecidability by exhibiting a
characterization of certain &quot;corresponder graphs&quot; in terms of presence and
absence of homomorphisms to a finite number of fixed graphs. The undecidability
of implication of regular graph constraints implies that there is no algorithm
that will verify that procedure preconditions are met or that the invariants
are maintained when these properties are expressed in any specification
language at least as expressive as regular graph constraints.

 <dc:description>  We show that the first-order theory of structural subtyping of non-recursive
types is decidable. Let $\Sigma$ be a language consisting of function symbols
(representing type constructors) and $C$ a decidable structure in the
relational language $L$ containing a binary relation $\leq$. $C$ represents
primitive types; $\leq$ represents a subtype ordering. We introduce the notion
of $\Sigma$-term-power of $C$, which generalizes the structure arising in
structural subtyping. The domain of the $\Sigma$-term-power of $C$ is the set
of $\Sigma$-terms over the set of elements of $C$. We show that the
decidability of the first-order theory of $C$ implies the decidability of the
first-order theory of the $\Sigma$-term-power of $C$. Our decision procedure
makes use of quantifier elimination for term algebras and Feferman-Vaught
theorem. Our result implies the decidability of the first-order theory of
structural subtyping of non-recursive types.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient and practical lock-free implementation of a
concurrent deque that is disjoint-parallel accessible and uses atomic
primitives which are available in modern computer systems. Previously known
lock-free algorithms of deques are either based on non-available atomic
synchronization primitives, only implement a subset of the functionality, or
are not designed for disjoint accesses. Our algorithm is based on a doubly
linked list, and only requires single-word compare-and-swap atomic primitives,
even for dynamic memory sizes. We have performed an empirical study using full
implementations of the most efficient algorithms of lock-free deques known. For
systems with low concurrency, the algorithm by Michael shows the best
performance. However, as our algorithm is designed for disjoint accesses, it
performs significantly better on systems with high concurrency and non-uniform
memory architecture.

 <dc:description>  A variable-length code is a fix-free code if no codeword is a prefix or a
suffix of any other codeword. In a fix-free code any finite sequence of
codewords can be decoded in both directions, which can improve the robustness
to channel noise and speed up the decoding process. In this paper we prove a
new sufficient condition of the existence of fix-free codes and improve the
upper bound on the redundancy of optimal fix-free codes.

 <dc:description>  We present role logic, a notation for describing properties of relational
structures in shape analysis, databases, and knowledge bases. We construct role
logic using the ideas of de Bruijn's notation for lambda calculus, an encoding
of first-order logic in lambda calculus, and a simple rule for implicit
arguments of unary and binary predicates. The unrestricted version of role
logic has the expressive power of first-order logic with transitive closure.
Using a syntactic restriction on role logic formulas, we identify a natural
fragment RL^2 of role logic. We show that the RL^2 fragment has the same
expressive power as two-variable logic with counting C^2 and is therefore
decidable. We present a translation of an imperative language into the
decidable fragment RL^2, which allows compositional verification of programs
that manipulate relational structures. In addition, we show how RL^2 encodes
boolean shape analysis constraints and an expressive description logic.

 <dc:description>  We have previously introduced role logic as a notation for describing
properties of relational structures in shape analysis, databases and knowledge
bases. A natural fragment of role logic corresponds to two-variable logic with
counting and is therefore decidable. We show how to use role logic to describe
open and closed records, as well the dual of records, inverse records. We
observe that the spatial conjunction operation of separation logic naturally
models record concatenation. Moreover, we show how to eliminate the spatial
conjunction of formulas of quantifier depth one in first-order logic with
counting. As a result, allowing spatial conjunction of formulas of quantifier
depth one preserves the decidability of two-variable logic with counting. This
result applies to two-variable role logic fragment as well. The resulting logic
smoothly integrates type system and predicate calculus notation and can be
viewed as a natural generalization of the notation for constraints arising in
role analysis and similar shape analysis approaches.

  Management</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a class of sensor networks where the data is not
required in real-time by an observer; for example, a sensor network monitoring
a scientific phenomenon for later play back and analysis. In such networks, the
data must be stored in the network. Thus, in addition to battery power, storage
is a primary resource: the useful lifetime of the network is constrained by its
ability to store the generated data samples. We explore the use of
collaborative storage technique to efficiently manage data in storage
constrained sensor networks. The proposed collaborative storage technique takes
advantage of spatial correlation among the data collected by nearby sensors to
significantly reduce the size of the data near the data sources. We show that
the proposed approach provides significant savings in the size of the stored
data vs. local buffering, allowing the network to run for a longer time without
running out of storage space and reducing the amount of data that will
eventually be relayed to the observer. In addition, collaborative storage
performs load balancing of the available storage space if data generation rates
are not uniform across sensors (as would be the case in an event driven sensor
network), or if the available storage varies across the network.

 <dc:description>  Future smart environments will be characterized by multiple nodes that sense,
collect, and disseminate information about environmental phenomena through a
wireless network. In this paper, we define a set of applications that require a
new form of distributed knowledge about the environment, referred to as
non-uniform information granularity. By non-uniform information granularity we
mean that the required accuracy or precision of information is proportional to
the distance between a source node (information producer) and current sink node
(information consumer). That is, as the distance between the source node and
sink node increases, loss in information precision is acceptable. Applications
that can benefit from this type of knowledge range from battlefield scenarios
to rescue operations. The main objectives of this paper are two-fold: first, we
will precisely define non-uniform information granularity, and second, we will
describe different protocols that achieve non-uniform information dissemination
and analyze these protocols based on complexity, energy consumption, and
accuracy of information.

 <dc:subject>D.3.4 Optimization</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we discuss the optimizing compilation of Constraint Handling
Rules (CHRs). CHRs are a multi-headed committed choice constraint language,
commonly applied for writing incremental constraint solvers. CHRs are usually
implemented as a language extension that compiles to the underlying language.
In this paper we show how we can use different kinds of information in the
compilation of CHRs in order to obtain access efficiency, and a better
translation of the CHR rules into the underlying language, which in this case
is HAL. The kinds of information used include the types, modes, determinism,
functional dependencies and symmetries of the CHR constraints. We also show how
to analyze CHR programs to determine this information about functional
dependencies, symmetries and other kinds of information supporting
optimizations.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an efficient algorithm for the incremental construction
of a minimal acyclic sequential transducer (ST) for a dictionary consisting of
a list of input and output strings. The algorithm generalises a known method of
constructing minimal finite-state automata (Daciuk et al. 2000). Unlike the
algorithm published by Mihov and Maurel (2001), it does not require the input
strings to be sorted. The new method is illustrated by an application to
pronunciation dictionaries.

 <dc:title>CHR Grammars</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Christiansen, Henning</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A grammar formalism based upon CHR is proposed analogously to the way
Definite Clause Grammars are defined and implemented on top of Prolog. These
grammars execute as robust bottom-up parsers with an inherent treatment of
ambiguity and a high flexibility to model various linguistic phenomena. The
formalism extends previous logic programming based grammars with a form of
context-sensitive rules and the possibility to include extra-grammatical
hypotheses in both head and body of grammar rules. Among the applications are
straightforward implementations of Assumption Grammars and abduction under
integrity constraints for language analysis. CHR grammars appear as a powerful
tool for specification and implementation of language processors and may be
proposed as a new standard for bottom-up grammars in logic programming.

graph theory to have new connections to analysis. For example, our framework
gives rise to many new partial differential equations on graphs, most notably a
new (Laplacian based) wave equation; this wave equation gives rise to a partial
improvement on the Chung-Faber-Manteuffel diameter/eigenvalue bound in graph
theory, and the Chung-Grigoryan-Yau and (in a certain case) Bobkov-Ledoux
distance/eigenvalue bounds in analysis. Our framework also allows most
techniques for the non-linear p-Laplacian in analysis to be easily carried over
to graph theory.

 <dc:title>The Revolution In Database System Architecture</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gray, Jim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Database system architectures are undergoing revolutionary changes.
Algorithms and data are being unified by integrating programming languages with
the database system. This gives an extensible object-relational system where
non-procedural relational operators manipulate object sets. Coupled with this,
each DBMS is now a web service. This has huge implications for how we structure
applications. DBMSs are now object containers. Queues are the first objects to
be added. These queues are the basis for transaction processing and workflow
applica-tions. Future workflow systems are likely to be built on this core.
Data cubes and online analytic processing are now baked into most DBMSs. Beyond
that, DBMSs have a framework for data mining and machine learning algorithms.
Decision trees, Bayes nets, clustering, and time series analysis are built in;
new algorithms can be added. Text, temporal, and spatial data access methods,
along with their probabilistic reasoning have been added to database systems.
Allowing approximate and probabilistic answers is essential for many
applications. Many believe that XML and xQuery will be the main data structure
and access pattern. Database systems must accommodate that perspective.These
changes mandate a much more dynamic query optimization strategy. Intelligence
is moving to the periphery of the network. Each disk and each sensor will be a
competent database machine. Relational algebra is a convenient way to program
these systems. Database systems are now expected to be self-managing,
self-healing, and always-up.

 <dc:description>  We explored ways of doing spatial search within a relational database: (1)
hierarchical triangular mesh (a tessellation of the sphere), (2) a zoned
bucketing system, and (3) representing areas as disjunctive-normal form
constraints. Each of these approaches has merits. They all allow efficient
point-in-region queries. A relational representation for regions allows Boolean
operations among them and allows quick tests for point-in-region,
regions-containing-point, and region-overlap. The speed of these algorithms is
much improved by a zone and multi-scale zone-pyramid scheme. The approach has
the virtue that the zone mechanism works well on B-Trees native to all SQL
systems and integrates naturally with current query optimizers - rather than
requiring a new spatial access method and concomitant query optimizer
extensions. Over the last 5 years, we have used these techniques extensively in
our work on SkyServer.sdss.org, and SkyQuery.net.

 <dc:description>  Although recent works try to improve collective communication in grid systems
by separating intra and inter-cluster communication, the optimisation of
communications focus only on inter-cluster communications. We believe, instead,
that the overall performance of the application may be improved if
intra-cluster collective communications performance is known in advance. Hence,
it is important to have an accurate model of the intra-cluster collective
communications, which provides the necessary evidences to tune and to predict
their performance correctly. In this paper we present our experience on
modelling such communication strategies. We describe and compare different
implementation strategies with their communication models, evaluating the
models' accuracy and describing the practical challenges that can be found when
modelling collective communications.

 <dc:description>  Recently, many works focus on the implementation of collective communication
operations adapted to wide area computational systems, like computational Grids
or global-computing. Due to the inherently heterogeneity of such environments,
most works separate &quot;clusters&quot; in different hierarchy levels. to better model
the communication. However, in our opinion, such works do not give enough
attention to the delimitation of such clusters, as they normally use the
locality or the IP subnet from the machines to delimit a cluster without
verifying the &quot;homogeneity&quot; of such clusters. In this paper, we describe a
strategy to gather network information from different local-area networks and
to construct &quot;logical homogeneous clusters&quot;, better suited to the performance
modelling.

 <dc:description>  Recent works try to optimise collective communication in grid systems
focusing mostly on the optimisation of communications among different clusters.
We believe that intra-cluster collective communications should also be
optimised, as a way to improve the overall efficiency and to allow the
construction of multi-level collective operations. Indeed, inside homogeneous
clusters, a simple optimisation approach rely on the comparison from different
implementation strategies, through their communication models. In this paper we
evaluate this approach, comparing different implementation strategies with
their predicted performances. As a result, we are able to choose the
communication strategy that better adapts to each network environment.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing and controlling large distributed services under a wide range of
conditions is difficult. Yet these capabilities are essential to a number of
important development and operational tasks such as benchmarking, testing, and
system management. To facilitate these tasks, we have built the Application
Control and Monitoring Environment (ACME), a scalable, flexible infrastructure
for monitoring, analyzing, and controlling Internet-scale systems. ACME
consists of two parts. ISING, the Internet Sensor In-Network agGregator,
queries sensors and aggregates the results as they are routed through an
overlay network. ENTRIE, the ENgine for TRiggering Internet Events, uses the
data streams supplied by ISING, in combination with a user's XML configuration
file, to trigger actuators such as killing processes during a robustness
benchmark or paging a system administrator when predefined anomalous conditions
are observed. In this paper we describe the design, implementation, and
evaluation of ACME and its constituent parts. We find that for a 512-node
system running atop an emulated Internet topology, ISING's use of in-network
aggregation can reduce end-to-end query-response latency by more than 50%
compared to using either direct network connections or the same overlay network
without aggregation. We also find that an untuned implementation of ACME can
invoke an actuator on one or all nodes in response to a discrete or aggregate
event in less than four seconds, and we illustrate ACME's applicability to
concrete benchmarking and monitoring scenarios.

 <dc:description>  The distributed transaction commit problem requires reaching agreement on
whether a transaction is committed or aborted. The classic Two-Phase Commit
protocol blocks if the coordinator fails. Fault-tolerant consensus algorithms
also reach agreement, but do not block whenever any majority of the processes
are working. Running a Paxos consensus algorithm on the commit/abort decision
of each participant yields a transaction commit protocol that uses 2F +1
coordinators and makes progress if at least F +1 of them are working. In the
fault-free case, this algorithm requires one extra message delay but has the
same stable-storage write delay as Two-Phase Commit. The classic Two-Phase
Commit algorithm is obtained as the special F = 0 case of the general Paxos
Commit algorithm.

 <dc:title>Multi-dimensional Type Theory: Rules, Categories, and Combinators for
  Syntax and Semantics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We investigate the possibility of modelling the syntax and semantics of
natural language by constraints, or rules, imposed by the multi-dimensional
type theory Nabla. The only multiplicity we explicitly consider is two, namely
one dimension for the syntax and one dimension for the semantics, but the
general perspective is important. For example, issues of pragmatics could be
handled as additional dimensions.
  One of the main problems addressed is the rather complicated repertoire of
operations that exists besides the notion of categories in traditional Montague
grammar. For the syntax we use a categorial grammar along the lines of Lambek.
For the semantics we use so-called lexical and logical combinators inspired by
work in natural logic. Nabla provides a concise interpretation and a sequent
calculus as the basis for implementations.

 <dc:description>  Fundamental results concerning the dynamics of abelian group codes
(behaviors) and their duals are developed. Duals of sequence spaces over
locally compact abelian groups may be defined via Pontryagin duality; dual
group codes are orthogonal subgroups of dual sequence spaces. The dual of a
complete code or system is finite, and the dual of a Laurent code or system is
(anti-)Laurent. If C and C^\perp are dual codes, then the state spaces of C act
as the character groups of the state spaces of C^\perp. The controllability
properties of C are the observability properties of C^\perp. In particular, C
is (strongly) controllable if and only if C^\perp is (strongly) observable, and
the controller memory of C is the observer memory of C^\perp. The controller
granules of C act as the character groups of the observer granules of C^\perp.
Examples of minimal observer-form encoder and syndrome-former constructions are
given. Finally, every observer granule of C is an &quot;end-around&quot; controller
granule of C.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor large
geographical areas inexpensively. Sensors, however, have significant power
constraint (battery life), making communication very expensive. Another
important issue in the context of sensor-based information systems is that
individual sensor readings are inherently unreliable. In order to address these
two aspects, sensor database systems like TinyDB and Cougar enable in-network
data aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improve reliability. The
existing data aggregation techniques, however, are limited to relatively simple
types of queries such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MIN/MAX. In this paper we propose
a data aggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries that
can be answered using sensor networks. These queries include (approximate)
quantiles, such as the median, the most frequent data values, such as the
consensus value, a histogram of the data distribution, as well as range
queries. In our scheme, each sensor aggregates the data it has received from
other sensors into a fixed (user specified) size message. We provide strict
theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the queries in terms of
the message size. We evaluate the performance of our aggregation scheme by
simulation and demonstrate its accuracy, scalability and low resource
utilization for highly variable input data sets.

 <dc:title>Hash sort: A linear time complexity multiple-dimensional sort algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gilreath, William F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sorting and hashing are two completely different concepts in computer
science, and appear mutually exclusive to one another. Hashing is a search
method using the data as a key to map to the location within memory, and is
used for rapid storage and retrieval. Sorting is a process of organizing data
from a random permutation into an ordered arrangement, and is a common activity
performed frequently in a variety of applications.
  Almost all conventional sorting algorithms work by comparison, and in doing
so have a linearithmic greatest lower bound on the algorithmic time complexity.
Any improvement in the theoretical time complexity of a sorting algorithm can
result in overall larger gains in implementation performance.. A gain in
algorithmic performance leads to much larger gains in speed for the application
that uses the sort algorithm. Such a sort algorithm needs to use an alternative
method for ordering the data than comparison, to exceed the linearithmic time
complexity boundary on algorithmic performance.
  The hash sort is a general purpose non-comparison based sorting algorithm by
hashing, which has some interesting features not found in conventional sorting
algorithms. The hash sort asymptotically outperforms the fastest traditional
sorting algorithm, the quick sort. The hash sort algorithm has a linear time
complexity factor -- even in the worst case. The hash sort opens an area for
further work and investigation into alternative means of sorting.

 <dc:title>Fractal geometry of literature: first attempt to Shakespeare's works</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eftekhari, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It was demonstrated that there is a geometrical order in the structure of
literature. Fractal geometry as a modern mathematical approach and a new
geometrical viewpoint on natural objects including both processes and
structures was employed for analysis of literature. As the first study, the
works of William Shakespeare were chosen as the most important items in western
literature. By counting the number of letters applied in a manuscript, it is
possible to study the whole manuscript statistically. A novel method based on
basic assumption of fractal geometry was proposed for the calculation of
fractal dimensions of the literature. The results were compared with Zipf's
law. Zipf's law was successfully used for letters instead of words. Two new
concepts namely Zipf's dimension and Zipf's order were also introduced. It was
found that changes of both fractal dimension and Zipf's dimension are similar
and dependent on the manuscript length. Interestingly, direct plotting the data
obtained in semi-logarithmic and logarithmic forms also led to a power-law.

 <dc:description>  The ability of a sensor node to determine its physical location within a
network (Localization) is of fundamental importance in sensor networks.
Interpretating data from sensors will not be possible unless the context of the
data is known; this is most often accomplished by tracking its physical
location. Existing research has focused on localization in static sensor
networks where localization is a one-time (or low frequency) activity. In
contrast, this paper considers localization for mobile sensors: when sensors
are mobile, localization must be invoked periodically to enable the sensors to
track their location. The higher the frequency of localization, the lower the
error introduced because of mobility. However, localization is a costly
operation since it involves both communication and computation. In this paper,
we propose and investigate adaptive and predictive protocols that control the
frequency of localization based on sensor mobility behavior to reduce the
energy requirements for localization while bounding the localization error. We
show that such protocols can significantly reduce the localization energy
without sacrificing accuracy (in fact, improving accuracy for most situations).
Using simulation and analysis we explore the tradeoff between energy efficiency
and localization error due to mobility for several protocols.

 <dc:description>  Constructive dimension and constructive strong dimension are effectivizations
of the Hausdorff and packing dimensions, respectively. Each infinite binary
sequence A is assigned a dimension dim(A) in [0,1] and a strong dimension
Dim(A) in [0,1].
  Let DIM^alpha and DIMstr^alpha be the classes of all sequences of dimension
alpha and of strong dimension alpha, respectively. We show that DIM^0 is
properly Pi^0_2, and that for all Delta^0_2-computable alpha in (0,1],
DIM^alpha is properly Pi^0_3.
  To classify the strong dimension classes, we use a more powerful effective
Borel hierarchy where a co-enumerable predicate is used rather than a
enumerable predicate in the definition of the Sigma^0_1 level. For all
Delta^0_2-computable alpha in [0,1), we show that DIMstr^alpha is properly in
the Pi^0_3 level of this hierarchy. We show that DIMstr^1 is properly in the
Pi^0_2 level of this hierarchy.
  We also prove that the class of Schnorr random sequences and the class of
computably random sequences are properly Pi^0_3.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  FLUX is a programming method for the design of agents that reason logically
about their actions and sensor information in the presence of incomplete
knowledge. The core of FLUX is a system of Constraint Handling Rules, which
enables agents to maintain an internal model of their environment by which they
control their own behavior. The general action representation formalism of the
fluent calculus provides the formal semantics for the constraint solver. FLUX
exhibits excellent computational behavior due to both a carefully restricted
expressiveness and the inference paradigm of progression.

 <dc:description>  The synchronisation of Tree Parity Machines (TPMs), has proven to provide a
valuable alternative concept for secure symmetric key exchange. Yet, from a
cryptographer's point of view, authentication is at least as important as a
secure exchange of keys. Adding an authentication via hashing e.g. is
straightforward but with no relation to Neural Cryptography. We consequently
formulate an authenticated key exchange within this concept. Another
alternative, integrating a Zero-Knowledge protocol into the synchronisation, is
also presented. A Man-In-The-Middle attack and even all currently known
attacks, that are based on using identically structured TPMs and
synchronisation as well, can so be averted. This in turn has practical
consequences on using the trajectory in weight space. Both suggestions have the
advantage of not affecting the previously observed physics of this interacting
system at all.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a new breed of academic journals that use statistical
machine learning techniques to make them more democratic. In particular, not
only can anyone submit an article, but anyone can also become a reviewer.
Machine learning is used to decide which reviewers accurately represent the
views of the journal's readers and thus deserve to have their opinions carry
more weight. The paper concentrates on describing a specific experimental
prototype of a democratic journal called the Journal of New Democratic Methods
(JNDM). The paper also mentions the wider implications that machine learning
and the techniques used in the JNDM may have for representative democracy in
general.

probability distribution derived from the input vector, and the decoder is
implemented as a superposition of reconstruction vectors. This stochastic VQ
(SVQ) is optimised using a minimum mean Euclidean reconstruction distortion
criterion, as in the LBG case. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate
how this leads to self-organisation of the SVQ, where different stochastically
sampled code indices become associated with different input subspaces.

 <dc:description>  The theory of stochastic vector quantisers (SVQ) has been extended to allow
the quantiser to develop invariances, so that only &quot;large&quot; degrees of freedom
in the input vector are represented in the code. This has been applied to the
problem of encoding data vectors which are a superposition of a &quot;large&quot; jammer
and a &quot;small&quot; signal, so that only the jammer is represented in the code. This
allows the jammer to be subtracted from the total input vector (i.e. the jammer
is nulled), leaving a residual that contains only the underlying signal. The
main advantage of this approach to jammer nulling is that little prior
knowledge of the jammer is assumed, because these properties are automatically
discovered by the SVQ as it is trained on examples of input vectors.
