 <dc:description>  Gender recognition from unconstrained face images is a challenging task due
to the high degree of misalignment, pose, expression, and illumination
variation. In previous works, the recognition of gender from unconstrained face
images is approached by utilizing image alignment, exploiting multiple samples
per individual to improve the learning ability of the classifier, or learning
gender based on prior knowledge about pose and demographic distributions of the
dataset. However, image alignment increases the complexity and time of
computation, while the use of multiple samples or having prior knowledge about
data distribution is unrealistic in practical applications. This paper presents
an approach for gender recognition from unconstrained face images. Our
technique exploits the robustness of local feature descriptor to photometric
variations to extract the shape description of the 2D face image using a single
sample image per individual. The results obtained from experiments on Labeled
Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset describe the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The essence of this study is to investigate the most suitable functions
and parameter settings for recognizing gender from unconstrained face images.

 <dc:description>  Although deep learning models have proven effective at solving problems in
natural language processing, the mechanism by which they come to their
conclusions is often unclear. As a result, these models are generally treated
as black boxes, yielding no insight of the underlying learned patterns. In this
paper we consider Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and demonstrate a new
approach for tracking the importance of a given input to the LSTM for a given
output. By identifying consistently important patterns of words, we are able to
distill state of the art LSTMs on sentiment analysis and question answering
into a set of representative phrases. This representation is then
quantitatively validated by using the extracted phrases to construct a simple,
rule-based classifier which approximates the output of the LSTM.

 <dc:description>  In human societies, people's willingness to compete and strive for better
social status as well as being envious of those perceived in some way superior
lead to social structures that are intrinsically hierarchical. Here we propose
an agent-based, network model to mimic the ranking behaviour of individuals and
its possible repercussions in human society. The main ingredient of the model
is the assumption that the relevant feature of social interactions is each
individual's keenness to maximise his or her status relative to others. The
social networks produced by the model are homophilous and assortative, as
frequently observed in human communities and most of the network properties
seem quite independent of its size. However, it is seen that for small number
of agents the resulting network consists of disjoint weakly connected
communities while being highly assortative and homophilic. On the other hand
larger networks turn out to be more cohesive with larger communities but less
homophilic. We find that the reason for these changes is that larger network
size allows agents to use new strategies for maximizing their social status
allowing for more diverse links between them.

 <dc:title>Parallel algorithms for the Lopsided Lovasz Local Lemma</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLL) is a probabilistic tool which shows that, if a
collection of &quot;bad&quot; events $\mathcal B$ in a probability space are not too
likely and not too interdependent, then there is a positive probability that no
bad-events in $\mathcal B$ occur. Moser &amp; Tardos (2010) gave sequential and
parallel algorithms which transformed most applications of the
variable-assignment LLL into efficient algorithms.
  There has been limited success in developing parallel algorithms for more
generalized forms of the LLL. Harris (2016) developed RNC algorithms for the
variable-assignment Lopsided Lov\'asz Local Lemma (LLLL) and Harris &amp;
Srinivasan (2014) developed an algorithm for the permutation LLL. These
algorithms are cumbersome and limited in the types of bad-events they can
handle (limitations not shared for the standard LLL). Kolmogorov (2016)
developed a framework which partially parallelizes LLL settings such as random
matchings of $K_n$, although key algorithm components remained missing.
  We give new parallel algorithms for most forms of LLLL, which are simpler,
faster, and more general than the algorithms of Harris and Harris &amp; Srinivasan.
This also includes probability spaces for which no previous RNC algorithm was
known, including matchings and hamiltonian cycles of $K_n$. We achieve this by
providing a unified algebraic framework for applications of the LLLL to
permutations.
  The parallel LLLL algorithm is based on new primitive for parallel computing,
which we refer to as the \emph{lexicographically-first maximal-independent-set}
of a directed graph. We give an efficient algorithm for constructing this and
show that it is precisely what is needed for our LLLL algorithms. This
generalizes an algorithm given by Blelloch, Fineman, Shun (2012) for undirected
graphs.

 <dc:description>  Fisher-Vectors (FV) encode higher-order statistics of a set of multiple local
descriptors like SIFT features. They already show good performance in
combination with shallow learning architectures on visual recognitions tasks.
Current methods using FV as a feature descriptor in deep architectures assume
that all original input features are static. We propose a framework to jointly
learn the representation of original features, FV parameters and parameters of
the classifier in the style of traditional neural networks. Our proof of
concept implementation improves the performance of FV on the Pascal Voc 2007
challenge in a multi-GPU setting in comparison to a default SVM setting. We
demonstrate that FV can be embedded into neural networks at arbitrary
positions, allowing end-to-end training with back-propagation.

 <dc:title>A Modified Construction for a Support Vector Classifier to Accommodate

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a training set with binary classification, the Support Vector Machine
identifies the hyperplane maximizing the margin between the two classes of
training data. This general formulation is useful in that it can be applied
without regard to variance differences between the classes. Ignoring these
differences is not optimal, however, as the general SVM will give the class
with lower variance an unjustifiably wide berth. This increases the chance of
misclassification of the other class and results in an overall loss of
predictive performance. An alternate construction is proposed in which the
margins of the separating hyperplane are different for each class, each
proportional to the standard deviation of its class along the direction
perpendicular to the hyperplane. The construction agrees with the SVM in the
case of equal class variances. This paper will then examine the impact to the
dual representation of the modified constraint equations.

 <dc:title>Maximum Matching in Two, Three, and a Few More Passes Over Graph Streams</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kale, Sagar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tirodkar, Sumedh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the maximum matching problem in the semi-streaming model
formalized by Feigenbaum, Kannan, McGregor, Suri, and Zhang that is inspired by
giant graphs of today. As our main result, we give a two-pass $(1/2 +
1/16)$-approximation algorithm for triangle-free graphs and a two-pass $(1/2 +
1/32)$-approximation algorithm for general graphs; these improve the
approximation ratios of $1/2 + 1/52$ for bipartite graphs and $1/2 + 1/140$ for
general graphs by Konrad, Magniez, and Mathieu. In three passes, we achieve
approximation ratios of $1/2 + 1/10$ for triangle-free graphs and $1/2 +
1/19.753$ for general graphs. We also give a multi-pass algorithm where we
bound the number of passes precisely---we give a $(2/3
-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm that uses $2/(3\varepsilon)$ passes for
triangle-free graphs and $4/(3\varepsilon)$ passes for general graphs. Our
algorithms are simple and combinatorial, use $O(n \log n)$ space, and have
$O(1)$ update time per edge.
  For general graphs, our multi-pass algorithm improves the best known
deterministic algorithms in terms of the number of passes:
  --Ahn and Guha give a $(2/3 - \varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm that uses
$O(\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^2)$ passes, whereas our $(2/3 -
\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm uses $4/(3\varepsilon)$ passes;
  --they also give a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm that uses
$O(\log n \cdot \mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon))$ passes, where $n$ is the number
of vertices of the input graph; although our algorithm is $(2/3 -
\varepsilon)$-approximation, our number of passes do not depend on $n$.
  Earlier multi-pass algorithms either have a large constant inside big-$O$
notation for the number of passes or the constant cannot be determined due to
the involved analysis, so our multi-pass algorithm should use much fewer passes
for approximation ratios bounded slightly below $2/3$.

 <dc:title>Pilot Reuse Factor with Large Scale Fading Precoding for Massive MIMO</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The fundamental limitation of massive MIMO technology is pilot contamination
effect. This effect occurs during uplink training when terminals use the same
orthogonal signals. In this paper, a pilot reuse factor with large scale fading
precoding is proposed to mitigate the pilot contamination effect. The pilot
reuse factor is designed to assign unique orthogonal signals to the adjacent
cells. These unique orthogonal signals are reused only within the cell and
hence, intra-pilot contamination is the only concern. Large scale fading
precoding is then used to mitigate the intra-pilot contamination effect. The
average achievable sum rate is computed for different pilot reuse factors.
Experimental results through MATLAB simulation show that a higher pilot reuse
factor gives better average achievable sum rates.

 <dc:title>Design of Distributed Voting Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Meter, Christian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Countries like Estonia, Norway or Australia developed electronic voting
systems, which could be used to realize parliamentary elections with the help
of personal computers and the Internet. These systems are completely different
in their design and their way to solve the same problem. In this thesis, we
analyze some of the largest real-world systems, describe their building blocks
and their general design to focus on possible problems in these electronic
voting systems.
  Furthermore, we present a template for an e-voting system, which we designed
to try to fulfill the preliminaries and requirements of a secure electronic
voting system. We use the experiences and the building blocks of existing
systems to combine them to another more secure system. Afterwards, we compare
our concept with real-world systems to evaluate the fulfillments of the
requirements. Conclusively, we discuss the occurring problems when designing a
secure system.
  Peer-to-peer networks provide many advantages, like decentralization, which
might be applicable to electronic voting systems. Therefore, we take a look on
the distributed database called blockchain and the usage in a peer-to-peer
voting system. Our contribution to this topic is a modification of the
proof-of-stake, which enables the usage of common devices, like smartphones or
tablets, for the blockchain verification and inclusion of new ballots to the
chain. This proof does not need much computing power and has a lower carbon
footprint than the proof-of-work in the Bitcoin protocol.

presentation corpus containing humorous utterances based on TED talks. Compared
to previous data resources supporting humor recognition research, ours has
several advantages, including (a) both positive and negative instances coming
from a homogeneous data set, (b) containing a large number of speakers, and (c)
being open. Focusing on using lexical cues for humor recognition, we
systematically compare a newly emerging text classification method based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a well-established conventional
method using linguistic knowledge. The advantages of the CNN method are both
getting higher detection accuracies and being able to learn essential features
automatically.

 <dc:description>  As its price per bit drops, SSD is increasingly becoming the default storage
medium for cloud application databases. However, it has not become the
preferred storage medium for key-value caches, even though SSD offers more than
10x lower price per bit and sufficient performance compared to DRAM. This is
because key-value caches need to frequently insert, update and evict small
objects. This causes excessive writes and erasures on flash storage, since
flash only supports writes and erasures of large chunks of data. These
excessive writes and erasures significantly shorten the lifetime of flash,
rendering it impractical to use for key-value caches. We present Flashield, a
hybrid key-value cache that uses DRAM as a &quot;filter&quot; to minimize writes to SSD.
Flashield performs light-weight machine learning profiling to predict which
objects are likely to be read frequently before getting updated; these objects,
which are prime candidates to be stored on SSD, are written to SSD in large
chunks sequentially. In order to efficiently utilize the cache's available
memory, we design a novel in-memory index for the variable-sized objects stored
on flash that requires only 4 bytes per object in DRAM. We describe Flashield's
design and implementation and, we evaluate it on a real-world cache trace.
Compared to state-of-the-art systems that suffer a write amplification of 2.5x
or more, Flashield maintains a median write amplification of 0.5x without any
loss of hit rate or throughput.

 <dc:description>  Proof schemata are a variant of LK-proofs able to simulate various induction
schemes in first-order logic by adding so called proof links to the standard
first-order LK-calculus. Proof links allow proofs to reference proofs thus
giving proof schemata a recursive structure. Unfortunately, applying reductive
cut- elimination is non-trivial in the presence of proof links. Borrowing the
concept of lazy instantiation from functional programming, we evaluate proof
links locally allowing reductive cut-elimination to proceed past them. Though,
this method cannot be used to obtain cut-free proof schemata, we nonetheless
obtain important results concerning the schematic CERES method, that is a
method of cut-elimination for proof schemata based on resolution. In &quot;Towards a
clausal analysis of cut-elimination&quot;, it was shown that reductive
cut-elimination transforms a given LK-proof in such a way that a subsumption
relation holds between the pre- and post-transformation characteristic clause
sets, i.e. the clause set representing the cut-structure of an LK-proof. Let
CL(A') be the characteristic clause set of a normal form A' of an LK-proof A
that is reached by performing reductive cut-elimination on A without atomic cut
elimination. Then CL(A') is subsumed by all characteristic clause sets
extractable from any application of reductive cut-elimination to A. Such a
normal form is referred to as an ACNF top and plays an essential role in
methods of cut-elimination by resolution. These results can be extended to
proof schemata through our &quot;lazy instantiation&quot; of proof links, and provides an
essential step toward a complete cut-elimination method for proof schemata.

 <dc:title>Fidelity Lower Bounds for Stabilizer and CSS Quantum Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ashikhmin, Alexei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we estimate the fidelity of stabilizer and CSS codes. First, we
derive a lower bound on the fidelity of a stabilizer code via its quantum
enumerator. Next, we find the average quantum enumerators of the ensembles of
finite length stabilizer and CSS codes. We use the average quantum enumerators
for obtaining lower bounds on the average fidelity of these ensembles. We
further improve the fidelity bounds by estimating the quantum enumerators of
expurgated ensembles of stabilizer and CSS codes. Finally, we derive fidelity
bounds in the asymptotic regime when the code length tends to infinity.
  These results tell us which code rate we can afford for achieving a target
fidelity with codes of a given length. The results also show that in symmetric
depolarizing channel a typical stabilizer code has better performance, in terms
of fidelity and code rate, compared with a typical CSS codes, and that balanced
CSS codes significantly outperform other CSS codes. Asymptotic results
demonstrate that CSS codes have a fundamental performance loss compared to
stabilizer codes.

 <dc:description>  In many problems, agents cooperate locally so that a leader or fusion center
can infer the state of every agent from probing the state of only a small
number of agents. Versions of this problem arise when a fusion center
reconstructs an extended physical field by accessing the state of just a few of
the sensors measuring the field, or a leader monitors the formation of a team
of robots. Given a link cost, the paper presents a polynomial time algorithm to
design a minimum cost coordinated network dynamics followed by the agents,
under an observability constraint. The problem is placed in the context of
structural observability and solved even when up to k agents in the coordinated
network dynamics fail.

 <dc:description>  In application domains such as healthcare, we want accurate predictive models
that are also causally interpretable. In pursuit of such models, we propose a
causal regularizer to steer predictive models towards causally-interpretable
solutions and theoretically study its properties. In a large-scale analysis of
Electronic Health Records (EHR), our causally-regularized model outperforms its
L1-regularized counterpart in causal accuracy and is competitive in predictive
performance. We perform non-linear causality analysis by causally regularizing
a special neural network architecture. We also show that the proposed causal
regularizer can be used together with neural representation learning algorithms
to yield up to 20% improvement over multilayer perceptron in detecting
multivariate causation, a situation common in healthcare, where many causal
factors should occur simultaneously to have an effect on the target variable.

 <dc:description>  In a smart city, real-time traffic sensors may be deployed for various
applications, such as route planning. Unfortunately, sensors are prone to
failures, which result in erroneous traffic data. Erroneous data can adversely
affect applications such as route planning, and can cause increased travel
time. To minimize the impact of sensor failures, we must detect them promptly
and accurately. However, typical detection algorithms may lead to a large
number of false positives (i.e., false alarms) and false negatives (i.e.,
missed detections), which can result in suboptimal route planning. In this
paper, we devise an effective detector for identifying faulty traffic sensors
using a prediction model based on Gaussian Processes. Further, we present an
approach for computing the optimal parameters of the detector which minimize
losses due to false-positive and false-negative errors. We also characterize
critical sensors, whose failure can have high impact on the route planning
application. Finally, we implement our method and evaluate it numerically using
a real-world dataset and the route planning platform OpenTripPlanner.

 <dc:description>  Sparse signatures have been proposed for the CDMA uplink to reduce multi-user
detection complexity, but they have not yet been fully exploited for its
downlink counterpart. In this work, we propose a Multi-Carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA)
downlink communication, where regular sparse signatures are deployed in the
frequency domain. Taking the symbol detection point of view, we formulate a
problem appropriate for the downlink with discrete alphabets as inputs. The
solution to the problem provides a power-efficient precoding algorithm for the
base station, subject to minimum symbol error probability (SEP) requirements at
the mobile stations. In the algorithm, signature sparsity is shown to be
crucial for reducing precoding complexity. Numerical results confirm
system-load-dependent power reduction gain from the proposed precoding over the
zero-forcing precoding and the regularized zero-forcing precoding with
optimized regularization parameter under the same SEP targets. For a fixed
system load, it is also demonstrated that sparse MC-CDMA with a proper choice
of sparsity level attains almost the same power efficiency and link throughput
as that of dense MC-CDMA yet with reduced precoding complexity, thanks to the
sparse signatures.

 <dc:description>  Connecting different text attributes associated with the same entity
(conflation) is important in business data analytics since it could help merge
two different tables in a database to provide a more comprehensive profile of
an entity. However, the conflation task is challenging because two text strings
that describe the same entity could be quite different from each other for
reasons such as misspelling. It is therefore critical to develop a conflation
model that is able to truly understand the semantic meaning of the strings and
match them at the semantic level. To this end, we develop a character-level
deep conflation model that encodes the input text strings from character level
into finite dimension feature vectors, which are then used to compute the
cosine similarity between the text strings. The model is trained in an
end-to-end manner using back propagation and stochastic gradient descent to
maximize the likelihood of the correct association. Specifically, we propose
two variants of the deep conflation model, based on long-short-term memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN),
respectively. Both models perform well on a real-world business analytics
dataset and significantly outperform the baseline bag-of-character (BoC) model.

 <dc:title>On minimum distance of locally repairable codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Distributed and cloud storage systems are used to reliably store large-scale
data. Erasure codes have been recently proposed and used in real-world
distributed and cloud storage systems such as Google File System, Microsoft
Azure Storage, and Facebook HDFS-RAID, to enhance the reliability. In order to
decrease the repair bandwidth and disk I/O, a class of erasure codes called
locally repairable codes (LRCs) have been proposed which have small locality
compare to other erasure codes. Although LRCs have small locality, they have
lower minimum distance compare to the Singleton bound. Hence, seeking the
largest possible minimum distance for LRCs have been the topic of many recent
studies. In this paper, we study the largest possible minimum distance of a
class of LRCs and evaluate them in terms of achievability. Furthermore, we
compare our results with the existence bounds in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Interpersonal relationships are necessary for successful daily functioning
and wellbeing. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of social
connectivity for mental health, both through direct peer-to-peer influence and
by the location of individuals within their social network. Passive monitoring
using smartphones provides an advanced tool to map social networks based on the
proximity between individuals. This study investigates the feasibility of using
a smartphone app to measure and assess the relationship between social network
metrics and mental health. The app collected Bluetooth and mental health data
in 63 participants. Social networks of proximity were estimated from Bluetooth
data and 95% of the edges were scanned at least every 30 minutes. The majority
of participants found this method of data collection acceptable and reported
that they would be likely to participate in future studies using this app.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using a smartphone app that
participants can install on their own phone to investigate the relationship
between social connectivity and mental health.

 <dc:description>  The amount of aspect-oriented software development techniques and tools have
been increasing for the last years but still they have not enough maturity and
are not sufficiently spread to be included in a project leader's box of tools.
Software development projects have to deal with many risks, and the main
function of project leaders is to minimize them. The use of immature
technologies, tools newcomers to the market, techniques that have not been
tested enough, etc., would be very risky decisions to take by who has the
responsibility to carry out a successful software development project. On the
other hand, the availability of well-known tools and techniques and the
adherence to standards and best practices will help professionals to make good
estimates and to take better decisions. There is many proposals on
aspect-oriented techniques, notations, tools, etc., but they have not yet
unified on a common body of knowledge and none of them has become the most
popular approach. We are interested in the early phases of the aspect-oriented
SDLC which include the phases from the beginning of the life cycle until
architecture design. We are interested in portraying the state of the art of
aspect-oriented techniques and tools, in the identification of the standards
they employ. Our goal is to collect all the available evidence, analyze it, and
study the possibility of applying these techniques, tools and standards in real
projects, taking advantage of the benefits of the aspect-oriented paradigm, by
identifying the standard and widespread approaches, techniques, notations and
tools present in the scientific literature and to verify if they were applied
in the industry, by means of a systematic mapping of the literature published
between January 1996 and December 2016.

multi-instance (MI) framework to consider the non-stationarity of the EEG
signal. The non-stationary characteristic of EEG is considered by describing
the signal as a bag of relevant and irrelevant concepts. The concepts are
provided by a robust representation of homogenous segments of EEG signal using
spatial covariance matrices. Due to the nonlinear geometry of the space of
covariance matrices, we determine the boundaries of the homogeneous segments
based on adaptive segmentation of the signal in a Riemannian framework. Each
subject is described as a bag of covariance matrices of homogenous segments and
the bag-level discriminative information is used for classification. To
evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, we examine it in attention
deficit hyperactivity/bipolar mood disorder detection and depression/normal
diagnosis applications. Experimental results confirm the superiority of the
proposed approach, which is gained due to the robustness of covariance
descriptor, the effectiveness of Riemannian geometry, and the benefits of
considering the inherent non-stationary nature of the brain.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of ranking a set of items from nonactively chosen
pairwise preferences where each item has feature information with it. We
propose and characterize a very broad class of preference matrices giving rise
to the Feature Low Rank (FLR) model, which subsumes several models ranging from
the classic Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry 1952) and Thurstone
(Thurstone 1927) models to the recently proposed blade-chest (Chen and Joachims
2016) and generic low-rank preference (Rajkumar and Agarwal 2016) models. We
use the technique of matrix completion in the presence of side information to
develop the Inductive Pairwise Ranking (IPR) algorithm that provably learns a
good ranking under the FLR model, in a sample-efficient manner. In practice,
through systematic synthetic simulations, we confirm our theoretical findings
regarding improvements in the sample complexity due to the use of feature
information. Moreover, on popular real-world preference learning datasets, with
as less as 10% sampling of the pairwise comparisons, our method recovers a good
ranking.

 <dc:title>On the Local Correctabilities of Projective Reed-Muller Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lin, Sian-Jheng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show that the projective Reed-Muller~(PRM) codes form a
family of locally correctable codes~(LCC) in the regime of low query
complexities. A PRM code is specified by the alphabet size $q$, the number of
variables $m$, and the degree $d$. When $d\leq q-1$, we present a perfectly
smooth local decoder to recover a symbol by accessing $\gamma\leq q$ symbols to
the coordinates fall on a line. There are three major parameters considered in
LCCs, namely the query complexity, the message length and the code length. This
paper shows that PRM codes are shorter than generalized Reed-Muller~(GRM) codes
in LCCs. Precisely, given a GRM code over a field of size $q$, there exists a
class of shorter codes over a field of size $q-1$, while maintaining the same
values on the query complexities and the message lengths.

 <dc:description>  We consider the capacity region of a $K$-user multiple access channel (MAC)
with energy harvesting transmitters. Each user stores and schedules the
randomly arriving energy using an energy buffer. Users can also perform energy
cooperation by transmitting energy to other users or receiving energy from
them. We derive the capacity region of this channel and show that 1) the
capacity region coincides with that of a traditional $K$-user Gaussian MAC with
energy cooperation, where the average power constraints are equal to the
battery recharging rates of the energy harvesting case; 2) each rate on the
capacity region boundary can be achieved using the save-and-forward power
control and a fixed energy cooperation policy.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, machine learning techniques based on neural networks for
mobile computing become increasingly popular. Classical multi-layer neural
networks require matrix multiplications at each stage. Multiplication operation
is not an energy efficient operation and consequently it drains the battery of
the mobile device. In this paper, we propose a new energy efficient neural
network with the universal approximation property over space of Lebesgue
integrable functions. This network, called, additive neural network, is very
suitable for mobile computing. The neural structure is based on a novel vector
product definition, called ef-operator, that permits a multiplier-free
implementation. In ef-operation, the &quot;product&quot; of two real numbers is defined
as the sum of their absolute values, with the sign determined by the sign of
the product of the numbers. This &quot;product&quot; is used to construct a vector
product in $R^N$. The vector product induces the $l_1$ norm. The proposed
additive neural network successfully solves the XOR problem. The experiments on
MNIST dataset show that the classification performances of the proposed
additive neural networks are very similar to the corresponding multi-layer
perceptron and convolutional neural networks (LeNet).

 <dc:description>  Low-rank structures play important role in recent advances of many problems
in image science and data science. As a natural extension of low-rank
structures for data with nonlinear structures, the concept of the
low-dimensional manifold structure has been considered in many data processing
problems. Inspired by this concept, we consider a manifold based low-rank
regularization as a linear approximation of manifold dimension. This
regularization is less restricted than the global low-rank regularization, and
thus enjoy more flexibility to handle data with nonlinear structures. As
applications, we demonstrate the proposed regularization to classical inverse
problems in image sciences and data sciences including image inpainting, image
super-resolution, X-ray computer tomography (CT) image reconstruction and
semi-supervised learning. We conduct intensive numerical experiments in several
image restoration problems and a semi-supervised learning problem of
classifying handwritten digits using the MINST data. Our numerical tests
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and illustrate that the
new regularization methods produce outstanding results by comparing with many
existing methods.

 <dc:description>  Locally recoverable (LRC) codes have recently been a focus point of research
in coding theory due to their theoretical appeal and applications in
distributed storage systems. In an LRC code, any erased symbol of a codeword
can be recovered by accessing only a small number of other symbols. For LRC
codes over a small alphabet (such as binary), the optimal rate-distance
trade-off is unknown. We present several new combinatorial bounds on LRC codes
including the locality-aware sphere packing and Plotkin bounds. We also develop
an approach to linear programming (LP) bounds on LRC codes. The resulting LP
bound gives better estimates in examples than the other upper bounds known in
the literature. Further, we provide the tightest known upper bound on the rate
of linear LRC codes with a given relative distance, an improvement over the
previous best known bounds.

 <dc:description>  Although a majority of the theoretical literature in high-dimensional
statistics has focused on settings which involve fully-observed data, settings
with missing values and corruptions are common in practice. We consider the
problems of estimation and of constructing component-wise confidence intervals
in a sparse high-dimensional linear regression model when some covariates of
the design matrix are missing completely at random. We analyze a variant of the
Dantzig selector [9] for estimating the regression model and we use a
de-biasing argument to construct component-wise confidence intervals. Our first
main result is to establish upper bounds on the estimation error as a function
of the model parameters (the sparsity level s, the expected fraction of
observed covariates $\rho_*$, and a measure of the signal strength
$\|\beta^*\|_2$). We find that even in an idealized setting where the
covariates are assumed to be missing completely at random, somewhat
surprisingly and in contrast to the fully-observed setting, there is a
dichotomy in the dependence on model parameters and much faster rates are
obtained if the covariance matrix of the random design is known. To study this
issue further, our second main contribution is to provide lower bounds on the
estimation error showing that this discrepancy in rates is unavoidable in a
minimax sense. We then consider the problem of high-dimensional inference in
the presence of missing data. We construct and analyze confidence intervals
using a de-biased estimator. In the presence of missing data, inference is
complicated by the fact that the de-biasing matrix is correlated with the pilot
estimator and this necessitates the design of a new estimator and a novel
analysis. We also complement our mathematical study with extensive simulations
on synthetic and semi-synthetic data that show the accuracy of our asymptotic
predictions for finite sample sizes.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new view of multi-user (MU) hybrid massive
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems from array signal processing
perspective. We first show that the instantaneous channel vectors corresponding
to different users are asymptotically orthogonal if the angles of arrival
(AOAs) of users are different. We then decompose the channel matrix into an
angle domain basis matrix and a gain matrix. The former can be formulated by
steering vectors and the latter has the same size as the number of RF chains,
which perfectly matches the structure of hybrid precoding. A novel hybrid
channel estimation is proposed by separately estimating the angle information
and the gain matrix, which could significantly save the training overhead and
substantially improve the channel estimation accuracy compared to the
conventional beamspace approach. Moreover, with the aid of the angle domain
matrix, the MU massive MIMO system can be viewed as a type of non-orthogonal
angle division multiple access (ADMA) to simultaneously serve multiple users at
the same frequency band. Finally, the performance of the proposed scheme is
validated by computer simulation results.

 <dc:description>  Holant problems capture a class of Sum-of-Product computations such as
counting matchings. It is inspired by holographic algorithms and is equivalent
to tensor networks, with counting CSP being a special case. A classification
for Holant problems is more difficult to prove, not only because it implies a
classification for counting CSP, but also due to the deeper reason that there
exist more intricate polynomial time tractable problems in the broader
framework.
  We discover a new family of constraint functions $\mathscr{L}$ which define
polynomial time computable counting problems. These do not appear in counting
CSP, and no newly discovered tractable constraints can be symmetric. It has a
delicate support structure related to error-correcting codes. Local holographic
transformations is fundamental in its tractability. We prove a complexity
dichotomy theorem for all Holant problems defined by any real valued constraint
function set on Boolean variables and contains two 0-1 pinning functions.
Previously, dichotomy for the same framework was only known for symmetric
constraint functions. he set $\mathscr{L}$ supplies the last piece of
tractability. We also prove a dichotomy for a variant of counting CSP as a
technical component toward this Holant dichotomy.

 <dc:title>Wideband Distributed Spectrum Sharing with Multichannel Immediate
  Multiple Access</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cai, Mingming</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Laneman, J. Nicholas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes a radio architecture for distributed spectrum sharing of
multiple channels among secondary users (SUs) in a wide band of frequencies and
a localized area. A novel Multichannel Immediate Multiple Access (MIMA)
physical layer is developed such that each SU can monitor all the channels
simultaneously for incoming signals and achieve fast rendezvous within the
multiple channels. The spectrum utilized by an SU pair can be changed
dynamically based upon spectrum sensing at the transmitter and tracking
synchronization and control messages at the receiver. Although information
about the number of active SUs can be used to improve the spectrum sharing
efficiency, the improvement is small relative to the cost of obtaining such
information. Therefore, the architecture adopts Multichannel Carrier Sense
Multiple Access (CSMA) for medium access control regardless of the number of
active SUs. A prototype implementation of the architecture has been developed
using an advanced software defined radio (SDR) platform. System tests
demonstrate that the spectrum sharing efficiency of the prototype is close to
an upper bound if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is sufficiently high. Among
other practical issues, imaged interference caused by hardware IQ imbalance
limits system performance. In the prototype, the MIMA is based on an LTE
waveform. Therefore, the spectrum sharing radio can be potentially applied to
the 3.5 GHz radar band for Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS).

 <dc:description>  Fads, product adoption, mobs, rumors, memes, and emergent norms are diverse
social contagions that have been modeled as network cascades. Empirical study
of these cascades is vulnerable to what we describe as the &quot;opacity problem&quot;:
the inability to observe the critical level of peer influence required to
trigger an individual's behavioral change. Even with maximal information,
network cascades reveal intervals that bound critical levels of peer exposure,
rather than critical values themselves. Existing practice uses interval maxima,
which systematically over-estimates the social influence required for
behavioral change. Simulations reveal that the over-estimation is likely common
and large in magnitude. This is confirmed by an empirical study of hashtag
cascades among 3.2 million Twitter users: one in five hashtag adoptions suffers
critical value uncertainty due to the opacity problem. Different assumptions
about these intervals lead to qualitatively different conclusions about the
role of peer reinforcement in diffusion. We introduce a solution that combines
identifying tightly bounded intervals with predicting uncertain critical values
using node-level information.

 <dc:description>  Linearizability is the standard correctness criterion concurrent data
structures such as stacks and queues. It allows to establish observational
refinement between a concurrent implementation and an atomic reference
implementation.Proving linearizability requires identifying linearization
points for each method invocation along all possible computations, leading to
valid sequential executions, or alternatively, establishing forward and
backward simulations. In both cases, carrying out proofs is hard and complex in
general. In particular, backward reasoning is difficult in the context of
programs with data structures, and strategies for identifying statically
linearization points cannot be defined for all existing implementations. In
this paper, we show that, contrary to common belief, many such complex
implementations, including, e.g., the Herlihy&amp;Wing Queue and the Time-Stamped
Stack, can be proved correct using only forward simulation arguments. This
leads to conceptually simple and natural correctness proofs for these
implementations that are amenable to automation.

 <dc:description>  Supervised deep learning often suffers from the lack of sufficient training
data. Specifically in the context of monocular depth map prediction, it is
barely possible to determine dense ground truth depth images in realistic
dynamic outdoor environments. When using LiDAR sensors, for instance, noise is
present in the distance measurements, the calibration between sensors cannot be
perfect, and the measurements are typically much sparser than the camera
images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to depth map prediction from
monocular images that learns in a semi-supervised way. While we use sparse
ground-truth depth for supervised learning, we also enforce our deep network to
produce photoconsistent dense depth maps in a stereo setup using a direct image
alignment loss. In experiments we demonstrate superior performance in depth map
prediction from single images compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Predicting Privileged Information for Height Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel regression-based method for employing
privileged information to estimate the height using human metrology. The actual
values of the anthropometric measurements are difficult to estimate accurately
using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. Hence, we use ratios of
anthropometric measurements as features. Since many anthropometric measurements
are not available at test time in real-life scenarios, we employ a learning
using privileged information (LUPI) framework in a regression setup. Instead of
using the LUPI paradigm for regression in its original form (i.e.,
\epsilon-SVR+), we train regression models that predict the privileged
information at test time. The predictions are then used, along with observable
features, to perform height estimation. Once the height is estimated, a mapping
to classes is performed. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can estimate
the height better and faster than the \epsilon-SVR+ algorithm and report
results for different genders and quartiles of humans.

 <dc:description>  Estimating multiple sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (sGGMs) jointly for many
related tasks (large $K$) under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation is an
important task. Most previous studies for the joint estimation of multiple
sGGMs rely on penalized log-likelihood estimators that involve expensive and
difficult non-smooth optimizations. We propose a novel approach, FASJEM for
\underline{fa}st and \underline{s}calable \underline{j}oint
structure-\underline{e}stimation of \underline{m}ultiple sGGMs at a large
scale. As the first study of joint sGGM using the M-estimator framework, our
work has three major contributions: (1) We solve FASJEM through an entry-wise
manner which is parallelizable. (2) We choose a proximal algorithm to optimize
FASJEM. This improves the computational efficiency from $O(Kp^3)$ to $O(Kp^2)$
and reduces the memory requirement from $O(Kp^2)$ to $O(K)$. (3) We
theoretically prove that FASJEM achieves a consistent estimation with a
convergence rate of $O(\log(Kp)/n_{tot})$. On several synthetic and four
real-world datasets, FASJEM shows significant improvements over baselines on
accuracy, computational complexity and memory costs.

 <dc:description>  A coding scheme for two-page unrestricted-rate PRIO code that each page may
have different code rates is proposed. In the second page, the code for each
messages consists of two complementary codewords with code length n. There are
a total of 2n-1 codes which are disjoint to guarantees uniquely decodable for
2n-1 messages. In the first page, the code for each message consists of all
weight-u vectors with their non-zero elements restricted to (2u-1) same
positions, where non-negative integer u is less than or equal to half of code
length. Finding codes to be disjoint in first page is equivalent to
construction of constant-weight codes, and the numbers of disjoint codes are
the best-known numbers of codewords in constant-weight codes. Our coding scheme
is constructive, and the code length is arbitrary.The sum rates of our proposed
codes are higher than those of previous work.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel face alignment method using single deep

max-pooling layer followed one convolutional layer in typical convolutional
neural networks (CNN), SDN adopts a stack of 3 layer groups instead. Each group
layer contains two convolutional layers and a max-pooling layer, which can
extract the features hierarchically. Moreover, an effective data augmentation
strategy and corresponding training skills are also proposed to over-come the
lack of training images on COFW and 300-W da-tasets. The experiment results
show that our method outper-forms state-of-the-art methods in both detection
accuracy and speed.

 <dc:description>  Sensitivity-based methods are extensively used to construct differentially
private mechanisms. In this paper, we realize that designing a differentially
private mechanism can be considered as finding a randomized mapping between two
metric spaces. The metric in the first metric space can be considered as a
metric about privacy and the metric in the second metric space can be
considered as a metric about utility. We find that the sensitivity-based
methods are those just using the metric about utility to construct mechanisms.
By the observation, we design mechanisms based on the metric about privacy.
Furthermore, we design mechanisms based on the composition of the two metrics.
Moreover, we find that most mechanisms, such as the global sensitivity
mechanism [1], the Staircase mechanism [2,3], the Ladder mechanism [4] and the
K-norm mechanism [5,6], can be considered as special cases of our mechanisms.
  Finally, we analyze these mechanisms and apply them to the subgraph counting
problem and the linear query problem. The experiments show that our mechanisms
(in most cases) have more accurate results than the state of the art
mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the recently launched mobile data trading markets (e.g., China
Mobile Hong Kong's 2nd exChange Market), in this paper we study the mobile data
trading problem under the future data demand uncertainty. We introduce a
brokerage-based market, where sellers and buyers propose their selling and
buying quantities, respectively, to the trading platform that matches the
market supply and demand. To understand the users' realistic trading behaviors,
a prospect theory (PT) model from behavioral economics is proposed, which
includes the widely adopted expected utility theory (EUT) as a special case.
Although the PT modeling leads to a challenging non-convex optimization
problem, the optimal solution can be characterized by exploiting the unimodal
structure of the objective function. Building upon our analysis, we design an
algorithm to help estimate the user's risk preference and provide trading
recommendations dynamically, considering the latest market and usage
information. It is shown in our simulation that the risk preferences have a
significant impact on the user's decision and outcome: a risk-averse dominant
user can guarantee a higher minimum profit in the trading, while a risk-seeking
dominant user can achieve a higher maximum profit. By comparing with the EUT
benchmark, it is shown that a PT user with a low reference point is more
willing to buy mobile data. Moreover, when the probability of high future data
demand is low, a PT user is more willing to buy mobile data due to the
probability distortion comparing with an EUT user.

 <dc:description>  Subject of research is complex networks and network systems. The network
system is defined as a complex network in which flows are moved. Classification
of flows in the network is carried out on the basis of ordering and continuity.
It is shown that complex networks with different types of flows generate
various network systems. Flow analogues of the basic concepts of the theory of
complex networks are introduced and the main problems of this theory in terms
of flow characteristics are formulated. Local and global flow characteristics
of networks bring closer the theory of complex networks to the systems theory
and systems analysis. Concept of flow core of network system is introduced and
defined how it simplifies the process of its investigation. Concepts of kernel
and flow core of multiplex are determined. Features of operation of multiplex
type systems are analyzed.

 <dc:description>  Autonomous fixed-wing UAV landing based on differential GPS is now a
mainstream providing reliable and precise landing. But the task still remains
challenging when GPS availability is limited like for military UAVs. We discuss
a solution of this problem based on computer vision and dot markings along
stationary or makeshift runway. We focus our attempts on using infrared beacons
along with narrow-band filter as promising way to mark any makeshift runway and
utilize particle filtering to fuse both IMU and visual data. We believe that
unlike many other vision-based methods this solution is capable of tracking UAV
position up to engines stop. System overview, algorithm description and it's
evaluation on synthesized sequence along real recorded trajectory is presented.

 <dc:description>  Instant messaging is one of the major channels of computer mediated
communication. However, humans are known to be very limited in understanding
others' emotions via text-based communication. Aiming on introducing emotion
sensing technologies to instant messaging, we developed EmotionPush, a system
that automatically detects the emotions of the messages end-users received on
Facebook Messenger and provides colored cues on their smartphones accordingly.
We conducted a deployment study with 20 participants during a time span of two
weeks. In this paper, we revealed five challenges, along with examples, that we
observed in our study based on both user's feedback and chat logs, including
(i)the continuum of emotions, (ii)multi-user conversations, (iii)different
dynamics between different users, (iv)misclassification of emotions and
(v)unconventional content. We believe this discussion will benefit the future
exploration of affective computing for instant messaging, and also shed light
on research of conversational emotion sensing.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present an approach for mining user preferences and
recommendation based on reviews. There have been various studies worked on
recommendation problem. However, most of the studies beyond one aspect user
generated- content such as user ratings, user feedback and so on to state user
preferences. There is a prob- lem in one aspect mining is lacking for stating
user preferences. As a demonstration, in collaborative filter recommendation,
we try to figure out the preference trend of crowded users, then use that trend
to predict current user preference. Therefore, there is a gap between real user
preferences and the trend of the crowded people. Additionally, user preferences
can be addressed from mining user reviews since user often comment about
various aspects of products. To solve this problem, we mainly focus on mining
product aspects and user aspects inside user reviews to directly state user
preferences. We also take into account Social Network Analysis for cold-start
item problem. With cold-start user problem, collaborative filter algorithm is
employed in our work. The framework is general enough to be applied to
different recommendation domains. Theoretically, our method would achieve a
significant enhancement.

 <dc:description>  Many human activities involve object manipulations aiming to modify the
object state. Examples of common state changes include full/empty bottle,
open/closed door, and attached/detached car wheel. In this work, we seek to
automatically discover the states of objects and the associated manipulation
actions. Given a set of videos for a particular task, we propose a joint model
that learns to identify object states and to localize state-modifying actions.
Our model is formulated as a discriminative clustering cost with constraints.
We assume a consistent temporal order for the changes in object states and
manipulation actions, and introduce new optimization techniques to learn model
parameters without additional supervision. We demonstrate successful discovery
of seven manipulation actions and corresponding object states on a new dataset
of videos depicting real-life object manipulations. We show that our joint
formulation results in an improvement of object state discovery by action
recognition and vice versa.

 <dc:description>  Ultrasound diagnosis is routinely used in obstetrics and gynecology for fetal
biometry, and owing to its time-consuming process, there has been a great
demand for automatic estimation. However, the automated analysis of ultrasound
images is complicated because they are patient-specific, operator-dependent,
and machine-specific. Among various types of fetal biometry, the accurate
estimation of abdominal circumference (AC) is especially difficult to perform
automatically because the abdomen has low contrast against surroundings,
non-uniform contrast, and irregular shape compared to other parameters.We
propose a method for the automatic estimation of the fetal AC from 2D
ultrasound data through a specially designed convolutional neural network
(CNN), which takes account of doctors' decision process, anatomical structure,
and the characteristics of the ultrasound image. The proposed method uses CNN
to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical
vein) and Hough transformation for measuring AC. We test the proposed method
using clinical ultrasound data acquired from 56 pregnant women. Experimental
results show that, with relatively small training samples, the proposed CNN
provides sufficient classification results for AC estimation through the Hough
transformation. The proposed method automatically estimates AC from ultrasound
images. The method is quantitatively evaluated, and shows stable performance in
most cases and even for ultrasound images deteriorated by shadowing artifacts.
As a result of experiments for our acceptance check, the accuracies are 0.809
and 0.771 with the expert 1 and expert 2, respectively, while the accuracy
between the two experts is 0.905. However, for cases of oversized fetus, when
the amniotic fluid is not observed or the abdominal area is distorted, it could
not correctly estimate AC.

 <dc:description>  Diffusion MRI measurements using hyperpolarized gases are generally acquired
during patient breath hold, which yields a compromise between achievable image
resolution, lung coverage and number of b-values. In this work, we propose a
novel method that accelerates the acquisition of MR diffusion data by
undersampling in both spatial and b-value dimensions, thanks to incorporating
knowledge about the signal decay into the reconstruction (SIDER). SIDER is
compared to total variation (TV) reconstruction by assessing their effect on
both the recovery of ventilation images and estimated mean alveolar dimensions
(MAD). Both methods are assessed by retrospectively undersampling diffusion
datasets of normal volunteers and COPD patients (n=8) for acceleration factors
between x2 and x10. TV led to large errors and artefacts for acceleration
factors equal or larger than x5. SIDER improved TV, presenting lower errors and
histograms of MAD closer to those obtained from fully sampled data for
accelerations factors up to x10. SIDER preserved image quality at all
acceleration factors but images were slightly smoothed and some details were
lost at x10. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a novel compressed
sensing method for lung MRI imaging and achieved high acceleration factors,
which can be used to increase the amount of data acquired during a breath-hold.
This methodology is expected to improve the accuracy of estimated lung
microstructure dimensions and widen the possibilities of studying lung diseases
with MRI.

 <dc:description>  Sampling-based alpha matting methods have traditionally followed the
compositing equation to estimate the alpha value at a pixel from a pair of
foreground (F) and background (B) samples. The (F,B) pair that produces the
least reconstruction error is selected, followed by alpha estimation. The
significance of that residual error has been left unexamined. In this letter,
we propose a video matting algorithm that uses L1-regularized reconstruction
error of F and B samples as a measure of the alpha matte. A multi-frame
non-local means framework using coherency sensitive hashing is utilized to
ensure temporal coherency in the video mattes. Qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on a dataset exclusively for video matting demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed matting algorithm.

 <dc:title>Spin Transfer Torque Driven Coupled Oscillators for Self-Oscillating RF
  Mixers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Maji, Supriyo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spin transfer torque oscillators (STOs) based on magnetic tunnel junction
(MTJ) devices are emerging as a possible replacement for complementary
metal-oxide semiconductors for radio-frequency (RF) signal generation.
Advantages include low power consumption, small device area, and large
frequency tunability. But such a single device cannot achieve the necessary
noise performance for RF applications. It has been reported lately that a
network of globally coupled STOs achieves significant improvement in phase
noise. The study here is to propose use of such coupled STOs as
self-oscillating RF mixers. Critical mixer performance parameters, including
conversion gain, output power, and linearity, are discussed.

 <dc:description>  High penetration of renewable energy source makes microgrid (MGs) be
environment friendly. However, the stochastic input from renewable energy
resource brings difficulty in balancing the energy supply and demand.
Purchasing extra energy from macrogrid to deal with energy shortage will
increase MG energy cost. To mitigate intermittent nature of renewable energy,
energy trading and energy storage which can exploit diversity of renewable
energy generation across space and time are efficient and cost-effective
methods. But current energy storage control action will impact the future
control action which brings challenge to energy management. In addition, due to
MG participating energy trading as prosumer, it calls for an efficient trading
mechanism. Therefore, this paper focuses on the problem of MG energy management
and trading. Energy trading problem is formulated as a stochastic optimization
one with both individual profit and social welfare maximization. Firstly a
Lyapunov optimization based algorithm is developed to solve the stochastic
problem. Secondly the double-auction based mechanism is provided to attract MG
truthful bidding for buying and selling energy. Through theoretical analysis,
we demonstrate that individual MG can achieve a time average energy cost close
to offline optimum with tradeoff between storage capacity and energy trading
cost. Meanwhile the social welfare is also asymptotically maximized under
double auction. Simulation results based on real world data show the
effectiveness of our algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Small cells are a cost-effective way to reliably expand network coverage and
provide significantly increased capacity for end users. The ultra-high
bandwidth available at millimeter (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) frequencies can
effectively realize short-range wireless access links in small cells enabling
potential uses cases such as driver-less cars, data backhauling and
ultra-high-definition infotainment services. This paper describes a new
software defined network (SDN) framework for vehicles equipped with
transceivers capable of dynamically switching between THz and mmWave bands. We
present a novel SDN controlled admission policy that preferentially handoffs
between the mmWave and THz small cells, accommodates asymmetric uplink/downlink
traffic, performs error recovery and handles distinct link states that arise
due to motion along practical vehicular paths. We then analytically derive the
resulting capacity of such a small cell network by accounting for the channel
characteristics unique to both these spectrum bands, relative distance and the
contact times between a given transceiver pair. We then formulate the optimal
procedure for scheduling multiple vehicles at a given infrastructure tower,
with regards to practical road congestion scenarios. The search for the optimal
schedule is shown to be a NP-hard problem. Hence, we design a
computationally-feasible polynomial-time scheduling algorithm that runs at the
SDN controller and compare its performance against the optimal procedure and
random access. Additionally, we present a simulation-based case study for the
use case of data center backhauling in Boston city to showcase the benefits of
our approach.

 <dc:description>  Camera relocalisation is an important problem in computer vision, with
applications in simultaneous localisation and mapping, virtual/augmented
reality and navigation. Common techniques either match the current image
against keyframes with known poses coming from a tracker, or establish 2D-to-3D
correspondences between keypoints in the current image and points in the scene
in order to estimate the camera pose. Recently, regression forests have become
a popular alternative to establish such correspondences. They achieve accurate
results, but must be trained offline on the target scene, preventing
relocalisation in new environments. In this paper, we show how to circumvent
this limitation by adapting a pre-trained forest to a new scene on the fly. Our
adapted forests achieve relocalisation performance that is on par with that of
offline forests, and our approach runs in under 150ms, making it desirable for
real-time systems that require online relocalisation.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies remote state estimation in the presence of an
eavesdropper. A sensor transmits local state estimates over a packet dropping
link to a remote estimator, while an eavesdropper can successfully overhear
each sensor transmission with a certain probability. The objective is to
determine when the sensor should transmit, in order to minimize the estimation
error covariance at the remote estimator, while trying to keep the eavesdropper
error covariance above a certain level. This is done by solving an optimization
problem that minimizes a linear combination of the expected estimation error
covariance and the negative of the expected eavesdropper error covariance.
Structural results on the optimal transmission policy are derived, and shown to
exhibit thresholding behaviour in the estimation error covariances. In the
infinite horizon situation, it is shown that with unstable systems one can keep
the expected estimation error covariance bounded while the expected
eavesdropper error covariance becomes unbounded. An alternative measure of
security, constraining the amount of information revealed to the eavesdropper,
is also considered, and similar structural results on the optimal transmission
policy are derived. In the infinite horizon situation with unstable systems, it
is now shown that for any transmission policy which keeps the expected
estimation error covariance bounded, the expected amount of information
revealed to the eavesdropper is always lower bounded away from zero. An
extension of our results to the transmission of measurements is also presented.

 <dc:description>  Today's storage systems expose abstractions which are either too low-level
(e.g., key-value store, raw-block store) that they require developers to
re-invent the wheels, or too high-level (e.g., relational databases, Git) that
they lack generality to support many classes of applications. In this work, we
propose and implement a general distributed data storage system, called UStore,
which has rich semantics. UStore delivers three key properties, namely
immutability, sharing and security, which unify and add values to many classes
of today's applications, and which also open the door for new applications. By
keeping the core properties within the storage, UStore helps reduce application
development efforts while offering high performance at hand. The storage
embraces current hardware trends as key enablers. It is built around a
data-structure similar to that of Git, a popular source code versioning system,
but it also synthesizes many designs from distributed systems and databases.
Our current implementation of UStore has better performance than general
in-memory key-value storage systems, especially for version scan operations. We
port and evaluate four applications on top of UStore: a Git-like application, a
collaborative data science application, a transaction management application,
and a blockchain application. We demonstrate that UStore enables faster
development and the UStore-backed applications can have better performance than
the existing implementations.

line drawing merely contains the contour of human face. Previous exemplar-based
methods are over-dependent on the datasets and are hard to generalize to
complicated natural scenes. Recently, several works utilize deep neural
networks to increase the generalization, but they are still limited in the
controllability of the users. In this paper, we propose a deep generative model
to synthesize face photo from simple line drawing controlled by face attributes
such as hair color and complexion. In order to maximize the controllability of
face attributes, an attribute-disentangled variational auto-encoder (AD-VAE) is
firstly introduced to learn latent representations disentangled with respect to
specified attributes. Then we conduct photo synthesis from simple line drawing
based on AD-VAE. Experiments show that our model can well disentangle the
variations of attributes from other variations of face photos and synthesize
detailed photorealistic face images with desired attributes. Regarding
background and illumination as the style and human face as the content, we can
also synthesize face photos with the target style of a style photo.

 <dc:description>  In spite of recent advances in field delineation methods, bibliometricians
still don't know the extent to which their topic detection algorithms
reconstruct `ground truths', i.e. thematic structures in the scientific
literature. In this paper, we demonstrate a new approach to the delineation of
thematic structures that attempts to match the algorithm to theoretically
derived and empirically observed properties all thematic structures have in
common. We cluster citation links rather than publication nodes, use
predominantly local information and search for communities of links starting
from seed subgraphs in order to allow for pervasive overlaps of topics. We
evaluate sets of links with a new cost function and assume that local minima in
the cost landscape correspond to link communities. Because this cost landscape
has many local minima we define a valid community as the community with the
lowest minimum within a certain range. Since finding all valid communities is
impossible for large networks, we designed a memetic algorithm that combines
probabilistic evolutionary strategies with deterministic local searches. We
apply our approach to a network of about 15,000 Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics papers
published 2010 and their cited sources, and to a network of about 100,000
Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics papers (published 2003--2010) which are linked through
direct citations.

 <dc:description>  Facility location queries identify the best locations to set up new
facilities for providing service to its users. Majority of the existing works
in this space assume that the user locations are static. Such limitations are
too restrictive for planning many modern real-life services such as fuel
stations, ATMs, convenience stores, cellphone base-stations, etc. that are
widely accessed by mobile users. The placement of such services should,
therefore, factor in the mobility patterns or trajectories of the users rather
than simply their static locations. In this work, we introduce the TOPS
(Trajectory-Aware Optimal Placement of Services) query that locates the best k
sites on a road network. The aim is to optimize a wide class of objective
functions defined over the user trajectories. We show that the problem is
NP-hard and even the greedy heuristic with an approximation bound of (1-1/e)
fails to scale on urban-scale datasets. To overcome this challenge, we develop
a multi-resolution clustering based indexing framework called NetClus.
Empirical studies on real road network trajectory datasets show that NetClus
offers solutions that are comparable in terms of quality with those of the
greedy heuristic, while having practical response times and low memory
footprints. Additionally, the NetClus framework can absorb dynamic updates in
mobility patterns, handle constraints such as site-costs and capacity, and
existing services, thereby providing an effective solution for modern
urban-scale scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Current electronic voting systems require an anonymous channel during the
voting phase to prevent coercion. Typically, low-latency anonymization-networks
like Tor are used for this purpose. In this paper we devise a monitoring attack
that allows an attacker to monitor whether participants of an election voted,
despite the use of a low-latency network during the voting phase, thereby
breaking an important part of coercion-freeness. We implement a simulation
carrying out our attack and measure its success rates.

 <dc:description>  Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) methods have shown that classification
accuracy can be improved by integrating relations between samples. Techniques
such as iterative classification or relaxation labeling achieve this by
propagating information between related samples during the inference process.
When only a few samples are labeled and connections between samples are sparse,
collective inference methods have shown large improvements over standard
feature-based ML methods. However, in contrast to feature based ML, collective
inference methods require complex inference procedures and often depend on the
strong assumption of label consistency among related samples. In this paper, we
introduce new relational features for standard ML methods by extracting
information from direct and indirect relations. We show empirically on three
standard benchmark datasets that our relational features yield results
comparable to collective inference methods. Finally we show that our proposal
outperforms these methods when additional information is available.

 <dc:description>  The Boolean Satisfiability problem asks if a Boolean formula is satisfiable
by some assignment of the variables or not. It belongs to the NP-complete
complexity class and hence no algorithm with polynomial time worst-case
complexity is known, i.e., the problem is hard. The K-SAT problem is the subset
of the Boolean Satisfiability problem, for which the Boolean formula has the
conjunctive normal form with K literals per clause. This problem is still
NP-complete for $K \ge 3$. Although the worst case complexity of NP-complete
problems is conjectured to be exponential, there might be subsets of the
realizations where solutions can typically be found in polynomial time. In
fact, random $K$-SAT, with the number of clauses to number of variables ratio
$\alpha$ as control parameter, shows a phase transition between a satisfiable
phase and an unsatisfiable phase, at which the hardest problems are located. We
use here several linear programming approaches to reveal further &quot;easy-hard&quot;
transition points at which the typical hardness of the problems increases which
means that such algorithms can solve the problem on one side efficiently but
not beyond this point. For one of these transitions, we observed a coincidence
with a structural transition of the literal factor graphs of the problem
instances. We also investigated cutting-plane approaches, which often increase
the computational efficiency. Also we tried out a mapping to another
NP-complete optimization problem using a specific algorithm for that problem.
In both cases, no improvement of the performance was observed, i.e., no shift
of the easy-hard transition to higher values of $\alpha$.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of the present paper is to show that: Eilenberg-type
correspondences = Birkhoff's theorem for (finite) algebras + duality. We
consider algebras for a monad T on a category D and we study (pseudo)varieties
of T-algebras. Pseudovarieties of algebras are also known in the literature as
varieties of finite algebras. Two well-known theorems that characterize
varieties and pseudovarieties of algebras play an important role here:
Birkhoff's theorem and Birkhoff's theorem for finite algebras, the latter also
known as Reiterman's theorem. We prove, under mild assumptions, a categorical
version of Birkhoff's theorem for (finite) algebras to establish a one-to-one
correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)equational
T-theories. Now, if C is a category that is dual to D and B is the comonad on C
that is the dual of T, we get a one-to-one correspondence between
(pseudo)equational T-theories and their dual, (pseudo)coequational B-theories.
Particular instances of (pseudo)coequational B-theories have been already
studied in language theory under the name of &quot;varieties of languages&quot; to
establish Eilenberg-type correspondences. All in all, we get a one-to-one
correspondence between (pseudo)varieties of T-algebras and (pseudo)coequational
B-theories, which will be shown to be exactly the nature of Eilenberg-type
correspondences.

 <dc:description>  The explosive increase in number of smart devices hosting sophisticated
applications is rapidly affecting the landscape of information communication
technology industry. Mobile subscriptions, expected to reach 8.9 billion by
2022, would drastically increase the demand of extra capacity with aggregate
throughput anticipated to be enhanced by a factor of 1000. In an already
crowded radio spectrum, it becomes increasingly difficult to meet ever growing
application demands of wireless bandwidth. It has been shown that the allocated
spectrum is seldom utilized by the primary users and hence contains spectrum
holes that may be exploited by the unlicensed users for their communication. As
we enter the Internet Of Things (IoT) era in which appliances of common use
will become smart digital devices with rigid performance requirements (such as
low latency, energy efficiency, etc.), current networks face the vexing problem
of how to create sufficient capacity for such applications. The fifth
generation of cellular networks (5G) envisioned to address these challenges are
thus required to incorporate cognition and intelligence to resolve the
aforementioned issues.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of functions of $ d $ variables is considered using ridge
combinations of the form $ \textstyle\sum_{k=1}^m c_{1,k}
\phi(\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^d c_{0,j,k}x_j-b_k) $ where the activation function $
\phi $ is a function with bounded value and derivative. These include
single-hidden layer neural networks, polynomials, and sinusoidal models. From a
sample of size $ n $ of possibly noisy values at random sites $ X \in B =
[-1,1]^d $, the minimax mean square error is examined for functions in the
closure of the $ \ell_1 $ hull of ridge functions with activation $ \phi $. It
is shown to be of order $ d/n $ to a fractional power (when $ d $ is of smaller
order than $ n $), and to be of order $ (\log d)/n $ to a fractional power
(when $ d $ is of larger order than $ n $). Dependence on constraints $ v_0 $
and $ v_1 $ on the $ \ell_1 $ norms of inner parameter $ c_0 $ and outer
parameter $ c_1 $, respectively, is also examined. Also, lower and upper bounds
on the fractional power are given. The heart of the analysis is development of
information-theoretic packing numbers for these classes of functions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce the notion of DTM-signature, a measure on R +
that can be associated to any metric-measure space. This signature is based on
the distance to a measure (DTM) introduced by Chazal, Cohen-Steiner and
M\'erigot. It leads to a pseudo-metric between metric-measure spaces,
upper-bounded by the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Under some geometric
assumptions, we derive lower bounds for this pseudo-metric. Given two
N-samples, we also build an asymptotic statistical test based on the
DTM-signature, to reject the hypothesis of equality of the two underlying
metric-measure spaces, up to a measure-preserving isometry. We give strong
theoretical justifications for this test and propose an algorithm for its
implementation.

 <dc:description>  We provide a new constant factor approximation algorithm for the (connected)
distance-$r$ dominating set problem on graph classes of bounded expansion.
Classes of bounded expansion include many familiar classes of sparse graphs
such as planar graphs and graphs with excluded (topological) minors, and
notably, these classes form the most general subgraph closed classes of graphs
for which a sequential constant factor approximation algorithm for the
distance-$r$ dominating set problem is currently known. Our algorithm can be
implemented in the $\mathcal{CONGEST}_{\mathrm{BC}}$ model of distributed
computing and uses $\mathcal{O}(r^2 \log n)$ communication rounds.
  Our techniques, which may be of independent interest, are based on a
distributed computation of sparse neighborhood covers of small radius on
bounded expansion classes. We show how to compute an $r$-neighborhood cover of
radius $2r$ and overlap $f(r)$ on every class of bounded expansion in
$\mathcal{O}(r^2\log n)$ communication rounds.
  Finally, we show how to use the greater power of the $\mathcal{LOCAL}$ model
to turn any distance-$r$ dominating set into a constantly larger connected
distance-$r$ dominating set in $3r+1$ rounds on any class of bounded expansion.
Combining this algorithm, e.g., with the constant factor approximation
algorithm for dominating sets on planar graphs of Lenzen et al. gives a
constant factor approximation algorithm for connected dominating sets on planar
graphs in a constant number of rounds in the $\mathcal{LOCAL}$ model, where the
approximation ratio is only $6$ times larger than that of Lenzen et al.'s
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We study an online multi-task learning setting, in which instances of related
tasks arrive sequentially, and are handled by task-specific online learners. We
consider an algorithmic framework to model the relationship of these tasks via
a set of convex constraints. To exploit this relationship, we design a novel
algorithm -- COOL -- for coordinating the individual online learners: Our key
idea is to coordinate their parameters via weighted projections onto a convex
set. By adjusting the rate and accuracy of the projection, the COOL algorithm
allows for a trade-off between the benefit of coordination and the required
computation/communication. We derive regret bounds for our approach and analyze
how they are influenced by these trade-off factors. We apply our results on the
application of learning users' preferences on the Airbnb marketplace with the
goal of incentivizing users to explore under-reviewed apartments.

 <dc:title>Decoding Delay Performance of Random Linear Network Coding for Broadcast</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Characterization of the delay profile of systems employing random linear
network coding is important for the reliable provision of broadcast services.
Previous studies focused on network coding over large finite fields or
developed Markov chains to model the delay distribution but did not look at the
effect of transmission deadlines on the delay. In this work, we consider
generations of source packets that are encoded and transmitted over the erasure
broadcast channel. The transmission of packets associated to a generation is
taken to be deadline-constrained, that is, the transmitter drops a generation
and proceeds to the next one when a predetermined deadline expires. Closed-form
expressions for the average number of required packet transmissions per
generation are obtained in terms of the generation size, the field size, the
erasure probability and the deadline choice. An upper bound on the average
decoding delay, which is tighter than previous bounds found in the literature,
is also derived. Analysis shows that the proposed framework can be used to
fine-tune the system parameters and ascertain that neither insufficient nor
excessive amounts of packets are sent over the broadcast channel.

 <dc:description>  The emerging paradigm of network function virtualization advocates deploying
virtualized network functions (VNF) on standard virtualization platforms for
significant cost reduction and management flexibility. There have been system
designs for managing dynamic deployment and scaling of VNF service chains
within one cloud data center. Many real-world network services involve
geo-distributed service chains, with prominent examples of mobile core networks
and IMSs (IP Multimedia Subsystems). Virtualizing these service chains requires
efficient coordination of VNF deployment across different geo-distributed data
centers over time, calling for new management system design. This paper designs
a dynamic scaling system for geo-distributed VNF service chains, using the case
of an IMS. IMSs are widely used subsystems for delivering multimedia services
among mobile users in a 3G/4G network, whose virtualization has been broadly
advocated in the industry for reducing cost, improving network usage efficiency
and enabling dynamic network topology reconfiguration for performance
optimization. Our scaling system design caters to key control-plane and
data-plane service chains in an IMS, combining proactive and reactive
approaches for timely, cost-effective scaling of the service chains. We
evaluate our system design using real-world experiments on both emulated
platforms and geo-distributed clouds.

 <dc:description>  The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) bursts in preterm infants provides
valuable information about maturation or prognostication after perinatal
asphyxia. Over the last two decades, a number of works proposed algorithms to
automatically detect EEG bursts in preterm infants, but they were designed for
populations under 35 weeks of post menstrual age (PMA). However, as the brain
activity evolves rapidly during postnatal life, these solutions might be
under-performing with increasing PMA. In this work we focused on preterm
infants reaching term ages (PMA $\geq$ 36 weeks) using multi-feature
classification on a single EEG channel. Five EEG burst detectors relying on
different machine learning approaches were compared: Logistic regression (LR),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), support vector
machines (SVM) and thresholding (Th). Classifiers were trained by visually
labeled EEG recordings from 14 very preterm infants (born after 28 weeks of
gestation) with 36 - 41 weeks PMA. The most performing classifiers reached
about 95\% accuracy (kNN, SVM and LR) whereas Th obtained 84\%. Compared to
human-automatic agreements, LR provided the highest scores (Cohen's kappa =
0.71) and the best computational efficiency using only three EEG features.
Applying this classifier in a test database of 21 infants $\geq$ 36 weeks PMA,
we show that long EEG bursts and short inter-bust periods are characteristic of
infants with the highest PMA and weights. In view of these results, LR-based
burst detection could be a suitable tool to study maturation in monitoring or
portable devices using a single EEG channel.

 <dc:description>  Science education is a crucial issue with long-term impacts for Europe as the
low enrolment rates in the STEM-fields, including (natural) science,
technology, engineering and mathematics, will lead to a workforce problem in
research and development. In order to address this challenge, the EU-funded
research project SciChallenge (project.scichallenge.eu) aims to find a new way
for getting young people more interested in STEM. For this purpose, the project
developed and implemented a social-media-based STEM-contest for young people,
which aims at increasing the attractiveness of science education and careers
among young people. In the first two parts, the paper reflects on the problem,
introduces the project and highlights the main steps of the preparation of the
contest. The third section of the paper presents the idea, design and
implementation of the digital contest platform (www.scichallenge.eu), which
serves as the core of the challenge. The fourth part of the paper will provide
a status update on the contest pilot. It will provide a summary of the
experiences that the consortium made with this novel approach as well as the
main obstacles that the consortium was facing. The paper will conclude with a
preliminary reflection on the question if such an approach can help to increase
the interest of young people in STEM-education and careers.

which can be constructed using general polynomial curves. The conclusions can
be extended to spline surfaces as well.

 <dc:title>Improved Inapproximability Results for Steiner Tree via Long Code Based
  Reductions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>&#xc7;ivril, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The best algorithm for approximating Steiner tree has performance ratio
$\ln(4)+\epsilon \approx 1.386$ [J. Byrka et al., \textit{Proceedings of the
42th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC)}, 2010, pp. 583-592],
whereas the inapproximability result stays at the factor $\frac{96}{95} \approx
1.0105$ [M. Chleb\'ik and J. Chleb\'ikov\'a, \textit{Proceedings of the 8th
Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory (SWAT)}, 2002, pp. 170-179]. In this
article, we take a step forward to bridge this gap and show that there is no
polynomial time algorithm approximating Steiner tree with constant ratio better
than $\frac{19}{18} \approx 1.0555$ unless \textsf{P = NP}. We also relate the
problem to the Unique Games Conjecture by showing that it is \textsf{UG}-hard
to find a constant approximation ratio better than $\frac{17}{16} = 1.0625$. In
the special case of quasi-bipartite graphs, we prove an inapproximability
factor of $\frac{25}{24} \approx 1.0416$ unless \textsf{P = NP}, which improves
upon the previous bound of $\frac{128}{127} \approx 1.0078$. The reductions
that we present for all the cases are of the same spirit with appropriate
modifications. Our main technical contribution is an adaptation of a Set-Cover
type reduction in which the Long Code is used to the geometric setting of the
problems we consider.

 <dc:title>Sparse Approximation is Provably Hard under Coherent Dictionaries</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>&#xc7;ivril, Ali</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well known that sparse approximation problem is \textsf{NP}-hard under
general dictionaries. Several algorithms have been devised and analyzed in the
past decade under various assumptions on the \emph{coherence} $\mu$ of the
dictionary represented by an $M \times N$ matrix from which a subset of $k$
column vectors is selected. All these results assume $\mu=O(k^{-1})$. This
article is an attempt to bridge the big gap between the negative result of
\textsf{NP}-hardness under general dictionaries and the positive results under
this restrictive assumption. In particular, it suggests that the aforementioned
assumption might be asymptotically the best one can make to arrive at any
efficient algorithmic result under well-known conjectures of complexity theory.
In establishing the results, we make use of a new simple multilayered PCP which
is tailored to give a matrix with small coherence combined with our reduction.

 <dc:description>  Since planar triangle-free graphs are 3-colourable, such a graph with n
vertices has an independent set of size at least n/3. We prove that unless the
graph contains a certain obstruction, its independence number is at least
n/(3-epsilon) for some fixed epsilon&gt;0. We also provide a reduction rule for
this obstruction, which enables us to transform any plane triangle-free graph G
into a plane triangle-free graph G' such that alpha(G')-|G'|/3=alpha(G)-|G|/3
and |G'|&lt;=(alpha(G)-|G|/3)/epsilon. We derive a number of algorithmic
consequences as well as a structural description of n-vertex plane
triangle-free graphs whose independence number is close to n/3.

 <dc:description>  Parameterized algorithms are a way to solve hard problems more efficiently,
given that a specific parameter of the input is small. In this paper, we apply
this idea to the field of answer set programming (ASP). To this end, we propose
two kinds of graph representations of programs to exploit their treewidth as a
parameter. Treewidth roughly measures to which extent the internal structure of
a program resembles a tree. Our main contribution is the design of
parameterized dynamic programming algorithms, which run in linear time if the
treewidth and weights of the given program are bounded. Compared to previous
work, our algorithms handle the full syntax of ASP. Finally, we report on an
empirical evaluation that shows good runtime behaviour for benchmark instances
of low treewidth, especially for counting answer sets.

 <dc:title>Sparse Approximation by Semidefinite Programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The problem of sparse approximation and the closely related compressed
sensing have received tremendous attention in the past decade. Primarily
studied from the viewpoint of applied harmonic analysis and signal processing,
there have been two dominant algorithmic approaches to this problem: Greedy
methods called the matching pursuit (MP) and the linear programming based
approaches called the basis pursuit (BP). The aim of the current paper is to
bring a fresh perspective to sparse approximation by treating it as a
combinatorial optimization problem and providing an algorithm based on the
powerful optimization technique semidefinite programming (SDP). In particular,
we show that there is a randomized algorithm based on a semidefinite relaxation
of the problem with performance guarantees depending on the coherence and the
restricted isometry constant of the dictionary used. We then show a
derandomization of the algorithm based on the method of conditional
probabilities.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of using observational data to learn treatment
assignment policies that satisfy certain constraints specified by a
practitioner, such as budget, fairness, or functional form constraints. This
problem has previously been studied in economics, statistics, and computer
science, and several regret-consistent methods have been proposed. However,
several key analytical components are missing, including a characterization of
optimal methods for policy learning, and sharp bounds for minimax regret. In
this paper, we derive lower bounds for the minimax regret of policy learning
under constraints, and propose a method that attains this bound asymptotically
up to a constant factor. Whenever the class of policies under consideration has
a bounded Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, we show that the problem of
minimax-regret policy learning can be asymptotically reduced to first
efficiently evaluating how much each candidate policy improves over a
randomized baseline, and then maximizing this value estimate. Our analysis
relies on uniform generalizations of classical semiparametric efficiency
results for average treatment effect estimation, paired with sharp
concentration bounds for weighted empirical risk minimization that may be of
independent interest.

 <dc:title>Online and Offline Domain Adaptation for Reducing BCI Calibration Effort</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Dongrui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications rely on
single-trial classification of event-related potentials (ERPs) in EEG signals.
However, because different subjects have different neural responses to even the
same stimulus, it is very difficult to build a generic ERP classifier whose
parameters fit all subjects. The classifier needs to be calibrated for each
individual subject, using some labeled subject-specific data. This paper
proposes both online and offline weighted adaptation regularization (wAR)
algorithms to reduce this calibration effort, i.e., to minimize the amount of
labeled subject-specific EEG data required in BCI calibration, and hence to
increase the utility of the BCI system. We demonstrate using a visually-evoked
potential oddball task and three different EEG headsets that both online and
offline wAR algorithms significantly outperform several other algorithms.
Moreover, through source domain selection, we can reduce their computational
cost by about 50%, making them more suitable for real-time applications.

 <dc:description>  One big challenge that hinders the transition of brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs) from laboratory settings to real-life applications is the availability
of high-performance and robust learning algorithms that can effectively handle
individual differences, i.e., algorithms that can be applied to a new subject
with zero or very little subject-specific calibration data. Transfer learning
and domain adaptation have been extensively used for this purpose. However,
most previous works focused on classification problems. This paper considers an
important regression problem in BCI, namely, online driver drowsiness
estimation from EEG signals. By integrating fuzzy sets with domain adaptation,
we propose a novel online weighted adaptation regularization for regression
(OwARR) algorithm to reduce the amount of subject-specific calibration data,
and also a source domain selection (SDS) approach to save about half of the
computational cost of OwARR. Using a simulated driving dataset with 15
subjects, we show that OwARR and OwARR-SDS can achieve significantly smaller
estimation errors than several other approaches. We also provide comprehensive
analyses on the robustness of OwARR and OwARR-SDS.

 <dc:description>  A hybrid mobile/fixed device cloud that harnesses sensing, computing,
communication, and storage capabilities of mobile and fixed devices in the
field as well as those of computing and storage servers in remote datacenters
is envisioned. Mobile device clouds can be harnessed to enable innovative
pervasive applications that rely on real-time, in-situ processing of sensor
data collected in the field. To support concurrent mobile applications on the
device cloud, a robust and secure distributed computing framework, called
Maestro, is proposed. The key components of Maestro are (i) a task scheduling
mechanism that employs controlled task replication in addition to task
reallocation for robustness and (ii) Dedup for task deduplication among
concurrent pervasive workflows. An architecture-based solution that relies on
task categorization and authorized access to the categories of tasks is
proposed for different levels of protection. Experimental evaluation through
prototype testbed of Android- and Linux-based mobile devices as well as
simulations is performed to demonstrate Maestro's capabilities.

 <dc:description>  Electroencephalography (EEG) headsets are the most commonly used sensing
devices for Brain-Computer Interface. In real-world applications, there are
advantages to extrapolating data from one user session to another. However,
these advantages are limited if the data arise from different hardware systems,
which often vary between application spaces. Currently, this creates a need to
recalibrate classifiers, which negatively affects people's interest in using
such systems. In this paper, we employ active weighted adaptation
regularization (AwAR), which integrates weighted adaptation regularization
(wAR) and active learning, to expedite the calibration process. wAR makes use
of labeled data from the previous headset and handles class-imbalance, and
active learning selects the most informative samples from the new headset to
label. Experiments on single-trial event-related potential classification show
that AwAR can significantly increase the classification accuracy, given the
same number of labeled samples from the new headset. In other words, AwAR can
effectively reduce the number of labeled samples required from the new headset,
given a desired classification accuracy, suggesting value in collating data for
use in wide scale transfer-learning applications.

 <dc:description>  We propose PowerAlert, an efficient external integrity checker for untrusted
hosts. Current attestation systems suffer from shortcomings in requiring
complete checksum of the code segment, being static, use of timing information
sourced from the untrusted machine, or use of timing information with high
error (network round trip time). We address those shortcomings by (1) using
power measurements from the host to ensure that the checking code is executed
and (2) checking a subset of the kernel space over a long period of time. We
compare the power measurement against a learned power model of the execution of
the machine and validate that the execution was not tampered. Finally, power
diversifies the integrity checking program to prevent the attacker from
adapting. We implement a prototype of PowerAlert using Raspberry pi and
evaluate the performance of the integrity checking program generation. We model
the interaction between PowerAlert and an attacker as a game. We study the
effectiveness of the random initiation strategy in deterring the attacker. The
study shows that \power forces the attacker to trade-off stealthiness for the
risk of detection, while still maintaining an acceptable probability of
detection given the long lifespan of stealthy attacks.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a randomized algorithm for computing the near-optimal
low-rank dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). Randomized algorithms are emerging
techniques to compute low-rank matrix approximations. They are able to ease the
computational challenges arising in the area of big data. The idea is to derive
from the high-dimensional input matrix a smaller matrix, which is then used to
efficiently compute the dynamic modes and eigenvalues. The algorithm is
presented in a modular probabilistic framework, and the approximation quality
can be controlled via oversampling, and power iterations.

 <dc:description>  Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are frequently used in brain-computer
interfaces (BCIs), but they are easily contaminated by artifacts and noises, so
preprocessing must be done before they are fed into a machine learning
algorithm for classification or regression. Spatial filters have been widely
used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification
problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very
limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for
EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter
for classification, by making use of fuzzy sets. Experimental results on
EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected
143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17
subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial
filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO
and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the
spatial filters can reduce the root mean square estimation error by
10.02-19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true
response speed by 19.39-86.47%.

 <dc:description>  The global move towards efficient energy consumption and production has led
to remarkable advancements in the design of the smart grid infrastructure.
Local energy trading is one way forward. It typically refers to the transfer of
energy from an entity of the smart grid surplus energy to one with a deficit.
In this paper, we present a detailed review of the recent advances in the
application of game--theoretic methods to local energy trading scenarios. An
extensive description of a complete game theory-based energy trading framework
is presented. It includes a taxonomy of the methods and an introduction to the
smart grid architecture with a focus on renewable energy generation and energy
storage. Finally, we present a critical evaluation of the current shortcomings
and identify areas for future research.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach for facial action
unit detection by enhancing and cropping the regions of interest. The approach
is implemented by adding two novel nets (layers): the enhancing layers and the
cropping layers, to a pretrained CNN model. For the enhancing layers, we
designed an attention map based on facial landmark features and applied it to a
pretrained neural network to conduct enhanced learning (The E-Net). For the
cropping layers, we crop facial regions around the detected landmarks and
design convolutional layers to learn deeper features for each facial region
(C-Net). We then fuse the E-Net and the C-Net to obtain our Enhancing and
Cropping (EAC) Net, which can learn both feature enhancing and region cropping
functions. Our approach shows significant improvement in performance compared
to the state-of-the-art methods applied to BP4D and DISFA AU datasets.

 <dc:description>  The \emph{word problem} of a group $G = \langle \Sigma \rangle$ can be
defined as the set of formal words in $\Sigma^*$ that represent the identity in
$G$. When viewed as formal languages, this gives a strong connection between
classes of groups and classes of formal languages. For example, Anisimov showed
that a group is finite if and only if its word problem is a regular language,
and Muller and Schupp showed that a group is virtually-free if and only if its
word problem is a context-free language. Above this, not much was known, until
Salvati showed recently that the word problem of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ is a multiple
context-free language, giving first such example. We generalize Salvati's
result to show that the word problem of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is a multiple
context-free language for any $n$.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary robotics aims to automatically design autonomous adaptive
morphological robots that can evolve to accomplish a specific task while
adapting to environmental changes. Soft robotics have demonstrated the
feasibility of evolutionary robotics for the synthesis of robots control and
morphology. The motivation of developing evolutionary soft computing techniques
to that can generate task oriented structures for morphological robots makes
the domain of soft robotics worthy of serious investigation and research, and
hence this article summarizes an important volume of research for a
computational and software architecture perspective. This paper reviews the
literature and discusses various aspects of evolutionary robotics including the
application on morphological soft robots to allow self assembly, self
reconfiguration, self repair, and self reproduction. Then, major milestones are
outlined along with important morphological soft robotic prototypes due to
their importance in the field. Finally, the current state of the art in the
field is assessed.

 <dc:title>A Generalization of Permanent Inequalities and Applications in Counting

 <dc:description>  A polynomial $p\in\mathbb{R}[z_1,\dots,z_n]$ is real stable if it has no
roots in the upper-half complex plane. Gurvits's permanent inequality gives a
lower bound on the coefficient of the $z_1z_2\dots z_n$ monomial of a real
stable polynomial $p$ with nonnegative coefficients. This fundamental
inequality has been used to attack several counting and optimization problems.
  Here, we study a more general question: Given a stable multilinear polynomial
$p$ with nonnegative coefficients and a set of monomials $S$, we show that if
the polynomial obtained by summing up all monomials in $S$ is real stable, then
we can lowerbound the sum of coefficients of monomials of $p$ that are in $S$.
We also prove generalizations of this theorem to (real stable) polynomials that
are not multilinear. We use our theorem to give a new proof of Schrijver's
inequality on the number of perfect matchings of a regular bipartite graph,
generalize a recent result of Nikolov and Singh, and give deterministic
polynomial time approximation algorithms for several counting problems.

 <dc:title>What can the programming language Rust do for astrophysics?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The astrophysics community uses different tools for computational tasks such
as complex systems simulations, radiative transfer calculations or big data.
Programming languages like Fortran, C or C++ are commonly present in these
tools and, generally, the language choice was made based on the need for
performance. However, this comes at a cost: safety. For instance, a common
source of error is the access to invalid memory regions, which produces random
execution behaviors and affects the scientific interpretation of the results.
  In 2015, Mozilla Research released the first stable version of a new
programming language named Rust. Many features make this new language
attractive for the scientific community, it is open source and it guarantees
memory safety while offering zero-cost abstraction.
  We explore the advantages and drawbacks of Rust for astrophysics by
re-implementing the fundamental parts of Mercury-T, a Fortran code that
simulates the dynamical and tidal evolution of multi-planet systems.

 <dc:description>  We present a comparative analysis of the maximum performance achieved by the
Linpack benchmark on compute intensive hardware publicly available from
multiple cloud providers. We study both performance within a single compute
node, and speedup for distributed memory calculations with up to 32 nodes or at
least 512 computing cores. We distinguish between hyper-threaded and
non-hyper-threaded scenarios and estimate the performance per single computing
core. We also compare results with a traditional supercomputing system for
reference. Our findings provide a way to rank the cloud providers and
demonstrate the viability of the cloud for high performance computing
applications.

 <dc:title>The Price of Selection in Differential Privacy</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In the differentially private top-$k$ selection problem, we are given a
dataset $X \in \{\pm 1\}^{n \times d}$, in which each row belongs to an
individual and each column corresponds to some binary attribute, and our goal
is to find a set of $k \ll d$ columns whose means are approximately as large as
possible. Differential privacy requires that our choice of these $k$ columns
does not depend too much on any on individual's dataset. This problem can be
solved using the well known exponential mechanism and composition properties of
differential privacy. In the high-accuracy regime, where we require the error
of the selection procedure to be to be smaller than the so-called sampling
error $\alpha \approx \sqrt{\ln(d)/n}$, this procedure succeeds given a dataset
of size $n \gtrsim k \ln(d)$.
  We prove a matching lower bound, showing that a dataset of size $n \gtrsim k
\ln(d)$ is necessary for private top-$k$ selection in this high-accuracy
regime. Our lower bound is the first to show that selecting the $k$ largest
columns requires more data than simply estimating the value of those $k$
columns, which can be done using a dataset of size just $n \gtrsim k$.

 <dc:description>  We propose a formal approach for relating abstract separation logic library
specifications with the trace properties they enforce on interactions between a
client and a library. Separation logic with abstract predicates enforces a
resource discipline that constrains when and how calls may be made between a
client and a library. Intuitively, this can enforce a protocol on the
interaction trace. This intuition is broadly used in the separation logic
community but has not previously been formalised. We provide just such a
formalisation. Our approach is based on using wrappers which instrument library
code to induce execution traces for the properties under examination. By
considering a separation logic extended with trace resources, we prove that
when a library satisfies its separation logic specification then its wrapped
version satisfies the same specification and, moreover, maintains the trace
properties as an invariant. Consequently, any client and library implementation
that are correct with respect to the separation logic specification will
satisfy the trace properties.

 <dc:description>  Modern large-scale computing deployments consist of complex applications
running over machine clusters. An important issue in these is the offering of
elasticity, i.e., the dynamic allocation of resources to applications to meet
fluctuating workload demands. Threshold based approaches are typically
employed, yet they are difficult to configure and optimize. Approaches based on
reinforcement learning have been proposed, but they require a large number of
states in order to model complex application behavior. Methods that adaptively
partition the state space have been proposed, but their partitioning criteria
and strategies are sub-optimal. In this work we present MDP_DT, a novel
full-model based reinforcement learning algorithm for elastic resource
management that employs adaptive state space partitioning. We propose two novel
statistical criteria and three strategies and we experimentally prove that they
correctly decide both where and when to partition, outperforming existing
approaches. We experimentally evaluate MDP_DT in a real large scale cluster
over variable not-encountered workloads and we show that it takes more informed
decisions compared to static and model-free approaches, while requiring a
minimal amount of training data.

 <dc:title>Idiomatic and Reproducible Software Builds using Containers for Reliable
  Computing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Weber, Jonas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Containers as the unit of application delivery are the 'next big thing' in
the software development world. They enable developers to create an executable
image containing an application bundled with all its dependencies which a user
can run inside a controlled environment with virtualized resources. Complex
workflows for business-critical applications and research environments require
a high degree of reproducibility which can be accomplished using uniquely
identified images as units of computation.
  It will be shown in this thesis that the most widely used approaches to
create an image from pre-existing software or from source code lack the ability
to provide idiomaticity in their use of the technology as well as proper
reproducibility safe-guards. In the first part, existing approaches are
formalized and discussed and a new approach is introduced. The approaches are
then evaluated using a suite of three different examples.
  This thesis provides a framework for formalizing operations involving a
layered file system, containers and images, and a novel approach to the
creation of images using utility containers and layer donning fulfilling the
idiomaticity and reproducibility criteria.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Forward-looking ground-penetrating radar (FLGPR) has recently been
investigated as a remote sensing modality for buried target detection (e.g.,
landmines). In this context, raw FLGPR data is beamformed into images and then
computerized algorithms are applied to automatically detect subsurface buried
targets. Most existing algorithms are supervised, meaning they are trained to
discriminate between labeled target and non-target imagery, usually based on
features extracted from the imagery. A large number of features have been
proposed for this purpose, however thus far it is unclear which are the most
effective. The first goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive comparison
of detection performance using existing features on a large collection of FLGPR
data. Fusion of the decisions resulting from processing each feature is also
considered. The second goal of this work is to investigate two modern feature
learning approaches from the object recognition literature: the
bag-of-visual-words and the Fisher vector for FLGPR processing. The results
indicate that the new feature learning approaches outperform existing methods.
Results also show that fusion between existing features and new features yields
little additional performance improvements.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To estimate the value functions of policies from exploratory data, most
model-free off-policy algorithms rely on importance sampling, where the use of
importance sampling ratios often leads to estimates with severe variance. It is
thus desirable to learn off-policy without using the ratios. However, such an
algorithm does not exist for multi-step learning with function approximation.
In this paper, we introduce the first such algorithm based on
temporal-difference (TD) learning updates. We show that an explicit use of
importance sampling ratios can be eliminated by varying the amount of
bootstrapping in TD updates in an action-dependent manner. Our new algorithm
achieves stability using a two-timescale gradient-based TD update. A prior
algorithm based on lookup table representation called Tree Backup can also be
retrieved using action-dependent bootstrapping, becoming a special case of our
algorithm. In two challenging off-policy tasks, we demonstrate that our
algorithm is stable, effectively avoids the large variance issue, and can
perform substantially better than its state-of-the-art counterpart.

 <dc:description>  The convex hull of a planar point set is the smallest convex polygon
containing each point in the set. The dynamic convex hull problem concerns
efficiently maintaining the convex hull of a set of points subject to additions
and removals. One algorithm for this problem uses two external balanced binary
search trees (BSTs) (M. H. Overmars, J. van Leeuwen 1981). We present the first
concurrent solution for this problem, which uses a single BST that stores
references to intermediate convex hull solutions at each node. We implement and
evaluate two lock-based approaches: a) fine-grained locking, where each node of
the tree is protected by a lock, and b) &quot;finer-grained locking&quot;, where each
node contains a separate lock for each of the left and right chains. In our
throughput experiments, we observe that finer-grained locking yields an 8-60%
improvement over fine-grained locking, and a 38-61x improvement over
coarsegrained locking and software transactional memory (STM). When applied to
find the convex hull of static point sets, our approach outperforms a parallel
divide-and-conquer implementation by 2-4x using an equivalent number of
threads.

 <dc:description>  The principal mission of Multi-Source Multicast (MSM) is to disseminate all
messages from all sources in a network to all destinations. MSM is utilized in
numerous applications. In many of them, securing the messages disseminated is
critical. A common secure model is to consider a network where there is an
eavesdropper which is able to observe a subset of the network links, and seek a
code which keeps the eavesdropper ignorant regarding all the messages. While
this is solved when all messages are located at a single source, Secure MSM
(SMSM) is an open problem, and the rates required are hard to characterize in
general. In this paper, we consider Individual Security, which promises that
the eavesdropper has zero mutual information with each message individually. We
completely characterize the rate region for SMSM under individual security, and
show that such a security level is achievable at the full capacity of the
network, that is, the cut-set bound is the matching converse, similar to
non-secure MSM. Moreover, we show that the field size is similar to non-secure
MSM and does not have to be larger due to the security constraint.

 <dc:title>Elementary $L^\infty$ error estimates for super-resolution de-noising</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Weilin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of recovering a discrete complex measure on
the torus from a finite number of corrupted Fourier samples. We assume the
support of the unknown discrete measure satisfies a minimum separation
condition and we use convex regularization methods to recover approximations of
the original measure. We focus on two well-known convex regularization methods,
and for both, we establish an error estimate that bounds the smoothed-out error
in terms of the target resolution and noise level. Our $L^\infty$ approximation
rate is entirely new for one of the methods, and improves upon a previously
established $L^1$ estimate for the other. We provide a unified analysis and an
elementary proof of the theorem.

 <dc:description>  Accurate estimation of camera matrices is an important step in structure from
motion algorithms. In this paper we introduce a novel rank constraint on
collections of fundamental matrices in multi-view settings. We show that in
general, with the selection of proper scale factors, a matrix formed by
stacking fundamental matrices between pairs of images has rank 6. Moreover,
this matrix forms the symmetric part of a rank 3 matrix whose factors relate
directly to the corresponding camera matrices. We use this new characterization
to produce better estimations of fundamental matrices by optimizing an L1-cost
function using Iterative Re-weighted Least Squares and Alternate Direction
Method of Multiplier. We further show that this procedure can improve the
recovery of camera locations, particularly in multi-view settings in which
fewer images are available.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we enhance the traditional confusion network system
combination approach with an additional model trained by a neural network. This
work is motivated by the fact that the commonly used binary system voting
models only assign each input system a global weight which is responsible for
the global impact of each input system on all translations. This prevents
individual systems with low system weights from having influence on the system
combination output, although in some situations this could be helpful. Further,
words which have only been seen by one or few systems rarely have a chance of
being present in the combined output. We train a local system voting model by a
neural network which is based on the words themselves and the combinatorial
occurrences of the different system outputs. This gives system combination the
option to prefer other systems at different word positions even for the same
sentence.

 <dc:description>  Matrix games like Prisoner's Dilemma have guided research on social dilemmas
for decades. However, they necessarily treat the choice to cooperate or defect
as an atomic action. In real-world social dilemmas these choices are temporally
extended. Cooperativeness is a property that applies to policies, not
elementary actions. We introduce sequential social dilemmas that share the
mixed incentive structure of matrix game social dilemmas but also require
agents to learn policies that implement their strategic intentions. We analyze
the dynamics of policies learned by multiple self-interested independent
learning agents, each using its own deep Q-network, on two Markov games we
introduce here: 1. a fruit Gathering game and 2. a Wolfpack hunting game. We
characterize how learned behavior in each domain changes as a function of
environmental factors including resource abundance. Our experiments show how
conflict can emerge from competition over shared resources and shed light on
how the sequential nature of real world social dilemmas affects cooperation.

 <dc:description>  The follow the leader (FTL) algorithm, perhaps the simplest of all online
learning algorithms, is known to perform well when the loss functions it is
used on are convex and positively curved. In this paper we ask whether there
are other &quot;lucky&quot; settings when FTL achieves sublinear, &quot;small&quot; regret. In
particular, we study the fundamental problem of linear prediction over a
non-empty convex, compact domain. Amongst other results, we prove that the
curvature of the boundary of the domain can act as if the losses were curved:
In this case, we prove that as long as the mean of the loss vectors have
positive lengths bounded away from zero, FTL enjoys a logarithmic growth rate
of regret, while, e.g., for polytope domains and stochastic data it enjoys
finite expected regret. Building on a previously known meta-algorithm, we also
get an algorithm that simultaneously enjoys the worst-case guarantees and the
bound available for FTL.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on large-scale datasets have recently
achieved impressive improvements in face recognition. But a persistent
challenge remains to develop methods capable of handling large pose variations
that are relatively underrepresented in training data. This paper presents a
method for learning a feature representation that is invariant to pose, without
requiring extensive pose coverage in training data. We first propose to
generate non-frontal views from a single frontal face, in order to increase the
diversity of training data while preserving accurate facial details that are
critical for identity discrimination. Our next contribution is to seek a rich
embedding that encodes identity features, as well as non-identity ones such as
pose and landmark locations. Finally, we propose a new feature reconstruction
metric learning to explicitly disentangle identity and pose, by demanding
alignment between the feature reconstructions through various combinations of
identity and pose features, which is obtained from two images of the same
subject. Experiments on both controlled and in-the-wild face datasets, such as
MultiPIE, 300WLP and the profile view database CFP, show that our method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially on images with large
head pose variations. Detail results and resource are referred to

 <dc:description>  This paper presents incremental network quantization (INQ), a novel method,
targeting to efficiently convert any pre-trained full-precision convolutional
neural network (CNN) model into a low-precision version whose weights are
constrained to be either powers of two or zero. Unlike existing methods which
are struggled in noticeable accuracy loss, our INQ has the potential to resolve
this issue, as benefiting from two innovations. On one hand, we introduce three
interdependent operations, namely weight partition, group-wise quantization and
re-training. A well-proven measure is employed to divide the weights in each
layer of a pre-trained CNN model into two disjoint groups. The weights in the
first group are responsible to form a low-precision base, thus they are
quantized by a variable-length encoding method. The weights in the other group
are responsible to compensate for the accuracy loss from the quantization, thus
they are the ones to be re-trained. On the other hand, these three operations
are repeated on the latest re-trained group in an iterative manner until all
the weights are converted into low-precision ones, acting as an incremental
network quantization and accuracy enhancement procedure. Extensive experiments
on the ImageNet classification task using almost all known deep CNN
architectures including AlexNet, VGG-16, GoogleNet and ResNets well testify the
efficacy of the proposed method. Specifically, at 5-bit quantization, our
models have improved accuracy than the 32-bit floating-point references. Taking
ResNet-18 as an example, we further show that our quantized models with 4-bit,
3-bit and 2-bit ternary weights have improved or very similar accuracy against
its 32-bit floating-point baseline. Besides, impressive results with the
combination of network pruning and INQ are also reported. The code is available

 <dc:description>  Approximate message passing (AMP) is an algorithmic framework for solving
linear inverse problems from noisy measurements, with exciting applications
such as reconstructing images, audio, hyper spectral images, and various other
signals, including those acquired in compressive signal acquisiton systems. The
growing prevalence of big data systems has increased interest in large-scale
problems, which may involve huge measurement matrices that are unsuitable for
conventional computing systems. To address the challenge of large-scale
processing, multiprocessor (MP) versions of AMP have been developed. We provide
an overview of two such MP-AMP variants. In row-MP-AMP, each computing node
stores a subset of the rows of the matrix and processes corresponding
measurements. In column- MP-AMP, each node stores a subset of columns, and is
solely responsible for reconstructing a portion of the signal. We will discuss
pros and cons of both approaches, summarize recent research results for each,
and explain when each one may be a viable approach. Aspects that are
highlighted include some recent results on state evolution for both MP-AMP
algorithms, and the use of data compression to reduce communication in the MP
network.

 <dc:description>  Estimating expected polynomials of density functions from samples is a basic
problem with numerous applications in statistics and information theory.
Although kernel density estimators are widely used in practice for such
functional estimation problems, practitioners are left on their own to choose
an appropriate bandwidth for each application in hand. Further, kernel density
estimators suffer from boundary biases, which are prevalent in real world data
with lower dimensional structures. We propose using the fixed-k nearest
neighbor distances for the bandwidth, which adaptively adjusts to local
geometry. Further, we propose a novel estimator based on local likelihood
density estimators, that mitigates the boundary biases. Although such a choice
of fixed-k nearest neighbor distances to bandwidths results in inconsistent
estimators, we provide a simple debiasing scheme that precomputes the
asymptotic bias and divides off this term. With this novel correction, we show
consistency of this debiased estimator. We provide numerical experiments

 <dc:title>Feedback Capacity of Stationary Gaussian Channels Further Examined</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Tao</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Han, Guangyue</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well known that the problem of computing the feedback capacity of a
stationary Gaussian channel can be recast as an infinite-dimensional
optimization problem; moreover, necessary and sufficient conditions for the
optimality of a solution to this optimization problem have been characterized,
and based on this characterization, an explicit formula for the feedback
capacity has been given for the case that the noise is a first-order
autoregressive moving-average Gaussian process. In this paper, we further
examine the above-mentioned infinite-dimensional optimization problem. We prove
that unless the Gaussian noise is white, its optimal solution is unique, and we
propose an algorithm to recursively compute the unique optimal solution, which
is guaranteed to converge in theory and features an efficient implementation
for a suboptimal solution in practice. Furthermore, for the case that the noise
is a k-th order autoregressive moving-average Gaussian process, we give a
relatively more explicit formula for the feedback capacity; more specifically,
the feedback capacity is expressed as a simple function evaluated at a solution
to a system of polynomial equations, which is amenable to numerical computation
for the cases k=1, 2 and possibly beyond.

 <dc:title>Sparsity/Undersampling Tradeoffs in Anisotropic Undersampling, with
  Applications in MR Imaging/Spectroscopy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Monajemi, Hatef</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Donoho, David L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study anisotropic undersampling schemes like those used in
multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and MR imaging, which sample exhaustively in
certain time dimensions and randomly in others.
  Our analysis shows that anisotropic undersampling schemes are equivalent to
certain block-diagonal measurement systems. We develop novel exact formulas for
the sparsity/undersampling tradeoffs in such measurement systems. Our formulas
predict finite-$N$ phase transition behavior differing substantially from the
well known asymptotic phase transitions for classical Gaussian undersampling.
Extensive empirical work shows that our formulas accurately describe observed
finite-$N$ behavior, while the usual formulas based on universality are
substantially inaccurate.
  We also vary the anisotropy, keeping the total number of samples fixed, and
for each variation we determine the precise sparsity/undersampling tradeoff
(phase transition). We show that, other things being equal, the ability to
recover a sparse object decreases with an increasing number of
exhaustively-sampled dimensions.

 <dc:title>Dynamic Switch-Controller Association and Control Devolution for SDN

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In software-defined networking (SDN), as data plane scale expands,
scalability and reliability of the control plane have become major concerns. To
mitigate such concerns, two kinds of solutions have been proposed separately.
One is multi- controller architecture, i.e., a logically centralized control
plane with physically distributed controllers. The other is control devolution,
i.e., delegating control of some flows back to switches. Most of existing
solutions adopt either static switch-controller association or static
devolution, which may not adapt well to the traffic variation, leading to high
communication costs between switches and controller, and high computation costs
of switches. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to jointly consider both
solutions, i.e., we dynamically associate switches with controllers and
dynamically devolve control of flows to switches. Our scheme is an efficient
online algorithm that does not need the statistics of traffic flows. By
adjusting a parameter, we can make a trade- off between costs and queue
backlogs. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations show that our scheme
yields much lower costs or latency compared to other schemes, as well as
balanced loads among controllers.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider challenges relating to security for Industrial
Control Systems (ICS) in the context of ICS security education and research
targeted both to academia and industry. We propose to address those challenges
through gamified attack training and countermeasure evaluation. We tested our
proposed ICS security gamification idea in the context of the (to the best of
our knowledge) first Capture-The-Flag (CTF) event targeted to ICS security
called SWaT Security Showdown (S3). Six teams acted as attackers in a security
competition leveraging an ICS testbed, with several academic defense systems
attempting to detect the ongoing attacks. The event was conducted in two
phases. The online phase (a jeopardy-style CTF) served as a training session.
The live phase was structured as an attack-defense CTF. We acted as judges and
we assigned points to the attacker teams according to a scoring system that we
developed internally based on multiple factors, including realistic attacker
models. We conclude the paper with an evaluation and discussion of the S3,
including statistics derived from the data collected in each phase of S3.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new resilience optimal Byzantine consensus algorithm
targeting consortium blockchains. To this end, it first revisits the consensus
validity property by requiring that the decided value satisfies a predefined
predicate, which does not systematically exclude a value proposed only by
Byzantine processes, thereby generalizing the validity properties found in the
literature. Then the paper presents a simple and modular Byzantine consensus
algorithm that relies neither on a leader, nor on signatures, nor on
randomization. It consists of a reduction of multivalued Byzantine consensus to
binary Byzantine consensus satisfying this validity property. This reduction
terminates after a constant-sized sequence of binary Byzantine consensus
instances. The idea is to spawn concurrent instances of binary consensus but to
decide only after a sequence of two of these instances. The binary consensus
instances result in a bitmask that the reduction applies to a vector of
multivalued proposals to filter out a valid proposed value that is decided. The
paper then presents an underlying binary Byzantine consensus algorithm that
assumes eventual synchrony to terminate.

 <dc:title>PCA in Data-Dependent Noise (Correlated-PCA): Nearly Optimal Finite

 <dc:description>  We study Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a setting where a part of the
corrupting noise is data-dependent and, as a result, the noise and the true
data are correlated. Under a bounded-ness assumption on the true data and the
noise, and a simple assumption on data-noise correlation, we obtain a nearly
optimal sample complexity bound for the most commonly used PCA solution,
singular value decomposition (SVD). This bound is a significant improvement
over the bound obtained by Vaswani and Guo in recent work (NIPS 2016) where
this &quot;correlated-PCA&quot; problem was first studied; and it holds under a
significantly weaker data-noise correlation assumption than the one used for
this earlier result.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes to use distributed representation of words (word
embeddings) in cross-language textual similarity detection. The main
contributions of this paper are the following: (a) we introduce new
cross-language similarity detection methods based on distributed representation
of words; (b) we combine the different methods proposed to verify their
complementarity and finally obtain an overall F1 score of 89.15% for
English-French similarity detection at chunk level (88.5% at sentence level) on
a very challenging corpus.

occurs at most once and linear $\lambda$-terms are $\lambda$-terms in which
each bound variables occurs once. and only once. In this paper we count the
number of closed affine $\lambda$-terms of size $n$, closed linear
$\lambda$-terms of size $n$, affine $\beta$-normal forms of size $n$ and linear
$\beta$-normal forms of ise $n$, for different ways of measuring the size of
$\lambda$-terms. From these formulas, we show how we can derive programs for
generating all the terms of size $n$ for each class. For this we use a specific
data structure, which are contexts taking into account all the holes at levels
of abstractions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the most common ABox reasoning services for the
description logic $\dlssx$ ($\shdlssx$, for short) and prove their decidability
via a reduction to the satisfiability problem for the set-theoretic fragment
\flqsr. The description logic $\shdlssx$ is very expressive, as it admits
various concept and role constructs, and data types, that allow one to
represent rule-based languages such as SWRL. Decidability results are achieved
by defining a generalization of the conjunctive query answering problem, called
HOCQA (Higher Order Conjunctive Query Answering), that can be instantiated to
the most wide\-spread ABox reasoning tasks. We also present a \ke\space based
procedure for calculating the answer set from $\shdlssx$ knowledge bases and
higher order $\shdlssx$ conjunctive queries, thus providing means for reasoning
on several well-known ABox reasoning tasks. Our calculus extends a previously
introduced \ke\space based decision procedure for the CQA problem.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the two dimensional (2-D) predecessor-following
control problem for a platoon of unicycle vehicles moving on a planar surface.
More specifically, we design a decentralized kinematic control protocol, in the
sense that each vehicle calculates its own control signal based solely on local
information regarding its preceding vehicle, by its on-board camera, without
incorporating any velocity measurements. Additionally, the transient and steady
state response is a priori determined by certain designer-specified performance
functions and is fully decoupled by the number of vehicles composing the
platoon and the control gains selection. Moreover, collisions between
successive vehicles as well as connectivity breaks, owing to the limited field
of view of cameras, are provably avoided. Finally, an extensive simulation
study is carried out in the WEBOTS realistic simulator, clarifying the proposed
control scheme and verifying its effectiveness.

 <dc:description>  In this article we study the minimum number $\kappa$ of additional automata
that a Boolean automata network (BAN) associated with a given block-sequential
update schedule needs in order to simulate a given BAN with a parallel update
schedule. We introduce a graph that we call $\mathsf{NECC}$ graph built from
the BAN and the update schedule. We show the relation between $\kappa$ and the
chromatic number of the $\mathsf{NECC}$ graph. Thanks to this $\mathsf{NECC}$
graph, we bound $\kappa$ in the worst case between $n/2$ and $2n/3+2$ ($n$
being the size of the BAN simulated) and we conjecture that this number equals
$n/2$. We support this conjecture with two results: the clique number of a
$\mathsf{NECC}$ graph is always less than or equal to $n/2$ and, for the
subclass of bijective BANs, $\kappa$ is always less than or equal to $n/2+1$.

new graph-based transforms and wavelets for image / video coding, where the
underlying graph describes inter-pixel correlations. In this paper, we develop
a new transform called signed graph Fourier transform (SGFT), where the
underlying graph G contains negative edges that describe anti-correlations
between pixel pairs. Specifically, we first construct a one-state Markov
process that models both inter-pixel correlations and anti-correlations. We
then derive the corresponding precision matrix, and show that the loopy graph
Laplacian matrix Q of a graph G with a negative edge and two self-loops at its
end nodes is approximately equivalent. This proves that the eigenvectors of Q -
called SGFT - approximates the optimal Karhunen-Lo`eve Transform (KLT). We show
the importance of the self-loops in G to ensure Q is positive semi-definite. We
prove that the first eigenvector of Q is piecewise constant (PWC), and thus can
well approximate a piecewise smooth (PWS) signal like a depth image.
Experimental results show that a block-based coding scheme based on SGFT
outperforms a previous scheme using graph transforms with only positive edges
for several depth images.

 <dc:description>  Given an $n$-point metric space, consider the problem of finding a point with
the minimum sum of distances to all points. We show that this problem has a
randomized algorithm that {\em always} outputs a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate
solution in an expected $O(n/\epsilon^2)$ time for each constant $\epsilon&gt;0$.
Inheriting Indyk's algorithm, our algorithm outputs a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $1$-median in $O(n/\epsilon^2)$ time with
probability $\Omega(1)$.

 <dc:title>Next Generation Crowdsourcing for Collective Intelligence</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  New techniques leveraging IT-mediated crowds such as Crowdsensing, Situated
Crowdsourcing, Spatial Crowdsourcing, and Wearables Crowdsourcing have now
materially emerged. These techniques, here termed next generation
Crowdsourcing, serve to extend Crowdsourcing efforts beyond the heretofore
dominant desktop computing paradigm. Employing new configurations of hardware,
software, and people, these techniques represent new forms of organization for
IT-mediated crowds. However, it is not known how these new techniques change
the processes and outcomes of IT-mediated crowds for Collective Intelligence
purposes? The aim of this exploratory work is to begin to answer this question.
The work ensues by outlining the relevant findings of the first generation
Crowdsourcing paradigm, before reviewing the emerging literature pertaining to
the new generation of Crowdsourcing techniques. Premised on this review, a
collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive typology is formed, organizing
the next generation Crowdsourcing techniques along two salient dimensions
common to all first generation Crowdsourcing techniques. As a result, this work
situates the next generation Crowdsourcing techniques within the extant
Crowdsourcing literature, and identifies new research avenues stemming directly
from the analysis.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports a large-scale study that aims to understand how mobile
application (app) vulnerabilities are associated with software libraries. We
analyze both free and paid apps. Studying paid apps was quite meaningful
because it helped us understand how differences in app development/maintenance
affect the vulnerabilities associated with libraries. We analyzed 30k free and
paid apps collected from the official Android marketplace. Our extensive
analyses revealed that approximately 70%/50% of vulnerabilities of free/paid
apps stem from software libraries, particularly from third-party libraries.
Somewhat paradoxically, we found that more expensive/popular paid apps tend to
have more vulnerabilities. This comes from the fact that more expensive/popular
paid apps tend to have more functionality, i.e., more code and libraries, which
increases the probability of vulnerabilities. Based on our findings, we provide
suggestions to stakeholders of mobile app distribution ecosystems.

 <dc:title>Texture Characterization by Using Shape Co-occurrence Patterns</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Texture characterization is a key problem in image understanding and pattern
recognition. In this paper, we present a flexible shape-based texture
representation using shape co-occurrence patterns. More precisely, texture
images are first represented by tree of shapes, each of which is associated
with several geometrical and radiometric attributes. Then four typical kinds of
shape co-occurrence patterns based on the hierarchical relationship of the
shapes in the tree are learned as codewords. Three different coding methods are
investigated to learn the codewords, with which, any given texture image can be
encoded into a descriptive vector. In contrast with existing works, the
proposed method not only inherits the strong ability to depict geometrical
aspects of textures and the high robustness to variations of imaging conditions
from the shape-based method, but also provides a flexible way to consider shape
relationships and to compute high-order statistics on the tree. To our
knowledge, this is the first time to use co-occurrence patterns of explicit
shapes as a tool for texture analysis. Experiments on various texture datasets
and scene datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

 <dc:title>Sigmoid-Weighted Linear Units for Neural Network Function Approximation

 <dc:description>  In recent years, neural networks have enjoyed a renaissance as function
approximators in reinforcement learning. Two decades after Tesauro's TD-Gammon
achieved near top-level human performance in backgammon, the deep reinforcement
learning algorithm DQN achieved human-level performance in many Atari 2600
games. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, we propose two activation
functions for neural network function approximation in reinforcement learning:
the sigmoid-weighted linear unit (SiLU) and its derivative function (dSiLU).
The activation of the SiLU is computed by the sigmoid function multiplied by
its input. Second, we suggest that the more traditional approach of using
on-policy learning with eligibility traces, instead of experience replay, and
softmax action selection with simple annealing can be competitive with DQN,
without the need for a separate target network. We validate our proposed
approach by, first, achieving new state-of-the-art results in both stochastic
SZ-Tetris and Tetris with a small 10$\times$10 board, using TD($\lambda$)
learning and shallow dSiLU network agents, and, then, by outperforming DQN in
the Atari 2600 domain by using a deep Sarsa($\lambda$) agent with SiLU and
dSiLU hidden units.

 <dc:description>  Recent research in psycholinguistics has provided increasing evidence that
humans predict upcoming content. Prediction also affects perception and might
be a key to robustness in human language processing. In this paper, we
investigate the factors that affect human prediction by building a
computational model that can predict upcoming discourse referents based on
linguistic knowledge alone vs. linguistic knowledge jointly with common-sense
knowledge in the form of scripts. We find that script knowledge significantly
improves model estimates of human predictions. In a second study, we test the
highly controversial hypothesis that predictability influences referring
expression type but do not find evidence for such an effect.

 <dc:title>The Potential of Using Large Antenna Arrays on Intelligent Surfaces</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider capacities of single-antenna terminals
communicating to large antenna arrays that are deployed on surfaces. That is,
the entire surface is used as an intelligent receiving antenna array. Under the
condition that the surface area is sufficiently large, the received signal
after matched-filtering (MF) can be well approximated by an intersymbol
interference (ISI) channel where channel taps are closely related to a sinc
function. Based on such an approximation, we have derived the capacities for
both one-dimensional (terminals on a line) and high dimensional (terminals on a
plane or in a cube) terminal-deployments. In particular, we analyze the
normalized capacity $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$, measured in nats/s/Hz/m$^2$, under the
constraint that the transmit power per m$^2$, $\bar{P}$, is fixed. We show that
when the user-density increases, the limit of $\bar{\mathcal{C}}$, achieved as
the wavelength $\lambda$ approaches 0, is $\bar{P}/(2N_0)$ nats/s/Hz/m$^2$,
where $N_0$ is the spatial power spectral density (PSD) of noise. In addition,
we also show that the number of signal dimensions is $2/\lambda$ per meter
deployed surface for the one-dimensional case, and $\pi/\lambda^2$ per m$^2$
deployed surface for two and three dimensional terminal-deployments.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the potential for positioning with a system where antenna arrays
are deployed as a large intelligent surface (LIS). We derive
Fisher-informations and Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bounds (CRLB) in closed-form for
terminals along the central perpendicular line (CPL) of the LIS for all three
Cartesian dimensions. For terminals at positions other than the CPL,
closed-form expressions for the Fisher-informations and CRLBs seem out of
reach, and we alternatively provide approximations (in closed-form) which are
shown to be very accurate. We also show that under mild conditions, the CRLBs
in general decrease quadratically in the surface-area for both the $x$ and $y$
dimensions. For the $z$-dimension (distance from the LIS), the CRLB decreases
linearly in the surface-area when terminals are along the CPL. However, when
terminals move away from the CPL, the CRLB is dramatically increased and then
also decreases quadratically in the surface-area. We also extensively discuss
the impact of different deployments (centralized and distributed) of the LIS.

 <dc:description>  In 1973, L.A. Levin published an algorithm that solves any inversion problem
$\pi$ as quickly as the fastest algorithm $p^*$ computing a solution for $\pi$
in time bounded by $2^{l(p^*)}.t^*$, where $l(p^*)$ is the length of the binary
encoding of $p^*$, and $t^*$ is the runtime of $p^*$ plus the time to verify
its correctness. In 2002, M. Hutter published an algorithm that solves any
well-defined problem $\pi$ as quickly as the fastest algorithm $p^*$ computing
a solution for $\pi$ in time bounded by $5.t_{p}(x)+d_p.time_{t_{p}}(x)+c_p$,
where $d_p=40.2^{l(p)+l(t_{p})}$ and $c_p=40.2^{l(f)+1}.O(l(f)^2)$, where
$l(f)$ is the length of the binary encoding of a proof $f$ that produces a pair
$(p,t_p)$, where $t_p(x)$ is a provable time bound on the runtime of the
fastest program $p$ provably equivalent to $p^*$. In this paper, we rewrite
Levin Search using the ideas of Hutter so that we have a new simple algorithm
that solves any well-defined problem $\pi$ as quickly as the fastest algorithm
$p^*$ computing a solution for $\pi$ in time bounded by $O(l(f)^2).t_p(x)$.

 <dc:description>  Minimal perfect hash functions provide space-efficient and collision-free
hashing on static sets. Existing algorithms and implementations that build such
functions have practical limitations on the number of input elements they can
process, due to high construction time, RAM or external memory usage. We
revisit a simple algorithm and show that it is highly competitive with the
state of the art, especially in terms of construction time and memory usage. We
provide a parallel C++ implementation called BBhash. It is capable of creating
a minimal perfect hash function of $10^{10}$ elements in less than 7 minutes
using 8 threads and 5 GB of memory, and the resulting function uses 3.7
bits/element. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first
implementation that has been successfully tested on an input of cardinality
$10^{12}$. Source code: https://github.com/rizkg/BBHash

 <dc:title>A short introduction to secrecy and verifiability for elections</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We explore the fundamental properties that are necessary to ensure that
election schemes behave as expected. The exploration reveals how our
understanding of those expectations has evolved, culminating in the emergence
of formal definitions of properties necessary to fulfil expectations. We
provide insights into definitions of secrecy and verifiability, allowing us to
learn and appreciate the underlying intuition and technical details of these
notions.
  Equipped with definitions, we can build election schemes that can be proven
to behave as expected. And, as an illustrative example, we review a variant of
the Helios election system that was built and proven secure, in this way.
Furthermore, the definitions can be used to analyse existing election schemes,
and vulnerabilities have been uncovered. Indeed, we describe a series of
vulnerabilities that were discovered during the analysis of the original Helios
system, which advanced our understanding of system behaviour and prompted the
design of the aforementioned variant.
  Thus, this article contributes to the science of security by sharing valuable
insights into elections, and demonstrating the value that formal definitions
and analysis have in building schemes guaranteed to behave as expected.

 <dc:description>  Change detection in heterogeneous multitemporal satellite images is a
challenging and still not much studied topic in remote sensing and earth
observation. This paper focuses on comparison of image pairs covering the same
geographical area and acquired by two different sensors, one optical radiometer
and one synthetic aperture radar, at two different times. We propose a
clustering-based technique to detect changes, identified as clusters that split
or merge in the different images. To evaluate potentials and limitations of our
method, we perform experiments on real data. Preliminary results confirm the
relationship between splits and merges of clusters and the occurrence of
changes. However, it becomes evident that it is necessary to incorporate prior,
ancillary, or application-specific information to improve the interpretation of
clustering results and to identify unambiguously the areas of change.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper contributes to a development of randomized methods for neural
networks. The proposed learner model is generated incrementally by stochastic
configuration (SC) algorithms, termed as Stochastic Configuration Networks
(SCNs). In contrast to the existing randomised learning algorithms for single
layer feed-forward neural networks (SLFNNs), we randomly assign the input
weights and biases of the hidden nodes in the light of a supervisory mechanism,
and the output weights are analytically evaluated in either constructive or
selective manner. As fundamentals of SCN-based data modelling techniques, we
establish some theoretical results on the universal approximation property.
Three versions of SC algorithms are presented for regression problems
(applicable for classification problems as well) in this work. Simulation
results concerning both function approximation and real world data regression
indicate some remarkable merits of our proposed SCNs in terms of less human
intervention on the network size setting, the scope adaptation of random
parameters, fast learning and sound generalization.

 <dc:title>The Stochastic Shortest Path Problem : A polyhedral combinatorics

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give a new framework for the stochastic shortest path
problem in finite state and action spaces. Our framework generalizes both the
frameworks proposed by Bertsekas and Tsitsikli and by Bertsekas and Yu. We
prove that the problem is well-defined and (weakly) polynomial when (i) there
is a way to reach the target state from any initial state and (ii) there is no
transition cycle of negative costs (a generalization of negative cost cycles).
These assumptions generalize the standard assumptions for the deterministic
shortest path problem and our framework encapsulates the latter problem (in
contrast with prior works). In this new setting, we can show that (a) one can
restrict to deterministic and stationary policies, (b) the problem is still
(weakly) polynomial through linear programming, (c) Value Iteration and Policy
Iteration converge, and (d) we can extend Dijkstra's algorithm.

 <dc:title>On 2-level polytopes arising in combinatorial settings</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Aprile, Manuel</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  2-level polytopes naturally appear in several areas of pure and applied
mathematics, including combinatorial optimization, polyhedral combinatorics,
communication complexity, and statistics. In this paper, we present a study of
some 2-level polytopes arising in combinatorial settings. Our first
contribution is proving that v(P)*f(P) is upper bounded by d*2^(d+1), for a
large collection of families of such polytopes P. Here v(P) (resp. f(P)) is the
number of vertices (resp. facets) of P, and d is its dimension. Whether this
holds for all 2-level polytopes was asked in [Bohn et al., ESA 2015], and
experimental results from [Fiorini et al., ISCO 2016] showed it true up to
dimension 7. The key to most of our proofs is a deeper understanding of the
relations among those polytopes and their underlying combinatorial structures.
This leads to a number of results that we believe to be of independent
interest: a trade-off formula for the number of cliques and stable sets in a
graph; a description of stable matching polytopes as affine projections of
certain order polytopes; and a linear-size description of the base polytope of
matroids that are 2-level in terms of cuts of an associated tree.

 <dc:description>  Many recent deep learning platforms rely on third-party libraries (such as
cuBLAS) to utilize the computing power of modern hardware accelerators (such as
GPUs). However, we observe that they may achieve suboptimal performance because
the library functions are not used appropriately. In this paper, we target at
optimizing the operations of multiplying a matrix with the transpose of another
matrix (referred to as NT operation hereafter), which contribute about half of
the training time of fully connected deep neural networks. Rather than directly
calling the library function, we propose a supervised learning based algorithm
selection approach named MTNN, which uses a gradient boosted decision tree to
select one from two alternative NT implementations intelligently: (1) calling
the cuBLAS library function; (2) calling our proposed algorithm TNN that uses
an efficient out-of-place matrix transpose. We evaluate the performance of MTNN
on two modern GPUs: NVIDIA GTX 1080 and NVIDIA Titan X Pascal. MTNN can achieve
96\% of prediction accuracy with very low computational overhead, which results
in an average of 54\% performance improvement on a range of NT operations. To
further evaluate the impact of MTNN on the training process of deep neural
networks, we have integrated MTNN into a popular deep learning platform Caffe.
Our experimental results show that the revised Caffe can outperform the
original one by an average of 28\%. Both MTNN and the revised Caffe are
open-source.

 <dc:description>  Universal Dependencies (UD) offer a uniform cross-lingual syntactic
representation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications. Recent
work shows that semantic parsing can be accomplished by transforming syntactic
dependencies to logical forms. However, this work is limited to English, and
cannot process dependency graphs, which allow handling complex phenomena such
as control. In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a semantic interface for UD,
which maps natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent
fashion and can process dependency graphs. We perform experiments on question
answering against Freebase and provide German and Spanish translations of the
WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets to facilitate multilingual evaluation.
Results show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and
datasets. For English, it achieves a 4.9 F1 point improvement over the
state-of-the-art on GraphQuestions. Our code and data can be downloaded at

 <dc:description>  The social media network phenomenon leads to a massive amount of valuable
data that is available online and easy to access. Many users share images,
videos, comments, reviews, news and opinions on different social networks
sites, with Twitter being one of the most popular ones. Data collected from
Twitter is highly unstructured, and extracting useful information from tweets
is a challenging task. Twitter has a huge number of Arabic users who mostly
post and write their tweets using the Arabic language. While there has been a
lot of research on sentiment analysis in English, the amount of researches and
datasets in Arabic language is limited. This paper introduces an Arabic
language dataset which is about opinions on health services and has been
collected from Twitter. The paper will first detail the process of collecting
the data from Twitter and also the process of filtering, pre-processing and
annotating the Arabic text in order to build a big sentiment analysis dataset
in Arabic. Several Machine Learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Support Vector
Machine and Logistic Regression) alongside Deep and Convolutional Neural
Networks were utilized in our experiments of sentiment analysis on our health
dataset.

 <dc:title>Exploiting QoS Flexibility for Smart Grid and IoT Applications Using TV
  White Spaces: Extended Version</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the utilization of TV White Spaces (TVWS) by small
Cognitive Radio (CR) wireless network operators (SCWNO) to support the
communication needs of various smart grid and internet of things (IoT)
applications. Spectrum leasing could be essential for SCWNO to support a wide
range of applications. In our paper, we assume that in order to ensure Quality
of service (QoS) requirements, the CR operator has the option of leasing the
specially designated high priority TVWS channels (HPC) for short term use by
paying a small fee according to the actual usage. Based on Lyapunov drift plus
penalty function framework, we develop an online algorithm to exploit QoS
flexibility. Such flexibility might be available in terms of data transmission
delays as well as data quality reduction in order to minimize the overall HPC
leasing cost. The developed algorithm also provides three adjustable parameters
that could be controlled to tradeoff the total cost and QoS. The performance of
the proposed algorithm is very close to the optimal offline lower bound
solution.

 <dc:description>  Optical interconnect is a potential solution to attain the large bandwidth
on-chip communications needed in high performance computers in a low power and
low cost manner. Mode-division multiplexing (MDM) is an emerging technology
that scales the capacity of a single wavelength carrier by the number of modes
in a multimode waveguide, and is attractive as a cost-effective means for high
bandwidth density on-chip communications. Advanced modulation formats with high
spectral efficiency in MDM networks can further improve the data rates of the
optical link. Here, we demonstrate an intra-chip MDM communications link
employing advanced modulation formats with two waveguide modes. We demonstrate
a compact single wavelength carrier link that is expected to support 2x100 Gb/s
mode multiplexed capacity. The network comprised integrated microring
modulators at the transmitter, mode multiplexers, multimode waveguide
interconnect, mode demultiplexers and integrated germanium on silicon
photodetectors. Each of the mode channels achieves 100 Gb/s line rate with 84
Gb/s net payload data rate at 7% overhead for hard-decision forward error
correction (HD-FEC) in the OFDM/16-QAM signal transmission.

 <dc:title>Coherence number as a discrete quantum resource</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chin, Seungbeom</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new discrete coherence monotone named the \emph{coherence
number}, which is a generalization of the coherence rank to mixed states. After
defining the coherence number in a similar manner to the Schmidt number in
entanglement theory, we present a necessary and sufficient condition of the
coherence number for a coherent state to be converted to an entangled state of
nonzero $k$-concurrence (a member of the generalized concurrence family with
$2\le k \le d$). It also turns out that the coherence number is a useful
measure to understand the process of Grover search algorithm of $N$ items. We
show that the coherence number remains $N$ and falls abruptly when the success
probability of the searching process becomes maximal. This phenomenon motivates
us to analyze the depletion pattern of $C_c^{(N)}$ (the last member of the
generalized coherence concurrence, nonzero when the coherence number is $N$),
which turns out to be an optimal resource for the process since it is
completely consumed to finish the searching task.

 <dc:description>  The continuously increasing cost of the US healthcare system has received
significant attention. Central to the ideas aimed at curbing this trend is the
use of technology, in the form of the mandate to implement electronic health
records (EHRs). EHRs consist of patient information such as demographics,
medications, laboratory test results, diagnosis codes and procedures. Mining
EHRs could lead to improvement in patient health management as EHRs contain
detailed information related to disease prognosis for large patient
populations. In this manuscript, we provide a structured and comprehensive
overview of data mining techniques for modeling EHR data. We first provide a
detailed understanding of the major application areas to which EHR mining has
been applied and then discuss the nature of EHR data and its accompanying
challenges. Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR mining, the metrics
associated with EHRs, and the various study designs. With this foundation, we
then provide a systematic and methodological organization of existing data
mining techniques used to model EHRs and discuss ideas for future research. We
conclude this survey with a comprehensive summary of clinical data mining
applications of EHR data, as illustrated in the online supplement.

consume, join the labor market and trade houses. A single consumption tax is
collected by municipalities that invest back into quality of life improvements.
We test whether a single metropolitan government - which is an aggregation of
municipalities - would be in the best interest of its citizens. Preliminary
results for 20 simulation runs indicate that it may be the case. Future
developments include improving performance to enable running of higher
percentage of the population and a number of runs that make the model more
robust.

 <dc:description>  Cell-Free Massive MIMO comprises a large number of distributed single-antenna
access points (APs) serving a much smaller number of users. There is no
partitioning into cells and each user is served by all APs.
  In this paper, the uplink performance of cell-free systems with minimum mean
squared error (MMSE) and large scale fading decoding (LSFD) receivers is
investigated. The main idea of LSFD receiver is to maximize achievable
throughput using only large scale fading coefficients between APs and users.
Capacity lower bounds for MMSE and LSFD receivers are derived. An asymptotic
approximation for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of MMSE
receiver is derived as a function of large scale fading coefficients only. The
obtained approximation is accurate even for a small number of antennas. MMSE
and LSFD receivers demonstrate five-fold and two-fold gains respectively over
matched filter (MF) receiver in terms of 5%-outage rate.

 <dc:description>  Social media are transforming global communication and coordination. The data
derived from social media can reveal patterns of human behavior at all levels
and scales of society. Using geolocated Twitter data, we have quantified
collective behaviors across multiple scales, ranging from the commutes of
individuals, to the daily pulse of 50 major urban areas and global patterns of
human coordination. Human activity and mobility patterns manifest the synchrony
required for contingency of actions between individuals. Urban areas show
regular cycles of contraction and expansion that resembles heartbeats linked
primarily to social rather than natural cycles. Business hours and circadian
rhythms influence daily cycles of work, recreation, and sleep. Different urban
areas have characteristic signatures of daily collective activities. The
differences are consistent with a new emergent global synchrony that couples
behavior in distant regions across the world. A globally synchronized peak that
includes exchange of ideas and information across Europe, Africa, Asia and
Australasia. We propose a dynamical model to explain the emergence of global
synchrony in the context of increasing global communication and reproduce the
observed behavior. The collective patterns we observe show how social
interactions lead to interdependence of behavior manifest in the
synchronization of communication. The creation and maintenance of temporally
sensitive social relationships results in the emergence of complexity of the
larger scale behavior of the social system.

 <dc:description>  A binary triangle of size $n$ is a triangle of zeroes and ones, with $n$
rows, built with the same local rule as the standard Pascal triangle modulo
$2$. A binary triangle is said to be balanced if the absolute difference
between the numbers of zeroes and ones that constitute this triangle is at most
$1$. In this paper, the existence of balanced binary triangles of size $n$, for
all positive integers $n$, is shown. This is achieved by considering periodic
balanced binary triangles, that are balanced binary triangles where each row,
column or diagonal is a periodic sequence.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the achievable rate of LOS MIMO systems that use
1-bit quantization and spatial oversampling at the receiver. We propose that by
using additional antennas at the receiver, the loss incurred due to the strong
limitation of the quantization can be decreased. Mutual information results
show that considerable rate gains can be achieved depending on the number and
arrangement of the antennas. In some of the cases, even the full available rate
from the transmitter can be attained. Furthermore, the results also reveal that
two-dimensional antenna arrays can benefit more from spatial oversampling than
one-dimensional arrays, when using 1-bit quantization in the LOS MIMO scenario.

 <dc:title>Towards Developing an Easy-To-Use Scripting Environment for Animating
  Virtual Characters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mousas, Christos</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Graphics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the three scripting commands and main functionalities of
a novel character animation environment called CHASE. CHASE was developed for
enabling inexperienced programmers, animators, artists, and students to animate
in meaningful ways virtual reality characters. This is achieved by scripting
simple commands within CHASE. The commands identified, which are associated
with simple parameters, are responsible for generating a number of predefined
motions and actions of a character. Hence, the virtual character is able to
animate within a virtual environment and to interact with tasks located within
it. An additional functionality of CHASE is supplied. It provides the ability
to generate multiple tasks of a character, such as providing the user the
ability to generate scenario-related animated sequences. However, since
multiple characters may require simultaneous animation, the ability to script
actions of different characters at the same time is also provided.

 <dc:title>A Novel Hybrid Approach Using SMS and ROCOF for Islanding Detection of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach for islanding detection of
inverter-based distributed generations (DG) based on combination of the Slip
mode frequency-shift (SMS) as an active and rate of change of frequency (ROCOF)
relay and over/under frequency relay as passive methods. This approach is
utilized to force the DG to lose its stable operation and drift the frequency
out of the allowed range of the frequency threshold. Performance of the
proposed approach is evaluated under the IEEE 1547, UL 1741 and multiple-DG
operation. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach for detection of islanding, especially for loads with high quality
factor. It operates accurately under the condition of load switching and does
not interfere with the power system operation during normal condition. In other
words, not only it holds the benefits of both SMS and ROCOF, but also it
removes their drawbacks by having less non-detection zone and faster response.

 <dc:description>  In index modulation schemes, information bits are conveyed through indexing
of transmission entities such as antennas, subcarriers, times slots, precoders,
subarrays, and radio frequency (RF) mirrors. Index modulation schemes are
attractive for their advantages such as good performance, high rates, and
hardware simplicity. This paper focuses on index modulation schemes in which
multiple transmission entities, namely, {\em antennas}, {\em time slots}, and
{\em RF mirrors}, are indexed {\em simultaneously}. Recognizing that such
multidimensional index modulation schemes encourage sparsity in their transmit
signal vectors, we propose efficient signal detection schemes that use
compressive sensing based reconstruction algorithms. Results show that, for a
given rate, improved performance is achieved when the number of indexed
transmission entities is increased. We also explore indexing opportunities in
{\em load modulation}, which is a modulation scheme that offers power
efficiency and reduced RF hardware complexity advantages in multiantenna
systems. Results show that indexing space and time in load modulated
multiantenna systems can achieve improved performance.

 <dc:description>  Since the inception of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in the year 1997,
it has tremendously grown in the last few years. IEEE 802.11 is popularly known
as WLAN. To provide the last mile wireless broadband connectivity to users,
IEEE 802.11 is enriched with IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b and IEEE 802.11g. More
recently, IEEE 802.11n, IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ad are introduced with
enhancements to the physical (PHY) layer and medium access control (MAC)
sublayer to provide much higher data rates and thus these amendments are called
High Throughput WLANs (HT-WLANs). For both standards, PHY is enhanced with
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antenna technologies, channel bonding,
short guard intervals (SGI), enhanced modulation and coding schemes (MCS). At
the same time, MAC layer overhead is reduced by introducing frame aggregation
and block acknowledgement technologies. However, existing studies reveal that
although PHY and MAC enhancements promise to improve physical data rate
significantly, they yield negative impact over upper layer protocols -- mainly
for reliable end-to-end transport/application layer protocols. As a
consequence, a large number of schools have focused researches on HT-WLANs to
improve the coordination among PHY/MAC and upper layer protocols and thus,
boost up the performance benefit. In this survey, we discuss the impact of
enhancements of PHY/MAC layer in HT-WLANs over transport/application layer
protocols. list down different open challenges that can be explored for the
development of next generation HT-WLAN technologies.

 <dc:description>  Living organisms intertwine soft (e.g., muscle) and hard (e.g., bones)
materials, giving them an intrinsic flexibility and resiliency often lacking in
conventional rigid robots. The emerging field of soft robotics seeks to harness
these same properties in order to create resilient machines. The nature of soft
materials, however, presents considerable challenges to aspects of design,
construction, and control -- and up until now, the vast majority of gaits for
soft robots have been hand-designed through empirical trial-and-error. This
manuscript describes an easy-to-assemble tensegrity-based soft robot capable of
highly dynamic locomotive gaits and demonstrating structural and behavioral
resilience in the face of physical damage. Enabling this is the use of a
machine learning algorithm able to discover novel gaits with a minimal number
of physical trials. These results lend further credence to soft-robotic
approaches that seek to harness the interaction of complex material dynamics in
order to generate a wealth of dynamical behaviors.

 <dc:description>  For a given a graph, a distance oracle is a data structure that answers
distance queries between pairs of vertices. We introduce an $O(n^{5/3})$-space
distance oracle which answers exact distance queries in $O(\log n)$ time for
$n$-vertex planar edge-weighted digraphs. All previous distance oracles for
planar graphs with truly subquadratic space i.e., space $O(n^{2 - \epsilon})$
for some constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$) either required query time polynomial in $n$
or could only answer approximate distance queries.
  Furthermore, we show how to trade-off time and space: for any $S \ge
n^{3/2}$, we show how to obtain an $S$-space distance oracle that answers
queries in time $O((n^{5/2}/ S^{3/2}) \log n)$. This is a polynomial
improvement over the previous planar distance oracles with $o(n^{1/4})$ query
time.

 <dc:description>  Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) are energy-based neural-networks which
are commonly used as the building blocks for deep architectures neural
architectures. In this work, we derive a deterministic framework for the
training, evaluation, and use of RBMs based upon the Thouless-Anderson-Palmer
(TAP) mean-field approximation of widely-connected systems with weak
interactions coming from spin-glass theory. While the TAP approach has been
extensively studied for fully-visible binary spin systems, our construction is
generalized to latent-variable models, as well as to arbitrarily distributed
real-valued spin systems with bounded support. In our numerical experiments, we
demonstrate the effective deterministic training of our proposed models and are
able to show interesting features of unsupervised learning which could not be
directly observed with sampling. Additionally, we demonstrate how to utilize
our TAP-based framework for leveraging trained RBMs as joint priors in
denoising problems.

 <dc:title>Two Optimization Problems for Unit Disks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an implementation of a recent algorithm to compute shortest-path
trees in unit disk graphs in $O(n\log n)$ worst-case time, where $n$ is the
number of disks.
  In the minimum-separation problem, we are given $n$ unit disks and two points
$s$ and $t$, not contained in any of the disks, and we want to compute the
minimum number of disks one needs to retain so that any curve connecting $s$ to
$t$ intersects some of the retained disks. We present a new algorithm solving
this problem in $O(n^2\log^3 n)$ worst-case time and its implementation.

 <dc:title>Dual-Tree Wavelet Scattering Network with Parametric Log Transformation
  for Object Classification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Singh, Amarjot</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kingsbury, Nick</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a ScatterNet that uses a parametric log transformation with
Dual-Tree complex wavelets to extract translation invariant representations
from a multi-resolution image. The parametric transformation aids the OLS
pruning algorithm by converting the skewed distributions into relatively
mean-symmetric distributions while the Dual-Tree wavelets improve the
computational efficiency of the network. The proposed network is shown to
outperform Mallat's ScatterNet on two image datasets, both for classification
accuracy and computational efficiency. The advantages of the proposed network
over other supervised and some unsupervised methods are also presented using
experiments performed on different training dataset sizes.

 <dc:description>  End-to-end learning of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) is an attractive
solution for dialog systems; however, current techniques are data-intensive and
require thousands of dialogs to learn simple behaviors. We introduce Hybrid
Code Networks (HCNs), which combine an RNN with domain-specific knowledge
encoded as software and system action templates. Compared to existing
end-to-end approaches, HCNs considerably reduce the amount of training data
required, while retaining the key benefit of inferring a latent representation
of dialog state. In addition, HCNs can be optimized with supervised learning,
reinforcement learning, or a mixture of both. HCNs attain state-of-the-art
performance on the bAbI dialog dataset, and outperform two commercially
deployed customer-facing dialog systems.

 <dc:title>Batch Renormalization: Towards Reducing Minibatch Dependence in
  Batch-Normalized Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ioffe, Sergey</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Batch Normalization is quite effective at accelerating and improving the
training of deep models. However, its effectiveness diminishes when the
training minibatches are small, or do not consist of independent samples. We
hypothesize that this is due to the dependence of model layer inputs on all the
examples in the minibatch, and different activations being produced between
training and inference. We propose Batch Renormalization, a simple and
effective extension to ensure that the training and inference models generate
the same outputs that depend on individual examples rather than the entire
minibatch. Models trained with Batch Renormalization perform substantially
better than batchnorm when training with small or non-i.i.d. minibatches. At
the same time, Batch Renormalization retains the benefits of batchnorm such as
insensitivity to initialization and training efficiency.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel parsing concept called local lexing. It integrates the
classically separated stages of lexing and parsing by allowing lexing to be
dependent upon the parsing progress and by providing a simple mechanism for
constraining lexical ambiguity. This makes it possible for language design to
be composable not only at the level of context-free grammars, but also at the
lexical level. It also makes it possible to include lightweight error-handling
directly as part of the language specification instead of leaving it up to the
implementation.
  We present a high-level algorithm for local lexing, which is an extension of
Earley's algorithm. We have formally verified the correctness of our algorithm
with respect to its local lexing semantics in Isabelle/HOL.

 <dc:title>A More Sensitive Context</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Banks, Christopher J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Stark, Ian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Logic of Behaviour in Context (LBC) is a spatio-temporal logic for expressing
properties of continuous-state processes, such as biochemical reaction
networks. LBC builds on the existing Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) and
adds a &quot;context modality&quot; that explores the behaviour of a system when composed
with an external process. LBC models are terms of the Continuous {\pi}-Calculus
(c{\pi}), a process algebra with continuous state space. Our previously
published LBC model-checking technique required examining many points along the
behavioural trajectory of a process; and potentially computing further
trajectories branching off at every such point. This raised two difficulties:
mixing temporal and spatial modalities could require computing a large number
of trajectories, with costly numerical solution of differential equations; and
might still fail to check intermediate values between discrete points on those
trajectories. In this paper we make progress against both of these problems
using techniques from signal temporal logic and from sensitivity analysis.
Boolean signals aggressively compress trace information, allowing more
efficient computation; and sensitivity analysis lets us reliably check formulae
over a region by calculating a smaller number of sample trajectories.

 <dc:description>  Mass customization explains the phenomenon to provide a unique designed
products and services to all customer by achieving a high process integration
and flexibility. It has been used as a competitive approach by many companies.
Adequate resource implementation in mass customization-particularly in terms of
resource usage, it is therefore important to meet customer's requirement in
terms effective responsiveness and meeting deadlines, at the same time offering
high scalability. An architecture for solving the resource allocation issue in
mass customized flexible manufacturing system was illustrated, by putting in
place a couple of advance reservation systems and scheduling algorithms for
effective usage of the product.

 <dc:description>  Fuzzy critic-based learning forms a reinforcement learning method based on
dynamic programming. In this paper, an adaptive critic-based neuro-fuzzy system
is presented for an unmanned bicycle. The only information available for the
critic agent is the system feedback which is interpreted as the last action
performed by the controller in the previous state. The signal produced by the
critic agent is used along with the error back propagation to tune (online)
conclusion parts of the fuzzy inference rules of the adaptive controller.
Simulations and experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the
proposed controller. The results demonstrate superior performance of the
developed controller in terms of improved transient response, robustness to
model uncertainty and fast online learning.

 <dc:description>  Many language technology applications would benefit from the ability to
represent negation and its scope on top of widely-used linguistic resources. In
this paper, we investigate the possibility of obtaining a first-order logic
representation with negation scope marked using Universal Dependencies. To do
so, we enhance UDepLambda, a framework that converts dependency graphs to
logical forms. The resulting UDepLambda$\lnot$ is able to handle phenomena
related to scope by means of an higher-order type theory, relevant not only to
negation but also to universal quantification and other complex semantic
phenomena. The initial conversion we did for English is promising, in that one
can represent the scope of negation also in the presence of more complex
phenomena such as universal quantifiers.

 <dc:description>  A generative model based on training deep architectures is proposed. The
model consists of K networks that are trained together to learn the underlying
distribution of a given data set. The process starts with dividing the input
data into K clusters and feeding each of them into a separate network. After
few iterations of training networks separately, we use an EM-like algorithm to
train the networks together and update the clusters of the data. We call this
model Mixture of Networks. The provided model is a platform that can be used
for any deep structure and be trained by any conventional objective function
for distribution modeling. As the components of the model are neural networks,
it has high capability in characterizing complicated data distributions as well
as clustering data. We apply the algorithm on MNIST hand-written digits and
Yale face datasets. We also demonstrate the clustering ability of the model
using some real-world and toy examples.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we design real-time decentralized and distributed control
schemes for Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems in energy
efficient buildings. The control schemes balance user comfort and energy
saving, and are implemented without measuring or predicting exogenous
disturbances. Firstly, we introduce a thermal dynamic model of building systems
and formulate a steady-state resource allocation problem, which aims to
minimize the aggregate deviation between zone temperatures and their set
points, as well as the building energy consumption, subject to practical
operating constraints, by adjusting zone flow rates. Because this problem is
nonconvex, we propose two methods to (approximately) solve it and to design the
real-time control. In the first method, we present a convex relaxation approach
to solve an approximate version of the steady-state optimization problem, where
the heat transfer between neighboring zones is ignored. We prove the tightness
of the relaxation and develop a real-time decentralized algorithm to regulate
the zone flow rate. In the second method, we introduce a mild assumption under
which the original optimization problem becomes convex, and then a real-time
distributed algorithm is developed to regulate the zone flow rate. In both
cases, the thermal dynamics can be driven to equilibria which are optimal
solutions to those associated steady-state optimization problems. Finally,
numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed
control schemes.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers generic unbalanced and multiphase distribution systems
and develops a load-flow algorithm based on a fixed-point interpretation of the
AC power-flow equations. Explicit conditions for existence and uniqueness of
load-flow solutions are presented. These conditions also guarantee convergence
of the load-flow algorithm to the unique power-flow solution. The proposed
methodology broadens the well-established Z-bus iterative method, and it is
applicable to generic systems featuring (i) wye connections; (ii) ungrounded
delta connections; (iii) a combination of wye-connected and delta-connected
sources/loads; and, (iv) a combination of line-to-line and
line-to-grounded-neutral devices at the secondary of distribution transformers.
Linear load-flow models are then derived, and their approximation accuracy is
analyzed. Theoretical results are corroborated through experiments on IEEE test
feeders.

 <dc:description>  We study reinforcement learning of chatbots with recurrent neural network
architectures when the rewards are noisy and expensive to obtain. For instance,
a chatbot used in automated customer service support can be scored by quality
assurance agents, but this process can be expensive, time consuming and noisy.
Previous reinforcement learning work for natural language processing uses
on-policy updates and/or is designed for on-line learning settings. We
demonstrate empirically that such strategies are not appropriate for this
setting and develop an off-policy batch policy gradient method (BPG). We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method via a series of synthetic experiments
and an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment on a restaurant recommendations
dataset.

 <dc:description>  Explicit concept space models have proven efficacy for text representation in
many natural language and text mining applications. The idea is to embed
textual structures into a semantic space of concepts which captures the main
topics of these structures. That so called bag-of-concepts representation
suffers from data sparsity causing low similarity scores between similar texts
due to low concept overlap. In this paper we propose two neural embedding
models in order to learn continuous concept vectors. Once learned, we propose
an efficient vector aggregation method to generate fully dense bag-of-concepts
representations. Empirical results on a benchmark dataset for measuring entity
semantic relatedness show superior performance over other concept embedding
models. In addition, by utilizing our efficient aggregation method, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of the densified vector representation over the
typical sparse representations for dataless classification where we can achieve
at least same or better accuracy with much less dimensions.

 <dc:title>Multi-Resolution Dual-Tree Wavelet Scattering Network for Signal
  Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a Deep Scattering network that utilizes Dual-Tree
complex wavelets to extract translation invariant representations from an input
signal. The computationally efficient Dual-Tree wavelets decompose the input
signal into densely spaced representations over scales. Translation invariance
is introduced in the representations by applying a non-linearity over a region
followed by averaging. The discriminatory information in the densely spaced,
locally smooth, signal representations aids the learning of the classifier. The
proposed network is shown to outperform Mallat's ScatterNet on four datasets
with different modalities on classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  This paper jointly optimizes the precoding matrices and the set of active
remote radio heads (RRHs) to minimize the network power consumption (NPC) for a
user-centric cloud radio access network (C-RAN), where both the RRHs and users
have multiple antennas and each user is served by its nearby RRHs. Both users'
rate requirements and per-RRH power constraints are considered. Due to these
conflicting constraints, this optimization problem may be infeasible. In this
paper, we propose to solve this problem in two stages. In Stage I, a
low-complexity user selection algorithm is proposed to find the largest subset
of feasible users. In Stage II, a low-complexity algorithm is proposed to solve
the optimization problem with the users selected from Stage I. Specifically,
the re-weighted $l_1$-norm minimization method is used to transform the
original problem with non-smooth objective function into a series of weighted
power minimization (WPM) problems, each of which can be solved by the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) method. The solution obtained by the WMMSE
method is proved to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the WPM
problem. Moreover, a low-complexity algorithm based on Newton's method and the
gradient descent method is developed to update the precoder matrices in each
iteration of the WMMSE method. Simulation results demonstrate the rapid
convergence of the proposed algorithms and the benefits of equipping multiple
antennas at the user side. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve
near-optimal performance in terms of NPC.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel automatic face recognition approach based on
local binary patterns (LBP). LBP descriptor considers a local neighbourhood of
a pixel to compute the features. This method is not very robust to handle image
noise, variances and different illumination conditions. In this paper, we
address these issues and extend the original LBP operator by considering more
pixels and different neighbourhoods to compute the feature vector. The proposed
method is evaluated on two benchmark corpora, namely UFI and FERET face
datasets. We experimentally show that our approach is very efficient because it
significantly outperforms several other state-of-the-art methods and is
efficient particularly in the real conditions where the above mentioned issues
are obvious.

 <dc:description>  Increasing safety and automation in transportation systems has led to the
proliferation of radar and IEEE 802.11 dedicated short range communication
(DSRC) in vehicles. Current implementations of vehicular radar devices,
however, are expensive, use a substantial amount of bandwidth, and are
susceptible to multiple security risks. Consider the feasibility of using an
IEEE 802.11 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications
waveform to perform radar functions. In this paper, we present an approach that
determines the mean-normalized channel energy from frequency domain channel
estimates and models it as a direct sinusoidal function of target range,
enabling closest target range estimation. In addition, we propose an
alternative to vehicular forward collision detection by extending IEEE 802.11
dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and WiFi technology to radar,
providing a foundation for joint communications and radar framework.
Furthermore, we perform an experimental demonstration using existing IEEE
802.11 devices with minimal modification through algorithm processing on
frequency-domain channel estimates. The results of this paper show that our
solution delivers similar accuracy and reliability to mmWave radar devices with
as little as 20 MHz of spectrum (doubling DSRC's 10 MHz allocation), indicating
significant potential for industrial devices with joint vehicular
communications and radar capabilities.

 <dc:description>  Our concern is the overhead of answering OWL 2 QL ontology-mediated queries
(OMQs) in ontology-based data access compared to evaluating their underlying
tree-shaped and bounded treewidth conjunctive queries (CQs). We show that OMQs
with bounded-depth ontologies have nonrecursive datalog (NDL) rewritings that
can be constructed and evaluated in LOGCFL for combined complexity, even in NL
if their CQs are tree-shaped with a bounded number of leaves, and so incur no
overhead in complexity-theoretic terms. For OMQs with arbitrary ontologies and
bounded-leaf CQs, NDL-rewritings are constructed and evaluated in LOGCFL. We
show experimentally feasibility and scalability of our rewritings compared to
previously proposed NDL-rewritings. On the negative side, we prove that
answering OMQs with tree-shaped CQs is not fixed-parameter tractable if the
ontology depth or the number of leaves in the CQs is regarded as the parameter,
and that answering OMQs with a fixed ontology (of infinite depth) is
NP-complete for tree-shaped and LOGCFL for bounded-leaf CQs.

 <dc:title>A Higher-Order Abstract Syntax Approach to the Verified Compilation of
  Functional Programs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Yuting</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We argue that the implementation and verification of compilers for functional
programming languages are greatly simplified by employing a higher-order
representation of syntax known as Higher-Order Abstract Syntax or HOAS. The
underlying idea of HOAS is to use a meta-language that provides a built-in and
logical treatment of binding related notions. By embedding the meta-language
within a larger programming or reasoning framework, it is possible to absorb
the treatment of binding structure in the object language into the meta-theory
of the system, thereby greatly simplifying the overall implementation and
reasoning processes.
  We develop the above argument in this thesis by presenting and demonstrating
the effectiveness of an approach to the verified implementation of compiler
transformations for functional programs that exploits HOAS. In this approach,
transformations on functional programs are first articulated in the form of
rule-based relational specifications. These specifications are rendered into
programs in the language lambda Prolog. On the one hand, these programs serve
directly as implementations. On the other hand, they can be used as input to
the Abella system which allows us to prove properties about them and thereby
about the implementations. Both lambda Prolog and Abella support the use of the
HOAS approach. Thus, they constitute a framework that can be used to test out
the benefits of the HOAS approach in verified compilation. We use them to
implement and verify a compiler for a representative functional programming
language that embodies the transformations that form the core of many compilers
for such languages. In both the programming and the reasoning phases, we show
how the use of the HOAS approach significantly simplifies the representation,
manipulation, analysis and reasoning of binding structure.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The credit on {\it reduction theory} goes back to the work of Lagrange,
Gauss, Hermite, Korkin, Zolotarev, and Minkowski. Modern reduction theory is
voluminous and includes the work of A. Lenstra, H. Lenstra and L. Lovasz who
created the well known LLL algorithm, and many other researchers such as L.
Babai and C. P. Schnorr who created significant new variants of basis reduction
algorithms. In this paper, we propose and investigate the efficacy of new
optimization techniques to be used along with LLL algorithm. The techniques we
have proposed are: i) {\it hill climbing (HC)}, ii) {\it lattice diffusion-sub
lattice fusion (LDSF)}, and iii) {\it multistage hybrid LDSF-HC}. The first
technique relies on the sensitivity of LLL to permutations of the input basis
$B$, and optimization ideas over the symmetric group $S_m$ viewed as a metric
space. The second technique relies on partitioning the lattice into
sublattices, performing basis reduction in the partition sublattice blocks,
fusing the sublattices, and repeating. We also point out places where parallel
computation can reduce run-times achieving almost linear speedup. The
multistage hybrid technique relies on the lattice diffusion and sublattice
fusion and hill climbing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication opens up tens of giga-hertz (GHz)
spectrum in the mmWave band for use by next-generation wireless systems,
thereby solving the problem of spectrum scarcity. Maintaining connectivity
stands out to be a key design challenge for mmWave networks deployed in urban
regions due to the blockage effect characterizing mmWave propagation.
Specifically, mmWave signals can be blocked by buildings and other large urban
objects. In this paper, we set out to investigate the blockage effect on the
connectivity of mmWave networks in a Manhattan-type urban region modeled using
a random regular lattice while base stations (BSs) are Poisson distributed in
the plane. In particular, we analyze the connectivity probability that a
typical user is within the transmission range of a BS and connected by a
line-of-sight. Using random lattice and stochastic geometry theories, different
lower bounds on the connectivity probability are derived as functions of the
buildings' size and probability of a lattice cell being occupied by a building
as well as BS density and transmission range. The asymptotic connectivity
probability is also derived for cases of dense buildings. Last, the results are
extended to heterogeneous networks. Our study yields closed-form relations
between the parameters of the building process and the BS process, providing
useful guidelines for practical mmWave network deployment.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the maximum loads of explicit hash families in the
$d$-choice schemes when allocating sequentially $n$ balls into $n$ bins. We
consider the \emph{Uniform-Greedy} scheme \cite{ABKU}, which provides $d$
independent bins for each ball and places the ball into the bin with the least
load, and its non-uniform variant --- the \emph{Always-Go-Left} scheme
introduced by V\&quot;ocking~\cite{Vocking}. We construct a hash family with $O(\log
n \log \log n)$ random bits based on the previous work of Celis et
al.~\cite{CRSW} and show the following results.
  1.This hash family has a maximum load of $\frac{\log \log n}{\log d} + O(1)$
in the \emph{Uniform-Greedy} scheme.
  2.It has a maximum load of $\frac{\log \log n}{d \log \phi_d} + O(1)$ in the
\emph{Always-Go-Left} scheme for a constant $\phi_d&gt;1.61$.
  The maximum loads of our hash family match the maximum loads of a perfectly
random hash function \cite{ABKU,Vocking} in the \emph{Uniform-Greedy} and
\emph{Always-Go-Left} scheme separately. Previously, the best known hash
families that guarantee the same maximum loads as a perfectly random hash
function in any of these schemes were $O(\log n)$-wise independent functions
\cite{Vocking}, which needs $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ random bits.

 <dc:description>  We present three private fingerprint alignment and matching protocols, based
on what are considered to be the most precise and efficient fingerprint
recognition algorithms, which use minutia points. Our protocols allow two or
more honest-but-curious parties to compare their respective privately-held
fingerprints in a secure way such that they each learn nothing more than an
accurate score of how well the fingerprints match. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time fingerprint alignment based on minutiae is
considered in a secure computation framework. We build secure fingerprint
alignment and matching protocols in both the two-party setting using garbled
circuit evaluation and in the multi-party setting using secret sharing
techniques. In addition to providing precise and efficient secure fingerprint
alignment and matching, our contributions include the design of a number of
secure sub-protocols for complex operations such as sine, cosine, arctangent,
square root, and selection, which are likely to be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose to train a deep neural network by distributed
optimization over a graph. Two nonlinear functions are considered: the
rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a linear unit with both lower and upper
cutoffs (DCutLU). The problem reformulation over a graph is realized by
explicitly representing ReLU or DCutLU using a set of slack variables. We then
apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to update the
weights of the network layerwise by solving subproblems of the reformulated
problem. Empirical results suggest that the ADMM-based method is less sensitive
to overfitting than the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam methods.

 <dc:description>  Micro-task crowdsourcing has become a successful mean to obtain high-quality
data from a large crowd of diverse people. In this context, trust between all
the involved actors (i.e. requesters, workers, and platform owners) is a
critical factor for acceptance and long-term success. As actors have no
expectation for &quot;real life&quot; meetings, thus trust can only be attributed through
computer-mediated trust cues like workers qualifications and requester ratings.
Such cues are often the result of technical or social assessments that are
performed in isolation, considering only a subset of relevant properties, and
with asynchronous and asymmetrical interactions. In this paper, we advocate for
a new generation of micro-task crowdsourcing systems that pursue an holistic
understanding of trust, by offering an open, transparent, privacy-friendly, and
socially-aware view on the all the actors of a micro-task crowdsourcing
environment.

 <dc:description>  Increasing nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms are applied to solving
the real-world optimization problems, as they have some advantages over the
classical methods of numerical optimization. This paper has proposed a new
nature-inspired metaheuristic called Whale Swarm Algorithm for function
optimization, which is inspired by the whales behavior of communicating with
each other via ultrasound for hunting. The proposed Whale Swarm Algorithm has
been compared with several popular metaheuristic algorithms on comprehensive
performance metrics. According to the experimental results, Whale Swarm
Algorithm has a quite competitive performance when compared with other
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Skyline queries enable multi-criteria optimization by filtering objects that
are worse in all the attributes of interest than another object. To handle the
large answer set of skyline queries in high-dimensional datasets, the concept
of k-dominance was proposed where an object is said to dominate another object
if it is better (or equal) in at least k attributes. This relaxes the full
domination criterion of normal skyline queries and, therefore, produces lesser
number of skyline objects. This is called the k-dominant skyline set. Many
practical applications, however, require that the preferences are applied on a
joined relation. Common examples include flights having one or multiple stops,
a combination of product price and shipping costs, etc. In this paper, we
extend the k-dominant skyline queries to the join paradigm by enabling such
queries to be asked on joined relations. We call such queries KSJQ (k-dominant
skyline join queries). The number of skyline attributes, k, that an object must
dominate is from the combined set of skyline attributes of the joined relation.
We show how pre-processing the base relations helps in reducing the time of
answering such queries over the naive method of joining the relations first and
then running the k-dominant skyline computation. We also extend the query to
handle cases where the skyline preference is on aggregated values in the joined
relation (such as total cost of the multiple legs of the flight) which are
available only after the join is performed. In addition to these problems, we
devise efficient algorithms to choose the value of k based on the desired
cardinality of the final skyline set. Experiments on both real and synthetic
datasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and practicality of our
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We consider a swarm of $n$ autonomous mobile robots, distributed on a
2-dimensional grid. A basic task for such a swarm is the gathering process: All
robots have to gather at one (not predefined) place. A common local model for
extremely simple robots is the following: The robots do not have a common
compass, only have a constant viewing radius, are autonomous and
indistinguishable, can move at most a constant distance in each step, cannot
communicate, are oblivious and do not have flags or states. The only gathering
algorithm under this robot model, with known runtime bounds, needs
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ rounds and works in the Euclidean plane. The underlying time
model for the algorithm is the fully synchronous $\mathcal{FSYNC}$ model. On
the other side, in the case of the 2-dimensional grid, the only known gathering
algorithms for the same time and a similar local model additionally require a
constant memory, states and &quot;flags&quot; to communicate these states to neighbors in
viewing range. They gather in time $\mathcal{O}(n)$.
  In this paper we contribute the (to the best of our knowledge) first
gathering algorithm on the grid that works under the same simple local model as
the above mentioned Euclidean plane strategy, i.e., without memory (oblivious),
&quot;flags&quot; and states. We prove its correctness and an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time
bound in the fully synchronous $\mathcal{FSYNC}$ time model. This time bound
matches the time bound of the best known algorithm for the Euclidean plane
mentioned above. We say gathering is done if all robots are located within a
$2\times 2$ square, because in $\mathcal{FSYNC}$ such configurations cannot be
solved.

 <dc:description>  This paper has three main contributions to our understanding of fixed-depth
minimax search: (A) A new formulation for Stockman's SSS* algorithm, based on
Alpha-Beta, is presented. It solves all the perceived drawbacks of SSS*,
finally transforming it into a practical algorithm. In effect, we show that
SSS* = alpha-beta + ransposition tables. The crucial step is the realization
that transposition tables contain so-called solution trees, structures that are
used in best-first search algorithms like SSS*. Having created a practical
version, we present performance measurements with tournament game-playing
programs for three different minimax games, yielding results that contradict a
number of publications. (B) Based on the insights gained in our attempts at
understanding SSS*, we present a framework that facilitates the construction of
several best-first fixed- depth game-tree search algorithms, known and new. The
framework is based on depth-first null-window Alpha-Beta search, enhanced with
storage to allow for the refining of previous search results. It focuses
attention on the essential differences between algorithms. (C) We present a new
instance of the framework, MTD(f). It is well-suited for use with iterative
deepening, and performs better than algorithms that are currently used in most
state-of-the-art game-playing programs. We provide experimental evidence to
explain why MTD(f) performs better than the other fixed-depth minimax
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Recently, machine learning methods have provided a broad spectrum of original
and efficient algorithms based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to automatically
predict an outcome with respect to a sequence of inputs. Recurrent hidden cells
allow these DNN-based models to manage long-term dependencies such as Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Nevertheless, these
RNNs process a single input stream in one (LSTM) or two (Bidirectional LSTM)
directions. But most of the information available nowadays is from multistreams
or multimedia documents, and require RNNs to process these information
synchronously during the training. This paper presents an original LSTM-based
architecture, named Parallel LSTM (PLSTM), that carries out multiple parallel
synchronized input sequences in order to predict a common output. The proposed
PLSTM method could be used for parallel sequence classification purposes. The
PLSTM approach is evaluated on an automatic telecast genre sequences
classification task and compared with different state-of-the-art architectures.
Results show that the proposed PLSTM method outperforms the baseline n-gram
models as well as the state-of-the-art LSTM approach.

 <dc:description>  When integrating computational tools such as automatic segmentation into
clinical practice, it is of utmost importance to be able to assess the level of
accuracy on new data, and in particular, to detect when an automatic method
fails. However, this is difficult to achieve due to absence of ground truth.
Segmentation accuracy on clinical data might be different from what is found
through cross-validation because validation data is often used during
incremental method development, which can lead to overfitting and unrealistic
performance expectations. Before deployment, performance is quantified using
different metrics, for which the predicted segmentation is compared to a
reference segmentation, often obtained manually by an expert. But little is
known about the real performance after deployment when a reference is
unavailable. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reverse classification
accuracy (RCA) as a framework for predicting the performance of a segmentation
method on new data. In RCA we take the predicted segmentation from a new image
to train a reverse classifier which is evaluated on a set of reference images
with available ground truth. The hypothesis is that if the predicted
segmentation is of good quality, then the reverse classifier will perform well
on at least some of the reference images. We validate our approach on
multi-organ segmentation with different classifiers and segmentation methods.
Our results indicate that it is indeed possible to predict the quality of
individual segmentations, in the absence of ground truth. Thus, RCA is ideal
for integration into automatic processing pipelines in clinical routine and as
part of large-scale image analysis studies.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an extension to the Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs), namely as ARTGAN to synthetically generate more challenging and complex
images such as artwork that have abstract characteristics. This is in contrast
to most of the current solutions that focused on generating natural images such
as room interiors, birds, flowers and faces. The key innovation of our work is
to allow back-propagation of the loss function w.r.t. the labels (randomly
assigned to each generated images) to the generator from the discriminator.
With the feedback from the label information, the generator is able to learn
faster and achieve better generated image quality. Empirically, we show that
the proposed ARTGAN is capable to create realistic artwork, as well as generate
compelling real world images that globally look natural with clear shape on
CIFAR-10.

 <dc:description>  Clustering scientific publications in an important problem in bibliometric
research. We demonstrate how two software tools, CitNetExplorer and VOSviewer,
can be used to cluster publications and to analyze the resulting clustering
solutions. CitNetExplorer is used to cluster a large set of publications in the
field of astronomy and astrophysics. The publications are clustered based on
direct citation relations. CitNetExplorer and VOSviewer are used together to
analyze the resulting clustering solutions. Both tools use visualizations to
support the analysis of the clustering solutions, with CitNetExplorer focusing
on the analysis at the level of individual publications and VOSviewer focusing
on the analysis at an aggregate level. The demonstration provided in this paper
shows how a clustering of publications can be created and analyzed using freely
available software tools. Using the approach presented in this paper,
bibliometricians are able to carry out sophisticated cluster analyses without
the need to have a deep knowledge of clustering techniques and without
requiring advanced computer skills.

 <dc:description>  LP$^{\supset,\mathsf{F}}$ is a three-valued paraconsistent propositional
logic which is essentially the same as J3. It has most properties that have
been proposed as desirable properties of a reasonable paraconsistent
propositional logic. However, it follows easily from already published results
that there are exactly 8192 different three-valued paraconsistent propositional
logics that have the properties concerned. In this note, properties concerning
the logical equivalence relation of a logic are used to distinguish
LP$^{\supset,\mathsf{F}}$ from the others. As one of the bonuses of focussing
on the logical equivalence relation, it is found that only 32 of the 8192
logics have a logical equivalence relation that satisfies the identity,
annihilation, idempotent, and commutative laws for conjunction and disjunction.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art methods for 3D hand pose estimation from depth images
require large amounts of annotated training data. We propose to model the
statistical relationships of 3D hand poses and corresponding depth images using
two deep generative models with a shared latent space. By design, our
architecture allows for learning from unlabeled image data in a semi-supervised
manner. Assuming a one-to-one mapping between a pose and a depth map, any given
point in the shared latent space can be projected into both a hand pose and a
corresponding depth map. Regressing the hand pose can then be done by learning
a discriminator to estimate the posterior of the latent pose given some depth
maps. To improve generalization and to better exploit unlabeled depth maps, we
jointly train a generator and a discriminator. At each iteration, the generator
is updated with the back-propagated gradient from the discriminator to
synthesize realistic depth maps of the articulated hand, while the
discriminator benefits from an augmented training set of synthesized and
unlabeled samples. The proposed discriminator network architecture is highly
efficient and runs at 90 FPS on the CPU with accuracies comparable or better
than state-of-art on 3 publicly available benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We obtain optimal strategies for the allocation of influence budget across
multiple channels and across time for an external influencer, e.g., a political
campaign, seeking to maximize its effect on an election given a network of
agents with linear consensus-seeking opinion dynamics. We show that for a
general set of objective functions, the optimal influence strategy at every
time uses all channels at either their maximum rate or not at all. Furthermore,
we prove that the number of switches between these extremes is bounded above
both by a term that is typically much smaller than the number of agents. This
means that the optimal influence strategy is to exert maximum effort in waves
for every channel, and then cease effort and let the effects propagate. We also
show that at the beginning, the total cost-adjusted reach of a channel
determines its relative value, while targeting matters more closer to election
time. We demonstrate that the optimal influence structures are easily
computable in several practical cases. We explicitly characterize the optimal
controls for the case of linear objective functions via a closed form. Finally,
we see that in the canonical election example, identifying late-deciders
approximately determines the optimal campaign resource allocation strategy.

 <dc:description>  Many driver assistance systems such as Adaptive Cruise Control require the
identification of the closest vehicle that is in the host vehicle's path. This
entails an assignment of detected vehicles to the host vehicle path or
neighboring paths. After reviewing approaches to the estimation of the host
vehicle path and lane assignment techniques we introduce two methods that are
motivated by the rationale to filter measured data as late in the processing
stages as possible in order to avoid delays and other artifacts of intermediate
filters. These filters generate discrete posterior probability distributions
from which a path or &quot;lane&quot; index is extracted by a median estimator. The
relative performance of those methods is illustrated by a ROC using
experimental data and labeled ground truth data.

 <dc:description>  We consider the following problem: a team of robots is deployed in an unknown
environment and it has to collaboratively build a map of the area without a
reliable infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern mapping
techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the
robots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this
paper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather
than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots
exchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose
graph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed
implementation of the two-stage approach of Carlone et al., where we use the
Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation (JOR) as
workhorses to split the computation among the robots. As a second contribution,
we extend %and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed distributed
algorithms to work with object-based map models. The use of object-based models
avoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g., point clouds) further
reducing the communication burden. Our third contribution is an extensive
experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, including tests in
realistic Gazebo simulations and field experiments in a military test facility.
Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the proposed algorithms
(the Distributed Gauss-Seidel method or DGS) has excellent performance. The DGS
requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales well to
large teams, is robust to noise, and is easy to implement. Our field tests show
that the combined use of our distributed algorithms and object-based models
reduces the communication requirements by several orders of magnitude and
enables distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world problems.

 <dc:description>  Synapse crossbar is an elementary structure in Neuromorphic Computing Systems
(NCS). However, the limited size of crossbars and heavy routing congestion
impedes the NCS implementations of big neural networks. In this paper, we
propose a two-step framework (namely, group scissor) to scale NCS designs to
big neural networks. The first step is rank clipping, which integrates low-rank
approximation into the training to reduce total crossbar area. The second step
is group connection deletion, which structurally prunes connections to reduce
routing congestion between crossbars. Tested on convolutional neural networks
of LeNet on MNIST database and ConvNet on CIFAR-10 database, our experiments
show significant reduction of crossbar area and routing area in NCS designs.
Without accuracy loss, rank clipping reduces total crossbar area to 13.62\% and
51.81\% in the NCS designs of LeNet and ConvNet, respectively. Following rank
clipping, group connection deletion further reduces the routing area of LeNet
and ConvNet to 8.1\% and 52.06\%, respectively.

 <dc:description>  We consider an infinite-buffer single-server queue where inter-arrival times
are phase-type ($PH$), the service is provided according to Markovian service
process $(MSP)$, and the server may take single, exponentially distributed
vacations when the queue is empty. The proposed analysis is based on roots of
the associated characteristic equation of the vector-generating function (VGF)
of system-length distribution at a pre-arrival epoch. Also, we obtain the
steady-state system-length distribution at an arbitrary epoch along with some
important performance measures such as the mean number of customers in the
system and the mean system sojourn time of a customer. Later, we have
established heavy- and light-traffic approximations as well as an approximation
for the tail probabilities at pre-arrival epoch based on one root of the
characteristic equation. At the end, we present numerical results in the form
of tables to show the effect of model parameters on the performance measures.

 <dc:description>  The traditional sparse modeling approach, when applied to inverse problems
with large data such as images, essentially assumes a sparse model for small
overlapping data patches. While producing state-of-the-art results, this
methodology is suboptimal, as it does not attempt to model the entire global
signal in any meaningful way - a nontrivial task by itself. In this paper we
propose a way to bridge this theoretical gap by constructing a global model
from the bottom up. Given local sparsity assumptions in a dictionary, we show
that the global signal representation must satisfy a constrained
underdetermined system of linear equations, which can be solved efficiently by
modern optimization methods such as Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM). We investigate conditions for unique and stable recovery, and provide
numerical evidence corroborating the theory.

 <dc:description>  Massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) will be a core
technology in fifth-generation (5G) wireless systems as it offers significant
improvements in spectral efficiency compared to existing multi-antenna
technologies. The presence of hundreds of antenna elements at the base station
(BS), however, results in excessively high hardware costs and power
consumption, and requires high interconnect throughput between the
baseband-processing unit and the radio unit. Massive MU-MIMO that uses
low-resolution analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) has
the potential to address all these issues. In this paper, we focus on downlink
precoding for massive MU-MIMO systems with 1-bit DACs at the BS. The objective
is to design precoders that simultaneously mitigate multi-user interference
(MUI) and quantization artifacts. We propose two nonlinear 1-bit precoding
algorithms and corresponding very-large scale integration (VLSI) designs. Our
algorithms rely on biconvex relaxation, which enables the design of efficient
1-bit precoding algorithms that achieve superior error-rate performance
compared to that of linear precoding algorithms followed by quantization. To
showcase the efficacy of our algorithms, we design VLSI architectures that
enable efficient 1-bit precoding for massive MU-MIMO systems in which hundreds
of antennas serve tens of user equipments. We present corresponding
field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations to demonstrate that 1-bit
precoding enables reliable and high-rate downlink data transmission in
practical systems.

binary reachability relation between configurations of a given timed automaton
is definable in linear arithmetic over the integers and reals. In this paper we
give a new and simpler proof of this result, building on the well-known
reachability analysis of timed automata involving difference bound matrices.
Using this new proof, we give an exponential-space procedure for model checking
the reachability fragment of the logic parametric TCTL. Finally we show that
the latter problem is NEXPTIME-hard.

 <dc:description>  Low-cost mini-drones with advanced sensing and maneuverability enable a new
class of intelligent sensing systems. This trend motivated several research
efforts to employ drones as standalone systems or to assist legacy deployments.
However, several fundamental challenges remain unsolved including: 1) Adequate
coverage of sizable targets; 2) Target orientation that render coverage
effective only from certain view points; 3) Occlusion by elements in the
environment, including other targets.
  In this paper, we present Argus, a system that provides coverage of wide and
oriented targets, using camera-mounted drones, taking into account the
challenges stated above. Argus relies on a geometric model that captures both
target shapes and coverage constraints. With drones being the scarcest resource
in Argus, we study the problem of minimizing the number of drones required to
cover a set of such targets and derive a best-possible approximation algorithm.
Furthermore, we present a sampling heuristic that yields a comparable
performance, yet is up to 100x faster than the approximation algorithm. We
build a prototype of Argus to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed coverage
algorithms as part of a complete autonomous surveillance system. We evaluate
the proposed algorithms using simulations to compare their performance at scale
under various conditions. Finally, we present extensions and discuss open
problems related to the studied problem.

 <dc:title>Time-Space Efficient Regression Testing for Configurable Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Configurable systems are those that can be adapted from a set of options.
They are prevalent and testing them is important and challenging. Existing
approaches for testing configurable systems are either unsound (i.e., they can
miss fault-revealing configurations) or do not scale. This paper proposes
EvoSPLat, a regression testing technique for configurable systems. EvoSPLat
builds on our previously-developed technique, SPLat, which explores all
dynamically reachable configurations from a test. EvoSPLat is tuned for two
scenarios of use in regression testing: Regression Configuration Selection
(RCS) and Regression Test Selection (RTS). EvoSPLat for RCS prunes
configurations (not tests) that are not impacted by changes whereas EvoSPLat
for RTS prunes tests (not configurations) which are not impacted by changes.
Handling both scenarios in the context of evolution is important. Experimental
results show that EvoSPLat is promising. We observed a substantial reduction in
time (22%) and in the number of configurations (45%) for configurable Java
programs. In a case study on a large real-world configurable system (GCC),
EvoSPLat reduced 35% of the running time. Comparing EvoSPLat with sampling
techniques, 2-wise was the most efficient technique, but it missed two bugs
whereas EvoSPLat detected all bugs four times faster than 6-wise, on average.

 <dc:description>  Our ultimate goal is to efficiently enable end-users to correctly anticipate
a robot's behavior in novel situations. This behavior is often a direct result
of the robot's underlying objective function. Our insight is that end-users
need to have an accurate mental model of this objective function in order to
understand and predict what the robot will do. While people naturally develop
such a mental model over time through observing the robot act, this
familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces this time by
having the robot model how people infer objectives from observed behavior, and
then selecting those behaviors that are maximally informative. The problem of
computing a posterior over objectives from observed behavior is known as
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), and has been applied to robots learning
human objectives. We consider the problem where the roles of human and robot
are swapped. Our main contribution is to recognize that unlike robots, humans
will not be \emph{exact} in their IRL inference. We thus introduce two factors
to define candidate approximate-inference models for human learning in this
setting, and analyze them in a user study in the autonomous driving domain. We
show that certain approximate-inference models lead to the robot generating
example behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what the robot will do
in test situations. Our results also suggest, however, that additional research
is needed in modeling how humans extrapolate from examples of robot behavior.

 <dc:title>Safe Open-Loop Strategies for Handling Intermittent Communications in

 <dc:description>  In multi-robot systems where a central decision maker is specifying the
movement of each individual robot, a communication failure can severely impair
the performance of the system. This paper develops a motion strategy that
allows robots to safely handle critical communication failures for such
multi-robot architectures. For each robot, the proposed algorithm computes a
time horizon over which collisions with other robots are guaranteed not to
occur. These safe time horizons are included in the commands being transmitted
to the individual robots. In the event of a communication failure, the robots
execute the last received velocity commands for the corresponding safe time
horizons leading to a provably safe open-loop motion strategy. The resulting
algorithm is computationally effective and is agnostic to the task that the
robots are performing. The efficacy of the strategy is verified in simulation
as well as on a team of differential-drive mobile robots.

 <dc:description>  The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) is quickly
becoming the key enabler for the digital transformation of the healthcare
industry by offering comprehensive improvements in patient engagements,
productivity and risk mitigation. This paradigm shift, while bringing numerous
benefits and new opportunities to healthcare organizations, has raised a lot of
security and privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a reliable, searchable
and privacy-preserving e-healthcare system, which takes advantage of emerging
cloud storage and IoT infrastructure and enables healthcare service providers
(HSPs) to realize remote patient monitoring in a secure and regulatory
compliant manner. Our system is built upon a novel dynamic searchable symmetric
encryption scheme with forward privacy and delegated verifiability for
periodically generated healthcare data. While the forward privacy is achieved
by maintaining an increasing counter for each keyword at an IoT gateway, the
data owner delegated verifiability comes from the combination of the Bloom
filter and aggregate message authentication code. Moreover, our system is able
to support multiple HSPs through either data owner assistance or delegation.
The detailed security analysis as well as the extensive simulations on a large
data set with millions of records demonstrate the practical efficiency of the
proposed system for real world healthcare applications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Using deep learning for different machine learning tasks such as image
classification and word embedding has recently gained many attentions. Its
appealing performance reported across specific Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks in comparison with other approaches is the reason for its
popularity. Word embedding is the task of mapping words or phrases to a low
dimensional numerical vector. In this paper, we use deep learning to embed
Wikipedia Concepts and Entities. The English version of Wikipedia contains more
than five million pages, which suggest its capability to cover many English
Entities, Phrases, and Concepts. Each Wikipedia page is considered as a
concept. Some concepts correspond to entities, such as a person's name, an
organization or a place. Contrary to word embedding, Wikipedia Concepts
Embedding is not ambiguous, so there are different vectors for concepts with
similar surface form but different mentions. We proposed several approaches and
evaluated their performance based on Concept Analogy and Concept Similarity
tasks. The results show that proposed approaches have the performance
comparable and in some cases even higher than the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we demonstrate the fragility of decentralized load-side
frequency algorithms proposed in [1] against stochastic parametric uncertainty
in power network model. The stochastic parametric uncertainty is motivated
through the presence of renewable energy resources in power system model. We
show that relatively small variance value of the parametric uncertainty
affecting the system bus voltages cause the decentralized load-side frequency
regulation algorithm to become stochastically unstable. The critical variance
value of the stochastic bus voltages above which the decentralized control
algorithm become mean square unstable is computed using an analytical framework
developed in [2], [3]. Furthermore, the critical variance value is shown to
decrease with the increase in the cost of the controllable loads and with the
increase in penetration of renewable energy resources. Finally, simulation
results on IEEE 68 bus system are presented to verify the main findings of the
paper.

 <dc:title>Distributed Averaging With Random Network Graphs and Noises</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider discrete-time distributed averaging algorithms over multi-agent
networks with measurement noises and time-varying random graph flows. Each
agent updates its state by relative states between neighbours with both
additive and multiplicative measurement noises. The network structure is
modeled by time-varying random digraphs, which may be spatially and temporally
dependent. By developing difference inequalities of proper stochastic Lyapunov
function, the algebraic graph theory and martingale convergence theory, we
obtain sufficient conditions for stochastic approximation type algorithms to
achieve mean square and almost sure average consensus. We prove that all states
of agents converge to a common variable in mean square and almost surely if the
graph flow is conditionally balanced and uniformly conditionally jointly
connected. The mathematical expectation of the common variable is right the
average of initial values, and the upper bound of the mean square steady-state
error is given quantitatively related to the weights, the algorithm gain and
the energy level of the noises.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we develop linear transfer Perron Frobenius operator-based
approach for optimal stabilization of stochastic nonlinear system. One of the
main highlight of the proposed transfer operator based approach is that both
the theory and computational framework developed for the optimal stabilization
of deterministic dynamical system in [1] carries over to the stochastic case
with little change. The optimal stabilization problem is formulated as an
infinite dimensional linear program. Set oriented numerical methods are
proposed for the finite dimensional approximation of the transfer operator and
the controller. Simulation results are presented to verify the developed
framework.

 <dc:description>  We analyze arbitrarily varying classical-quantum wiretap channels.These
channels are subject to two attacks at the same time: one passive
(eavesdropping), and one active (jamming). We progress on previous works by
introducing a reduced class of allowed codes that fulfills a more stringent
secrecy requirement than earlier definitions. In addition, we prove that
non-symmetrizability of the legal link is suficient for equality of the
deterministic and the common randomness assisted secrecy capacities. At last,
we focus on analytic properties of both secrecy capacities: We completely
characterize their discontinuity points, and their super-activation properties.

used to assigns subqueries and GPU is used to compute the join of subqueries.
Finally, we implement our proposed framework and evaluate our proposal by
comparing with two popular and latest SPARQL query engines gStore and gStoreD
on the LUBM benchmark. The experiments demonstrate that our proposal MapSQ is
highly efficient and effective (up to 50% speedup).

 <dc:description>  We present Octopus, an AI agent to jointly balance three conflicting task
objectives on a micro-crowdsourcing marketplace - the quality of work, total
cost incurred, and time to completion. Previous control agents have mostly
focused on cost-quality, or cost-time tradeoffs, but not on directly
controlling all three in concert. A naive formulation of three-objective
optimization is intractable; Octopus takes a hierarchical POMDP approach, with
three different components responsible for setting the pay per task, selecting
the next task, and controlling task-level quality. We demonstrate that Octopus
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on real
experiments. We also deploy Octopus on Amazon Mechanical Turk, showing its
ability to manage tasks in a real-world dynamic setting.

 <dc:description>  Incremental learning with concept drift has often been tackled by ensemble
methods, where models built in the past can be re-trained to attain new models
for the current data. Two design questions need to be addressed in developing
ensemble methods for incremental learning with concept drift, i.e., which
historical (i.e., previously trained) models should be preserved and how to
utilize them. A novel ensemble learning method, namely Diversity and Transfer
based Ensemble Learning (DTEL), is proposed in this paper. Given newly arrived
data, DTEL uses each preserved historical model as an initial model and further
trains it with the new data via transfer learning. Furthermore, DTEL preserves
a diverse set of historical models, rather than a set of historical models that
are merely accurate in terms of classification accuracy. Empirical studies on
15 synthetic data streams and 4 real-world data streams (all with concept
drifts) demonstrate that DTEL can handle concept drift more effectively than 4
other state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  The deployment of a large number of small cells poses new challenges to
energy efficiency, which has often been ignored in fifth generation (5G)
cellular networks. While massive multiple-input multiple outputs (MIMO) will
reduce the transmission power at the expense of higher computational cost, the
question remains as to which computation or transmission power is more
important in the energy efficiency of 5G small cell networks. Thus, the main
objective in this paper is to investigate the computation power based on the
Landauer principle. Simulation results reveal that more than 50% of the energy
is consumed by the computation power at 5G small cell BS's. Moreover, the
computation power of 5G small cell BS can approach 800 watt when the massive
MIMO (e.g., 128 antennas) is deployed to transmit high volume traffic. This
clearly indicates that computation power optimization can play a major role in
the energy efficiency of small cell networks.

 <dc:description>  Many security protocols rely on the assumptions on the physical properties in
which its protocol sessions will be carried out. For instance, Distance
Bounding Protocols take into account the round trip time of messages and the
transmission velocity to infer an upper bound of the distance between two
agents. We classify such security protocols as Cyber-Physical. Time plays a key
role in design and analysis of many of these protocols. This paper investigates
the foundational differences and the impacts on the analysis when using models
with discrete time and models with dense time. We show that there are attacks
that can be found by models using dense time, but not when using discrete time.
We illustrate this with a novel attack that can be carried out on most Distance
Bounding Protocols. In this attack, one exploits the execution delay of
instructions during one clock cycle to convince a verifier that he is in a
location different from his actual position. We additionally present a
probabilistic analysis of this novel attack. As a formal model for representing
and analyzing Cyber-Physical properties, we propose a Multiset Rewriting model
with dense time suitable for specifying cyber-physical security protocols. We
introduce Circle-Configurations and show that they can be used to symbolically
solve the reachability problem for our model, and show that for the important
class of balanced theories the reachability problem is PSPACE-complete. We also
show how our model can be implemented using the computational rewriting tool
Maude, the machinery that automatically searches for such attacks.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in
image classification tasks for benchmark and practical uses. The CNNs with
deeper architectures have achieved higher performances recently thanks to their
robustness to parallel shift of objects in images aw well as their numerous
parameters and resulting high expression ability. However, the CNNs have a
limited robustness to other geometric transformations such as scaling and
rotation. This problem is considered to limit performance improvement of the
deep CNNs but there is no established solution. This study focuses on scale
transformation and proposes a novel network architecture called weight-shared
multi-stage network (WSMS-Net), consisting of multiple stages of CNNs. The
WSMS-Net is easily combined with existing deep CNNs, such as ResNet and
DenseNet, and enables them to acquire a robustness to scaling of objects. The
experimental results demonstrate that existing deep CNNs combined with the
proposed WSMS-Net achieve higher accuracy for image classification tasks only
with a little increase in the number of parameters.

 <dc:description>  Opportunity detection at secondary transmitters (TXs) is a key technique
enabling cognitive radio (CR) networks. Such detection however cannot guarantee
reliable communication at secondary receivers (RXs), especially when their
association distance is long. To cope with the issue, this paper proposes a
novel MAC called sense-and-predict (SaP), where each secondary TX decides
whether to access or not based on the prediction of the interference level at
RX. Firstly, we provide the spatial interference correlation in a probabilistic
form using stochastic geometry, and utilize it to maximize the area spectral
efficiency (ASE) for secondary networks while guaranteeing the service quality
of primary networks. Through simulations and testbed experiments using USRP,
SaP is shown to always achieve ASE improvement compared with the conventional
TX based sensing.

 <dc:title>On the capacity of bandlimited optical intensity channels with Gaussian
  noise</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhou, Jing</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Wenyi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We determine lower and upper bounds on the capacity of bandlimited optical
intensity channels (BLOIC) with white Gaussian noise. Three types of input
power constraints are considered: 1) only an average power constraint, 2) only
a peak power constraint, and 3) an average and a peak power constraint.
Capacity lower bounds are derived by a two-step process including 1) for each
type of constraint, designing admissible pulse amplitude modulated input
waveform ensembles, and 2) lower bounding the maximum achievable information
rates of the designed input ensembles. Capacity upper bounds are derived by
exercising constraint relaxations and utilizing known results on discrete-time
optical intensity channels. We obtain degrees-of-freedom-optimal (DOF-optimal)
lower bounds which have the same pre-log factor as the upper bounds, thereby
characterizing the high SNR capacity of BLOIC to within a finite gap. We
further derive intersymbol-interference-free (ISI-free) signaling based lower
bounds, which perform well for all practical SNR values. In particular, the
ISI-free signaling based lower bounds outperform the DOF-optimal lower bound
when the SNR is below 10 dB.

 <dc:description>  In program algebra, an algebraic theory of single-pass instruction sequences,
three congruences on instruction sequences are paid attention to: instruction
sequence congruence, structural congruence, and behavioural congruence. Sound
and complete axiom systems for the first two congruences were already given in
early papers on program algebra. The current paper is the first one that is
concerned with an axiom system for the third congruence. The presented axiom
system is especially notable for its axioms that have to do with forward jump

 <dc:description>  As a result of several successful applications in computer vision and image
processing, sparse representation (SR) has attracted significant attention in
multi-sensor image fusion. Unlike the traditional multiscale transforms (MSTs)
that presume the basis functions, SR learns an over-complete dictionary from a
set of training images for image fusion, and it achieves more stable and
meaningful representations of the source images. By doing so, the SR-based
fusion methods generally outperform the traditional MST-based image fusion
methods in both subjective and objective tests. In addition, they are less
susceptible to mis-registration among the source images, thus facilitating the
practical applications. This survey paper proposes a systematic review of the
SR-based multi-sensor image fusion literature, highlighting the pros and cons
of each category of approaches. Specifically, we start by performing a
theoretical investigation of the entire system from three key algorithmic
aspects, (1) sparse representation models; (2) dictionary learning methods; and
(3) activity levels and fusion rules. Subsequently, we show how the existing
works address these scientific problems and design the appropriate fusion rules
for each application, such as multi-focus image fusion and multi-modality
(e.g., infrared and visible) image fusion. At last, we carry out some
experiments to evaluate the impact of these three algorithmic components on the
fusion performance when dealing with different applications. This article is
expected to serve as a tutorial and source of reference for researchers
preparing to enter the field or who desire to employ the sparse representation
theory in other fields.

 <dc:title>A Technical Report: Entity Extraction using Both Character-based and

 <dc:description>  Entity extraction is fundamental to many text mining tasks such as
organisation name recognition. A popular approach to entity extraction is based
on matching sub-string candidates in a document against a dictionary of
entities. To handle spelling errors and name variations of entities, usually
the matching is approximate and edit or Jaccard distance is used to measure
dissimilarity between sub-string candidates and the entities. For approximate
entity extraction from free text, existing work considers solely
character-based or solely token-based similarity and hence cannot
simultaneously deal with minor variations at token level and typos. In this
paper, we address this problem by considering both character-based similarity
and token-based similarity (i.e. two-level similarity). Measuring one-level
(e.g. character-based) similarity is computationally expensive, and measuring
two-level similarity is dramatically more expensive. By exploiting the
properties of the two-level similarity and the weights of tokens, we develop
novel techniques to significantly reduce the number of sub-string candidates
that require computation of two-level similarity against the dictionary of
entities. A comprehensive experimental study on real world datasets show that
our algorithm can efficiently extract entities from documents and produce a
high F1 score in the range of [0.91, 0.97].

 <dc:title>A better model of computation for digital physics?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This note is meant to invite the reader to consider interaction nets, a
relatively recently discovered model of computation, as a possible alternative
for cellular automata which are often employed as the basis for digital
physics. Defined as graph-like structures (in contrast to the grids for
cellular automata), interaction nets possess a set of interesting properties,
such as locality, linearity, and strong confluence, which together result in
so-called clockless computation in the sense that they do not require any
global clock in order to operate. We believe that an attempt of using
interaction nets as a replacement for cellular automata may lead to a new view
in digital physics.

 <dc:description>  There has been relatively little attention to incorporating linguistic prior
to neural machine translation. Much of the previous work was further
constrained to considering linguistic prior on the source side. In this paper,
we propose a hybrid model, called NMT+RNNG, that learns to parse and translate
by combining the recurrent neural network grammar into the attention-based
neural machine translation. Our approach encourages the neural machine
translation model to incorporate linguistic prior during training, and lets it
translate on its own afterward. Extensive experiments with four language pairs
show the effectiveness of the proposed NMT+RNNG.

 <dc:title>Leader Election in Trees with Customized Advice</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Leader election is a basic symmetry breaking problem in distributed
computing. All nodes of a network have to agree on a single node, called the
leader. If the nodes of the network have distinct labels, then agreeing on a
single node means that all nodes have to output the label of the elected
leader.
  If the nodes are anonymous, the task of leader election is formulated as
follows: every node of the network must output a simple path starting at it,
which is coded as a sequence of port numbers, such that all these paths end at
a common node, the leader. In this paper, we study deterministic leader
election in anonymous trees.
  Our goal is to establish tradeoffs between the allocated time $\tau$ and the
amount of information that has to be given {\em a priori} to the nodes of a
network to enable leader election in time $\tau$. Following the framework of
{\em algorithms with advice}, this information is provided to all nodes at the
start by an oracle knowing the entire tree, in form of binary strings assigned
to all nodes. There are two possible variants of formulating this advice
assignment. Either the strings provided to all nodes are identical, or strings
assigned to different nodes may be potentially different, i.e., advice can be
{\em customized}. As opposed to previous papers on leader election with advice,
in this paper we consider the latter option.
  The maximum length of all assigned binary strings is called the {\em size of
advice}.
  For a given time $\tau$ allocated to leader election, we give upper and lower
bounds on the minimum size of advice sufficient to perform leader election in
time $\tau$. All our bounds except one pair are tight up to multiplicative
constants, and in this one exceptional case, the gap between the upper and the
lower bound is very small.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the identification of large-scale 1D networks consisting
of identical LTI dynamical systems. A new subspace identification method is
developed that only uses local input-output information and does not rely on
knowledge about the local state interaction. The identification of the local
system matrices (up to a similarity transformation) is done via a low
dimensional subspace retrieval step that enables the estimation of the Markov
parameters of a locally lifted system. Using the estimated Markov parameters,
the state-space realization of a single subsystem in the network is determined.
The low dimensional subspace retrieval step exploits various key structural
properties that are present in the data equation such as a low rank property
and a {\em two-layer} Toeplitz structure in the data matrices constructed from
products of the system matrices. For the estimation of the system matrices of a
single subsystem, it is formulated as a structured low-rank matrix
factorization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed identification method
is demonstrated by a simulation example.

 <dc:description>  The contribution of this paper is twofold. The first is a novel dataset for
studying behaviors of traffic participants while crossing. Our dataset contains
more than 650 samples of pedestrian behaviors in various street configurations
and weather conditions. These examples were selected from approx. 240 hours of
driving in the city, suburban and urban roads. The second contribution is an
analysis of our data from the point of view of joint attention. We identify
what types of non-verbal communication cues road users use at the point of
crossing, their responses, and under what circumstances the crossing event
takes place. It was found that in more than 90% of the cases pedestrians gaze
at the approaching cars prior to crossing in non-signalized crosswalks. The
crossing action, however, depends on additional factors such as time to
collision (TTC), explicit driver's reaction or structure of the crosswalk.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how the COSMA environment can be used
for system modeling. This environment is a set of tools based on Concurrent
State Machines paradigm and is developed in the Institute of Computer Science
at the Warsaw University of Technology. Our demonstration example is a
distributed brake control system dedicated for a railway transport. The paper
shortly introduces COSMA. Next it shows how the example model can be validated
by our temporal logic analyzer.

 <dc:title>Evaluation of Temporal Formulas Based on &quot;Checking By Spheres&quot;</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>D.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classical algorithms of evaluation of temporal CTL formulas are constructed
&quot;bottom-up&quot;. A formula must be evaluated completely to give the result. In the
paper, a new concept of &quot;top-down&quot; evaluation of temporal QsCTL (CTL with state
quantifiers) formulas, called &quot;Checking By Spheres&quot; is presented. The new
algorithm has two general advantages: the evaluation may be stopped on certain
conditions in early steps of the algorithm (not the whole formula and not whole
state space should be analyzed), and state quantification may be used in
formulas (even if a range of a quantifier is not statically obtainable).

 <dc:description>  A considerable amount of machine learning algorithms take instance-feature
matrices as their inputs. As such, they cannot directly analyze time series
data due to its temporal nature, usually unequal lengths, and complex
properties. This is a great pity since many of these algorithms are effective,
robust, efficient, and easy to use. In this paper, we bridge this gap by
proposing an efficient representation learning framework that is able to
convert a set of time series with equal or unequal lengths to a matrix format.
In particular, we guarantee that the pairwise similarities between time series
are well preserved after the transformation. The learned feature representation
is particularly suitable to the class of learning problems that are sensitive
to data similarities. Given a set of $n$ time series, we first construct an
$n\times n$ partially observed similarity matrix by randomly sampling $O(n \log
n)$ pairs of time series and computing their pairwise similarities. We then
propose an extremely efficient algorithm that solves a highly non-convex and
NP-hard problem to learn new features based on the partially observed
similarity matrix. We use the learned features to conduct experiments on both
data classification and clustering tasks. Our extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework is both effective and efficient.

 <dc:title>Post-Quantum Cryptography(PQC): Generalized ElGamal Cipher over
  GF(251^8)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hecht, Pedro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) attempts to find cryptographic protocols
resistant to attacks by means of for instance Shor's polynomial time algorithm
for numerical field problems like integer factorization (IFP) or the discrete
logarithm (DLP). Other aspects are the backdoors discovered in deterministic
random generators or recent advances in solving some instances of DLP. The use
of alternative algebraic structures like non-commutative or non-associative
partial groupoids, magmas, monoids, semigroups, quasigroups or groups, are
valid choices for these new kinds of protocols. In this paper, we focus in an
asymmetric cipher based on a generalized ElGamal non-arbitrated protocol using
a non-commutative general linear group. The developed protocol forces a hard
subgroup membership search problem into a non-commutative structure. The
protocol involves at first a generalized Diffie-Hellman key interchange and
further on the private and public parameters are recursively updated each time
a new cipher session is launched. Security is based on a hard variation of the
Generalized Symmetric Decomposition Problem (GSDP). Working with GF(251^8) a
64-bits security is achieved, and if GF(251^16) is chosen, the security rises
to 127-bits. An appealing feature is that there is no need for big number
libraries as all arithmetic if performed in Z_251 and therefore the new
protocol is particularly useful for computational platforms with very limited
capabilities like smartphones or smartcards.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we generalize the well-known index coding problem to exploit
the structure in the source-data to improve system throughput. In many
applications, the data to be transmitted may lie (or can be well approximated)
in a low-dimensional subspace. We exploit this low-dimensional structure of the
data using an algebraic framework to solve the index coding problem (referred
to as subspace-aware index coding) as opposed to the traditional index coding
problem which is subspace-unaware. Also, we propose an efficient algorithm
based on the alternating minimization approach to obtain near optimal index
codes for both subspace-aware and -unaware cases. Our simulations indicate that
under certain conditions, a significant throughput gain (about 90%) can be
achieved by subspace-aware index codes over conventional subspace-unaware index
codes.

 <dc:description>  In some applications, the variance of additive measurement noise depends on
the signal that we aim to measure. For instance, additive Gaussian
signal-dependent noise (AGSDN) channel models are used in molecular and optical
communication. Herein we provide lower and upper bounds on the capacity of
additive signal-dependent noise (ASDN) channels. The idea of the first lower
bound is the extension of the majorization inequality, and for the second one,
it uses some calculations based on the fact that $h(Y) &gt; h (Y|Z)$. Both of them
are valid for all additive signal-dependent noise (ASDN) channels defined in
the paper. The upper bound is based on a previous idea of the authors
(&quot;symmetric relative entropy&quot;) and is used for the additive Gaussian
signal-dependent noise (AGSDN) channels. These bounds indicate that in ASDN
channels (unlike the classical AWGN channels), the capacity does not
necessarily become larger by making the variance function of the noise smaller.
We also provide sufficient conditions under which the capacity becomes
infinity. This is complemented by a number of conditions that imply capacity is
finite and a unique capacity achieving measure exists (in the sense of the
output measure).

 <dc:description>  In this paper we explore whether or not deep neural architectures can learn
to classify Boolean satisfiability (SAT). We devote considerable time to
discussing the theoretical properties of SAT. Then, we define a graph
representation for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form, and train
neural classifiers over general graph structures called Graph Neural Networks,
or GNNs, to recognize features of satisfiability. To the best of our knowledge
this has never been tried before. Our preliminary findings are potentially
profound. In a weakly-supervised setting, that is, without problem specific
feature engineering, Graph Neural Networks can learn features of
satisfiability.

 <dc:title>Genetic and Memetic Algorithm with Diversity Equilibrium based on Greedy

 <dc:description>  The lack of diversity in a genetic algorithm's population may lead to a bad
performance of the genetic operators since there is not an equilibrium between
exploration and exploitation. In those cases, genetic algorithms present a fast
and unsuitable convergence.
  In this paper we develop a novel hybrid genetic algorithm which attempts to
obtain a balance between exploration and exploitation. It confronts the
diversity problem using the named greedy diversification operator. Furthermore,
the proposed algorithm applies a competition between parent and children so as
to exploit the high quality visited solutions. These operators are complemented
by a simple selection mechanism designed to preserve and take advantage of the
population diversity.
  Additionally, we extend our proposal to the field of memetic algorithms,
obtaining an improved model with outstanding results in practice.
  The experimental study shows the validity of the approach as well as how
important is taking into account the exploration and exploitation concepts when
designing an evolutionary algorithm.

 <dc:title>Novel Baseband Equivalent Models of Quadrature Modulated All-Digital

 <dc:description>  In this paper an exact baseband equivalent model of a quadrature modulated
all-digital transmitter is derived. No restrictions on the number of levels of
a digital switched-mode power amplifier (SMPA) driving input, nor the pulse
encoding scheme employed, are made. This implies a high level of generality of
the proposed model. We show that all-digital transmitter (ADT) can be
represented as a series connection of the pulse encoder, discrete-time Volterra
series model of fixed degree and memory depth, and a linear time-varying system
with special properties. This result suggests a new analytically motivated
structure of a digital predistortion (DPD) of SMPA nonlinearities in ADT.
Numerical simulations in MATLAB are used to verify proposed baseband equivalent
model.

 <dc:description>  Underwater cameras are widely used to observe the sea floor. They are usually
included in autonomous underwater vehicles, unmanned underwater vehicles, and
in situ ocean sensor networks. Despite being an important sensor for monitoring
underwater scenes, there exist many issues with recent underwater camera
sensors. Because of lights transportation characteristics in water and the
biological activity at the sea floor, the acquired underwater images often
suffer from scatters and large amounts of noise. Over the last five years, many
methods have been proposed to overcome traditional underwater imaging problems.
This paper aims to review the state-of-the-art techniques in underwater image
processing by highlighting the contributions and challenges presented in over
40 papers. We present an overview of various underwater image processing
approaches, such as underwater image descattering, underwater image color
restoration, and underwater image quality assessments. Finally, we summarize
the future trends and challenges in designing and processing underwater imaging
sensors.

 <dc:description>  In the Best-$k$-Arm problem, we are given $n$ stochastic bandit arms, each
associated with an unknown reward distribution. We are required to identify the
$k$ arms with the largest means by taking as few samples as possible. In this
paper, we make progress towards a complete characterization of the
instance-wise sample complexity bounds for the Best-$k$-Arm problem. On the
lower bound side, we obtain a novel complexity term to measure the sample
complexity that every Best-$k$-Arm instance requires. This is derived by an
interesting and nontrivial reduction from the Best-$1$-Arm problem. We also
provide an elimination-based algorithm that matches the instance-wise lower
bound within doubly-logarithmic factors. The sample complexity of our algorithm
strictly dominates the state-of-the-art for Best-$k$-Arm (module constant
factors).

 <dc:description>  A finite abstract simplicial complex G defines two finite simple graphs: the
Barycentric refinement G1, connecting two simplices if one is a subset of the
other and the connection graph G', connecting two simplices if they intersect.
We prove that the Poincare-Hopf value i(x)=1-X(S(x)), where X is Euler
characteristics and S(x) is the unit sphere of a vertex x in G1, agrees with
the Green function value g(x,x),the diagonal element of the inverse of (1+A'),
where A' is the adjacency matrix of G'. By unimodularity, det(1+A') is the
product of parities (-1)^dim(x) of simplices in G, the Fredholm matrix 1+A' is
in GL(n,Z), where n is the number of simplices in G. We show that the set of
possible unit sphere topologies in G1 is a combinatorial invariant of the
complex G. So, also the Green function range of G is a combinatorial invariant.
To prove the invariance of the unit sphere topology we use that all unit
spheres in G1 decompose as a join of a stable and unstable part. The join
operation + renders the category X of simplicial complexes into a monoid, where
the empty complex is the 0 element and the cone construction adds 1. The
augmented Grothendieck group (X,+,0) contains the graph and sphere monoids
(Graphs, +,0) and (Spheres,+,0). The Poincare-Hopf functionals i(G) as well as
the volume are multiplicative functions on (X,+). For the sphere group, both
i(G) as well as Fredholm characteristic are characters. The join + can be
augmented with a product * so that we have a commutative ring (X,+,0,*,1)for
which there are both additive and multiplicative primes and which contains as a
subring of signed complete complexes isomorphic to the integers (Z,+,0,*,1). We
also look at the spectrum of the Laplacian of the join of two graphs. Both for
addition + and multiplication *, one can ask whether unique prime factorization
holds.

 <dc:description>  Short-term probabilistic wind power forecasting can provide critical
quantified uncertainty information of wind generation for power system
operation and control. As the complicated characteristics of wind power
prediction error, it would be difficult to develop a universal forecasting
model dominating over other alternative models. Therefore, a novel multi-model
combination (MMC) approach for short-term probabilistic wind generation
forecasting is proposed in this paper to exploit the advantages of different
forecasting models. The proposed approach can combine different forecasting
models those provide different kinds of probability density functions to
improve the probabilistic forecast accuracy. Three probabilistic forecasting
models based on the sparse Bayesian learning, kernel density estimation and
beta distribution fitting are used to form the combined model. The parameters
of the MMC model are solved based on Bayesian framework. Numerical tests
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMC approach.

 <dc:description>  Online learning with streaming data in a distributed and collaborative manner
can be useful in a wide range of applications. This topic has been receiving
considerable attention in recent years with emphasis on both single-task and
multitask scenarios. In single-task adaptation, agents cooperate to track an
objective of common interest, while in multitask adaptation agents track
multiple objectives simultaneously. Regularization is one useful technique to
promote and exploit similarity among tasks in the latter scenario. This work
examines an alternative way to model relations among tasks by assuming that
they all share a common latent feature representation. As a result, a new
multitask learning formulation is presented and algorithms are developed for
its solution in a distributed online manner. We present a unified framework to
analyze the mean-square-error performance of the adaptive strategies, and
conduct simulations to illustrate the theoretical findings and potential
applications.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of binary prediction with expert advice in settings
where experts have agency and seek to maximize their credibility. This paper
makes three main contributions. First, it defines a model to reason formally
about settings with selfish experts, and demonstrates that &quot;incentive
compatible&quot; (IC) algorithms are closely related to the design of proper scoring
rules. Designing a good IC algorithm is easy if the designer's loss function is
quadratic, but for other loss functions, novel techniques are required. Second,
we design IC algorithms with good performance guarantees for the absolute loss
function. Third, we give a formal separation between the power of online
prediction with selfish experts and online prediction with honest experts by
proving lower bounds for both IC and non-IC algorithms. In particular, with
selfish experts and the absolute loss function, there is no (randomized)
algorithm for online prediction-IC or otherwise-with asymptotically vanishing
regret.

 <dc:title>Complexity of mixed equilibria in Boolean games</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ianovski, Egor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Boolean games are a succinct representation of strategic games wherein a
player seeks to satisfy a formula of propositional logic by selecting a truth
assignment to a set of propositional variables under his control.
  The framework has proven popular within the multiagent community, however,
almost invariably, the work to date has been restricted to the case of pure
strategies. Such a focus is highly restrictive as the notion of randomised play
is fundamental to the theory of strategic games -- even very simple games can
fail to have pure-strategy equilibria, but every finite game has at least one
equilibrium in mixed strategies.
  To address this, the present work focuses on the complexity of algorithmic
problems dealing with mixed strategies in Boolean games. The main result is
that the problem of determining whether a two-player game has an equilibrium
satisfying a given payoff constraint is NEXP-complete. Based on this result, we
then demonstrate that a number of other decision problems, such as the
uniqueness of an equilibrium or the satisfaction of a given formula in
equilibrium, are either NEXP or coNEXP-complete. The proof techniques developed
in the course of this are then used to show that the problem of deciding
whether a given profile is in equilibrium is coNP^#P-hard, and the problem of
deciding whether a Boolean game has a rational-valued equilibrium is NEXP-hard,
and whether a two-player Boolean game has an irrational-valued equilibrium is
NEXP-complete. Finally, we show that determining whether the value of a
two-player zero-sum game exceeds a given threshold is EXP-complete.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between information
and communication technology (ICT) and knowledge management processes (KM
process) in Indian milk co-operatives and non-government organizations. Both
qualitative and quantitative methods have been adopted in this study. Data were
collected using questionnaires from 275 members working in both milk
co-operatives and non-profit organizations (NGOs). The analysis and hypotheses
testing were implemented using structural equation modeling technique (SEM).
The results showed that ICT has significant (at p = 0.001) and positive effect
on KM processes. The results obtained would help managers to better understand
the linkage between ICT and KM processes. They could use the results to improve
their ICT (tools and infrastructure) for improving the efficiency of KM process
in their organizations. The proposed set of metrics could be used as common
tools to measure the performance of ICT in KM process in agriculture
organizations and for future research.

 <dc:title>Separation of AC$^0[\oplus]$ Formulas and Circuits</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rossman, Benjamin</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper gives the first separation between the power of {\em formulas} and
{\em circuits} of equal depth in the $\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ basis (unbounded
fan-in AND, OR, NOT and MOD$_2$ gates). We show, for all $d(n) \le O(\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n})$, that there exist {\em polynomial-size depth-$d$ circuits}
that are not equivalent to {\em depth-$d$ formulas of size $n^{o(d)}$}
(moreover, this is optimal in that $n^{o(d)}$ cannot be improved to
$n^{O(d)}$). This result is obtained by a combination of new lower and upper
bounds for {\em Approximate Majorities}, the class of Boolean functions
$\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ that agree with the Majority function on $3/4$ fraction
of inputs.
  $\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ formula lower bound: We show that every depth-$d$
$\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ formula of size $s$ has a {\em $1/8$-error polynomial
approximation} over $\mathbb{F}_2$ of degree $O(\frac{1}{d}\log s)^{d-1}$. This
strengthens a classic $O(\log s)^{d-1}$ degree approximation for
\underline{circuits} due to Razborov. Since the Majority function has
approximate degree $\Theta(\sqrt n)$, this result implies an
$\exp(\Omega(dn^{1/2(d-1)}))$ lower bound on the depth-$d$
$\mathrm{AC}^0[\oplus]$ formula size of all Approximate Majority functions for
all $d(n) \le O(\log n)$.
  Monotone $\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuit upper bound: For all $d(n) \le O(\frac{\log
n}{\log\log n})$, we give a randomized construction of depth-$d$ monotone
$\mathrm{AC}^0$ circuits (without NOT or MOD$_2$ gates) of size
$\exp(O(n^{1/2(d-1)}))$ that compute an Approximate Majority function. This
strengthens a construction of \underline{formulas} of size
$\exp(O(dn^{1/2(d-1)}))$ due to Amano.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies an auction design problem for a seller to sell a commodity
in a social network, where each individual (the seller or a buyer) can only
communicate with her neighbors. The challenge to the seller is to design a
mechanism to incentivize the buyers, who are aware of the auction, to further
propagate the information to their neighbors so that more buyers will
participate in the auction and hence, the seller will be able to make a higher
revenue. We propose a novel auction mechanism, called information diffusion
mechanism (IDM), which incentivizes the buyers to not only truthfully report
their valuations on the commodity to the seller, but also further propagate the
auction information to all their neighbors. In comparison, the direct extension
of the well-known Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism in social networks can
also incentivize the information diffusion, but it will decrease the seller's
revenue or even lead to a deficit sometimes. The formalization of the problem
has not yet been addressed in the literature of mechanism design and our
solution is very significant in the presence of large-scale online social
networks.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent research has demonstrated that the rotor angle stability can be
assessed by identifying the sign of the system maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE).
A positive (negative) MLE implies unstable (stable) rotor angle dynamics.
However, because the MLE may fluctuate between positive and negative values for
a long time after a severe disturbance, it is difficult to determine the system
stability when observing a positive or negative MLE without knowing its further
fluctuation trend. In this paper, a new approach for online rotor angle
stability assessment is proposed to address this problem. The MLE is estimated
by a recursive least square (RLS) based method based on real-time rotor angle
measurements, and two critical parameters, the Theiler window and the MLE
estimation initial time step, are carefully chosen to make sure the calculated
MLE curves present distinct features for different stability conditions. By
using the proposed stability assessment criteria, the developed approach can
provide timely and reliable assessment of the rotor angle stability. Extensive
tests on the New-England 39-bus system and the Northeast Power Coordinating
Council 140-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Kernel regression is an essential and ubiquitous tool for non-parametric data
analysis, particularly popular among time series and spatial data. However, the
central operation which is performed many times, evaluating a kernel on the
data set, takes linear time. This is impractical for modern large data sets.
  In this paper we describe coresets for kernel regression: compressed data
sets which can be used as proxy for the original data and have provably bounded
worst case error. The size of the coresets are independent of the raw number of
data points, rather they only depend on the error guarantee, and in some cases
the size of domain and amount of smoothing. We evaluate our methods on very
large time series and spatial data, and demonstrate that they incur negligible
error, can be constructed extremely efficiently, and allow for great
computational gains.

 <dc:description>  Parikh matrices have been extensively investigated due to their usefulness in
studying subword occurrences in words. Due to the dependency of Parikh matrices
on the ordering of the alphabet, strong M-equivalence was proposed as an
order-independent alternative to M-equivalence in studying words possessing the
same Parikh matrix. This paper introduces and studies the notions of strong 2.t
and strong 3.t transformations in determining when two ternary words are
strongly M-equivalent. The irreducibility of strong 2.t transformations are
then scrutinized, exemplified by a structural characterization of irreducible
strong 2.2 transformations. The common limitation of these transformations in
characterizing strong M-equivalence is then addressed.

 <dc:description>  Agglutinative languages such as Turkish, Finnish and Hungarian require
morphological disambiguation before further processing due to the complex
morphology of words. A morphological disambiguator is used to select the
correct morphological analysis of a word. Morphological disambiguation is
important because it generally is one of the first steps of natural language
processing and its performance affects subsequent analyses. In this paper, we
propose a system that uses deep learning techniques for morphological
disambiguation. Many of the state-of-the-art results in computer vision, speech
recognition and natural language processing have been obtained through deep
learning models. However, applying deep learning techniques to morphologically
rich languages is not well studied. In this work, while we focus on Turkish
morphological disambiguation we also present results for French and German in
order to show that the proposed architecture achieves high accuracy with no
language-specific feature engineering or additional resource. In the
experiments, we achieve 84.12, 88.35 and 93.78 morphological disambiguation
accuracy among the ambiguous words for Turkish, German and French respectively.

 <dc:description>  Graphics Processing Units allow for running massively parallel applications
offloading the CPU from computationally intensive resources, however GPUs have
a limited amount of memory. In this paper a trie compression algorithm for
massively parallel pattern matching is presented demonstrating 85% less space
requirements than the original highly efficient parallel failure-less
aho-corasick, whilst demonstrating over 22 Gbps throughput. The algorithm
presented takes advantage of compressed row storage matrices as well as shared
and texture memory on the GPU.

 <dc:description>  In spite of recent progress, soft robotics still suffers from a lack of
unified modeling framework. Nowadays, the most adopted model for the design and
control of soft robots is the piece-wise constant curvature model, with its
consolidated benefits and drawbacks. In this work, an alternative model for
multisection soft robots dynamics is presented based on a discrete Cosserat
approach, which, not only takes into account shear and torsional deformations,
essentials to cope with out-of-plane external loads, but also inherits the
geometrical and mechanical properties of the continuous Cosserat model, making
it the natural soft robotics counterpart of the traditional rigid robotics
dynamics model. The soundness of the model is demonstrated through extensive
simulation and experimental results for both plane and out-of-plane motions.

 <dc:description>  The emergent field of probabilistic numerics has thus far lacked clear
statistical principals. This paper establishes Bayesian probabilistic numerical
methods as those which can be cast as solutions to certain inverse problems
within the Bayesian framework. This allows us to establish general conditions
under which Bayesian probabilistic numerical methods are well-defined,
encompassing both non-linear and non-Gaussian models. For general computation,
a numerical approximation scheme is proposed and its asymptotic convergence
established. The theoretical development is then extended to pipelines of
computation, wherein probabilistic numerical methods are composed to solve more
challenging numerical tasks. The contribution highlights an important research
frontier at the interface of numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification,
with a challenging industrial application presented.

 <dc:description>  With the emerging of the fifth generation (5G) mobile communication systems
and software defined networks, not only the performance of vehicular networks
could be improved but also new applications of vehicular networks are required
by future vehicles, e.g., pilotless vehicles. To meet requirements from
intelligent transportation systems, a new vehicular network architecture
integrated with 5G mobile communication technologies and software defined
network is proposed in this paper. Moreover, fog cells have been proposed to
flexibly cover vehicles and avoid frequently handover between vehicles and road
side units (RSUs). Based on the proposed 5G software defined vehicular
networks, the transmission delay and throughput are analyzed and compared.
Simulation results indicate that there exist a minimum transmission delay of 5G
software defined vehicular networks considering different vehicle densities.
Moreover, the throughput of fog cells in 5G software defined vehicular networks
is better than the throughput of traditional transportation management systems.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) is the next big evolutionary step in the world of
internet. The main intention behind the IoT is to enable safer living and risk
mitigation on different levels of life. With the advent of IoT botnets, the
view towards IoT devices has changed from enabler of enhanced living into
Internet of vulnerabilities for cyber criminals. IoT botnets has exposed two
different glaring issues, 1) A large number of IoT devices are accessible over
public Internet. 2) Security (if considered at all) is often an afterthought in
the architecture of many wide spread IoT devices. In this article, we briefly
outline the anatomy of the IoT botnets and their basic mode of operations. Some
of the major DDoS incidents using IoT botnets in recent times along with the
corresponding exploited vulnerabilities will be discussed. We also provide
remedies and recommendations to mitigate IoT related cyber risks and briefly
illustrate the importance of cyber insurance in the modern connected world.

 <dc:description>  Computer-assisted surgery (CAS) aims to provide the surgeon with the right
type of assistance at the right moment. Such assistance systems are especially
relevant in laparoscopic surgery, where CAS can alleviate some of the drawbacks
that surgeons incur. For many assistance functions, e.g. displaying the
location of a tumor at the appropriate time or suggesting what instruments to
prepare next, analyzing the surgical workflow is a prerequisite. Since
laparoscopic interventions are performed via endoscope, the video signal is an
obvious sensor modality to rely on for workflow analysis.
  Image-based workflow analysis tasks in laparoscopy, such as phase
recognition, skill assessment, video indexing or automatic annotation, require
a temporal distinction between video frames. Generally computer vision based
methods that generalize from previously seen data are used. For training such
methods, large amounts of annotated data are necessary. Annotating surgical
data requires expert knowledge, therefore collecting a sufficient amount of
data is difficult, time-consuming and not always feasible.
  In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an unsupervised method
for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between
laparoscopic video frames on a temporal basis. We extract video frames at
regular intervals from 324 unlabeled laparoscopic interventions, resulting in a
dataset of approximately 2.2 million images. From this dataset, we extract
image pairs from the same video and train a CNN to determine their temporal
order. To solve this problem, the CNN has to extract features that are relevant
for comprehending laparoscopic workflow.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a CNN can be adapted for surgical
workflow segmentation. We performed image-based workflow segmentation on a
publicly available dataset of 7 cholecystectomies and 9 colorectal
interventions.

 <dc:title>An Efficient Decomposition Framework for Discriminative Segmentation
  with Supermodular Losses</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yu, Jiaqian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Blaschko, Matthew B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Several supermodular losses have been shown to improve the perceptual quality
of image segmentation in a discriminative framework such as a structured output
support vector machine (SVM). These loss functions do not necessarily have the
same structure as the one used by the segmentation inference algorithm, and in
general, we may have to resort to generic submodular minimization algorithms
for loss augmented inference. Although these come with polynomial time
guarantees, they are not practical to apply to image scale data. Many
supermodular losses come with strong optimization guarantees, but are not
readily incorporated in a loss augmented graph cuts procedure. This motivates
our strategy of employing the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) decomposition for loss augmented inference. In doing so, we create a new
API for the structured SVM that separates the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
inference of the model from the loss augmentation during training. In this way,
we gain computational efficiency, making new choices of loss functions
practical for the first time, while simultaneously making the inference
algorithm employed during training closer to the test time procedure. We show
improvement both in accuracy and computational performance on the Microsoft
Research Grabcut database and a brain structure segmentation task, empirically
validating the use of several supermodular loss functions during training, and
the improved computational properties of the proposed ADMM approach over the
Fujishige-Wolfe minimum norm point algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) relay networks
represent a paradigm shift in the development of wireless networks, enabling
simultaneous radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting (EH) and information
processing. Different from conventional SWIPT relaying schemes, which typically
assume the availability of perfect channel state information (CSI), here we
consider the application of noncoherent modulation in order to avoid the need
of instantaneous CSI estimation/tracking and minimise the energy consumption.
We propose a unified and comprehensive analytical framework for the analysis of
time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures with the
amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. In particular, we adopt a moments-based
approach to derive novel expressions for the outage probability, achievable
throughput, and average symbol error rate (ASER) of the considered SWIPT
system. We quantify the impact of several system parameters, involving relay
location, energy conversion efficiency, and TS and PS ratio assumptions,
imposed on the EH relay terminal. Our results reveal that the throughput
performance of the TS protocol is superior to that of the PS protocol at lower
receive signal-to-noise (SNR) values, which is in contrast to the
point-to-point SWIPT systems. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is
presented to corroborate the proposed analysis.

 <dc:description>  The Internet of Things paradigm envisages the presence of many
battery-powered sensors and this entails the design of energy-aware protocols.
Source coding techniques allow to save some energy by compressing the packets
sent over the network, but at the cost of a poorer accuracy in the
representation of the data. This paper addresses the problem of designing
efficient policies to jointly perform processing and transmission tasks. In
particular, we aim at defining an optimal scheduling strategy with the twofold
ultimate goal of extending the network lifetime and guaranteeing a low overall
distortion of the transmitted data. We propose a Time Division Multiple Access
(TDMA)-based access scheme that optimally allocates resources to heterogeneous
nodes. We use realistic rate-distortion curves to quantify the impact of
compression on the data quality and propose a complete energy model that
includes the energy spent for processing and transmitting the data, as well as
the circuitry costs. Both full knowledge and statistical knowledge of the
wireless channels are considered, and optimal policies are derived for both
cases. The overall problem is structured in a modular fashion and solved
through convex and alternate programming techniques. Finally, we thoroughly
evaluate the proposed algorithms and the influence of the design variables on
the system performance adopting parameters of real sensors.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a Markov chain choice model with single
transition. In this model, customers arrive at each product with a certain
probability. If the arrived product is unavailable, then the seller can
recommend a subset of available products to the customer and the customer will
purchase one of the recommended products or choose not to purchase with certain
transition probabilities. The distinguishing features of the model are that the
seller can control which products to recommend depending on the arrived product
and that each customer either purchases a product or leaves the market after
one transition.
  We study the assortment optimization problem under this model. Particularly,
we show that this problem is generally NP-Hard even if each product could only
transit to at most two products. Despite the complexity of the problem, we
provide polynomial time algorithms for several special cases, such as when the
transition probabilities are homogeneous with respect to the starting point, or
when each product can only transit to one other product. We also provide a
tight performance bound for revenue-ordered assortments. In addition, we
propose a compact mixed integer program formulation that can solve this problem
of large size. Through extensive numerical experiments, we show that the
proposed algorithms can solve the problem efficiently and the obtained
assortments could significantly improve the revenue of the seller than under
the Markov chain choice model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) that learns to solve
simultaneously the three tasks of the cQA challenge proposed by the
SemEval-2016 Task 3, i.e., question-comment similarity, question-question
similarity and new question-comment similarity. The latter is the main task,
which can exploit the previous two for achieving better results. Our DNN is
trained jointly on all the three cQA tasks and learns to encode questions and
comments into a single vector representation shared across the multiple tasks.
The results on the official challenge test set show that our approach produces
higher accuracy and faster convergence rates than the individual neural
networks. Additionally, our method, which does not use any manual feature
engineering, approaches the state of the art established with methods that make
heavy use of it.

 <dc:description>  The MAP-Elites algorithm produces a set of high-performing solutions that
vary according to features defined by the user. This technique has the
potential to be a powerful tool for design space exploration, but is limited by
the need for numerous evaluations. The Surrogate-Assisted Illumination
algorithm (SAIL), introduced here, integrates approximative models and
intelligent sampling of the objective function to minimize the number of
evaluations required by MAP-Elites.
  The ability of SAIL to efficiently produce both accurate models and diverse
high performing solutions is illustrated on a 2D airfoil design problem. The
search space is divided into bins, each holding a design with a different
combination of features. In each bin SAIL produces a better performing solution
than MAP-Elites, and requires several orders of magnitude fewer evaluations.
The CMA-ES algorithm was used to produce an optimal design in each bin: with
the same number of evaluations required by CMA-ES to find a near-optimal
solution in a single bin, SAIL finds solutions of similar quality in every bin.

 <dc:description>  Given an integer base $b&gt;1$, a set of integers is represented in base $b$ by
a language over $\{0,1,...,b-1\}$. The set is said to be $b$-recognisable if
its representation is a regular language. It is known that eventually periodic
sets are $b$-recognisable in every base $b$, and Cobham's theorem implies the
converse: no other set is $b$-recognisable in every base $b$.
  We are interested in deciding whether a $b$-recognisable set of integers
(given as a finite automaton) is eventually periodic. Honkala showed that this
problem decidable in 1986 and recent developments give efficient decision
algorithms. However, they only work when the integers are written with the
least significant digit first.
  In this work, we consider the natural order of digits (Most Significant Digit
First) and give a quasi-linear algorithm to solve the problem in this case.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the performance of a scheduling algorithm where the Mobile
Terminals (MTs) may be turned off if they cause a level of interference greater
than a given threshold. This approach, which is referred to as Interference
Aware Muting (IAM), may be regarded as an interference-aware scheme that is
aimed to reduce the level of interference. We analyze its performance with the
aid of stochastic geometry and compare it against other interference-unaware
and interference-aware schemes, where the level of interference is kept under
control in the power control scheme itself rather than in the scheduling
process. IAM is studied in terms of average transmit power, mean and variance
of the interference, coverage probability, Spectral Efficiency (SE), and Binary
Rate (BR), which accounts for the amount of resources allocated to the typical
MT. Simplified expressions of SE and BR for adaptive modulation and coding
schemes are proposed, which better characterize practical communication
systems. Our system-level analysis unveils that IAM increases the BR and
reduces the mean and variance of the interference. It is proved that an
operating regime exists, where the performance of IAM is independent of the
cell association criterion, which simplifies the joint design of uplink and
downlink transmissions.

 <dc:description>  In a former paper we simplified the proof of a theorem on personalized random
walk that is fundamental to graph nodes clustering and generalized it to
bipartite graphs for a specific case where the proobability of random jump was
proprtional to the number of links of &quot;personally prefereed&quot; nodes. In this
paper we turn to the more complex issue of graphs in which the random jump
follows uniform distribution.

 <dc:description>  We study in-network computation on general network topologies. Specifically,
we are given the description of a function, and a network with designated
distinct nodes at which the operands of the function are made available, and a
designated sink where the computed value of the function is to be consumed. We
want to compute the function during the process of moving the data towards the
sink. Such settings have been studied in the literature, but mainly for
symmetric functions, e.g. average, parity etc., which have the specific
property that the output is invariant to permutation of the operands. To the
best of our knowledge, we present the first fully decentralised algorithms for
arbitrary functions, which we model as those functions whose computation schema
is structured as a binary tree. We propose two algorithms, Fixed
Metropolis-Compute and Flexible Metropolis-Compute, for this problem, both of
which use random walks on the network as their basic primitive. Assuming that
time is slotted, we provide upper bounds on the time taken to compute the
function, characterising this time in terms of the fundamental parameters of
the random walk on the network: the hitting time in the case of Fixed
Metropolis-Compute, and the mixing time in the case of Flexible
Metropolis-Compute. Assuming a stochastic model for the generation of streams
of data at each source, we also provide a lower and an upper bound on the rate
at which Fixed Metropolis-Compute is able to compute the stream of associated
function values.

Jacobi-based algorithm of [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 2(34):651--672, 2013],

 <dc:description>  We begin a systematic study of those finite semigroups that generate join
irreducible members of the lattice of pseudovarieties of finite semigroups,
which are important for the spectral theory of this lattice. Finite semigroups
$S$ that generate join irreducible pseudovarieties are characterized as
follows: whenever $S$ divides a direct product $A \times B$ of finite
semigroups, then $S$ divides either $A^n$ or $B^n$ for some $n \geq 1$. We
present a new operator ${ \mathbf{V} \mapsto \mathbf{V}^\mathsf{bar} }$ that
preserves the property of join irreducibility, as does the dual operator, and
show that iteration of these operators on any nontrivial join irreducible
pseudovariety leads to an infinite hierarchy of join irreducible
pseudovarieties.
  We also describe all join irreducible pseudovarieties generated by a
semigroup of order at most five. It turns out that there are $30$ such
pseudovarieties, and there is a relatively easy way to remember them. In
addition, we survey most results known about join irreducible pseudovarieties
to date and generalize a number of results in Chapter 7.3 of [The $q$-Theory of
Finite Semigroups, Springer Monographs in Mathematics, Springer, Berlin, 2009].

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give novel certificates for triangular equivalence and rank
profiles. These certificates enable to verify the row or column rank profiles
or the whole rank profile matrix faster than recomputing them, with a
negligible overall overhead. We first provide quadratic time and space
non-interactive certificates saving the logarithmic factors of previously known
ones. Then we propose interactive certificates for the same problems whose
Monte Carlo verification complexity requires a small constant number of
matrix-vector multiplications, a linear space, and a linear number of extra
field operations. As an application we also give an interactive protocol ,
certifying the determinant of dense matrices, faster than the best previously
known one.

 <dc:description>  Non-technical losses (NTL) occur during the distribution of electricity in
power grids and include, but are not limited to, electricity theft and faulty
meters. In emerging countries, they may range up to 40% of the total
electricity distributed. In order to detect NTLs, machine learning methods are
used that learn irregular consumption patterns from customer data and
inspection results. The Big Data paradigm followed in modern machine learning
reflects the desire of deriving better conclusions from simply analyzing more
data, without the necessity of looking at theory and models. However, the
sample of inspected customers may be biased, i.e. it does not represent the
population of all customers. As a consequence, machine learning models trained
on these inspection results are biased as well and therefore lead to unreliable
predictions of whether customers cause NTL or not. In machine learning, this
issue is called covariate shift and has not been addressed in the literature on
NTL detection yet. In this work, we present a novel framework for quantifying
and visualizing covariate shift. We apply it to a commercial data set from
Brazil that consists of 3.6M customers and 820K inspection results. We show
that some features have a stronger covariate shift than others, making
predictions less reliable. In particular, previous inspections were focused on
certain neighborhoods or customer classes and that they were not sufficiently
spread among the population of customers. This framework is about to be
deployed in a commercial product for NTL detection.

 <dc:description>  As a well-established adaptation criterion, the maximum correntropy criterion
(MCC) has been receiving increasing attention due to its robust against
outliers. In this paper, a new complex recursive maximum correntropy (CRMC)
algorithm without any priori information on the noise characteristics, is
proposed under the MCC. The proposed algorithm is useful for adaptive
beamforming, when the desired signal is contaminated by the impulsive noises.
Moreover, the analysis of convergence property of the CRMC algorithm is
performed. The results obtained from simulation study establish the
effectiveness of this new beamformer.

To that aim it proposes LOCNeSs, an algorithm specially designed to run in a

 <dc:description>  With ever-increasing productivity targets in mining operations, there is a
growing interest in mining automation. The PIMM project addresses the
fundamental challenge of network communication by constructing a pilot 5G
network in the underground mine Kankberg. In this report, we discuss how such a
5G network could constitute the essential infrastructure to organize existing
systems in Kankberg into a system-of-systems (SoS). In this report, we analyze
a scenario in which LiDAR equipped vehicles operating in the mine are connected
to existing mine mapping and positioning solutions. The approach is motivated
by the approaching era of remote controlled, or even autonomous, vehicles in
mining operations. The proposed SoS could ensure continuously updated maps of
Kankberg, rendered in unprecedented detail, supporting both productivity and
safety in the underground mine. We present four different SoS solutions from an
organizational point of view, discussing how development and operations of the
constituent systems could be distributed among Boliden and external
stakeholders, e.g., the vehicle suppliers, the hauling company, and the
developers of the mapping software. The four scenarios are compared from both
technical and business perspectives, and based on trade-off discussions and
SWOT analyses. We conclude our report by recommending continued research along
two future paths, namely a closer cooperation with the vehicle suppliers, and
further feasibility studies regarding establishing a Kankberg software
ecosystem.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider a complete covert communication system, which
includes the source-model of a stealthy secret key generation (SSKG) as the
first phase. The generated key will be used for the covert communication in the
second phase of the current round and also in the first phase of the next
round. We investigate the stealthy SK rate performance of the first phase. The
derived results show that the SK capacity lower and upper bounds of the
source-model SKG are not affected by the additional stealth constraint. This
result implies that we can attain the SSKG capacity for free when the sequences
observed by the three terminals Alice ($X^n$), Bob ($Y^n$) and Willie ($Z^n$)
follow a Markov chain relationship, i.e., $X^n-Y^n-Z^n$. We then prove that the
sufficient condition to attain both, the SK capacity as well as the SSK
capacity, can be relaxed from physical to stochastic degradedness. In order to
underline the practical relevance, we also derive a sufficient condition to
attain the degradedness by the usual stochastic order for Maurer's fast fading
Gaussian (satellite) model for the source of common randomness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the impact of locality on the decoding of binary
cyclic codes under two approaches, namely ordered statistics decoding (OSD) and
trellis decoding. Given a binary cyclic code having locality or availability,
we suitably modify the OSD to obtain gains in terms of the Signal-To-Noise
ratio, for a given reliability and essentially the same level of decoder
complexity. With regard to trellis decoding, we show that careful introduction
of locality results in the creation of cyclic subcodes having lower maximum
state complexity. We also present a simple upper-bounding technique on the
state complexity profile, based on the zeros of the code. Finally, it is shown
how the decoding speed can be significantly increased in the presence of
locality, in the moderate-to-high SNR regime, by making use of a quick-look
decoder that often returns the ML codeword.

 <dc:description>  The German Broadcasting Archive (DRA) maintains the cultural heritage of
radio and television broadcasts of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The uniqueness and importance of the video material stimulates a large
scientific interest in the video content. In this paper, we present an
automatic video analysis and retrieval system for searching in historical
collections of GDR television recordings. It consists of video analysis
algorithms for shot boundary detection, concept classification, person
recognition, text recognition and similarity search. The performance of the
system is evaluated from a technical and an archival perspective on 2,500 hours
of GDR television recordings.

 <dc:description>  With the development of speech synthesis techniques, automatic speaker
verification systems face the serious challenge of spoofing attack. In order to
improve the reliability of speaker verification systems, we develop a new
filter bank based cepstral feature, deep neural network filter bank cepstral
coefficients (DNN-FBCC), to distinguish between natural and spoofed speech. The
deep neural network filter bank is automatically generated by training a filter
bank neural network (FBNN) using natural and synthetic speech. By adding
restrictions on the training rules, the learned weight matrix of FBNN is
band-limited and sorted by frequency, similar to the normal filter bank. Unlike
the manually designed filter bank, the learned filter bank has different filter
shapes in different channels, which can capture the differences between natural
and synthetic speech more effectively. The experimental results on the ASVspoof
{2015} database show that the Gaussian mixture model maximum-likelihood
(GMM-ML) classifier trained by the new feature performs better than the
state-of-the-art linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) based
classifier, especially on detecting unknown attacks.

 <dc:title>Reservoir Computing Using Non-Uniform Binary Cellular Automata</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm utilizes a dynamical system, i.e., a
reservoir, and a linear classifier, i.e., a read-out layer, to process data
from sequential classification tasks. In this paper the usage of Cellular
Automata (CA) as a reservoir is investigated. The use of CA in RC has been
showing promising results. In this paper, selected state-of-the-art experiments
are reproduced. It is shown that some CA-rules perform better than others, and
the reservoir performance is improved by increasing the size of the CA
reservoir itself. In addition, the usage of parallel loosely coupled
CA-reservoirs, where each reservoir has a different CA-rule, is investigated.
The experiments performed on quasi-uniform CA reservoir provide valuable
insights in CA reservoir design. The results herein show that some rules do not
work well together, while other combinations work remarkably well. This
suggests that non-uniform CA could represent a powerful tool for novel CA
reservoir implementations.

 <dc:description>  Natural language sentence matching is a fundamental technology for a variety
of tasks. Previous approaches either match sentences from a single direction or
only apply single granular (word-by-word or sentence-by-sentence) matching. In
this work, we propose a bilateral multi-perspective matching (BiMPM) model
under the &quot;matching-aggregation&quot; framework. Given two sentences $P$ and $Q$,
our model first encodes them with a BiLSTM encoder. Next, we match the two
encoded sentences in two directions $P \rightarrow Q$ and $P \leftarrow Q$. In
each matching direction, each time step of one sentence is matched against all
time-steps of the other sentence from multiple perspectives. Then, another
BiLSTM layer is utilized to aggregate the matching results into a fix-length
matching vector. Finally, based on the matching vector, the decision is made
through a fully connected layer. We evaluate our model on three tasks:
paraphrase identification, natural language inference and answer sentence
selection. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets show that our
model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all tasks.

 <dc:description>  CAPTCHAs/HIPs are security mechanisms that try to prevent automatic abuse of
services. They are susceptible to learning attacks in which attackers can use
them as oracles. Kwon and Cha presented recently a novel algorithm that intends
to avoid such learning attacks and &quot;detect all bots&quot;. They add uncertainties to
the grading of challenges, and also use trap images designed to detect bots.
The authors suggest that a major IT corporation is studying their proposal for
mainstream implementation. We present here two fundamental design flaws
regarding their trap images and uncertainty grading. These leak information
regarding the correct grading of images. Exploiting them, an attacker can use
an UTS-CAPTCHA as an oracle, and perform a learning attack. Our testing has
shown that we can increase any reasonable initial success rate up to 100%.

identification using both Kinect and passive RFID, by first measuring the
velocity vector of person's skeleton and of their RFID tag using the position
of the RFID reader antennas as reference points and then finding the best match
between skeletons and tags. We introduce a method for synchronizing Kinect
data, which is captured regularly, with irregular or missing RFID data
readouts. Our experiments show centimeter-level people tracking resolution with
80% average identification accuracy for up to six people in indoor
environments, which meets the needs of many applications. Our system can
preserve user privacy and work with different lighting.

 <dc:description>  The value proposition of a dataset often resides in the implicit
interconnections or explicit relationships (patterns) among individual
entities, and is often modeled as a graph. Effective visualization of such
graphs can lead to key insights uncovering such value. In this article we
propose a visualization method to explore graphs with numerical attributes
associated with nodes (or edges) -- referred to as scalar graphs. Such
numerical attributes can represent raw content information, similarities, or
derived information reflecting important network measures such as triangle
density and centrality. The proposed visualization strategy seeks to
simultaneously uncover the relationship between attribute values and graph
topology, and relies on transforming the network to generate a terrain map. A
key objective here is to ensure that the terrain map reveals the overall
distribution of components-of-interest (e.g. dense subgraphs, k-cores) and the
relationships among them while being sensitive to the attribute values over the
graph. We also design extensions that can capture the relationship across
multiple numerical attributes (scalars). We demonstrate the efficacy of our
method on several real-world data science tasks while scaling to large graphs
with millions of nodes.

 <dc:description>  For a nonlinear ordinary differential equation solved with respect to the
highest order derivative and rational in the other derivatives and in the
independent variable, we devise two algorithms to check if the equation can be
reduced to a linear one by a point transformation of the dependent and
independent variables. The first algorithm is based on a construction of the
Lie point symmetry algebra and on the computation of its derived algebra. The
second algorithm exploits the differential Thomas decomposition and allows not
only to test the linearizability, but also to generate a system of nonlinear
partial differential equations that determines the point transformation and the
coefficients of the linearized equation. Both algorithms have been implemented
in Maple and their application is illustrated using several examples.

 <dc:description>  Segmenting human left ventricle (LV) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
images and calculating its volume are important for diagnosing cardiac
diseases. In 2016, Kaggle organized a competition to estimate the volume of LV
from MRI images. The dataset consisted of a large number of cases, but only
provided systole and diastole volumes as labels. We designed a system based on
neural networks to solve this problem. It began with a detector combined with a
neural network classifier for detecting regions of interest (ROIs) containing
LV chambers. Then a deep neural network named hypercolumns fully convolutional
network was used to segment LV in ROIs. The 2D segmentation results were
integrated across different images to estimate the volume. With ground-truth
volume labels, this model was trained end-to-end. To improve the result, an
additional dataset with only segmentation label was used. The model was trained
alternately on these two datasets with different types of teaching signals. We
also proposed a variance estimation method for the final prediction. Our
algorithm ranked the 4th on the test set in this competition.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is a popular variant of
Stochastic Gradient Descent, where properly scaled isotropic Gaussian noise is
added to an unbiased estimate of the gradient at each iteration. This modest
change allows SGLD to escape local minima and suffices to guarantee asymptotic
convergence to global minimizers for sufficiently regular non-convex objectives
(Gelfand and Mitter, 1991). The present work provides a nonasymptotic analysis
in the context of non-convex learning problems, giving finite-time guarantees
for SGLD to find approximate minimizers of both empirical and population risks.
As in the asymptotic setting, our analysis relates the discrete-time SGLD
Markov chain to a continuous-time diffusion process. A new tool that drives the
results is the use of weighted transportation cost inequalities to quantify the
rate of convergence of SGLD to a stationary distribution in the Euclidean
$2$-Wasserstein distance.

 <dc:description>  [Context] Defect Causal Analysis (DCA) represents an efficient practice to
improve software processes. While knowledge on cause-effect relations is
helpful to support DCA, collecting cause-effect data may require significant
effort and time. [Goal] We propose and evaluate a new DCA approach that uses
cross-company data to support the practical application of DCA. [Method] We
collected cross-company data on causes of requirements engineering problems
from 74 Brazilian organizations and built a Bayesian network. Our DCA approach
uses the diagnostic inference of the Bayesian network to support DCA sessions.
We evaluated our approach by applying a model for technology transfer to
industry and conducted three consecutive evaluations: (i) in academia, (ii)
with industry representatives of the Fraunhofer Project Center at UFBA, and
(iii) in an industrial case study at the Brazilian National Development Bank
(BNDES). [Results] We received positive feedback in all three evaluations and
the cross-company data was considered helpful for determining main causes.
[Conclusions] Our results strengthen our confidence in that supporting DCA with
cross-company data is promising and should be further investigated.

 <dc:description>  We explore the problem of translating speech to text in low-resource
scenarios where neither automatic speech recognition (ASR) nor machine
translation (MT) are available, but we have training data in the form of audio
paired with text translations. We present the first system for this problem
applied to a realistic multi-speaker dataset, the CALLHOME Spanish-English
speech translation corpus. Our approach uses unsupervised term discovery (UTD)
to cluster repeated patterns in the audio, creating a pseudotext, which we pair
with translations to create a parallel text and train a simple bag-of-words MT
model. We identify the challenges faced by the system, finding that the
difficulty of cross-speaker UTD results in low recall, but that our system is
still able to correctly translate some content words in test data.

 <dc:description>  Usually bilingual word vectors are trained &quot;online&quot;. Mikolov et al. showed
they can also be found &quot;offline&quot;, whereby two pre-trained embeddings are
aligned with a linear transformation, using dictionaries compiled from expert
knowledge. In this work, we prove that the linear transformation between two
spaces should be orthogonal. This transformation can be obtained using the
singular value decomposition. We introduce a novel &quot;inverted softmax&quot; for
identifying translation pairs, with which we improve the precision @1 of
Mikolov's original mapping from 34% to 43%, when translating a test set
composed of both common and rare English words into Italian. Orthogonal
transformations are more robust to noise, enabling us to learn the
transformation without expert bilingual signal by constructing a
&quot;pseudo-dictionary&quot; from the identical character strings which appear in both
languages, achieving 40% precision on the same test set. Finally, we extend our
method to retrieve the true translations of English sentences from a corpus of
200k Italian sentences with a precision @1 of 68%.

 <dc:description>  Recently developed deep learning techniques have significantly improved the
accuracy of various speech and image recognition systems. In this paper we show
how to adapt some of these techniques to create a novel chained convolutional
architecture with next-step conditioning for improving performance on protein
sequence prediction problems. We explore its value by demonstrating its ability
to improve performance on eight-class secondary structure prediction. We first
establish a state-of-the-art baseline by adapting recent advances in
convolutional neural networks which were developed for vision tasks. This model
achieves 70.0% per amino acid accuracy on the CB513 benchmark dataset without
use of standard performance-boosting techniques such as ensembling or multitask
learning. We then improve upon this state-of-the-art result using a novel
chained prediction approach which frames the secondary structure prediction as
a next-step prediction problem. This sequential model achieves 70.3% Q8
accuracy on CB513 with a single model; an ensemble of these models produces
71.4% Q8 accuracy on the same test set, improving upon the previous overall
state of the art for the eight-class secondary structure problem. Our models
are implemented using TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning software
library available at TensorFlow.org; we aim to release the code for these
experiments as part of the TensorFlow repository.

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of social network mental disorders (SNMDs), such as
Cyber-Relationship Addiction, Information Overload, and Net Compulsion, have
been recently noted. Symptoms of these mental disorders are usually observed
passively today, resulting in delayed clinical intervention. In this paper, we
argue that mining online social behavior provides an opportunity to actively
identify SNMDs at an early stage. It is challenging to detect SNMDs because the
mental factors considered in standard diagnostic criteria (questionnaire)
cannot be observed from online social activity logs. Our approach, new and
innovative to the practice of SNMD detection, does not rely on self-revealing
of those mental factors via questionnaires. Instead, we propose a machine
learning framework, namely, Social Network Mental Disorder Detection (SNMDD),
that exploits features extracted from social network data to accurately
identify potential cases of SNMDs. We also exploit multi-source learning in
SNMDD and propose a new SNMD-based Tensor Model (STM) to improve the
performance. Our framework is evaluated via a user study with 3126 online
social network users. We conduct a feature analysis, and also apply SNMDD on
large-scale datasets and analyze the characteristics of the three SNMD types.
The results show that SNMDD is promising for identifying online social network
users with potential SNMDs.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks are deployed in many monitoring applications but
still suffer from short lifetimes originating from limited energy sources and
storages. Due to their low-power consumption and their on-demand communication
ability, wake-up receivers represent an energy efficient and simple enhancement
to wireless sensor nodes and wireless sensor network protocols. In this
context, wake-up receivers have the ability to increase the network lifetime.
In this article, we present T-ROME, a simple and energy efficient cross-layer
routing protocol for wireless sensor nodes containing wake-up receivers. The
protocol makes use of the different transmission ranges of wake-up and main
radios in order to save energy by skipping nodes during data transfer. With
respect to energy consumption and latency, T-ROME outperforms existing
protocols in many scenarios. Here, we describe and analyze the cross layer
multi-hop protocol by means of a Markov chain model that we verify using a
laboratory test setup.

 <dc:description>  The advent of High Performance Computing (HPC) has provided the computational
capacity required for power system operators (SO) to obtain solutions in the
least time to highly-complex applications, i.e., Unit Commitment (UC). The UC
problem, which attempts to schedule the least-cost combination of generating
units to meet the load, is increasing in complexity and problem size due to
deployments of renewable resources and smart grid technologies. The current
approach to solving the UC problem consists of in-house HPC infrastructures,
which experience issues at scale, and demands high maintenance and capital
expenditures. On the other hand, cloud computing is an ideal substitute due to
its powerful computational capacity, rapid scalability, and high
cost-effectiveness. In this work, the benefits and challenges of outsourcing
the UC application to the cloud are explored. A quantitative analysis of the
computational performance gain is explored for a large-scale UC problem solved
on the cloud and compared to traditional in-house HPC infrastructure. The
results show substantial reduction in solve time when outsourced to the cloud.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the problem associated with coordinating scheduling
decisions among multiple base stations in an LTE-Advanced downlink network in
order to manage inter-cell interference with a centralized controller. To solve
the coordinated scheduling problem an integer non-linear program is formulated
that, unlike most existing approaches, does not rely on exact channel state
information but only makes use of the specific measurement reports defined in
the 3GPP standard. An equivalent integer linear reformulation of the
coordinated scheduling problem is proposed, which can be efficiently solved by
commercial solvers. Extensive simulations of medium to large-size networks are
carried out to analyze the performance of the proposed coordinated scheduling
approaches, confirming available analytical results reporting fundamental
limitations in the cooperation due to out-of-cluster interference.
Nevertheless, the schemes proposed in this paper show important gains in
average user throughput of the cell-edge users, especially in the case of
heterogeneous networks.

 <dc:description>  Many JavaScript applications perform HTTP requests to web APIs, relying on
the request URL, HTTP method, and request data to be constructed correctly by
string operations. Traditional compile-time error checking, such as calling a
non-existent method in Java, are not available for checking whether such
requests comply with the requirements of a web API. In this paper, we propose
an approach to statically check web API requests in JavaScript. Our approach
first extracts a request's URL string, HTTP method, and the corresponding
request data using an inter-procedural string analysis, and then checks whether
the request conforms to given web API specifications. We evaluated our approach
by checking whether web API requests in JavaScript files mined from GitHub are
consistent or inconsistent with publicly available API specifications. From the
6575 requests in scope, our approach determined whether the request's URL and
HTTP method was consistent or inconsistent with web API specifications with a
precision of 96.0%. Our approach also correctly determined whether extracted
request data was consistent or inconsistent with the data requirements with a
precision of 87.9% for payload data and 99.9% for query data. In a systematic
analysis of the inconsistent cases, we found that many of them were due to
errors in the client code. The here proposed checker can be integrated with
code editors or with continuous integration tools to warn programmers about
code containing potentially erroneous requests.

applications make WSNs different from traditional networks. These
characteristics pose great challenges for architecture and protocol design,
performance modeling, and implementation. Accurately modeling the data
generated by each sensor node is essential for correctly simulating network
traffic, network congestion, interference between nodes and the energy expended
by each node. Successful design leads to enhancing the overall performance of
the whole of network. In this paper we analyze the performance of WSN with
N-BURST traffic model. The impact of bursty traffic on the mean packet delay
and buffer overflow probability is investigated analytically. We study the
effects of bursty WSN traffic through simulations with three different cases.
Both short-range dependency (SRD) traffic and long range dependency (LRD)
traffic are simulated over different burst parameters. Finally we study the
effect of pareto OFF time through simulation. The results are collected for 10
different 24 hour simulated periods in order to study and measure day-today
statistical fluctuation.

 <dc:description>  Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) architecture is the only viable
solution to handle the complex interference scenario generated by massive
antennas and small cells deployment as required by next generation (5G) mobile
networks. In conventional C-RAN, the fronthaul links used to exchange the
signal between Base Band Units (BBUs) and Remote Antenna Units (RAUs) are based
on digital baseband (BB) signals over optical fibers due to the huge bandwidth
required. In this paper we evaluate the transport capability of copper-based
all-analog fronthaul architecture called Radio over Copper (RoC) that leverages
on the pre-existing LAN cables that are already deployed in buildings and
enterprises. In particular, the main contribution of the paper is to evaluate
the number of independent BB signals for multiple antennas system that can be
transported over multi-pair Cat-5/6/7 cables under a predefined fronthauling
transparency condition in terms of maximum BB signal degradation. The MIMO-RoC
proves to be a complementary solution to optical fiber for the last 200m toward
the RAUs, mostly to reuse the existing LAN cables and to power-supply the RAUs
over the same cable.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a neural architecture for navigation in novel environments. Our
proposed architecture learns to map from first-person views and plans a
sequence of actions towards goals in the environment. The Cognitive Mapper and
Planner (CMP) is based on two key ideas: a) a unified joint architecture for
mapping and planning, such that the mapping is driven by the needs of the
planner, and b) a spatial memory with the ability to plan given an incomplete
set of observations about the world. CMP constructs a top-down belief map of
the world and applies a differentiable neural net planner to produce the next
action at each time step. The accumulated belief of the world enables the agent
to track visited regions of the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that
CMP outperforms both reactive strategies and standard memory-based
architectures and performs well in novel environments. Furthermore, we show
that CMP can also achieve semantically specified goals, such as &quot;go to a
chair&quot;.

 <dc:description>  This study is concerned with the dynamical behaviors of epidemic spreading
over a two-layered interconnected network. Three models in different levels are
proposed to describe cooperative spreading processes over the interconnected
network, wherein the disease in one network can spread to the other.
Theoretical analysis is provided for each model to reveal that the global
epidemic threshold in the interconnected network is not larger than the
epidemic thresholds for the two isolated layered networks. In particular, in an
interconnected homogenous network, detailed theoretical analysis is presented,
which allows quick and accurate calculations of the global epidemic threshold.
Moreover, in an interconnected heterogeneous network with inter-layer
correlation between node degrees, it is found that the inter-layer correlation
coefficient has little impact on the epidemic threshold, but has significant
impact on the total prevalence. Simulations further verify the analytical
results, showing that cooperative epidemic processes promote the spreading of
diseases.

analytics on satellite imagery for commercial applications. Drawing from our
background in high-performance computing, we draw parallels between the early
days of clustered computing systems and the current state of cloud computing
and its potential to disrupt the HPC market. Using our own virtual file system
layer on top of cloud remote object storage, we demonstrate aggregate read
bandwidth of 230 gigabytes per second using 512 Google Compute Engine (GCE)
nodes accessing a USA multi-region standard storage bucket. This figure is
comparable to the best HPC storage systems in existence. We also present
several of our application results, including the identification of field
boundaries in Ukraine, and the generation of a global cloud-free base layer

 <dc:description>  Robust control design for quantum systems has been recognized as a key task
in quantum information technology, molecular chemistry and atomic physics. In
this paper, an improved differential evolution algorithm of msMS_DE is proposed
to search robust fields for various quantum control problems. In msMS_DE,
multiple samples are used for fitness evaluation and a mixed strategy is
employed for mutation operation. In particular, the msMS_DE algorithm is
applied to the control problem of open inhomogeneous quantum ensembles and the
consensus problem of a quantum network with uncertainties. Numerical results
are presented to demonstrate the excellent performance of the improved DE
algorithm for these two classes of quantum robust control problems.
Furthermore, msMS_DE is experimentally implemented on femtosecond laser control
systems to generate good signals of two photon absorption and control
fragmentation of halomethane molecules CH2BrI. Experimental results demonstrate
excellent performance of msMS_DE in searching effective femtosecond laser
pulses for various tasks.

 <dc:title>Bayesian Compressive Sensing Approaches for Direction of Arrival

 <dc:description>  The problem of estimating the dynamic direction of arrival of far field
signals impinging on a uniform linear array, with mutual coupling effects, is
addressed. This work proposes two novel approaches able to provide accurate
solutions, including at the endfire regions of the array. Firstly, a Bayesian
compressive sensing Kalman filter is developed, which accounts for the
predicted estimated signals rather than using the traditional sparse prior. The
posterior probability density function of the received source signals and the
expression for the related marginal likelihood function are derived
theoretically. Next, a Gibbs sampling based approach with indicator variables
in the sparsity prior is developed. This allows sparsity to be explicitly
enforced in different ways, including when an angle is too far from the
previous estimate. The proposed approaches are validated and evaluated over
different test scenarios and compared to the traditional relevance vector
machine based method. An improved accuracy in terms of average root mean square
error values is achieved (up to 73.39% for the modified relevance vector
machine based approach and 86.36% for the Gibbs sampling based approach). The
proposed approaches prove to be particularly useful for direction of arrival
estimation when the angle of arrival moves into the endfire region of the
array.

 <dc:title>On the Courtade-Kumar conjecture for certain classes of Boolean

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We prove the Courtade-Kumar conjecture, for certain classes of
$n$-dimensional Boolean functions, $\forall n\geq 2$ and for all values of the
error probability of the binary symmetric channel, $\forall 0 \leq p \leq
\frac{1}{2}$. Let $\mathbf{X}=[X_1...X_n]$ be a vector of independent and
identically distributed Bernoulli$(\frac{1}{2})$ random variables, which are
the input to a memoryless binary symmetric channel, with the error probability
in the interval $0 \leq p \leq \frac{1}{2}$, and $\mathbf{Y}=[Y_1...Y_n]$ the
corresponding output. Let $f:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ be an
$n$-dimensional Boolean function. Then, the Courtade-Kumar conjecture states
that the mutual information $\operatorname{MI}(f(\mathbf{X}),\mathbf{Y}) \leq
1-\operatorname{H}(p)$, where $\operatorname{H}(p)$ is the binary entropy
function.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of estimating the graph size, where one is given only
local access to the graph. We formally define a query model in which one starts
with a \emph{seed} node and is allowed to make queries about neighbours of
nodes that have already been seen. In the case of undirected graphs, an
estimator of Katzir et al. (2014) based on a sample from the stationary
distribution $\pi$ uses $O\left(\frac{1}{\|\pi\|_2} + \text{davg}\right)$
queries, we prove that this is tight. In addition, we establish this as a lower
bound even when the algorithm is allowed to crawl the graph arbitrarily, the
results of Katzir et al. give an upper bound that is worse by a multiplicative
factor $t_\text{mix} \cdot \log(n)$. The picture becomes significantly
different in the case of directed graphs. We show that without strong
assumptions on the graph structure, the number of nodes cannot be predicted to
within a constant multiplicative factor without using a number of queries that
are at least linear in the number of nodes, in particular, rapid mixing and
small diameter, properties that most real-world networks exhibit, do not
suffice. The question of interest is whether any algorithm can beat
breadth-first search. We introduce a new parameter, generalising the
well-studied conductance, such that if a suitable bound on it exists and is
known to the algorithm, the number of queries required is sublinear in the
number of edges, we show that this is tight.

 <dc:description>  We study the following natural variation on the classical universality
problem: given an automaton $M$ of some type (DFA/NFA/PDA), does there exist an
integer $\ell \geq 0$ such that $\Sigma^\ell \subseteq L(M)$? The case of an
NFA was an open problem since 2009. Here, using a novel and deep construction,
we prove that the problem is NEXPTIME-complete, and the smallest such $\ell$
can be doubly exponential in the number of states. In the case of a DFA the
problem is NP-complete, and there exist examples for which the smallest such
$\ell$ is of the form $e^{\sqrt{n \log n} (1+o(1))}$, which is best possible,
where $n$ is the number of states. In the case of a PDA this problem is
recursively unsolvable, while the smallest such $\ell$ cannot be bounded in the
number of states by any computable function. Finally, we show that in all the
cases the problem becomes computationally easier when the length $\ell$ is also
given in the input.

 <dc:description>  The Parallel Meaning Bank is a corpus of translations annotated with shared,
formal meaning representations comprising over 11 million words divided over
four languages (English, German, Italian, and Dutch). Our approach is based on
cross-lingual projection: automatically produced (and manually corrected)
semantic annotations for English sentences are mapped onto their word-aligned
translations, assuming that the translations are meaning-preserving. The
semantic annotation consists of five main steps: (i) segmentation of the text
in sentences and lexical items; (ii) syntactic parsing with Combinatory
Categorial Grammar; (iii) universal semantic tagging; (iv) symbolization; and
(v) compositional semantic analysis based on Discourse Representation Theory.
These steps are performed using statistical models trained in a semi-supervised
manner. The employed annotation models are all language-neutral. Our first
results are promising.

 <dc:description>  Data-dependent access patterns of an application to an untrusted storage
system are notorious for leaking sensitive information about the user's data.
Previous research has shown how an adversary capable of monitoring both read
and write requests issued to the memory can correlate them with the application
to learn its sensitive data. However, information leakage through only the
write access patterns is less obvious and not well studied in the current
literature. In this work, we demonstrate an actual attack on power-side-channel
resistant Montgomery's ladder based modular exponentiation algorithm commonly
used in public key cryptography. We infer the complete 512-bit secret exponent
in $\sim3.5$ minutes by virtue of just the write access patterns of the
algorithm to the main memory. In order to learn the victim algorithm's write
access patterns under realistic settings, we exploit a compromised DMA device
to take frequent snapshots of the application's address space, and then run a
simple differential analysis on these snapshots to find the write access
sequence. The attack has been shown on an Intel Core(TM) i7-4790 3.60GHz
processor based system. We further discuss a possible attack on McEliece
public-key cryptosystem that also exploits the write-access patterns to learn
the secret key.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the French Street Name Signs (FSNS) Dataset consisting of more
than a million images of street name signs cropped from Google Street View
images of France. Each image contains several views of the same street name
sign. Every image has normalized, title case folded ground-truth text as it
would appear on a map. We believe that the FSNS dataset is large and complex
enough to train a deep network of significant complexity to solve the street
name extraction problem &quot;end-to-end&quot; or to explore the design trade-offs
between a single complex engineered network and multiple sub-networks designed
and trained to solve sub-problems. We present such an &quot;end-to-end&quot;
network/graph for Tensor Flow and its results on the FSNS dataset.

 <dc:title>Reception Capacity Through Perfect Domination</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dinitz, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ephraim, Naomi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The capacity of wireless networks is a classic and important topic of study.
Informally, the capacity of a network is simply the total amount of information
which it can transfer. In the context of models of wireless radio networks,
this has usually meant the total number of point-to-point messages which can be
sent or received in one time step. This definition has seen intensive study in
recent years, particularly with respect to more accurate models of radio
networks such as the SINR model. This paper is motivated by an obvious fact:
radio antennae are (at least traditionally) omnidirectional, and hence
point-to-point connections are not necessarily the best definition of capacity.
To fix this, we introduce a new definition of reception capacity as the maximum
number of messages which can be received in one round, and show that this is
related to a new optimization problem we call the Maximum Perfect Dominated Set
(MaxPDS) problem. Using this relationship we give tight upper and lower bounds
for approximating this capacity. We also analyze this notion of capacity under
game-theoretic constraints, giving tight bounds on both the Price of Anarchy
and the Price of Stability.

 <dc:description>  Received Signal Strength (RSS) is considered as a promising measurement for
indoor positioning. Lots of RSS-based localization methods have been proposed
by its convenience and low cost. This paper focuses on two challenging issues
in RSS-based localization schemes: finding optimal localization algorithms and
knowing what affects the accuracy of these algorithms. Through theoretical and
experimental analysis, we present three important results: 1) we prove that the
Non-linear Least Square (NLS) method is efficient to solve the RSS-based
localization problem, i.e., its localization error is minimal in theory; 2) we
provide a closed-form expression of the localization error for the NLS method.
Such an expression reveals the key factors that affect the accuracy of the NLS
method; 3) we further conduct a new lower bound of localization error, i.e.,
the best accuracy achieved possibly. The study of this paper shows the inherent
limitation of RSS-based localization schemes and provides guidance for
achieving optimal accuracy.

 <dc:title>Size Relationships in Abstract Cyclic Entailment Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A cyclic proof system generalises the standard notion of a proof as a finite
tree of locally sound inferences by allowing proof objects to be potentially
infinite. Regular infinite proofs can be finitely represented as graphs. To
preclude spurious cyclic reasoning, cyclic proof systems come equipped with a
well-founded notion of 'size' for the models that interpret their logical
statements. A global soundness condition on proof objects, stated in terms of
this notion of size, ensures that any non-well-founded paths in the proof
object can be disregarded.
  We give an abstract definition of a subclass of such cyclic proof systems:
cyclic entailment systems. In this setting, we consider the problem of
comparing the size of a model when interpreted in relation to the antecedent of
an entailment, with that when interpreted in relation to the consequent.
Specifically, we give a further condition on proof objects which ensures that
models of a given entailment are always 'smaller' when interpreted with respect
to the consequent than when interpreted with respect to the antecedent.
Knowledge of such relationships is useful in a program verification setting.

 <dc:title>The submodular secretary problem under a cardinality constraint and with
  limited resources</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hess, Tom</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sabato, Sivan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the submodular secretary problem subject to a cardinality
constraint, in long-running scenarios, or under resource constraints. In these
scenarios the resources consumed by the algorithm should not grow with the
input size, and the online selection algorithm should be an anytime algorithm.
We propose a $0.1933$-competitive anytime algorithm, which performs only a
single evaluation of the marginal contribution for each observed item, and
requires a memory of order only $k$ (up to logarithmic factors), where $k$ is
the cardinality constraint. The best competitive ratio for this problem known
so far under these constraints is $\frac{e-1}{e^2+e} \approx 0.1700$ (Feldman
et al., 2011). Our algorithm is based on the observation that information
collected during times in which no good items were selected, can be used to
improve the subsequent probability of selection success. The improvement is
obtained by using an adaptive selection strategy, which is a solution to a
stand-alone online selection problem. We develop general tools for analyzing
this algorithmic framework, which we believe will be useful also for other
online selection problems.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a review concluded that Google Scholar (GS) is not a suitable
source of information &quot;for identifying recent conference papers or other gray
literature publications&quot;. The goal of this letter is to demonstrate that GS can
be an effective tool to search and find gray literature, as long as appropriate
search strategies are used. To do this, we took as examples the same two case
studies used by the original review, describing first how GS processes
original's search strategies, then proposing alternative search strategies, and
finally generalizing each case study to compose a general search procedure
aimed at finding gray literature in Google Scholar for two wide selected case
studies: a) all contributions belonging to a congress (the ASCO Annual
Meeting); and b) indexed guidelines as well as gray literature within medical
institutions (National Institutes of Health) and governmental agencies (U.S.
Department of Health &amp; Human Services). The results confirm that original
search strategies were undertrained offering misleading results and erroneous
conclusions. Google Scholar lacks many of the advanced search features
available in other bibliographic databases (such as Pubmed), however, it is one
thing to have a friendly search experience, and quite another to find gray
literature. We finally conclude that Google Scholar is a powerful tool for
searching gray literature, as long as the users are familiar with all the
possibilities it offers as a search engine. Poorly formulated searches will
undoubtedly return misleading results.

 <dc:description>  Finding the origin of slow and infra-slow oscillations could reveal or
explain brain mechanisms in health and disease. Here, we present a
biophysically constrained computational model of a neural network where the
inclusion of astrocytes introduced slow and infra-slow-oscillations, through
two distinct mechanisms. Specifically, we show how astrocytes can modulate the
fast network activity through their slow inter-cellular calcium wave speed and
amplitude and possibly cause the oscillatory imbalances observed in diseases
commonly known for such abnormalities, namely Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
disease, epilepsy, depression and ischemic stroke. This work aims to increase
our knowledge on how astrocytes and neurons synergize to affect brain function
and dysfunction.

 <dc:description>  The success of deep learning in numerous application domains created the de-
sire to run and train them on mobile devices. This however, conflicts with
their computationally, memory and energy intense nature, leading to a growing
interest in compression. Recent work by Han et al. (2015a) propose a pipeline
that involves retraining, pruning and quantization of neural network weights,
obtaining state-of-the-art compression rates. In this paper, we show that
competitive compression rates can be achieved by using a version of soft
weight-sharing (Nowlan &amp; Hinton, 1992). Our method achieves both quantization
and pruning in one simple (re-)training procedure. This point of view also
exposes the relation between compression and the minimum description length
(MDL) principle.

 <dc:description>  We study the performance of data-driven, a priori and random approaches to
label space partitioning for multi-label classification with a Gaussian Naive
Bayes classifier. Experiments were performed on 12 benchmark data sets and
evaluated on 5 established measures of classification quality: micro and macro
averaged F1 score, Subset Accuracy and Hamming loss. Data-driven methods are
significantly better than an average run of the random baseline. In case of F1
scores and Subset Accuracy - data driven approaches were more likely to perform
better than random approaches than otherwise in the worst case. There always
exists a method that performs better than a priori methods in the worst case.
The advantage of data-driven methods against a priori methods with a weak
classifier is lesser than when tree classifiers are used.

 <dc:description>  We propose WiPLUS -- a system that enables WiFi to deal with the stealthy
invasion of LTE-U into the frequency bands used by WiFi. Using solely MAC layer
information extracted passively, during runtime, out of the hardware registers
of the WiFi NIC at the WiFi access point, WiPLUS is able to: i) detect
interfering LTE-U signals, ii) compute their duty-cycles, and iii) derive the
effective medium airtime available for each WiFi link in a WiFi Basic Service
Set (BSS). Moreover WiPLUS provides accurate timing information about the
detected LTE-U ON and OFF phases enabling advanced interference mitigation
strategies such as interference-aware scheduling of packet transmissions, rate
adaptation and adaptive channel bonding.
  WiPLUS does not require any modifications to the WiFi client stations and
works with commodity WiFi APs where it has a simple software installation
process.
  We present the design, the implementation details and the evaluation of the
WiPLUS approach. Evaluation results reveal that it is able to accurately
estimate the effective available medium airtime for each link in a WiFi BSS
under a wide range of LTE-U signal strengths with a root-mean-square error of
less than 3% for the downlink and less 10% for the uplink.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper presents a new formal way of modeling and designing reconfigurable
robots, in which case the robots are allowed to reconfigure not only
structurally but also functionally. We call such kind of robots
&quot;self-evolvable&quot;, which have the potential to be more flexible to be used in a
wider range of tasks, in a wider range of environments, and with a wider range
of users. To accommodate such a concept, i.e., allowing a self-evovable robot
to be configured and reconfigured, we present a series of formal constructs,
e.g., structural reconfigurable grammar and functional reconfigurable grammar.
Furthermore, we present a correct-by-construction strategy, which, given the
description of a workspace, the formula specifying a task, and a set of
available modules, is capable of constructing during the design phase a robot
that is guaranteed to perform the task satisfactorily. We use a planar
multi-link manipulator as an example throughout the paper to demonstrate the
proposed modeling and designing procedures.

 <dc:description>  Distributed computing remains inaccessible to a large number of users, in
spite of many open source platforms and extensive commercial offerings. While
distributed computation frameworks have moved beyond a simple map-reduce model,
many users are still left to struggle with complex cluster management and
configuration tools, even for running simple embarrassingly parallel jobs. We
argue that stateless functions represent a viable platform for these users,
eliminating cluster management overhead, fulfilling the promise of elasticity.
Furthermore, using our prototype implementation, PyWren, we show that this
model is general enough to implement a number of distributed computing models,
such as BSP, efficiently. Extrapolating from recent trends in network bandwidth
and the advent of disaggregated storage, we suggest that stateless functions
are a natural fit for data processing in future computing environments.

 <dc:title>Scheduling Algorithms for Asymmetric Multi-core Processors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Growing power dissipation due to high performance requirement of processor
suggests multicore processor technology, which has become the technology for
present and next decade. Research advocates asymmetric multi-core processor
system for better utilization of chip real state. However, asymmetric multi
core architecture poses a new challenge to operating system scheduler, which
traditionally assumes homogeneous hardware. So, scheduling threads to core has
become a major issue to operating system kernel. In this paper, proposed
scheduling algorithms for asymmetric multicore processors have been
categorized. This paper explores some representative algorithms of these
classes to get an overview of scheduling algorithms for asymmetric multicore
system.

 <dc:title>Predicting Hospital Re-admissions from Nursing Care Data of Hospitalized

 <dc:description>  Readmission rates in the hospitals are increasingly being used as a benchmark
to determine the quality of healthcare delivery to hospitalized patients.
Around three-fourths of all hospital re-admissions can be avoided, saving
billions of dollars. Many hospitals have now deployed electronic health record
(EHR) systems that can be used to study issues that trigger readmission.
However, most of the EHRs are high dimen-sional and sparsely populated, and
analyzing such data sets is a Big Data challenge. The effect of some of the
well-known dimension reduction techniques is minimized due to presence of
non-linear variables. We use association mining as a dimension reduction method
and the results are used to develop models, using data from an existing nursing
EHR system, for predicting risk of re-admission to the hospitals. These models
can help in determining effective treatments for patients to minimize the
possibility of re-admission, bringing down the cost and increasing the quality
of care provided to the patients. Results from the models show significantly
accurate predictions of patient re-admission.

 <dc:description>  Recently Trajectory-pooled Deep-learning Descriptors were shown to achieve
state-of-the-art human action recognition results on a number of datasets. This
paper improves their performance by applying rank pooling to each trajectory,
encoding the temporal evolution of deep learning features computed along the
trajectory. This leads to Evolution-Preserving Trajectory (EPT) descriptors, a
novel type of video descriptor that significantly outperforms Trajectory-pooled
Deep-learning Descriptors. EPT descriptors are defined based on dense
trajectories, and they provide complimentary benefits to video descriptors that
are not based on trajectories. In particular, we show that the combination of
EPT descriptors and VideoDarwin leads to state-of-the-art performance on
Hollywood2 and UCF101 datasets.

 <dc:description>  Tracking multiple objects is a challenging task when objects move in groups
and occlude each other. Existing methods have investigated the problems of
group division and group energy-minimization; however, lacking overall
object-group topology modeling limits their ability in handling complex object
and group dynamics. Inspired with the social affinity property of moving
objects, we propose a Graphical Social Topology (GST) model, which estimates
the group dynamics by jointly modeling the group structure and the states of
objects using a topological representation. With such topology representation,
moving objects are not only assigned to groups, but also dynamically connected
with each other, which enables in-group individuals to be correctly associated
and the cohesion of each group to be precisely modeled. Using well-designed
topology learning modules and topology training, we infer the birth/death and
merging/splitting of dynamic groups. With the GST model, the proposed
multi-object tracker can naturally facilitate the occlusion problem by treating
the occluded object and other in-group members as a whole while leveraging
overall state transition. Experiments on both RGB and RGB-D datasets confirm
that the proposed multi-object tracker improves the state-of-the-arts
especially in crowded scenes.

 <dc:description>  Several growth models have been proposed in the literature for scale-free
complex networks, with a range of fitness-based attachment models gaining
prominence recently. However, the processes by which such fitness-based
attachment behaviour can arise are less well understood, making it difficult to
compare the relative merits of such models. This paper analyses an evolutionary
mechanism that would give rise to a fitness-based attachment process. In
particular, it is proven by analytical and numerical methods that in
homogeneous networks, the minimisation of maximum exposure to node unfitness
leads to attachment probabilities that are proportional to node fitness. This
result is then extended to heterogeneous networks, with supply chain networks
being used as an example.

 <dc:title>Constraint Answer Set Solver EZCSP and Why Integration Schemas Matter</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Balduccini, Marcello</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Researchers in answer set programming and constraint programming have spent
significant efforts in the development of hybrid languages and solving
algorithms combining the strengths of these traditionally separate fields.
These efforts resulted in a new research area: constraint answer set
programming. Constraint answer set programming languages and systems proved to
be successful at providing declarative, yet efficient solutions to problems
involving hybrid reasoning tasks. One of the main contributions of this paper
is the first comprehensive account of the constraint answer set language and
solver EZCSP, a mainstream representative of this research area that has been
used in various successful applications. We also develop an extension of the
transition systems proposed by Nieuwenhuis et al. in 2006 to capture Boolean
satisfiability solvers. We use this extension to describe the EZCSP algorithm
and prove formal claims about it. The design and algorithmic details behind
EZCSP clearly demonstrate that the development of the hybrid systems of this
kind is challenging. Many questions arise when one faces various design choices
in an attempt to maximize system's benefits. One of the key decisions that a
developer of a hybrid solver makes is settling on a particular integration
schema within its implementation. Thus, another important contribution of this
paper is a thorough case study based on EZCSP, focused on the various
integration schemas that it provides.

 <dc:title>Localization in the Internet of Things Network: A Low-Rank Matrix
  Completion Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Location awareness, providing ability to identify the location of sensor,
machine, vehicle, and wearable device, is a rapidly growing trend of
hyper-connected society and one of key ingredients for internet of things
(IoT). In order to make a proper reaction to the collected information from
devices, location information of things should be available at the data center.
One challenge for the massive IoT networks is to identify the location map of
whole sensor nodes from partially observed distance information. This is
especially important for massive sensor networks, relay-based and hierarchical
networks, and vehicular to everything (V2X) networks. The primary goal of this
paper is to propose an algorithm to reconstruct the Euclidean distance matrix
(and eventually the location map) from partially observed distance information.
By casting the low-rank matrix completion problem into the unconstrained
minimization problem in Riemannian manifold in which a notion of
differentiability can be defined, we are able to solve the low-rank matrix
completion problem efficiently using a modified conjugate gradient algorithm.
From the analysis and numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method,
termed localization in Riemannian manifold using conjugate gradient (LRM-CG),
is effective in recovering the Euclidean distance matrix for both noiseless and
noisy environments.

 <dc:description>  Authentication is the first step toward establishing a service provider and
customer (C-P) association. In a mobile network environment, a lightweight and
secure authentication protocol is one of the most significant factors to
enhance the degree of service persistence. This work presents a secure and
lightweight keying and authentication protocol suite termed TAP (Time-Assisted
Authentication Protocol). TAP improves the security of protocols with the
assistance of time-based encryption keys and scales down the authentication
complexity by issuing a re-authentication ticket. While moving across the
network, a mobile customer node sends a re-authentication ticket to establish
new sessions with service-providing nodes. Consequently, this reduces the
communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. In
the keying protocol suite, a key distributor controls the key generation
arguments and time factors, while other participants independently generate a
keychain based on key generation arguments. We undertake a rigorous security
analysis and prove the security strength of TAP using CSP and rank function
analysis.

 <dc:description>  The Lorenz attractor was introduced in 1963 by E. N. Lorenz as one of the
first examples of \emph{strange attractors}. However Lorenz' research was
mainly based on (non-rigourous) numerical simulations and, until recently, the
proof of the existence of the Lorenz attractor remained elusive. To address
that problem some authors introduced geometric Lorenz models and proved that
geometric Lorenz models have a strange attractor. In 2002 it was shown that the
original Lorenz model behaves like a geometric Lorenz model and thus has a
strange attractor. In this paper we show that geometric Lorenz attractors are
computable, as well as their physical measures.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Deshpande et al. introduced a new measure of the complexity of a
Boolean function. We call this measure the &quot;goal value&quot; of the function. The
goal value of $f$ is defined in terms of a monotone, submodular utility
function associated with $f$. As shown by Deshpande et al., proving that a
Boolean function $f$ has small goal value can lead to a good approximation
algorithm for the Stochastic Boolean Function Evaluation problem for $f$. Also,
if $f$ has small goal value, it indicates a close relationship between two
other measures of the complexity of $f$, its average-case decision tree
complexity and its average-case certificate complexity. In this paper, we
explore the goal value measure in detail. We present bounds on the goal values
of arbitrary and specific Boolean functions, and present results on properties
of the measure. We compare the goal value measure to other, previously studied,
measures of the complexity of Boolean functions. Finally, we discuss a number
of open questions provoked by our work.

 <dc:description>  Real-world face recognition using a single sample per person (SSPP) is a
challenging task. The problem is exacerbated if the conditions under which the
gallery image and the probe set are captured are completely different. To
address these issues from the perspective of domain adaptation, we introduce an
SSPP domain adaptation network (SSPP-DAN). In the proposed approach, domain
adaptation, feature extraction, and classification are performed jointly using
a deep architecture with domain-adversarial training. However, the SSPP
characteristic of one training sample per class is insufficient to train the
deep architecture. To overcome this shortage, we generate synthetic images with
varying poses using a 3D face model. Experimental evaluations using a realistic
SSPP dataset show that deep domain adaptation and image synthesis complement
each other and dramatically improve accuracy. Experiments on a benchmark
dataset using the proposed approach show state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  We construct the base $2$ expansion of an absolutely normal real number $x$
so that, for every integer $b$ greater than or equal to $2$, the discrepancy
modulo $1$ of the sequence $(b^0 x, b^1 x, b^2 x , \ldots)$ is essentially the
same as that realized by almost all real numbers.

 <dc:description>  Flat-fading channel models are usually invoked for analyzing the performance
of massive spatial modulation multiple-input multiple-output (SM-MIMO) systems.
However, in the context of broadband SM transmission, the severe
inter-symbol-interference (ISI) caused by the frequency-selective fading
channels can not be ignored, which leads to very detrimental effects on the
achievable system performance, especially for single-carrier SM (SC-SM)
transmission schemes. To the best of the author's knowledge, none of the
previous researchers have been able to provide a thorough analysis on the
achievable spectral efficiency (SE) of the massive SC-SM MIMO uplink
transmission. In this context, the uplink SE of single-cell massive SC-SM MIMO
system is analyzed, and a tight closed-form lower bound is proposed to quantify
the SE when the base station (BS) uses maximum ratio (MR) combining for
multi-user detection. The impacts of imperfect channel estimation and transmit
correlation are all considered. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to verify
the tightness of our proposed SE lower bound. Both the theoretical analysis and
simulation results show that the SE of uplink single-cell massive SC-SM MIMO
system has the potential to outperform the uplink SE achieved by single-antenna
UEs.

 <dc:description>  With the huge influx of various data nowadays, extracting knowledge from them
has become an interesting but tedious task among data scientists, particularly
when the data come in heterogeneous form and have missing information. Many
data completion techniques had been introduced, especially in the advent of
kernel methods. However, among the many data completion techniques available in
the literature, studies about mutually completing several incomplete kernel
matrices have not been given much attention yet. In this paper, we present a
new method, called Mutual Kernel Matrix Completion (MKMC) algorithm, that
tackles this problem of mutually inferring the missing entries of multiple
kernel matrices by combining the notions of data fusion and kernel matrix
completion, applied on biological data sets to be used for classification task.
We first introduced an objective function that will be minimized by exploiting
the EM algorithm, which in turn results to an estimate of the missing entries
of the kernel matrices involved. The completed kernel matrices are then
combined to produce a model matrix that can be used to further improve the
obtained estimates. An interesting result of our study is that the E-step and
the M-step are given in closed form, which makes our algorithm efficient in
terms of time and memory. After completion, the (completed) kernel matrices are
then used to train an SVM classifier to test how well the relationships among
the entries are preserved. Our empirical results show that the proposed
algorithm bested the traditional completion techniques in preserving the
relationships among the data points, and in accurately recovering the missing
kernel matrix entries. By far, MKMC offers a promising solution to the problem
of mutual estimation of a number of relevant incomplete kernel matrices.

 <dc:description>  To cope with the ongoing changing demands of the internet, 'in-network
caching' has been presented as an application solution for two decades. With
the advent of information-centric network (ICN) architecture, 'in-network
caching' becomes a network level solution. Some unique features of ICNs, e.g.,
rapidly changing cache states, higher request arrival rates, smaller cache
sizes, and other factors, impose diverse requirements on the content eviction
policies. In particular, eviction policies should be fast and lightweight. In
this study, we propose cache replication and eviction schemes, Conditional
Leave Cope Everywhere (CLCE) and Least Frequent Recently Used (LFRU), which are
well suited for the ICN type of cache networks (CNs). The CLCE replication
scheme reduces the redundant caching of contents; hence improves the cache
space utilization. LFRU approximates the Least Frequently Used (LFU) scheme
coupled with the Least Recently Used (LRU) scheme and is practically
implementable for rapidly changing cache networks like ICNs.

 <dc:description>  A practical rate-matching system for constructing rate-compatible polar codes
is proposed. The proposed polar code circular buffer rate-matching is suitable
for transmissions on communication channels that support hybrid automatic
repeat request (HARQ) communications, as well as for flexible resource-element
rate-matching on single transmission channels. Our proposed circular buffer
rate matching scheme also incorporates a bit-mapping scheme for transmission on
bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) channels using higher order
modulations. An interleaver is derived from a puncturing order obtained with a
low complexity progressive puncturing search algorithm on a base code of short
length, and has the flexibility to achieve any desired rate at the desired code
length, through puncturing or repetition. The rate-matching scheme is implied
by a two-stage polarization, for transmission at any desired code length, code
rate, and modulation order, and is shown to achieve the symmetric capacity of
BICM channels. Numerical results on AWGN and fast fading channels show that the
rate-matched polar codes have a competitive performance when compared to the
spatially-coupled quasi-cyclic LDPC codes or LTE turbo codes, while having
similar rate-dematching storage and computational complexities.

 <dc:description>  Network centrality plays an important role in many applications. Central
nodes in social networks can be influential, driving opinions and spreading
news or rumors.In hyperlinked environments, such as the Web, where users
navigate via clicks, central content receives high traffic, becoming targets
for advertising campaigns. While there is an extensive amount of work on
centrality measures and their efficient computation, controlling nodes'
centrality via network updates is a more recent and challenging problem.
Performing minimal modifications to a network to achieve a desired property
falls under the umbrella of network design problems. This paper is focused on
improving the coverage centrality of a set of nodes, which is the number of
pairs of nodes that have a shortest path passing through the set, by adding
edges to the network. We prove strong inapproximability results and propose a
greedy algorithm for maximizing coverage centrality. To ensure scalability to
large networks, we also design an efficient sampling algorithm for the problem.
In addition to providing an extensive empirical evaluation of our algorithms,
we also show that, under some realistic constraints, the proposed solutions
achieve almost-optimal approximation for coverage centrality maximization.

 <dc:description>  Tree containment problem is a fundamental problem in phylogenetic study, as
it is used to verify a network model. It asks whether a given network contain a
subtree that resembles a binary tree. The problem is NP-complete in general,
even in the class of binary network. Recently, it was proven to be solvable in
cubic time, and later in quadratic time for the class of general reticulation
visible networks. In this paper, we further improve the time complexity into
linear time.

 <dc:description>  The performance of equal gain combining reception at free-space optical
communication systems is analytically studied and evaluated. We consider the
case when the total received signal undergoes independent and not necessarily
identically distributed channel fading, modeled by the versatile mixture-Gamma
distribution. Also, the misalignment-induced fading due to the presence of
pointing errors is jointly considered in the enclosed analysis. New closed-form
expressions in terms of finite sum series of the Meijer's $G$-function are
derived regarding some key performance metrics of the considered system;
namely, the scintillation index, outage probability, and average bit-error
rate. Based on these results, some useful outcomes are manifested, such as the
system diversity order, the crucial role of diversity branches, and the impact
of composite channel fading/pointing error effect onto the system performance.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a novel subspace-based method for blind identification of
multichannel finite impulse response (FIR) systems is presented. Here, we
exploit directly the impeded Toeplitz channel structure in the signal linear
model to build a quadratic form whose minimization leads to the desired channel
estimation up to a scalar factor. This method can be extended to estimate any
predefined linear structure, e.g. Hankel, that is usually encountered in linear
systems. Simulation findings are provided to highlight the appealing advantages
of the new structure-based subspace (SSS) method over the standard subspace
(SS) method in certain adverse identification scenarii.

 <dc:description>  Lineage tracing, the joint segmentation and tracking of living cells as they
move and divide in a sequence of light microscopy images, is a challenging
task. Jug et al. have proposed a mathematical abstraction of this task, the
moral lineage tracing problem (MLTP), whose feasible solutions define both a
segmentation of every image and a lineage forest of cells. Their branch-and-cut
algorithm, however, is prone to many cuts and slow convergence for large
instances. To address this problem, we make three contributions: (i) we devise
the first efficient primal feasible local search algorithms for the MLTP, (ii)
we improve the branch-and-cut algorithm by separating tighter cutting planes
and by incorporating our primal algorithms, (iii) we show in experiments that
our algorithms find accurate solutions on the problem instances of Jug et al.
and scale to larger instances, leveraging moral lineage tracing to practical
significance.

 <dc:description>  Over-segmentation, or super-pixel generation, is a common preliminary stage
for many computer vision applications. New acquisition technologies enable the
capturing of 3D point clouds that contain color and geometrical information.
This 3D information introduces a new conceptual change that can be utilized to
improve the results of over-segmentation, which uses mainly color information,
and to generate clusters of points we call super-points. We consider a variety
of possible 3D extensions of the Local Variation (LV) graph based
over-segmentation algorithms, and compare them thoroughly. We consider
different alternatives for constructing the connectivity graph, for assigning
the edge weights, and for defining the merge criterion, which must now account
for the geometric information and not only color. Following this evaluation, we
derive a new generic algorithm for over-segmentation of 3D point clouds. We
call this new algorithm Point Cloud Local Variation (PCLV). The advantages of
the new over-segmentation algorithm are demonstrated on both outdoor and
cluttered indoor scenes. Performance analysis of the proposed approach compared
to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D over-segmentation algorithms shows significant
improvement according to the common performance measures.

 <dc:description>  Over the past decade there has been considerable interest in spectral
algorithms for learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs). Spectral
algorithms have appealing theoretical guarantees; however, the resulting models
do not always perform well on inference tasks in practice. One reason for this
behavior is the mismatch between the intended task (accurate filtering or
prediction) and the loss function being optimized by the algorithm (estimation
error in model parameters).
  A natural idea is to improve performance by refining PSRs using an algorithm
such as EM. Unfortunately it is not obvious how to apply apply an EM style
algorithm in the context of PSRs as the Log Likelihood is not well defined for
all PSRs. We show that it is possible to overcome this problem using ideas from
Predictive State Inference Machines.
  We combine spectral algorithms for PSRs as a consistent and efficient
initialization with PSIM-style updates to refine the resulting model
parameters. By combining these two ideas we develop Inference Gradients, a
simple, fast, and robust method for practical learning of PSRs. Inference
Gradients performs gradient descent in the PSR parameter space to optimize an
inference-based loss function like PSIM. Because Inference Gradients uses a
spectral initialization we get the same consistency benefits as PSRs. We show
that Inference Gradients outperforms both PSRs and PSIMs on real and synthetic
data sets.

 <dc:description>  There is an inherent need for autonomous cars, drones, and other robots to
have a notion of how their environment behaves and to anticipate changes in the
near future. In this work, we focus on anticipating future appearance given the
current frame of a video. Existing work focuses on either predicting the future
appearance as the next frame of a video, or predicting future motion as optical
flow or motion trajectories starting from a single video frame. This work
stretches the ability of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to predict an
anticipation of appearance at an arbitrarily given future time, not necessarily
the next video frame. We condition our predicted future appearance on a
continuous time variable that allows us to anticipate future frames at a given
temporal distance, directly from the input video frame. We show that CNNs can
learn an intrinsic representation of typical appearance changes over time and
successfully generate realistic predictions at a deliberate time difference in
the near future.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of sequential learning from categorical observations
bounded in [0,1]. We establish an ordering between the Dirichlet posterior over
categorical outcomes and a Gaussian posterior under observations with N(0,1)
noise. We establish that, conditioned upon identical data with at least two
observations, the posterior mean of the categorical distribution will always
second-order stochastically dominate the posterior mean of the Gaussian
distribution. These results provide a useful tool for the analysis of
sequential learning under categorical outcomes.

 <dc:description>  All-pay auctions, a common mechanism for various human and agent
interactions, suffers, like many other mechanisms, from the possibility of
players' failure to participate in the auction. We model such failures, and
fully characterize equilibrium for this class of games, we present a symmetric
equilibrium and show that under some conditions the equilibrium is unique. We
reveal various properties of the equilibrium, such as the lack of influence of
the most-likely-to-participate player on the behavior of the other players. We
perform this analysis with two scenarios: the sum-profit model, where the
auctioneer obtains the sum of all submitted bids, and the max-profit model of
crowdsourcing contests, where the auctioneer can only use the best submissions
and thus obtains only the winning bid.
  Furthermore, we examine various methods of influencing the probability of
participation such as the effects of misreporting one's own probability of
participating, and how influencing another player's participation chances
changes the player's strategy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the problem of wireless sensor network (WSN)
maintenance using mobile entities called mules. The mules are deployed in the
area of the WSN in such a way that would minimize the time it takes them to
reach a failed sensor and fix it. The mules must constantly optimize their
collective deployment to account for occupied mules. The objective is to define
the optimal deployment and task allocation strategy for the mules, so that the
sensors' downtime and the mules' traveling distance are minimized. Our
solutions are inspired by research in the field of computational geometry and
the design of our algorithms is based on state of the art approximation
algorithms for the classical problem of facility location. Our empirical
results demonstrate how cooperation enhances the team's performance, and
indicate that a combination of k-Median based deployment with closest-available
task allocation provides the best results in terms of minimizing the sensors'
downtime but is inefficient in terms of the mules' travel distance. A
k-Centroid based deployment produces good results in both criteria.

 <dc:description>  Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is a novel architectural model for cloud
network infrastructure, improving resource utilization, scalability and
administration. SDN deployments increasingly rely on virtual switches executing
on commodity operating systems with large code bases, which are prime targets
for adversaries attacking the net- work infrastructure. We describe and
implement TruSDN, a framework for bootstrapping trust in SDN infrastructure
using Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), allowing to securely deploy SDN
components and protect communication between network endpoints. We introduce
ephemeral flow-specific pre-shared keys and propose a novel defense against
cuckoo attacks on SGX enclaves. TruSDN is secure under a powerful adversary
model, with a minor performance overhead.

 <dc:description>  Communication and topology aware process mapping is a powerful approach to
reduce communication time in parallel applications with known communication
patterns on large, distributed memory systems. We address the problem as a
quadratic assignment problem (QAP), and present algorithms to construct initial
mappings of processes to processors as well as fast local search algorithms to
further improve the mappings. By exploiting assumptions that typically hold for
applications and modern supercomputer systems such as sparse communication
patterns and hierarchically organized communication systems, we arrive at
significantly more powerful algorithms for these special QAPs. Our multilevel
construction algorithms employ recently developed, perfectly balanced graph
partitioning techniques and excessively exploit the given communication system
hierarchy. We present improvements to a local search algorithm of Brandfass et
al., and decrease the running time by reducing the time needed to perform swaps
in the assignment as well as by carefully constraining local search
neighborhoods. Experiments indicate that our algorithms not only dramatically
speed up local search, but due to the multilevel approach also find much better
solutions~in~practice.

 <dc:description>  Tens of millions of new variable objects are expected to be identified in
over a billion time series from the Gaia mission. Crossmatching known variable
sources with those from Gaia is crucial to incorporate current knowledge,
understand how these objects appear in the Gaia data, train supervised
classifiers to recognise known classes, and validate the results of the
Variability Processing and Analysis Coordination Unit (CU7) within the Gaia
Data Analysis and Processing Consortium (DPAC). The method employed by CU7 to
crossmatch variables for the first Gaia data release includes a binary
classifier to take into account positional uncertainties, proper motion,
targeted variability signals, and artefacts present in the early calibration of
the Gaia data. Crossmatching with a classifier makes it possible to automate
all those decisions which are typically made during visual inspection. The
classifier can be trained with objects characterized by a variety of attributes
to ensure similarity in multiple dimensions (astrometry, photometry,
time-series features), with no need for a-priori transformations to compare
different photometric bands, or of predictive models of the motion of objects
to compare positions. Other advantages as well as some disadvantages of the
method are discussed. Implementation steps from the training to the assessment
of the crossmatch classifier and selection of results are described.

 <dc:title>Canonical Completeness in Lattice-Based Languages for Attribute-Based
  Access Control</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Crampton, Jason</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Williams, Conrad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The study of canonically complete attribute-based access control (ABAC)
languages is relatively new. A canonically complete language is useful as it is
functionally complete and provides a &quot;normal form&quot; for policies. However,
previous work on canonically complete ABAC languages requires that the set of
authorization decisions is totally ordered, which does not accurately reflect
the intuition behind the use of the allow, deny and not-applicable decisions in
access control. A number of recent ABAC languages use a fourth value and the
set of authorization decisions is partially ordered. In this paper, we show how
canonical completeness in multi-valued logics can be extended to the case where
the set of truth values forms a lattice. This enables us to investigate the
canonical completeness of logics having a partially ordered set of truth
values, such as Belnap logic, and show that ABAC languages based on Belnap
logic, such as PBel, are not canonically complete. We then construct a
canonically complete four-valued logic using connections between the generators
of the symmetric group (defined over the set of decisions) and unary operators
in a canonically suitable logic. Finally, we propose a new authorization
language $\text{PTaCL}_{\sf 4}^{\leqslant}$, an extension of PTaCL, which
incorporates a lattice-ordered decision set and is canonically complete. We
then discuss how the advantages of $\text{PTaCL}_{\sf 4}^{\leqslant}$ can be
leveraged within the framework of XACML.

 <dc:description>  The field of Automatic Facial Expression Analysis has grown rapidly in recent
years. However, despite progress in new approaches as well as benchmarking
efforts, most evaluations still focus on either posed expressions, near-frontal
recordings, or both. This makes it hard to tell how existing expression
recognition approaches perform under conditions where faces appear in a wide
range of poses (or camera views), displaying ecologically valid expressions.
The main obstacle for assessing this is the availability of suitable data, and
the challenge proposed here addresses this limitation. The FG 2017 Facial
Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017) extends FERA 2015 to
the estimation of Action Units occurrence and intensity under different camera
views. In this paper we present the third challenge in automatic recognition of
facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE conference on
Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2017, in Washington, United States. Two
sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, and the estimation
of AU intensity. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data
used, and the results of a baseline method for both sub-challenges.

 <dc:title>Structured Deep Hashing with Convolutional Neural Networks for Fast
  Person Re-identification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wu, Lin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Yang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a pedestrian image as a query, the purpose of person re-identification
is to identify the correct match from a large collection of gallery images
depicting the same person captured by disjoint camera views. The critical
challenge is how to construct a robust yet discriminative feature
representation to capture the compounded variations in pedestrian appearance.
To this end, deep learning methods have been proposed to extract hierarchical
features against extreme variability of appearance. However, existing methods
in this category generally neglect the efficiency in the matching stage whereas
the searching speed of a re-identification system is crucial in real-world
applications. In this paper, we present a novel deep hashing framework with
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fast person re-identification.
Technically, we simultaneously learn both CNN features and hash functions/codes
to get robust yet discriminative features and similarity-preserving hash codes.
Thereby, person re-identification can be resolved by efficiently computing and
ranking the Hamming distances between images. A structured loss function
defined over positive pairs and hard negatives is proposed to formulate a novel
optimization problem so that fast convergence and more stable optimized
solution can be obtained. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks CUHK03
\cite{FPNN} and Market-1501 \cite{Market1501} show that the proposed deep
architecture is efficacy over state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  Virtual full-duplex (VFD) is a powerful solution to compensate the rate loss
of half-duplex relaying without the need to full-duplex capable nodes.
Inter-relay interference (IRI) challenges the operation of VFD relaying
systems. Recently, improper signaling is employed at both relays of the VFD to
mitigate the IRI by imposing the same signal characteristics for both relays.
To further boost the achievable rate performance, asymmetric time sharing VFD
relaying system is adopted with different improper signals at the half-duplex
relays. The joint tuning of the three design parameters improves the achievable
rate performance at different ranges of IRI and different relays locations.
Extensive simulation results are presented and analyzed to show the achievable
rate gain of the proposed system and understand the system behavior.

 <dc:description>  We consider the 0-1 Penalized Knapsack Problem (PKP). Each item has a profit,
a weight and a penalty and the goal is to maximize the sum of the profits minus
the greatest penalty value of the items included in a solution. We propose an
exact approach relying on a procedure which narrows the relevant range of
penalties, on the identification of a core problem and on dynamic programming.
The proposed approach turns out to be very effective in solving hard instances
of PKP and compares favorably both to commercial solver CPLEX 12.5 applied to
the ILP formulation of the problem and to the best available exact algorithm in
the literature. Then we present a general inapproximability result and
investigate several relevant special cases which permit fully polynomial time
approximation schemes (FPTASs).

 <dc:description>  What is the state of the literature in respect to Crowdsourcing for policy
making? This work attempts to answer this question by collecting, categorizing,
and situating the extant research investigating Crowdsourcing for policy,
within the broader Crowdsourcing literature. To do so, the work first extends
the Crowdsourcing literature by introducing, defining, explaining, and using
seven universal characteristics of all general Crowdsourcing techniques, to
vividly draw-out the relative trade-offs of each mode of Crowdsourcing. From
this beginning, the work systematically and explicitly weds the three types of
Crowdsourcing to the stages of the Policy cycle as a method of situating the
extant literature spanning both domains. Thereafter, we discuss the trends,
highlighting the research gaps, and outline the overlaps in the research on
Crowdsourcing for policy, stemming from our analysis.

 <dc:description>  Traditionally, the term crowd was used almost exclusively in the context of
people who self-organized around a common purpose, emotion or experience.
Today, however, firms often refer to crowds in discussions of how collections
of individuals can be engaged for organizational purposes. Crowdsourcing, the
use of information technologies to outsource business responsibilities to
crowds, can now significantly influence a firms ability to leverage previously
unattainable resources to build competitive advantage. Nonetheless, many
managers are hesitant to consider crowdsourcing because they do not understand
how its various types can add value to the firm. In response, we explain what
crowdsourcing is, the advantages it offers and how firms can pursue
crowdsourcing. We begin by formulating a crowdsourcing typology and show how
its four categories (crowd-voting, micro-task, idea and solution crowdsourcing)
can help firms develop crowd capital, an organizational-level resource
harnessed from the crowd. We then present a three-step process model for
generating crowd capital. Step one includes important considerations that shape
how a crowd is to be constructed. Step two outlines the capabilities firms need
to develop to acquire and assimilate resources (knowledge, labor, funds) from
the crowd. Step three addresses key decision-areas that executives need to
address to effectively engage crowds.

 <dc:description>  Crowdsourcing is beginning to be used for policymaking. The wisdom of crowds
[Surowiecki 2005], and crowdsourcing [Brabham 2008], are seen as new avenues
that can shape all kinds of policy, from transportation policy [Nash 2009] to
urban planning [Seltzer and Mahmoudi 2013], to climate policy. In general, many
have high expectations for positive outcomes with crowdsourcing, and based on
both anecdotal and empirical evidence, some of these expectations seem
justified [Majchrzak and Malhotra 2013]. Yet, to our knowledge, research has
yet to emerge that unpacks the different forms of crowdsourcing in light of
each stage of the well-established policy cycle. This work addresses this
research gap, and in doing so brings increased nuance to the application of
crowdsourcing techniques for policymaking.

 <dc:description>  In this work we use the theory of Crowd Capital as a lens to compare and
contrast a number of IS tools currently in use by organizations for
crowd-engagement purposes. In doing so, we contribute to both the practitioner
and research domains. For the practitioner community we provide decision-makers
with a convenient and useful resource, in table-form, outlining in detail some
of the differing potentialities of crowd-engaging IS. For the research
community we begin to unpack some of the key properties of crowd-engaging IS,
including some of the differing qualities of the crowds that these IS
application engage.

 <dc:description>  In this work we seek to understand how differences in location affect
participation outcomes in IT-mediated crowds. To do so, we operationalize Crowd
Capital Theory with data from a popular international creative crowdsourcing
site, to determine whether regional differences exist in crowdsourcing
participation outcomes. We present the early results of our investigation from
data encompassing 1,858,202 observations from 28,214 crowd members on 94
different projects in 2012. Using probit regressions to isolate geographic
effects by continental region, we find significant variation across regions in
crowdsourcing participation. In doing so, we contribute to the literature by
illustrating that geography matters in respect to crowd participation. Further,
our work illustrates an initial validation of Crowd Capital Theory as a useful
theoretical model to guide empirical inquiry in the fast-growing domain of
IT-mediated crowds.

 <dc:description>  To begin to understand the implications of the implementation of IT-mediated
Crowds for Politics and Policy purposes, this research builds the first-known
dataset of IT-mediated Crowd applications currently in use in the governance
context. Using Crowd Capital theory and governance theory as frameworks to
organize our data collection, we undertake an exploratory data analysis of some
fundamental factors defining this emerging field. Specific factors outlined and
discussed include the type of actors implementing IT-mediated Crowds in the
governance context, the global geographic distribution of the applications, and
the nature of the Crowd-derived resources being generated for governance
purposes. The findings from our dataset of 209 on-going endeavours indicates
that a wide-diversity of actors are engaging IT-mediated Crowds in the
governance context, both jointly and severally, that these endeavours can be
found to exist on all continents, and that said actors are generating
Crowd-derived resources in at least ten distinct governance sectors. We discuss
the ramifications of these and our other findings in comparison to the research
literature on the private-sector use of IT-mediated Crowds, while highlighting
some unique future research opportunities stemming from our work.

 <dc:description>  Can Crowds serve as useful allies in policy design? How do non-expert Crowds
perform relative to experts in the assessment of policy measures? Does the
geographic location of non-expert Crowds, with relevance to the policy context,
alter the performance of non-experts Crowds in the assessment of policy
measures? In this work, we investigate these questions by undertaking
experiments designed to replicate expert policy assessments with non-expert
Crowds recruited from Virtual Labor Markets. We use a set of ninety-six climate
change adaptation policy measures previously evaluated by experts in the
Netherlands as our control condition to conduct experiments using two discrete
sets of non-expert Crowds recruited from Virtual Labor Markets. We vary the
composition of our non-expert Crowds along two conditions: participants
recruited from a geographical location directly relevant to the policy context
and participants recruited at-large. We discuss our research methods in detail
and provide the findings of our experiments.

 <dc:description>  The increasing practice of engaging crowds, where organizations use IT to
connect with dispersed individuals for explicit resource creation purposes, has
precipitated the need to measure the precise processes and benefits of these
activities over myriad different implementations. In this work, we seek to
address these salient and non-trivial considerations by laying a foundation of
theory, measures, and research methods that allow us to test crowd-engagement
efficacy across organizations, industries, technologies, and geographies. To do
so, we anchor ourselves in the Theory of Crowd Capital, a generalizable
framework for studying IT-mediated crowd-engagement phenomena, and put forth an
empirical apparatus of testable measures and generalizable methods to begin to
unify the field of crowd science.

 <dc:description>  Biosensed information represent an emerging class of data with the potential
for massive, systematic, and remote or casual collection of personal
information about people. Biosensors capture physiological signals in addition
to kinesthetic data to draw intimate inferences about individuals' mental
states. The proliferation of sensors makes detection, interpretation, and
inference of these previously subtle--or otherwise invisible--emotional and
physiological signals possible from proximate and remote locations. These
sensors pose unprecedented challenges to individual privacy in public through
remote, precise, and passively collected data. This paper examines the unique
nature and inferential potential of biosensed data by creating a taxonomy of
signals that may be collected remotely, via casual contact, or from traces left
behind, and consider how these data may be collected and used--particularly in
public. Using historic and recent cases utilizing photography, this paper
explores how social norms evolved, and then employ the contextual integrity
privacy heuristic to explore the need for new norms and remedies for
biosensing. This analysis examines the extensibility of relevant legal
frameworks in the European Union (EU) and United States (US) as a privacy
remedy, and conclude with a brief outline of possible legal or social remedies
that may address privacy needs in public with biosensing technologies.

 <dc:description>  The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as delivery systems of online
goods is rapidly becoming a global norm, as corroborated by Amazon's &quot;Prime
Air&quot; and Google's &quot;Project Wing&quot; projects. However, the real-world deployment
of such drone delivery systems faces many cyber-physical security challenges.
In this paper, a novel mathematical framework for analyzing and enhancing the
security of drone delivery systems is introduced. In this regard, a zero-sum
network interdiction game is formulated between a vendor, operating a drone
delivery system, and a malicious attacker. In this game, the vendor seeks to
find the optimal path that its UAV should follow, to deliver a purchase from
the vendor's warehouse to a customer location, to minimize the delivery time.
Meanwhile, an attacker seeks to choose an optimal location to interdict the
potential paths of the UAVs, so as to inflict cyber or physical damage to it,
thus, maximizing its delivery time. First, the Nash equilibrium point of this
game is characterized. Then, to capture the subjective behavior of both the
vendor and attacker, new notions from prospect theory are incorporated into the
game. These notions allow capturing the vendor's and attacker's i) subjective
perception of attack success probabilities, and ii) their disparate subjective
valuations of the achieved delivery times relative to a certain target delivery
time. Simulation results have shown that the subjective decision making of the
vendor and attacker leads to adopting risky path selection strategies which
inflict delays to the delivery, thus, yielding unexpected delivery times which
surpass the target delivery time set by the vendor.

 <dc:title>Detection of Slang Words in e-Data using semi-Supervised Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The proposed algorithmic approach deals with finding the sense of a word in
an electronic data. Now a day,in different communication mediums like internet,
mobile services etc. people use few words, which are slang in nature. This
approach detects those abusive words using supervised learning procedure. But
in the real life scenario, the slang words are not used in complete word forms
always. Most of the times, those words are used in different abbreviated forms
like sounds alike forms, taboo morphemes etc. This proposed approach can detect
those abbreviated forms also using semi supervised learning procedure. Using
the synset and concept analysis of the text, the probability of a suspicious
word to be a slang word is also evaluated.

 <dc:title>Bizur: A Key-value Consensus Algorithm for Scalable File-systems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Bizur is a consensus algorithm exposing a key-value interface. It is used by
a distributed file-system that scales to 100s of servers, delivering millions
of IOPS, both data and metadata, with consistent low-latency.
  Bizur is aimed for services that require strongly consistent state, but do
not require a distributed log; for example, a distributed lock manager or a
distributed service locator. By avoiding a distributed log scheme, Bizur
outperforms distributed log based consensus algorithms, producing more IOPS and
guaranteeing lower latencies during normal operation and especially during
failures.
  Paxos-like algorithms (e.g., Zab and Raft) which are used by existing
distributed file-systems, can have artificial contention points due to their
dependence on a distributed log. The distributed log is needed when replicating
a general service, but when the desired service is key-value based, the
contention points created by the distributed log can be avoided.
  Bizur does exactly that, by reaching consensus independently on independent
keys. This independence allows Bizur to handle failures more efficiently and to
scale much better than other consensus algorithms, allowing the file-system
that utilizes Bizur to scale with it.

 <dc:description>  Mobile AdHoc NETworks (MANETs) have been identified as a key emerging
technology for scenarios in which IEEE 802.11 or cellular communications are
either infeasible, inefficient, or cost-ineffective. Smartphones are the most
adequate network nodes in many of these scenarios, but it is not
straightforward to build a network with them. We extensively survey existing
possibilities to build applications on top of ad-hoc smartphone networks for
experimentation purposes, and introduce a taxonomy to classify them. We present
AdHocDroid, an Android package that creates an IP-level MANET of (rooted)
Android smartphones, and make it publicly available to the community.
AdHocDroid supports standard TCP/IP applications, providing real smartphone
IEEE 802.11 MANET and the capability to easily change the routing protocol. We
tested our framework on several smartphones and a laptop. We validate the MANET
running off-the-shelf applications, and reporting on experimental performance
evaluation, including network metrics and battery discharge rate.

 <dc:description>  Molecular Dynamics is an important tool for computational biologists,
chemists, and materials scientists, consuming a sizable amount of
supercomputing resources. Many of the investigated systems contain charged
particles, which can only be simulated accurately using a long-range solver,
such as PPPM. We extend the popular LAMMPS molecular dynamics code with an
implementation of PPPM particularly suitable for the second generation Intel
Xeon Phi. Our main target is the optimization of computational kernels by means
of vectorization, and we observe speedups in these kernels of up to 12x. These
improvements carry over to LAMMPS users, with overall speedups ranging between
2-3x, without requiring users to retune input parameters. Furthermore, our
optimizations make it easier for users to determine optimal input parameters
for attaining top performance.

 <dc:title>A &quot;Quantal Regret&quot; Method for Structural Econometrics in Repeated Games</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We suggest a general method for inferring players' values from their actions
in repeated games. The method extends and improves upon the recent suggestion
of (Nekipelov et al., EC 2015) and is based on the assumption that players are
more likely to exhibit sequences of actions that have lower regret.
  We evaluate this &quot;quantal regret&quot; method on two different datasets from
experiments of repeated games with controlled player values: those of (Selten
and Chmura, AER 2008) on a variety of two-player 2x2 games and our own
experiment on ad-auctions (Noti et al., WWW 2014). We find that the quantal
regret method is consistently and significantly more precise than either
&quot;classic&quot; econometric methods that are based on Nash equilibria, or the
&quot;min-regret&quot; method of (Nekipelov et al., EC 2015).

 <dc:description>  Users on Twitter are commonly identified by their profile names. These names
are used when directly addressing users on Twitter, are part of their profile
page URLs, and can become a trademark for popular accounts, with people
referring to celebrities by their real name and their profile name,
interchangeably. Twitter, however, has chosen to not permanently link profile
names to their corresponding user accounts. In fact, Twitter allows users to
change their profile name, and afterwards makes the old profile names available
for other users to take. In this paper, we provide a large-scale study of the
phenomenon of profile name reuse on Twitter. We show that this phenomenon is
not uncommon, investigate the dynamics of profile name reuse, and characterize
the accounts that are involved in it. We find that many of these accounts adopt
abandoned profile names for questionable purposes, such as spreading malicious
content, and using the profile name's popularity for search engine
optimization. Finally, we show that this problem is not unique to Twitter (as
other popular online social networks also release profile names) and argue that
the risks involved with profile-name reuse outnumber the advantages provided by
this feature.

 <dc:description>  Due to stringent constraints on resources, it may be infeasible to acquire
the current channel state information at the transmitter in energy harvesting
communication systems. In this paper, we optimize an energy harvesting
transmitter, communicating over a slow fading channel, using layered coding.
The transmitter has access to the channel statistics, but does not know the
exact channel state. In layered coding, the codewords are first designed for
each of the channel states at different rates, and then the codewords are
either time-multiplexed or superimposed before the transmission, leading to two
transmission strategies. The receiver then decodes the information adaptively
based on the realized channel state. The transmitter is equipped with a
finite-capacity battery having non-zero internal resistance. In each of the
transmission strategies, we first formulate and study an average rate
maximization problem with non-causal knowledge of the harvested power
variations. Further, assuming statistical knowledge and causal information of
the harvested power variations, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm, and compare
with the stochastic dynamic programming based solution and a greedy policy.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this note is to attract attention to the following conjecture
(metastable $r$-fold Whitney trick) by clarifying its status as not having a
complete proof, in the sense described in the paper.
  Assume that $D=D_1\sqcup\ldots\sqcup D_r$ is disjoint union of $r$ disks of
dimension $s$, $f:D\to B^d$ a proper PL map such that $f\partial
D_1\cap\ldots\cap f\partial D_r=\emptyset$, $rd\ge (r+1)s+3$ and $d\ge s+3$. If
the map $$f^r:\partial(D_1\times\ldots\times D_r)\to
(B^d)^r-\{(x,x,\ldots,x)\in(B^d)^r\ |\ x\in B^d\}$$ extends to
$D_1\times\ldots\times D_r$, then there is a PL map $\overline f:D\to B^d$ such
that $$\overline f=f \quad\text{on}\quad D_r\cup\partial D\quad\text{and}\quad
\overline fD_1\cap\ldots\cap \overline fD_r=\emptyset.$$

 <dc:description>  Okapi is a new causally consistent geo-replicated key- value store. Okapi
leverages two key design choices to achieve high performance. First, it relies
on hybrid logical/physical clocks to achieve low latency even in the presence
of clock skew. Second, Okapi achieves higher resource efficiency and better
availability, at the expense of a slight increase in update visibility latency.
To this end, Okapi implements a new stabilization protocol that uses a
combination of vector and scalar clocks and makes a remote update visible when
its delivery has been acknowledged by every data center. We evaluate Okapi with
different workloads on Amazon AWS, using three geographically distributed
regions and 96 nodes. We compare Okapi with two recent approaches to causal
consistency, Cure and GentleRain. We show that Okapi delivers up to two orders
of magnitude better performance than GentleRain and that Okapi achieves up to
3.5x lower latency and a 60% reduction of the meta-data overhead with respect
to Cure.

 <dc:description>  Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) require ultra-low end-to-end delays
and multi-gigabit-per-second data transmission. Millimetre Waves (mmWaves)
communications can fulfil these requirements. However, the increased mobility
of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), requires frequent beamforming -
thus introducing increased overhead. In this paper, a new beamforming algorithm
is proposed able to achieve overhead-free beamforming training. Leveraging from
the CAVs sensory data, broadcast with Dedicated Short Range Communications
(DSRC) beacons, the position and the motion of a CAV can be estimated and
beamform accordingly. To minimise the position errors, an analysis of the
distinct error components was presented. The network performance is further
enhanced by adapting the antenna beamwidth with respect to the position error.
Our algorithm outperforms the legacy IEEE 802.11ad approach proving it a viable
solution for the future ITS applications and services.

 <dc:title>Design of a Time Delay Reservoir Using Stochastic Logic: A Feasibility
  Study</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Merkel, Cory</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a stochastic logic time delay reservoir design. The
reservoir is analyzed using a number of metrics, such as kernel quality,
generalization rank, performance on simple benchmarks, and is also compared to
a deterministic design. A novel re-seeding method is introduced to reduce the
adverse effects of stochastic noise, which may also be implemented in other
stochastic logic reservoir computing designs, such as echo state networks.
Benchmark results indicate that the proposed design performs well on
noise-tolerant classification problems, but more work needs to be done to
improve the stochastic logic time delay reservoir's robustness for regression
problems.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning and deep learning in particular has advanced tremendously on
perceptual tasks in recent years. However, it remains vulnerable against
adversarial perturbations of the input that have been crafted specifically to
fool the system while being quasi-imperceptible to a human. In this work, we
propose to augment deep neural networks with a small &quot;detector&quot; subnetwork
which is trained on the binary classification task of distinguishing genuine
data from data containing adversarial perturbations. Our method is orthogonal
to prior work on addressing adversarial perturbations, which has mostly focused
on making the classification network itself more robust. We show empirically
that adversarial perturbations can be detected surprisingly well even though
they are quasi-imperceptible to humans. Moreover, while the detectors have been
trained to detect only a specific adversary, they generalize to similar and
weaker adversaries. In addition, we propose an adversarial attack that fools
both the classifier and the detector and a novel training procedure for the
detector that counteracts this attack.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we revisit some classic board games like Pachisi or the Game of
Gosse. The main contribution of the paper is to design and add some
functionalities to the games in order to transform them in serious games, that
is, in games with learning and educational purposes. To do that, at the
beginning of the game, players choose one or several topics and during the
game, players have to anwers questions on these topics in order to move their
markers. We choose classic board games because a lot of people are familiar
with them so it is very easy to start to play without wasting time learning
game rules and, we think that this is an important element to make the game
more attractive to people. To enlarge the number of potential users we have
implement the games just using html and javascript and the games can be used in
any web browser, in any computer (including tablets) , in any computer
arquitecture (Windows, Mac, Linux) and no internet/server conexion is required.

 <dc:description>  For a wide variety of problems, creating detailed continuous models of
(continuous) physical systems is, at the very least, impractical. Hybrid models
can abstract away short transient behaviour (thus introducing discontinuities)
in order to simplify the study of such systems. For example, when modelling a
bouncing ball, the bounce can be abstracted as a discontinuous change of the
velocity, instead of resorting to the physics of the ball (de-)compression to
keep the velocity signal continuous. Impulsive differential equations can be
used to model and simulate hybrid systems such as the bouncing ball. In this
approach, the force acted on the ball by the floor is abstracted as an
infinitely large function in an infinitely small interval of time, that is, an
impulse. Current simulators cannot handle such approximations well due to the
limitations of machine precision.
  In this paper, we explore the simulation of impulsive differential equations,
where impulses are first class citizens. We present two approaches for the
simulation of impulses: symbolic and numerical. Our contribution is a
theoretically founded description of the implementation of both approaches in a
Causal Block Diagram modelling and simulation tool. Furthermore, we investigate
the conditions for which one approach is better than the other.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the details of Sighthound's fully automated age, gender
and emotion recognition system. The backbone of our system consists of several
deep convolutional neural networks that are not only computationally
inexpensive, but also provide state-of-the-art results on several competitive
benchmarks. To power our novel deep networks, we collected large labeled
datasets through a semi-supervised pipeline to reduce the annotation
effort/time. We tested our system on several public benchmarks and report
outstanding results. Our age, gender and emotion recognition models are
available to developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at

 <dc:description>  We present observations and discussion of previously unreported phenomena
discovered while training residual networks. The goal of this work is to better
understand the nature of neural networks through the examination of these new
empirical results. These behaviors were identified through the application of
Cyclical Learning Rates (CLR) and linear network interpolation. Among these
behaviors are counterintuitive increases and decreases in training loss and
instances of rapid training. For example, we demonstrate how CLR can produce
greater testing accuracy than traditional training despite using large learning
rates. Files to replicate these results are available at

 <dc:title>Integrating Three Mechanisms of Visual Attention for Active Visual
  Search</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rasouli, Amir</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Algorithms for robotic visual search can benefit from the use of visual
attention methods in order to reduce computational costs. Here, we describe how
three distinct mechanisms of visual attention can be integrated and
productively used to improve search performance. The first is viewpoint
selection as has been proposed earlier using a greedy search over a
probabilistic occupancy grid representation. The second is top-down
object-based attention using a histogram backprojection method, also previously
described. The third is visual saliency. This is novel in the sense that it is
not used as a region-of-interest method for the current image but rather as a
noncombinatorial form of look-ahead in search for future viewpoint selection.
Additionally, the integration of these three attentional schemes within a
single framework is unique and not previously studied. We examine our proposed
method in scenarios where little or no information regarding the environment is
available. Through extensive experiments on a mobile robot, we show that our
method improves visual search performance by reducing the time and number of
actions required.

 <dc:title>The KISS principle in Software-Defined Networking: An architecture for

 <dc:description>  Security is an increasingly fundamental requirement in Software-Defined
Networking (SDN). However, the pace of adoption of secure mechanisms has been
slow, which we estimate to be a consequence of the performance overhead of
traditional solutions and of the complexity of the support infrastructure
required. As a first step to addressing these problems, we propose a modular
secure SDN control plane communications architecture, KISS, with innovative
solutions in the context of key distribution and secure channel support. A
comparative analysis of the performance impact of essential security primitives
guided our selection of basic primitives for KISS. We further propose iDVV, the
integrated device verification value, a deterministic but
indistinguishable-from-random secret code generation protocol, allowing the
local but synchronized generation/verification of keys at both ends of the
channel, even on a per-message basis. iDVV is expected to give an important
contribution both to the robustness and simplification of the authentication
and secure communication problems in SDN.
  We show that our solution, while offering the same security properties,
outperforms reference alternatives, with performance improvements up to 30%
over OpenSSL, and improvement in robustness based on a code footprint one order
of magnitude smaller. Finally, we also prove and test randomness of the
proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This work analyses the Generalized Degrees-of-Freedom (GDoF) of the 2-User
Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) in the so-called
Distributed CSIT regime, with application to decentralized wireless networks.
This regime differs from the classical limited CSIT one in that the CSIT is not
just noisy but also imperfectly shared across the transmitters (TXs). Hence,
each TX precodes data on the basis of local CSIT and statistical quality
information at other TXs. We derive the GDoF result and obtain the surprising
outcome that by specific accounting of the pathloss information, it becomes
possible for the decentralized precoded network to reach the same performance
as a genie-aided centralized network where the central node has obtained the
estimates of both TXs. The key ingredient in the scheme is the so-called
Active-Passive Zero-Forcing (AP-ZF) precoding, which lets the precoder design
adapt optimally with respect to different local CSIT qualities available at
different TXs.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies scenarios of cyclic dominance in a coevolutionary spatial
model in which game strategies and links between agents adaptively evolve over
time. The Optional Prisoner's Dilemma (OPD) game is employed. The OPD is an
extended version of the traditional Prisoner's Dilemma where players have a
third option to abstain from playing the game. We adopt an agent-based
simulation approach and use Monte Carlo methods to perform the OPD with
coevolutionary rules. The necessary conditions to break the scenarios of cyclic
dominance are also investigated. This work highlights that cyclic dominance is
essential in the sustenance of biodiversity. Moreover, we also discuss the
importance of a spatial coevolutionary model in maintaining cyclic dominance in
adverse conditions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the minimization of a continuous function that is
potentially not differentiable or not twice differentiable on the boundary of
the feasible region. By exploiting an interior point technique, we present
first- and second-order optimality conditions for this problem that reduces to
classical ones when the derivative on the boundary is available. For this type
of problems, existing necessary conditions often rely on the notion of
subdifferential or become non-trivially weaker than the KKT condition in the
(twice-)differentiable counterpart problems. In contrast, this paper presents a
new set of first- and second-order necessary conditions that are derived
without the use of subdifferential and reduces to exactly the KKT condition
when (twice-)differentiability holds. As a result, these conditions are
stronger than some existing ones considered for the discussed minimization
problem when only non-negativity constraints are present. To solve for these
optimality conditions in the special but important case of linearly constrained
problems, we present two novel interior trust-region point algorithms and show
that their worst-case computational efficiency in achieving the potentially
stronger optimality conditions match the best known complexity bounds. Since
this work considers a more general problem than the literature, our results
also indicate that best known complexity bounds hold for a wider class of
nonlinear programming problems.

 <dc:description>  We develop an approach for solving rooted orienteering problems with category
constraints as found in tourist trip planning and logistics. It is based on
expanding partial solutions in a systematic way, prioritizing promising ones,
which reduces the search space we have to traverse during the search. The
category constraints help in reducing the space we have to explore even
further. We implement an algorithm that computes the optimal solution and also
illustrate how our approach can be turned into an approximation algorithm,
yielding much faster run times and guaranteeing lower bounds on the quality of
the solution found. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms by
comparing them to the state-of-the-art approach and an optimal algorithm based
on dynamic programming, showing that our technique clearly outperforms these
methods.

 <dc:title>Approximating the Held-Karp Bound for Metric TSP in Nearly Linear Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chekuri, Chandra</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We give a nearly linear time randomized approximation scheme for the
Held-Karp bound [Held and Karp, 1970] for metric TSP. Formally, given an
undirected edge-weighted graph $G$ on $m$ edges and $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the
algorithm outputs in $O(m \log^4n /\epsilon^2)$ time, with high probability, a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the Held-Karp bound on the metric TSP instance
induced by the shortest path metric on $G$. The algorithm can also be used to
output a corresponding solution to the Subtour Elimination LP. We substantially
improve upon the $O(m^2 \log^2(m)/\epsilon^2)$ running time achieved previously
by Garg and Khandekar. The LP solution can be used to obtain a fast randomized
$\big(\frac{3}{2} + \epsilon\big)$-approximation for metric TSP which improves
upon the running time of previous implementations of Christofides' algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We launch the new probabilistic model checker storm. It features the analysis
of discrete- and continuous-time variants of both Markov chains and MDPs. It
supports the PRISM and JANI modeling languages, probabilistic programs, dynamic
fault trees and generalized stochastic Petri nets. It has a modular set-up in
which solvers and symbolic engines can easily be exchanged. It offers a Python
API for rapid prototyping by encapsulating storm's fast and scalable
algorithms. Experiments on a variety of benchmarks show its competitive
performance.

 <dc:description>  A graph $G$ is a $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-graph if $V(G)$ can be bipartitioned into
$A$ and $B$ such that $G[A]$ satisfies property $\Pi_A$ and $G[B]$ satisfies
property $\Pi_B$. The $(\Pi_{A},\Pi_{B})$-Recognition problem is to recognize
whether a given graph is a $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-graph. There are many
$(\Pi_{A},\Pi_{B})$-Recognition problems, including the recognition problems
for bipartite, split, and unipolar graphs. We present efficient algorithms for
many cases of $(\Pi_A,\Pi_B)$-Recognition based on a technique which we dub
inductive recognition. In particular, we give fixed-parameter algorithms for
two NP-hard $(\Pi_{A},\Pi_{B})$-Recognition problems, Monopolar Recognition and
2-Subcoloring. We complement our algorithmic results with several hardness
results for $(\Pi_{A},\Pi_{B})$-Recognition.

 <dc:title>Don't cry over spilled records: Memory elasticity of data-parallel

 <dc:description>  Understanding the performance of data-parallel workloads when
resource-constrained has significant practical importance but unfortunately has
received only limited attention. This paper identifies, quantifies and
demonstrates memory elasticity, an intrinsic property of data-parallel tasks.
Memory elasticity allows tasks to run with significantly less memory that they
would ideally want while only paying a moderate performance penalty. For
example, we find that given as little as 10% of ideal memory, PageRank and
NutchIndexing Hadoop reducers become only 1.2x/1.75x and 1.08x slower. We show
that memory elasticity is prevalent in the Hadoop, Spark, Tez and Flink
frameworks. We also show that memory elasticity is predictable in nature by
building simple models for Hadoop and extending them to Tez and Spark.
  To demonstrate the potential benefits of leveraging memory elasticity, this
paper further explores its application to cluster scheduling. In this setting,
we observe that the resource vs. time trade-off enabled by memory elasticity
becomes a task queuing time vs task runtime trade-off. Tasks may complete
faster when scheduled with less memory because their waiting time is reduced.
We show that a scheduler can turn this task-level trade-off into improved job
completion time and cluster-wide memory utilization. We have integrated memory
elasticity into Apache YARN. We show gains of up to 60% in average job
completion time on a 50-node Hadoop cluster. Extensive simulations show similar
improvements over a large number of scenarios.

 <dc:title>On the Relevance of Auditory-Based Gabor Features for Deep Learning in
  Automatic Speech Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Martinez, Angel Mario Castro</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Previous studies support the idea of merging auditory-based Gabor features
with deep learning architectures to achieve robust automatic speech
recognition, however, the cause behind the gain of such combination is still
unknown. We believe these representations provide the deep learning decoder
with more discriminable cues. Our aim with this paper is to validate this
hypothesis by performing experiments with three different recognition tasks
(Aurora 4, CHiME 2 and CHiME 3) and assess the discriminability of the
information encoded by Gabor filterbank features. Additionally, to identify the
contribution of low, medium and high temporal modulation frequencies subsets of
the Gabor filterbank were used as features (dubbed LTM, MTM and HTM
respectively). With temporal modulation frequencies between 16 and 25 Hz, HTM
consistently outperformed the remaining ones in every condition, highlighting
the robustness of these representations against channel distortions, low
signal-to-noise ratios and acoustically challenging real-life scenarios with
relative improvements from 11 to 56% against a Mel-filterbank-DNN baseline. To
explain the results, a measure of similarity between phoneme classes from DNN
activations is proposed and linked to their acoustic properties. We find this
measure to be consistent with the observed error rates and highlight specific
differences on phoneme level to pinpoint the benefit of the proposed features.

 <dc:description>  We consider the bilinear inverse problem of recovering two vectors, $x$ and
$w$, in $\mathbb{R}^L$ from their entrywise product. For the case where the
vectors have known signs and belong to known subspaces, we introduce the convex
program BranchHull, which is posed in the natural parameter space and does not
require an approximate solution or initialization in order to be stated or
solved. Under the structural assumptions that $x$ and $w$ are the members of
known $K$ and $N$ dimensional random subspaces, we prove that BranchHull
recovers $x$ and $w$ up to the inherent scaling ambiguity with high probability
whenever $L \gtrsim K+N$. This program is motivated by applications in blind
deconvolution and self-calibration.

 <dc:description>  In the last two decades, DNA self-assembly has grown into a major area of
research attracting people from diverse background. It has numerous potential
applications such as targeted drug delivery, artificial photosynthesis etc. In
the last decade, another area received wide attention known as DNA origami,
where using M13 virus and carefully designed staple strands one can fold the
DNA into desired 2-D and 3-D shapes. In 2016, a group of researchers at MIT
have developed an automated DNA nanostructures strategy and an open source
software 'daedalus' based on MATLAB for developing the nanostructures. In this
work, we present a truly open source software '3dnaprinter' based on Java
(without MATLAB) that can do the same work.

 <dc:description>  For many low-resource or endangered languages, spoken language resources are
more likely to be annotated with translations than with transcriptions. Recent
work exploits such annotations to produce speech-to-translation alignments,
without access to any text transcriptions. We investigate whether providing
such information can aid in producing better (mismatched) crowdsourced
transcriptions, which in turn could be valuable for training speech recognition
systems, and show that they can indeed be beneficial through a small-scale case
study as a proof-of-concept. We also present a simple phonetically aware string
averaging technique that produces transcriptions of higher quality.

 <dc:description>  In a recent paper we analyzed the space complexity of streaming algorithms
whose goal is to decide membership of a sliding window to a fixed language. For
the class of regular languages we proved a space trichotomy theorem: for every
regular language the optimal space bound is either constant, logarithmic or
linear. In this paper we continue this line of research: We present natural
characterizations for the constant and logarithmic space classes and establish
tight relationships to the concept of language growth. We also analyze the
space complexity with respect to automata size and prove almost matching lower
and upper bounds. Finally, we consider the decision problem whether a language
given by a DFA/NFA admits a sliding window algorithm using logarithmic/constant
space.

 <dc:description>  Face detection is one of the challenging tasks in computer vision. Human face
detection plays an essential role in the first stage of face processing
applications such as face recognition, face tracking, image database
management, etc. In these applications, face objects often come from an
inconsequential part of images that contain variations, namely different
illumination, poses, and occlusion. These variations can decrease face
detection rate noticeably. Most existing face detection approaches are not
accurate, as they have not been able to resolve unstructured images due to
large appearance variations and can only detect human faces under one
particular variation. Existing frameworks of face detection need enhancements
to detect human faces under the stated variations to improve detection rate and
reduce detection time. In this study, an enhanced face detection framework is
proposed to improve detection rate based on skin color and provide a validation
process. A preliminary segmentation of the input images based on skin color can
significantly reduce search space and accelerate the process of human face
detection. The primary detection is based on Haar-like features and the
Adaboost algorithm. A validation process is introduced to reject non-face
objects, which might occur during the face detection process. The validation
process is based on two-stage Extended Local Binary Patterns. The experimental
results on the CMU-MIT and Caltech 10000 datasets over a wide range of facial
variations in different colors, positions, scales, and lighting conditions
indicated a successful face detection rate.

called Samu Entropy to try to improve dataflow program graphs like the ones
that are based on Google's TensorFlow. Currently, the Samu Entropy project
specifies only requirements for new esport games to be developed with
particular attention to the investigation of the relationship between esport
and artificial intelligence. It is quite obvious that there is a very close and
natural relationship between esport games and artificial intelligence.
Furthermore, the project Samu Entropy focuses not only on using artificial
intelligence, but on creating AI in a new way. We present a reference game
called Face Battle that implements the Samu Entropy requirements.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory optimization is a fundamental problem in robotics. While
optimization of continuous control trajectories is well developed, many
applications require both discrete and continuous, i.e., hybrid, controls.
Finding an optimal sequence of hybrid controls is challenging due to the
exponential explosion of discrete control combinations. Our method, based on
Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), circumvents this problem by
incorporating discrete actions inside DDP: we first optimize continuous
mixtures of discrete actions, and, subsequently force the mixtures into fully
discrete actions. Moreover, we show how our approach can be extended to
partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) for trajectory planning
under uncertainty. We validate the approach in a car driving problem where the
robot has to switch discrete gears and in a box pushing application where the
robot can switch the side of the box to push. The pose and the friction
parameters of the pushed box are initially unknown and only indirectly
observable.

 <dc:description>  Passive Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) systems carry critical
importance for Internet of Things (IoT) applications due to their energy
harvesting capabilities. RFID based position estimation, in particular, is
expected to facilitate a wide array of location based services for IoT
applications with low-power requirements. In this paper, considering monostatic
and bistatic configurations and 3D antenna radiation pattern, we investigate
the accuracy of received signal strength based wireless localization using
passive ultra high frequency (UHF) RFID systems. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound
(CRLB) for the localization accuracy is derived, and is compared with the
accuracy of maximum likelihood estimators for various RFID antenna
configurations. Numerical results show that due to RFID tag/antenna
sensitivity, and the directional antenna pattern, the localization accuracy can
degrade at blind locations that remain outside of the RFID reader antennas'
main beam patterns. In such cases optimizing elevation angle of antennas are
shown to improve localization coverage, while using bistatic configuration
improves localization accuracy significantly.

 <dc:description>  A key requirement for leveraging supervised deep learning methods is the
availability of large, labeled datasets. Unfortunately, in the context of RGB-D
scene understanding, very little data is available -- current datasets cover a
small range of scene views and have limited semantic annotations. To address
this issue, we introduce ScanNet, an RGB-D video dataset containing 2.5M views
in 1513 scenes annotated with 3D camera poses, surface reconstructions, and
semantic segmentations. To collect this data, we designed an easy-to-use and
scalable RGB-D capture system that includes automated surface reconstruction
and crowdsourced semantic annotation. We show that using this data helps
achieve state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding tasks,
including 3D object classification, semantic voxel labeling, and CAD model
retrieval. The dataset is freely available at http://www.scan-net.org.

 <dc:description>  Bin Packing problems have been widely studied because of their broad
applications in different domains. Known as a set of NP-hard problems, they
have different vari- ations and many heuristics have been proposed for
obtaining approximate solutions. Specifically, for the 1D variable sized bin
packing problem, the two key sets of optimization heuristics are the bin
assignment and the bin allocation. Usually the performance of a single static
optimization heuristic can not beat that of a dynamic one which is tailored for
each bin packing instance. Building such an adaptive system requires modeling
the relationship between bin features and packing perform profiles. The primary
drawbacks of traditional AI machine learnings for this task are the natural
limitations of feature engineering, such as the curse of dimensionality and
feature selection quality. We introduce a deep learning approach to overcome
the drawbacks by applying a large training data set, auto feature selection and
fast, accurate labeling. We show in this paper how to build such a system by
both theoretical formulation and engineering practices. Our prediction system
achieves up to 89% training accuracy and 72% validation accuracy to select the
best heuristic that can generate a better quality bin packing solution.

 <dc:description>  Data analytics (such as association rule mining and decision tree mining) can
discover useful statistical knowledge from a big data set. But protecting the
privacy of the data provider and the data user in the process of analytics is a
serious issue. Usually, the privacy of both parties cannot be fully protected
simultaneously by a classical algorithm. In this paper, we present a quantum
protocol for data mining that can much better protect privacy than the known
classical algorithms: (1) if both the data provider and the data user are
honest, the data user can know nothing about the database except the
statistical results, and the data provider can get nearly no information about
the results mined by the data user; (2) if the data user is dishonest and tries
to disclose private information of the other, she/he will be detected with a
high probability; (3) if the data provider tries to disclose the privacy of the
data user, she/he cannot get any useful information since the data user hides
his privacy among noises.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a multi-convex framework for multi-task learning
that improves predictions by learning relationships both between tasks and
between features. Our framework is a generalization of related methods in
multi-task learning, that either learn task relationships, or feature
relationships, but not both. We start with a hierarchical Bayesian model, and
use the empirical Bayes method to transform the underlying inference problem
into a multi-convex optimization problem. We propose a coordinate-wise
minimization algorithm that has a closed form solution for each block
subproblem. Naively these solutions would be expensive to compute, but by using
the theory of doubly stochastic matrices, we are able to reduce the underlying
matrix optimization subproblem into a minimum weight perfect matching problem
on a complete bipartite graph, and solve it analytically and efficiently. To
solve the weight learning subproblem, we propose three different strategies,
including a gradient descent method with linear convergence guarantee when the
instances are not shared by multiple tasks, and a numerical solution based on
Sylvester equation when instances are shared. We demonstrate the efficiency of
our method on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets. Experiments show
that the proposed optimization method is orders of magnitude faster than an
off-the-shelf projected gradient method, and our model is able to exploit the
correlation structures among multiple tasks and features.

 <dc:title>Vertex isoperimetry and independent set stability for tensor powers of
  cliques</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The tensor power of the clique on $t$ vertices (denoted by $K_t^n$) is the
graph on vertex set $\{1, ..., t\}^n$ such that two vertices $x, y \in \{1,
..., t\}^n$ are connected if and only if $x_i \neq y_i$ for all $i \in \{1,
..., n\}$. Let the density of a subset $S$ of $K_t^n$ to be $\mu(S) :=
\frac{|S|}{t^n}$, and let the vertex boundary of a set $S$ to be vertices which
are incident to some vertex of $S$, perhaps including points of $S$. We
investigate two similar problems on such graphs.
  First, we study the vertex isoperimetry problem. Given a density $\nu \in [0,
1]$ what is the smallest possible density of the vertex boundary of a subset of
$K_t^n$ of density $\nu$? Let $\Phi_t(\nu)$ be the infimum of these minimum
densities as $n \to \infty$. We find a recursive relation allows one to compute
$\Phi_t(\nu)$ in time polynomial to the number of desired bits of precision.
  Second, we study given an independent set $I \subseteq K_t^n$ of density
$\mu(I) = \frac{1}{t}(1-\epsilon)$, how close it is to a maximum-sized
independent set $J$ of density $\frac{1}{t}$. We show that this deviation
(measured by $\mu(I \setminus J)$) is at most $4\epsilon^{\frac{\log t}{\log t
- \log(t-1)}}$ as long as $\epsilon &lt; 1 - \frac{3}{t} + \frac{2}{t^2}$. This
substantially improves on results of Alon, Dinur, Friedgut, and Sudakov (2004)
and Ghandehari and Hatami (2008) which had an $O(\epsilon)$ upper bound. We
also show the exponent $\frac{\log t}{\log t - \log(t-1)}$ is optimal assuming
$n$ tending to infinity and $\epsilon$ tending to $0$. The methods have
similarity to recent work by Ellis, Keller, and Lifshitz (2016) in the context
of Kneser graphs and other settings.
  The author hopes that these results have potential applications in hardness
of approximation, particularly in approximate graph coloring and independent
set problems.

 <dc:description>  IMSI Catchers are tracking devices that break the privacy of the subscribers
of mobile access networks, with disruptive effects to both the communication
services and the trust and credibility of mobile network operators. Recently,
we verified that IMSI Catcher attacks are really practical for the
state-of-the-art 4G/LTE mobile systems too. Our IMSI Catcher device acquires
subscription identities (IMSIs) within an area or location within a few seconds
of operation and then denies access of subscribers to the commercial network.
Moreover, we demonstrate that these attack devices can be easily built and
operated using readily available tools and equipment, and without any
programming. We describe our experiments and procedures that are based on
commercially available hardware and unmodified open source software.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents the first \emph{concurrency-optimal} implementation of a
binary search tree (BST). The implementation, based on a standard sequential
implementation of an internal tree, ensures that every \emph{schedule} is
accepted, i.e., interleaving of steps of the sequential code, unless
linearizability is violated. To ensure this property, we use a novel read-write
locking scheme that protects tree \emph{edges} in addition to nodes.
  Our implementation outperforms the state-of-the art BSTs on most basic
workloads, which suggests that optimizing the set of accepted schedules of the
sequential code can be an adequate design principle for efficient concurrent
data structures.

 <dc:description>  We identify the &quot;organization&quot; of a human social group as the communication
network(s) within that group. We then introduce three theoretical approaches to
analyzing what determines the structures of human organizations. All three
approaches adopt a group-selection perspective, so that the group's network
structure is (approximately) optimal, given the information-processing
limitations of agents within the social group, and the exogenous welfare
function of the overall group. In the first approach we use a new sub-field of
telecommunications theory called network coding, and focus on a welfare
function that involves the ability of the organization to convey information
among the agents. In the second approach we focus on a scenario where agents
within the organization must allocate their future communication resources when
the state of the future environment is uncertain. We show how this formulation
can be solved with a linear program. In the third approach, we introduce an
information synthesis problem in which agents within an organization receive
information from various sources and must decide how to transform such
information and transmit the results to other agents in the organization. We
propose leveraging the computational power of neural networks to solve such
problems. These three approaches formalize and synthesize work in fields
including anthropology, archeology, economics and psychology that deal with
organization structure, theory of the firm, span of control and cognitive
limits on communication.

 <dc:title>Learning from Ambiguously Labeled Face Images</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Learning a classifier from ambiguously labeled face images is challenging
since training images are not always explicitly-labeled. For instance, face
images of two persons in a news photo are not explicitly labeled by their names
in the caption. We propose a Matrix Completion for Ambiguity Resolution (MCar)
method for predicting the actual labels from ambiguously labeled images. This
step is followed by learning a standard supervised classifier from the
disambiguated labels to classify new images. To prevent the majority labels
from dominating the result of MCar, we generalize MCar to a weighted MCar
(WMCar) that handles label imbalance. Since WMCar outputs a soft labeling
vector of reduced ambiguity for each instance, we can iteratively refine it by
feeding it as the input to WMCar. Nevertheless, such an iterative
implementation can be affected by the noisy soft labeling vectors, and thus the
performance may degrade. Our proposed Iterative Candidate Elimination (ICE)
procedure makes the iterative ambiguity resolution possible by gradually
eliminating a portion of least likely candidates in ambiguously labeled face.
We further extend MCar to incorporate the labeling constraints between
instances when such prior knowledge is available. Compared to existing methods,
our approach demonstrates improvement on several ambiguously labeled datasets.

 <dc:description>  As one of the fundamental tasks in text analysis, phrase mining aims at
extracting quality phrases from a text corpus. Phrase mining is important in
various tasks such as information extraction/retrieval, taxonomy construction,
and topic modeling. Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic
analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of
new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. Recently, a few
data-driven methods have been developed successfully for extraction of phrases
from massive domain-specific text. However, none of the state-of-the-art models
is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or
labeling phrases.
  Since one can easily obtain many quality phrases from public knowledge bases
to a scale that is much larger than that produced by human experts, in this
paper, we propose a novel framework for automated phrase mining, AutoPhrase,
which leverages this large amount of high-quality phrases in an effective way
and achieves better performance compared to limited human labeled phrases. In
addition, we develop a POS-guided phrasal segmentation model, which
incorporates the shallow syntactic information in part-of-speech (POS) tags to
further enhance the performance, when a POS tagger is available. Note that,
AutoPhrase can support any language as long as a general knowledge base (e.g.,
Wikipedia) in that language is available, while benefiting from, but not
requiring, a POS tagger. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the new
method has shown significant improvements in effectiveness on five real-world
datasets across different domains and languages.

 <dc:description>  Achieving high spectral efficiency in realistic massive multi-user (MU)
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems requires
computationally-complex algorithms for data detection in the uplink (users
transmit to base-station) and beamforming in the downlink (base-station
transmits to users). Most existing algorithms are designed to be executed on
centralized computing hardware at the base-station (BS), which results in
prohibitive complexity for systems with hundreds or thousands of antennas and
generates raw baseband data rates that exceed the limits of current
interconnect technology and chip I/O interfaces. This paper proposes a novel
decentralized baseband processing architecture that alleviates these
bottlenecks by partitioning the BS antenna array into clusters, each associated
with independent radio-frequency chains, analog and digital modulation
circuitry, and computing hardware. For this architecture, we develop novel
decentralized data detection and beamforming algorithms that only access local

clusters. We study the associated trade-offs between error-rate performance,
computational complexity, and interconnect bandwidth, and we demonstrate the
scalability of our solutions for massive MU-MIMO systems with thousands of BS
antennas using reference implementations on a graphic processing unit (GPU)
cluster.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks have been widely used as predictive models to fit data
distribution, and they could be implemented through learning a collection of
samples. In many applications, however, the given dataset may contain noisy
samples or outliers which may result in a poor learner model in terms of
generalization. This paper contributes to a development of robust stochastic
configuration networks (RSCNs) for resolving uncertain data regression
problems. RSCNs are built on original stochastic configuration networks with
weighted least squares method for evaluating the output weights, and the input
weights and biases are incrementally and randomly generated by satisfying with
a set of inequality constrains. The kernel density estimation (KDE) method is
employed to set the penalty weights for each training samples, so that some
negative impacts, caused by noisy data or outliers, on the resulting learner
model can be reduced. The alternating optimization technique is applied for
updating a RSCN model with improved penalty weights computed from the kernel
density estimation function. Performance evaluation is carried out by a
function approximation, four benchmark datasets and a case study on engineering
application. Comparisons to other robust randomised neural modelling
techniques, including the probabilistic robust learning algorithm for neural
networks with random weights and improved RVFL networks, indicate that the
proposed RSCNs with KDE perform favourably and demonstrate good potential for
real-world applications.

 <dc:description>  Nuclear norm minimization (NNM) tends to over-shrink the rank components and
treats the different rank components equally, thus limits its capability and
flexibility. Recent studies have shown that the weighted nuclear norm
minimization (WNNM) is expected to be more accurate than NNM. However, it still
lacks a plausible mathematical explanation why WNNM is more accurate than NNM.
This paper analyzes the WNNM and NNM from the perspective of the group sparse
representation (GSR). In particular, an adaptive dictionary for each group is
designed to connect the rank minimization and GSR models. Then, we prove that
the rank minimization model is equivalent to GSR model. Based on that
conclusion, we show mathematically that WNNM is more accurate than NNM. To make
the proposed model tractable and robust, the alternative direction multiplier
method (ADMM) framework is developed to solve the proposed model. Experimental
results on two low-level vison applications, image deblurring and image
compressive sensing (CS) recovery, demonstrate that the proposed scheme
outperforms many state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and
qualitatively.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of constructing codes that can correct $\delta$
deletions occurring in an arbitrary binary string of length $n$ bits.
Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes can correct all possible single deletions
$(\delta=1)$ with an asymptotically optimal redundancy. Finding similar codes
for $\delta \geq 2$ deletions is an open problem. We propose a new family of
codes, that we call Guess &amp; Check (GC) codes, that can correct, with high
probability, a constant number of deletions $\delta$ occurring at uniformly
random positions within an arbitrary string. The GC codes are based on MDS
codes and have an asymptotically optimal redundancy that is $\Theta(\delta \log
n)$. We provide deterministic polynomial time encoding and decoding schemes for
these codes. We also describe the applications of GC codes to file
synchronization.

 <dc:description>  Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial
transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are
executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart
contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the
blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to
verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners.
  Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's
concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution
appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming
languages have a serial semantics.
  This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute
smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software
transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel,
allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and &quot;discovering&quot; a
serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is
captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to
re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.
  Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of
of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three
concurrent threads.

 <dc:description>  Although deep learning has yielded impressive performance for face
recognition, many studies have shown that different networks learn different
feature maps: while some networks are more receptive to pose and illumination
others appear to capture more local information. Thus, in this work, we propose
a deep heterogeneous feature fusion network to exploit the complementary
information present in features generated by different deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNNs) for template-based face recognition, where a template
refers to a set of still face images or video frames from different sources
which introduces more blur, pose, illumination and other variations than
traditional face datasets. The proposed approach efficiently fuses the
discriminative information of different deep features by 1) jointly learning
the non-linear high-dimensional projection of the deep features and 2)
generating a more discriminative template representation which preserves the
inherent geometry of the deep features in the feature space. Experimental
results on the IARPA Janus Challenge Set 3 (Janus CS3) dataset demonstrate that
the proposed method can effectively improve the recognition performance. In
addition, we also present a series of covariate experiments on the face
verification task for in-depth qualitative evaluations for the proposed
approach.

 <dc:description>  Both GPS and WiFi based localization have been exploited in recent years, yet
most researches focus on localizing at home without environment context.
Besides, the near home or workplace area is complex and has little attention in
smart home or IOT. Therefore, after exploring the realistic route in and out of
building, we conducted a time localization system (TLS) based on off-the-shelf
smart phones with WiFi identification. TLS can identify the received signal
strength indication (RSSI) of home and construct radio map of users' time route
without site survey. As designed to service the smart devices in home, TLS
applies the time interval as the distance of positions and as the variables of
WiFi environment to mark time points. Experimental results with real users show
that TLS as a service system for timeline localization achieves a median
accuracy of 70 seconds and is more robust compared with nearest neighbor
localization approach.

 <dc:title>Leveraging cloud based big data analytics in knowledge management for

 <dc:description>  In recent past, big data opportunities have gained much momentum to enhance
knowledge management in organizations. However, big data due to its various
properties like high volume, variety, and velocity can no longer be effectively
stored and analyzed with traditional data management techniques to generate
values for knowledge development. Hence, new technologies and architectures are
required to store and analyze this big data through advanced data analytics and
in turn generate vital real-time knowledge for effective decision making by
organizations. More specifically, it is necessary to have a single
infrastructure which provides common functionality of knowledge management, and
flexible enough to handle different types of big data and big data analysis
tasks. Cloud computing infrastructures capable of storing and processing large
volume of data can be used for efficient big data processing because it
minimizes the initial cost for the large-scale computing infrastructure
demanded by big data analytics. This paper aims to explore the impact of big
data analytics on knowledge management and proposes a cloud-based conceptual
framework that can analyze big data in real time to facilitate enhanced
decision making intended for competitive advantage. Thus, this framework will
pave the way for organizations to explore the relationship between big data
analytics and knowledge management which are mostly deemed as two distinct
entities.

 <dc:description>  Recognizing dynamic scenes is one of the fundamental problems in scene
understanding, which categorizes moving scenes such as a forest fire,
landslide, or avalanche. While existing methods focus on reliable capturing of
static and dynamic information, few works have explored frame selection from a
dynamic scene sequence. In this paper, we propose dynamic scene recognition
using a deep dual descriptor based on `key frames' and `key segments.' Key
frames that reflect the feature distribution of the sequence with a small
number are used for capturing salient static appearances. Key segments, which
are captured from the area around each key frame, provide an additional
discriminative power by dynamic patterns within short time intervals. To this
end, two types of transferred convolutional neural network features are used in
our approach. A fully connected layer is used to select the key frames and key
segments, while the convolutional layer is used to describe them. We conducted
experiments using public datasets as well as a new dataset comprised of 23
dynamic scene classes with 10 videos per class. The evaluation results
demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Recent studies have shown effectiveness in using neural networks for Chinese
word segmentation. However, these models rely on large-scale data and are less
effective for low-resource datasets because of insufficient training data. We
propose a transfer learning method to improve low-resource word segmentation by
leveraging high-resource corpora. First, we train a teacher model on
high-resource corpora and then use the learned knowledge to initialize a
student model. Second, a weighted data similarity method is proposed to train
the student model on low-resource data. Experiment results show that our work
significantly improves the performance on low-resource datasets: 2.3% and 1.5%
F-score on PKU and CTB datasets. Furthermore, this paper achieves
state-of-the-art results: 96.1%, and 96.2% F-score on PKU and CTB datasets.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mm-wave) communications is considered a promising technology
for 5G networks. Exploiting beamforming gains with large-scale antenna arrays
to combat the increased path loss at mm-wave bands is one of its defining
features. However, previous works on mm-wave network analysis usually adopted
oversimplified antenna patterns for tractability, which can lead to significant
deviation from the performance with actual antenna patterns. In this paper,
using tools from stochastic geometry, we carry out a comprehensive
investigation on the impact of directional antenna arrays in mm-wave networks.
We first present a general and tractable framework for coverage analysis with
arbitrary distributions for interference power and arbitrary antenna patterns.
It is then applied to mm-wave ad hoc and cellular networks, where two
sophisticated antenna patterns with desirable accuracy and analytical
tractability are proposed to approximate the actual antenna pattern. Compared
with previous works, the proposed approximate antenna patterns help to obtain
more insights on the role of directional antenna arrays in mm-wave networks. In
particular, it is shown that the coverage probabilities of both types of
networks increase as a non-decreasing concave function with the antenna array
size. The analytical results are verified to be effective and reliable through
simulations, and numerical results also show that large-scale antenna arrays
are required for satisfactory coverage in mm-wave networks.

  Owing to the growing complexity of software and its increasing diffusion into
various application domains, it is no longer unusual for a software project to
have testing teams in more than one location or even distributed over many
continents. Owing to the intertwined dependencies of many software development
activities and their geographical and temporal issues, there are potentially
many overlapping test cases which can cause unwarranted redundancies across the
shared modules (i.e. a test for one requirement may be covered by more than one
test).
  In this paper, we explore the application of our newly developed
hyperheuristic, called Fuzzy Inference Selection (FIS), for addressing test
redundancy reduction problem. This paper presents the supplementary results for
the paper : An Experimental Study of Hyper-Heuristic Selection and Acceptance
Mechanism for Combinatorial t way Test Suite Generation published in

 <dc:title>A Dependency-Based Neural Reordering Model for Statistical Machine
  Translation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In machine translation (MT) that involves translating between two languages
with significant differences in word order, determining the correct word order
of translated words is a major challenge. The dependency parse tree of a source
sentence can help to determine the correct word order of the translated words.
In this paper, we present a novel reordering approach utilizing a neural
network and dependency-based embeddings to predict whether the translations of
two source words linked by a dependency relation should remain in the same
order or should be swapped in the translated sentence. Experiments on
Chinese-to-English translation show that our approach yields a statistically
significant improvement of 0.57 BLEU point on benchmark NIST test sets,
compared to our prior state-of-the-art statistical MT system that uses sparse
dependency-based reordering features.

 <dc:description>  Convective storm nowcasting has attracted substantial attention in various
fields. Existing methods under a deep learning framework rely primarily on
radar data. Although they perform nowcast storm advection well, it is still
challenging to nowcast storm initiation and growth, due to the limitations of
the radar observations. This paper describes the first attempt to nowcast storm
initiation, growth, and advection simultaneously under a deep learning
framework using multi-source meteorological data. To this end, we present a
multi-channel 3D-cube successive convolution network (3D-SCN). As real-time
re-analysis meteorological data can now provide valuable atmospheric boundary
layer thermal dynamic information, which is essential to predict storm
initiation and growth, both raw 3D radar and re-analysis data are used directly
without any handcraft feature engineering. These data are formulated as
multi-channel 3D cubes, to be fed into our network, which are convolved by
cross-channel 3D convolutions. By stacking successive convolutional layers
without pooling, we build an end-to-end trainable model for nowcasting.
Experimental results show that deep learning methods achieve better performance
than traditional extrapolation methods. The qualitative analyses of 3D-SCN show
encouraging results of nowcasting of storm initiation, growth, and advection.

 <dc:description>  Neural language models predict the next token using a latent representation
of the immediate token history. Recently, various methods for augmenting neural
language models with an attention mechanism over a differentiable memory have
been proposed. For predicting the next token, these models query information
from a memory of the recent history which can facilitate learning mid- and
long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention mechanisms used in
memory-augmented neural language models produce a single output vector per time
step. This vector is used both for predicting the next token as well as for the
key and value of a differentiable memory of a token history. In this paper, we
propose a neural language model with a key-value attention mechanism that
outputs separate representations for the key and value of a differentiable
memory, as well as for encoding the next-word distribution. This model
outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora.
Yet, we found that our method mainly utilizes a memory of the five most recent
output representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much
simpler model based only on the concatenation of recent output representations
from previous time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented
neural language models.

 <dc:title>GDSP: A Graphical Perspective on the Distributed Storage Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sahraei, Saeid</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Gastpar, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The classical distributed storage problem can be modeled by a k-uniform {\it
complete} hyper-graph where vertices represent servers and hyper-edges
represent users. Hence each hyper-edge should be able to recover the full file
using only the memories of the vertices associated with it. This paper
considers the generalization of this problem to {\it arbitrary} hyper-graphs
and to the case of multiple files, where each user is only interested in one, a
problem we will refer to as the graphical distributed storage problem (GDSP).
Specifically, we make progress in the analysis of minimum-storage codes for two
main subproblems of the GDSP which extend the classical model in two
independent directions: the case of an arbitrary graph with multiple files, and
the case of an arbitrary hyper-graph with a single file.

 <dc:description>  Accurate and reliable brain tumor segmentation is a critical component in
cancer diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment outcome evaluation. Build
upon successful deep learning techniques, a novel brain tumor segmentation
method is developed by integrating fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs)
and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) in a unified framework to obtain
segmentation results with appearance and spatial consistency. We train a deep
learning based segmentation model using 2D image patches and image slices in
following steps: 1) training FCNNs using image patches; 2) training CRFs as
Recurrent Neural Networks (CRF-RNN) using image slices with parameters of FCNNs
fixed; and 3) fine-tuning the FCNNs and the CRF-RNN using image slices.
Particularly, we train 3 segmentation models using 2D image patches and slices
obtained in axial, coronal and sagittal views respectively, and combine them to
segment brain tumors using a voting based fusion strategy. Our method could
segment brain images slice-by-slice, much faster than those based on image
patches. We have evaluated our method based on imaging data provided by the
Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Challenge (BRATS) 2013, BRATS 2015
and BRATS 2016. The experimental results have demonstrated that our method
could build a segmentation model with Flair, T1c, and T2 scans and achieve
competitive performance as those built with Flair, T1, T1c, and T2 scans.

 <dc:description>  We present a simple deterministic single-pass $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the maximum weight matching problem in the semi-streaming model.
This improves upon the currently best known approximation ratio of
$(3.5+\epsilon)$.
  Our algorithm uses $O(n\log^2 n)$ space for constant values of $\epsilon$. It
relies on a variation of the local-ratio theorem, which may be of use for other
algorithms in the semi-streaming model as well.

 <dc:description>  Human-machine networks affect many aspects of our lives: from sharing
experiences with family and friends, knowledge creation and distance learning,
and managing utility bills or providing feedback on retail items, to more
specialised networks providing decision support to human operators and the
delivery of health care via a network of clinicians, family, friends, and both
physical and virtual social robots. Such networks rely on increasingly
sophisticated machine algorithms, e.g., to recommend friends or purchases, to
track our online activities in order to optimise the services available, and
assessing risk to help maintain or even enhance people's health. Users are
being offered ever increasing power and reach through these networks by
machines which have to support and allow users to be able to achieve goals such
as maintaining contact, making better decisions, and monitoring their health.
As such, this comes down to a synergy between human and machine agency in which
one is dependent in complex ways on the other. With that agency questions arise
about trust, risk and regulation, as well as social influence and potential for
computer-mediated self-efficacy. In this paper, we explore these constructs and
their relationships and present a model based on review of the literature which
seeks to identify the various dependencies between them.

 <dc:title>A core-set approach for distributed quadratic programming in big-data

 <dc:creator>Notarstefano, Giuseppe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A new challenge for learning algorithms in cyber-physical network systems is
the distributed solution of big-data classification problems, i.e., problems in
which both the number of training samples and their dimension is high.
Motivated by several problem set-ups in Machine Learning, in this paper we
consider a special class of quadratic optimization problems involving a &quot;large&quot;
number of input data, whose dimension is &quot;big&quot;. To solve these quadratic
optimization problems over peer-to-peer networks, we propose an asynchronous,
distributed algorithm that scales with both the number and the dimension of the
input data (training samples in the classification problem). The proposed
distributed optimization algorithm relies on the notion of &quot;core-set&quot; which is
used in geometric optimization to approximate the value function associated to
a given set of points with a smaller subset of points. By computing local
core-sets on a smaller version of the global problem and exchanging them with
neighbors, the nodes reach consensus on a set of active constraints
representing an approximate solution for the global quadratic program.

 <dc:description>  Spatially coupled codes have been shown to universally achieve the capacity
for a large class of channels. Many variants of such codes have been introduced
to date. We discuss a further such variant that is particularly simple and is
determined by a very small number of parameters. More precisely, we consider
time-invariant low-density convolutional codes with very large constraint
lengths.
  We show via simulations that, despite their extreme simplicity, such codes
still show the threshold saturation behavior known from the spatially coupled
codes discussed in the literature. Further, we show how the size of the typical
minimum stopping set is related to basic parameters of the code. Due to their
simplicity and good performance, these codes might be attractive from an
implementation perspective.

 <dc:description>  The definition is a common form of human expert knowledge, a building block
of formal science and mathematics, a foundation for database theory and is
supported in various forms in many knowledge representation and formal
specification languages and systems. This paper is a formal study of some of
the most common forms of inductive definitions found in scientific text:
monotone inductive definition, definition by induction over a well-founded
order and iterated inductive definitions. We define a logic of definitions
offering a uniform formal syntax to express definitions of the different sorts,
and we define its semantics by a faithful formalization of the induction
process. Several fundamental properties of definition by induction emerge: the
non-determinism of the induction process, the confluence of induction
processes, the role of the induction order and its relation to the inductive
rules, how the induction order constrains the induction process and,
ultimately, that the induction order is irrelevant: the defined set does not
depend on the induction order. We propose an inductive construction capable of
constructing the defined set without using the induction order. We investigate
borderline definitions of the sort that appears in definitional paradoxes.

 <dc:title>Normalized Total Gradient: A New Measure for Multispectral Image
  Registration</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Shu-Jie</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shen, Hui-Liang</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Image registration is a fundamental issue in multispectral image processing.
In filter wheel based multispectral imaging systems, the non-coplanar placement
of the filters always causes the misalignment of multiple channel images. The
selective characteristic of spectral response in multispectral imaging raises
two challenges to image registration. First, the intensity levels of a local
region may be different in individual channel images. Second, the local
intensity may vary rapidly in some channel images while keeps stationary in
others. Conventional multimodal measures, such as mutual information,
correlation coefficient, and correlation ratio, can register images with
different regional intensity levels, but will fail in the circumstance of
severe local intensity variation. In this paper, a new measure, namely
normalized total gradient (NTG), is proposed for multispectral image
registration. The NTG is applied on the difference between two channel images.
This measure is based on the key assumption (observation) that the gradient of
difference image between two aligned channel images is sparser than that
between two misaligned ones. A registration framework, which incorporates image
pyramid and global/local optimization, is further introduced for rigid
transform. Experimental results validate that the proposed method is effective
for multispectral image registration and performs better than conventional
methods.

 <dc:description>  We consider a basic caching system, where a single server with a database of
$N$ files (e.g. movies) is connected to a set of $K$ users through a shared
bottleneck link. Each user has a local cache memory with a size of $M$ files.
The system operates in two phases: a placement phase, where each cache memory
is populated up to its size from the database, and a following delivery phase,
where each user requests a file from the database, and the server is
responsible for delivering the requested contents. The objective is to design
the two phases to minimize the load (peak or average) of the bottleneck link.
We characterize the rate-memory tradeoff of the above caching system within a
factor of $2.00884$ for both the peak rate and the average rate (under uniform
file popularity), where the best proved characterization in the current
literature gives a factor of $4$ and $4.7$ respectively. Moreover, in the
practically important case where the number of files ($N$) is large, we exactly
characterize the tradeoff for systems with no more than $5$ users, and
characterize the tradeoff within a factor of $2$ otherwise. We establish these
results by developing novel information theoretic outer-bounds for the caching
problem, which improves the state of the art and gives tight characterization
in various cases.

 <dc:description>  Mobile crowdsensing has emerged as an efficient sensing paradigm which
combines the crowd intelligence and the sensing power of mobile devices,
e.g.,~mobile phones and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. This article
addresses the contradicting incentives of privacy preservation by crowdsensing
users and accuracy maximization and collection of true data by service
providers. We firstly define the individual contributions of crowdsensing users
based on the accuracy in data analytics achieved by the service provider from
buying their data. We then propose a truthful mechanism for achieving high
service accuracy while protecting the privacy based on the user preferences.
The users are incentivized to provide true data by being paid based on their
individual contribution to the overall service accuracy. Moreover, we propose a
coalition strategy which allows users to cooperate in providing their data
under one identity, increasing their anonymity privacy protection, and sharing
the resulting payoff. Finally, we outline important open research directions in
mobile and people-centric crowdsensing.

 <dc:description>  Densifying the network and deploying more antennas at each access point are
two principal ways to boost the capacity of wireless networks. However, due to
the complicated distributions of random signal and interference channel gains,
largely induced by various space-time processing techniques, it is highly
challenging to quantitatively characterize the performance of dense
multi-antenna networks. In this paper, using tools from stochastic geometry, a
tractable framework is proposed for the analytical evaluation of such networks.
The major result is an innovative representation of the coverage probability,
as an induced $\ell_1$-norm of a Toeplitz matrix. This compact representation
incorporates lots of existing analytical results on single- and multi-antenna
networks as special cases, and its evaluation is almost as simple as the
single-antenna case with Rayleigh fading. To illustrate its effectiveness, we
apply the proposed framework to investigate two kinds of prevalent dense
wireless networks, i.e., physical layer security aware networks and
millimeter-wave networks. In both examples, in addition to tractable analytical
results of relevant performance metrics, insightful design guidelines are also
analytically obtained.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the validity of Kleinberg's axioms for clustering
functions with respect to the quite popular clustering algorithm called
$k$-means. While Kleinberg's axioms have been discussed heavily in the past, we
concentrate here on the case predominantly relevant for $k$-means algorithm,
that is behavior embedded in Euclidean space. We point at some contradictions
and counter intuitiveness aspects of this axiomatic set within $\mathbb{R}^m$
that were evidently not discussed so far. Our results suggest that apparently
without defining clearly what kind of clusters we expect we will not be able to
construct a valid axiomatic system. In particular we look at the shape and the
gaps between the clusters. Finally we demonstrate that there exist several ways
to reconcile the formulation of the axioms with their intended meaning and that
under this reformulation the axioms stop to be contradictory and the real-world
$k$-means algorithm conforms to this axiomatic system.

 <dc:description>  Maximum rank-distance (MRD) codes are extremal codes in the space of $m\times
n$ matrices over a finite field, equipped with the rank metric. Up to
generalizations, the classical examples of such codes were constructed in the
1970s and are today known as Gabidulin codes. Motivated by several recent
approaches to construct MRD codes that are inequivalent to Gabidulin codes, we
study the equivalence issue for Gabidulin codes themselves. This shows in
particular that the family of Gabidulin codes already contains a huge subset of
MRD codes that are pairwise inequivalent, provided that $2\le m\le n-2$.

 <dc:description>  The research was proposed to exploit and extend the relational and contextual
nature of the information assets of the Catasto Gregoriano, kept at the
Archivio di Stato in Rome. Developed within the MODEUS project (Making Open
Data Effectively Usable), this study originates from the following key ideas of
MODEUS: to require Open Data to be expressed in terms of an ontology, and to
include such an ontology as a documentation of the data themselves. Thus, Open
Data are naturally linked by means of the ontology, which meets the
requirements of the Linked Open Data vision.

 <dc:title>Deep Multi-camera People Detection</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of multi-view people occupancy map
estimation. Existing solutions for this problem either operate per-view, or
rely on a background subtraction pre-processing. Both approaches lessen the
detection performance as scenes become more crowded. The former does not
exploit joint information, whereas the latter deals with ambiguous input due to
the foreground blobs becoming more and more interconnected as the number of
targets increases.
  Although deep learning algorithms have proven to excel on remarkably numerous
computer vision tasks, such a method has not been applied yet to this problem.
In large part this is due to the lack of large-scale multi-camera data-set.
  The core of our method is an architecture which makes use of monocular
pedestrian data-set, available at larger scale then the multi-view ones,
applies parallel processing to the multiple video streams, and jointly utilises
it. Our end-to-end deep learning method outperforms existing methods by large
margins on the commonly used PETS 2009 data-set. Furthermore, we make publicly
available a new three-camera HD data-set. Our source code and trained models
will be made available under an open-source license.

 <dc:description>  The Minimum Weight Dominating Set (MWDS) problem is an important
generalization of the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) problem with extensive
applications. This paper proposes a new local search algorithm for the MWDS
problem, which is based on two new ideas. The first idea is a heuristic called
two-level configuration checking (CC2), which is a new variant of a recent
powerful configuration checking strategy (CC) for effectively avoiding the
recent search paths. The second idea is a novel scoring function based on the
frequency of being uncovered of vertices. Our algorithm is called CC2FS,
according to the names of the two ideas. The experimental results show that,
CC2FS performs much better than some state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of
solution quality on a broad range of MWDS benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  This article presents the prediction difference analysis method for
visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input. When
classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that
provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several
shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the
decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions
interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to
accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as
medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet
data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans).

 <dc:description>  In the last years renewed investigation of operator precedence languages
(OPL) led to discover important properties thereof: OPL are closed with respect
to all major operations, are characterized, besides the original grammar
family, in terms of an automata family and an MSO logic; furthermore they
significantly generalize the well-known visibly pushdown languages (VPL). In
another area of research, quantitative models of systems are also greatly in
demand. In this paper, we lay the foundation to marry these two research
fields. We introduce weighted operator precedence automata and show how they
are both strict extensions of OPA and weighted visibly pushdown automata. We
prove a Nivat-like result which shows that quantitative OPL can be described by
unweighted OPA and very particular weighted OPA. In a B\&quot;uchi-like theorem, we
show that weighted OPA are expressively equivalent to a weighted MSO-logic for
OPL.

 <dc:description>  Convolution is a ubiquitous operation in mathematics and computing. The
Kripke semantics for substructural and interval logics motivates its study for
quantale-valued functions relative to ternary relations. The resulting notion
of relational convolution leads to generalised binary and unary modal operators
for qualitative and quantitative models, and to more conventional variants,
when ternary relations arise from identities over partial semigroups.
Convolution-based semantics for fragments of categorial, linear and incidence
(segment or interval) logics are provided as qualitative applications.
Quantitative examples include algebras of durations and mean values in the
duration calculus.

suggested mark allows to evaluate not only the popularity of the author, as it
can be done by means of calculating the general citation number or by the
Hirsch index, which is often used to measure the author's research rate. The
index gives an opportunity to estimate the author's popularity, his/her
influence within the sought-after area &quot;knowledge area&quot; in the Internet - in
the Wikipedia. The suggested index is supposed to be calculated in frames of
the subject domain, and it, on the one hand, avoids the mistaken computation of
the homonyms, and on the other hand - provides the entirety of the subject
area. There are proposed algorithms and the technique of the Wikipedia Index

 <dc:title>Automated Identification of Drug-Drug Interactions in Pediatric
  Congestive Heart Failure Patients</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Miller, Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Congestive Heart Failure, or CHF, is a serious medical condition that can
result in fluid buildup in the body as a result of a weak heart. When the heart
can't pump enough blood to efficiently deliver nutrients and oxygen to the
body, kidney function may be impaired, resulting in fluid retention. CHF
patients require a broad drug regimen to maintain the delicate system balance,
particularly between their heart and kidneys. These drugs include ACE
inhibitors and Beta Blockers to control blood pressure, anticoagulants to
prevent blood clots, and diuretics to reduce fluid overload. Many of these
drugs may interact, and potential effects of these interactions must be weighed
against their benefits. For this project, we consider a set of 44 drugs
identified as specifically relevant for treating CHF by pediatric cardiologists
at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. This list was generated as part of our
current work at the LPCH Heart Center. The goal of this project is to identify
and evaluate potentially harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs) within pediatric
patients with Congestive Heart Failure. This identification will be done
autonomously, so that it may continuously update by evaluating newly published
literature.

 <dc:description>  In modern machine learning, pattern recognition replaces realtime semantic
reasoning. The mapping from input to output is learned with fixed semantics by
training outcomes deliberately. This is an expensive and static approach which
depends heavily on the availability of a very particular kind of prior raining
data to make inferences in a single step. Conventional semantic network
approaches, on the other hand, base multi-step reasoning on modal logics and
handcrafted ontologies, which are ad hoc, expensive to construct, and fragile
to inconsistency. Both approaches may be enhanced by a hybrid approach, which
completely separates reasoning from pattern recognition. In this report, a
quasi-linguistic approach to knowledge representation is discussed, motivated
by spacetime structure. Tokenized patterns from diverse sources are integrated
to build a lightly constrained and approximately scale-free network. This is
then be parsed with very simple recursive algorithms to generate
`brainstorming' sets of reasoned knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Point clouds arising from structured data, mainly as a result of CT scans,
provides special properties on the distribution of points and the distances
between those. Yet often, the amount of data provided can not compare to
unstructured point clouds, i.e. data that arises from 3D light scans or laser
scans. This article hereby proposes an approach to extend structured data and
enhance the quality by inserting selected points from an unstructured point
cloud. The resulting point cloud still has a partial structure that is called
&quot;half-structure&quot;. In this way, missing data that can not be optimally recovered
through other surface reconstruction methods can be completed.

 <dc:description>  Groups of Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) back each other and form
guarantee network to obtain loan from banks. The risk over the networked
enterprises may cause significant contagious damage. To dissolve such risks, we
propose a hybrid feature representation, which is feeded into a gradient
boosting model for credit risk assessment of guarantee network. Empirical study
is performed on a ten-year guarantee loan record from commercial banks. We find
that often hundreds or thousands of enterprises back each other and constitute
a sparse complex network. We study the risk of various structures of loan
guarantee network, and observe the high correlation between defaults with
centrality, and with the communities of the network. In particular, our
quantitative risk evaluation model shows promising prediction performance on
real-world data, which can be useful to both regulators and stakeholders.

 <dc:description>  Community detection in networks is a very actual and important field of
research with applications in many areas. But, given that the amount of
processed data increases more and more, existing algorithms need to be adapted
for very large graphs. The objective of this project was to parallelise the
Synchronised Louvain Method, a community detection algorithm developed by
Arnaud Browet, in order to improve its performances in terms of computation
time and thus be able to faster detect communities in very large graphs. To
reach this goal, we used the API OpenMP to parallelise the algorithm and then
carried out performance tests. We studied the computation time and speedup of
the parallelised algorithm and were able to bring out some qualitative trends.
We obtained a great speedup, compared with the theoretical prediction of Amdahl
law. To conclude, using the parallel implementation of the algorithm of Browet
on large graphs seems to give good results, both in terms of computation time
and speedup. Further tests should be carried out in order to obtain more
quantitative results.

 <dc:description>  We consider the general problem of modeling temporal data with long-range
dependencies, wherein new observations are fully or partially predictable based
on temporally-distant, past observations. A sufficiently powerful temporal
model should separate predictable elements of the sequence from unpredictable
elements, express uncertainty about those unpredictable elements, and rapidly
identify novel elements that may help to predict the future. To create such
models, we introduce Generative Temporal Models augmented with external memory
systems. They are developed within the variational inference framework, which
provides both a practical training methodology and methods to gain insight into
the models' operation. We show, on a range of problems with sparse, long-term
temporal dependencies, that these models store information from early in a
sequence, and reuse this stored information efficiently. This allows them to
perform substantially better than existing models based on well-known recurrent
neural networks, like LSTMs.

 <dc:title>Towards M-Adhesive Categories based on Coalgebras and Comma Categories</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Padberg, Julia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this contribution we investigate several extensions of the powerset that
comprise arbitrarily nested subsets, and call them superpower set. This allows
the definition of graphs with possibly infinitely nested nodes. additionally we
define edges that are incident to edges. Since we use coalgebraic constructions
we refer to these graphs as corecursive graphs. The superpower set functors are
examined and then used for the definition of $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive categories
which are the basic categories for $\mathcal{M}$-adhesive transformation
systems. So, we additionally show that coalgebras $\mathbf{Sets}_F$ are
$\mathcal{M}$-adhesive categories provided the functor $F:\mathbf{Sets}_F \to
\mathbf{Sets}_F$ preserves pullbacks along monomorphisms.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper provides an overview of research programs in cyber security
performed by the U.S Army Research Laboratory. Although ARL is the U.S. Army's
corporate laboratory that focuses on fundamental and early applied research,
the fundamental science endeavors are closely integrated with extensive
operationally-oriented programs. One example is the Cyber Collaborative
Research Alliance (CRA) that brings together ARL scientists with academic
researchers from dozens of U.S. universities. ARL cyber scientists are largely
driven by challenges unique to the ground operations of the Army; this paper
outlines a few of these challenges and the ways in which they are addressed by
ARL research efforts. The long-term campaign of cyber research is guided by the
vision of the future Army battlefield. In the year 2040, it will be a highly
converged virtual-physical space, where cyber operations will be an integral
part of the battle.

 <dc:description>  Achieving optimal program performance requires deep insight into the
interaction between hardware and software. For software developers without an
in-depth background in computer architecture, understanding and fully utilizing
modern architectures is close to impossible. Analytic loop performance modeling
is a useful way to understand the relevant bottlenecks of code execution based
on simple machine models. The Roofline Model and the Execution-Cache-Memory
(ECM) model are proven approaches to performance modeling of loop nests. In
comparison to the Roofline model, the ECM model can also describes the
single-core performance and saturation behavior on a multicore chip. We give an
introduction to the Roofline and ECM models, and to stencil performance
modeling using layer conditions (LC). We then present Kerncraft, a tool that
can automatically construct Roofline and ECM models for loop nests by
performing the required code, data transfer, and LC analysis. The layer
condition analysis allows to predict optimal spatial blocking factors for loop
nests. Together with the models it enables an ab-initio estimate of the
potential benefits of loop blocking optimizations and of useful block sizes. In
cases where LC analysis is not easily possible, Kerncraft supports a cache
simulator as a fallback option. Using a 25-point long-range stencil we
demonstrate the usefulness and predictive power of the Kerncraft tool.

 <dc:description>  How people look at visual information reveals fundamental information about
themselves, their interests and their state of mind. While previous visual
attention models output static 2-dimensional saliency maps, saccadic models aim
to predict not only where observers look at but also how they move their eyes
to explore the scene. Here we demonstrate that saccadic models are a flexible
framework that can be tailored to emulate observer's viewing tendencies. More
specifically, we use the eye data from 101 observers split in 5 age groups
(adults, 8-10 y.o., 6-8 y.o., 4-6 y.o. and 2 y.o.) to train our saccadic model
for different stages of the development of the human visual system. We show
that the joint distribution of saccade amplitude and orientation is a visual
signature specific to each age group, and can be used to generate age-dependent
scanpaths. Our age-dependent saccadic model not only outputs human-like,
age-specific visual scanpath, but also significantly outperforms other
state-of-the-art saliency models. In this paper, we demonstrate that the
computational modelling of visual attention, through the use of saccadic model,
can be efficiently adapted to emulate the gaze behavior of a specific group of
observers.

 <dc:description>  Handwritten character recognition is an active area of research with
applications in numerous fields. Past and recent works in this field have
concentrated on various languages. Arabic is one language where the scope of
research is still widespread, with it being one of the most popular languages
in the world and being syntactically different from other major languages. Das
et al. \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-1891} has pioneered the research for
handwritten digit recognition in Arabic. In this paper, we propose a novel
algorithm based on deep learning neural networks using appropriate activation
function and regularization layer, which shows significantly improved accuracy
compared to the existing Arabic numeral recognition methods. The proposed model
gives 97.4 percent accuracy, which is the recorded highest accuracy of the
dataset used in the experiment. We also propose a modification of the method
described in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-1891}, where our method scores
identical accuracy as that of \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1003-1891}, with the
value of 93.8 percent.

 <dc:description>  Quantised random embeddings are an efficient dimensionality reduction
technique which preserves the distances of low-complexity signals up to some
controllable additive and multiplicative distortions. In this work, we instead
focus on verifying when this technique preserves the separability of two
disjoint closed convex sets, i.e., in a quantised view of the &quot;rare eclipse
problem&quot; introduced by Bandeira et al. in 2014. This separability would ensure
exact classification of signals in such sets from the signatures output by this
non-linear dimensionality reduction. We here present a result relating the
embedding's dimension, its quantiser resolution and the sets' separation, as
well as some numerically testable conditions to illustrate it. Experimental
evidence is then provided in the special case of two $\ell_2$-balls, tracing
the phase transition curves that ensure these sets' separability in the
embedded domain.

 <dc:title>The complexity of Boolean surjective general-valued CSPs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) are discrete optimisation
problems with a $(\mathbb{Q}\cup\{\infty\})$-valued objective function given as
a sum of fixed-arity functions. In Boolean surjective VCSPs, variables take on
labels from $D=\{0,1\}$ and an optimal assignment is required to use both
labels from $D$. Examples include the classical global Min-Cut problem in
graphs and the Minimum Distance problem studied in coding theory.
  We establish a dichotomy theorem and thus give a complete complexity
classification of Boolean surjective VCSPs with respect to exact solvability.
Our work generalises the dichotomy for $\{0,\infty\}$-valued constraint
languages (corresponding to decision CSPs) obtained by Creignou and H\'ebrard.
For the maximisation problem of $\mathbb{Q}_{\geq 0}$-valued surjective VCSPs,
we also establish a dichotomy theorem with respect to approximability.
  Unlike in the case of Boolean surjective CSPs, there appears a novel
tractable class of languages that is trivial in the non-surjective setting.
This newly discovered tractable class has an interesting mathematical structure
related to downsets and upsets. Our main contribution is identifying this class
and proving that it lies on the borderline of tractability. A crucial part of
our proof is a polynomial-time algorithm for enumerating all near-optimal
solutions to a generalised Min-Cut problem, which might be of independent
interest.

 <dc:description>  Over the past three years Pinterest has experimented with several visual
search and recommendation services, including Related Pins (2014), Similar
Looks (2015), Flashlight (2016) and Lens (2017). This paper presents an
overview of our visual discovery engine powering these services, and shares the
rationales behind our technical and product decisions such as the use of object
detection and interactive user interfaces. We conclude that this visual
discovery engine significantly improves engagement in both search and
recommendation tasks.

 <dc:description>  A large portion of data mining and analytic services use modern machine
learning techniques, such as deep learning. The state-of-the-art results by
deep learning come at the price of an intensive use of computing resources. The
leading frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow) are executed on GPUs or on high-end
servers in datacenters. On the other end, there is a proliferation of personal
devices with possibly free CPU cycles; this can enable services to run in
users' homes, embedding machine learning operations. In this paper, we ask the
following question: Is distributed deep learning computation on WAN connected
devices feasible, in spite of the traffic caused by learning tasks? We show
that such a setup rises some important challenges, most notably the ingress
traffic that the servers hosting the up-to-date model have to sustain.
  In order to reduce this stress, we propose adaComp, a novel algorithm for
compressing worker updates to the model on the server. Applicable to stochastic
gradient descent based approaches, it combines efficient gradient selection and
learning rate modulation. We then experiment and measure the impact of
compression, device heterogeneity and reliability on the accuracy of learned
models, with an emulator platform that embeds TensorFlow into Linux containers.
We report a reduction of the total amount of data sent by workers to the server
by two order of magnitude (e.g., 191-fold reduction for a convolutional network
on the MNIST dataset), when compared to a standard asynchronous stochastic
gradient descent, while preserving model accuracy.

 <dc:title>Nearest Labelset Using Double Distances for Multi-label Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Multi-label classification is a type of supervised learning where an instance
may belong to multiple labels simultaneously. Predicting each label
independently has been criticized for not exploiting any correlation between
labels. In this paper we propose a novel approach, Nearest Labelset using
Double Distances (NLDD), that predicts the labelset observed in the training
data that minimizes a weighted sum of the distances in both the feature space
and the label space to the new instance. The weights specify the relative
tradeoff between the two distances. The weights are estimated from a binomial
regression of the number of misclassified labels as a function of the two
distances. Model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. NLDD only
considers labelsets observed in the training data, thus implicitly taking into
account label dependencies. Experiments on benchmark multi-label data sets show
that the proposed method on average outperforms other well-known approaches in
terms of Hamming loss, 0/1 loss, and multi-label accuracy and ranks second
after ECC on the F-measure.

 <dc:description>  We review the concept of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and discuss examples
of their use in a number of scenarios. Several SVM implementations have been
used in HEP and we exemplify this algorithm using the Toolkit for Multivariate
Analysis (TMVA) implementation. We discuss examples relevant to HEP including
background suppression for $H\to\tau^+\tau^-$ at the LHC with several different
kernel functions. Performance benchmarking leads to the issue of generalisation
of hyper-parameter selection. The avoidance of fine tuning (over training or
over fitting) in MVA hyper-parameter optimisation, i.e. the ability to ensure
generalised performance of an MVA that is independent of the training,
validation and test samples, is of utmost importance. We discuss this issue and
compare and contrast performance of hold-out and k-fold cross-validation. We
have extended the SVM functionality and introduced tools to facilitate cross
validation in TMVA and present results based on these improvements.

 <dc:description>  Usually, it is the software manufacturer who employs verification or testing
to ensure that the software embedded in a device meets its main objectives.
However, these days we are confronted with the situation that economical or
technological reasons might make a manufacturer become interested in the
software slightly deviating from its main objective for dubious reasons.
Examples include lock-in strategies and the $\mathrm{NO}_x$ emission scandals
in automotive industry. This phenomenon is what we call software doping. It is
turning more widespread as software is embedded in ever more devices of daily
use.
  The primary contribution of this article is to provide a hierarchy of simple
but solid formal definitions that enable to distinguish whether a program is
clean or doped. Moreover, we show that these characterisations provide an
immediate framework for analysis by using already existing verification
techniques. We exemplify this by applying self-composition on sequential
programs and model checking of HyperLTL formulas on reactive models.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new convex model predictive control strategy for
dynamic optimal power flow between battery energy storage systems distributed
in an AC microgrid. The proposed control strategy uses a new problem
formulation, based on a linear d-q reference frame voltage-current model and
linearised power flow approximations. This allows the optimal power flows to be
solved as a convex optimisation problem, for which fast and robust solvers
exist. The proposed method does not assume real and reactive power flows are
decoupled, allowing line losses, voltage constraints and converter current
constraints to be addressed. In addition, non-linear variations in the charge
and discharge efficiencies of lithium ion batteries are analysed and included
in the control strategy. Real-time digital simulations were carried out for an
islanded microgrid based on the IEEE 13 bus prototypical feeder, with
distributed battery energy storage systems and intermittent photovoltaic
generation. It is shown that the proposed control strategy approaches the
performance of a strategy based on non-convex optimisation, while reducing the
required computation time by a factor of 1000, making it suitable for a
real-time model predictive control implementation.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the task assignment problem for multiple dispersed
robots constrained by limited communication range. The robots are initially
randomly distributed and need to visit several target locations while
minimizing the total travel time. A centralized rendezvous-based algorithm is
proposed, under which all the robots first move towards a rendezvous position
until communication paths are established between every pair of robots either
directly or through intermediate peers, and then one robot is chosen as the
leader to make a centralized task assignment for the other robots. Furthermore,
we propose a decentralized algorithm based on a single-traveling-salesman tour,
which does not require all the robots to be connected through communication. We
investigate the variation of the quality of the assignment solutions as the
level of information sharing increases and as the communication range grows,
respectively. The proposed algorithms are compared with a centralized algorithm
with shared global information and a decentralized greedy algorithm
respectively. Monte Carlo simulation results show the satisfying performance of
the proposed algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We design jamming resistant receivers to enhance the robustness of a massive
MIMO uplink channel against jamming. In the pilot phase, we estimate not only
the desired channel, but also the jamming channel by exploiting purposely
unused pilot sequences. The jamming channel estimate is used to construct the
linear receive filter to reduce impact that jamming has on the achievable
rates. The performance of the proposed scheme is analytically and numerically
evaluated. These results show that the proposed scheme greatly improves the
rates, as compared to conventional receivers. Moreover, the proposed schemes
still work well with stronger jamming power.

 <dc:description>  Polar codes are a recently proposed family of provably capacity-achieving
error-correction codes that received a lot of attention. While their
theoretical properties render them interesting, their practicality compared to
other types of codes has not been thoroughly studied. Towards this end, in this
paper, we perform a comparison of polar decoders against LDPC and Turbo
decoders that are used in existing communications standards. More specifically,
we compare both the error-correction performance and the hardware efficiency of
the corresponding hardware implementations. This comparison enables us to
identify applications where polar codes are superior to existing
error-correction coding solutions as well as to determine the most promising
research direction in terms of the hardware implementation of polar decoders.

 <dc:title>Multi-Task Convolutional Neural Network for Pose-Invariant Face

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper explores multi-task learning (MTL) for face recognition. We answer
the questions of how and why MTL can improve the face recognition performance.
First, we propose a multi-task Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face
recognition where identity classification is the main task and pose,
illumination, and expression estimations are the side tasks. Second, we develop
a dynamic-weighting scheme to automatically assign the loss weight to each side
task, which is a crucial problem in MTL. Third, we propose a pose-directed
multi-task CNN by grouping different poses to learn pose-specific identity
features, simultaneously across all poses. Last but not least, we propose an
energy-based weight analysis method to explore how CNN-based MTL works. We
observe that the side tasks serve as regularizations to disentangle the
variations from the learnt identity features. Extensive experiments on the
entire Multi-PIE dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work using all data
in Multi-PIE for face recognition. Our approach is also applicable to
in-the-wild datasets for pose-invariant face recognition and achieves
comparable or better performance than state of the art on LFW, CFP, and IJB-A
datasets.

 <dc:description>  We provide the first analysis of a non-trivial quantization scheme for
compressed sensing measurements arising from structured measurements.
Specifically, our analysis studies compressed sensing matrices consisting of
rows selected at random, without replacement, from a circulant matrix generated
by a random subgaussian vector. We quantize the measurements using stable,
possibly one-bit, Sigma-Delta schemes, and use a reconstruction method based on
convex optimization. We show that the part of the reconstruction error due to
quantization decays polynomially in the number of measurements. This is in line
with analogous results on Sigma-Delta quantization associated with random
Gaussian or subgaussian matrices, and significantly better than results
associated with the widely assumed memoryless scalar quantization. Moreover, we
prove that our approach is stable and robust; i.e., the reconstruction error
degrades gracefully in the presence of non-quantization noise and when the
underlying signal is not strictly sparse. The analysis relies on results
concerning subgaussian chaos processes as well as a variation of McDiarmid's
inequality.

 <dc:description>  Simflowny is an open platform which automatically generates parallel code of
scientific dynamical models for different simulation frameworks. Here we
present major upgrades on this software to support an extended set of families
of models, in particular: i) a new generic family for partial differential
equations, which can include spatial derivatives of any order, ii) a new family
for agent based models to study complex phenomena --either on a spatial domain
or on a graph--. Additionally we introduce a flexible graphical user interface
(GUI) to accommodate these and future families of equations. This paper
describes the new GUI architecture and summarizes the formal representation and
implementation of these new families, providing several validation results.

 <dc:description>  Trace alignment algorithms have been used in process mining for discovering
the consensus treatment procedures and process deviations. Different alignment
algorithms, however, may produce very different results. No widely-adopted
method exists for evaluating the results of trace alignment. Existing
reference-free evaluation methods cannot adequately and comprehensively assess
the alignment quality. We analyzed and compared the existing evaluation
methods, identifying their limitations, and introduced improvements in two
reference-free evaluation methods. Our approach assesses the alignment result
globally instead of locally, and therefore helps the algorithm to optimize
overall alignment quality. We also introduced a novel metric to measure the
alignment complexity, which can be used as a constraint on alignment algorithm
optimization. We tested our evaluation methods on a trauma resuscitation
dataset and provided the medical explanation of the activities and patterns
identified as deviations using our proposed evaluation methods.

 <dc:description>  The sparsest cut problem consists of identifying a small set of edges that
breaks the graph into balanced sets of vertices. The normalized cut problem
balances the total degree, instead of the size, of the resulting sets.
Applications of graph cuts include community detection and computer vision.
However, cut problems were originally proposed for static graphs, an assumption
that does not hold in many modern applications where graphs are highly dynamic.
In this paper, we introduce the sparsest and normalized cut problems in
temporal graphs, which generalize their standard definitions by enforcing the
smoothness of cuts over time. We propose novel formulations and algorithms for
computing temporal cuts using spectral graph theory, multiplex graphs,
divide-and-conquer and low-rank matrix approximation. Furthermore, we extend
our formulation to dynamic graph signals, where cuts also capture node values,
as graph wavelets. Experiments show that our solutions are accurate and
scalable, enabling the discovery of dynamic communities and the analysis of
dynamic graph processes.

 <dc:title>An Improved Dictatorship Test with Perfect Completeness</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow \{0,1\}$ is called a dictator if
it depends on exactly one variable i.e $f(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = x_i$ for
some $i\in [n]$. In this work, we study a $k$-query dictatorship test.
Dictatorship tests are central in proving many hardness results for constraint
satisfaction problems.
  The dictatorship test is said to have {\em perfect completeness} if it
accepts any dictator function. The {\em soundness} of a test is the maximum
probability with which it accepts any function far from a dictator. Our main
result is a $k$-query dictatorship test with perfect completeness and soundness
$ \frac{2k + 1}{2^k}$, where $k$ is of the form $2^t -1$ for any integer $t &gt;
2$. This improves upon the result of \cite{TY15} which gave a dictatorship test
with soundness $ \frac{2k + 3}{2^k}$.

 <dc:description>  We consider optimal/efficient power allocation policies in a single/multihop
wireless network in the presence of hard end-to-end deadline delay constraints
on the transmitted packets. Such constraints can be useful for real time voice
and video. Power is consumed in only transmission of the data. We consider the
case when the power used in transmission is a convex function of the data
transmitted. We develop a computationally efficient online algorithm, which
minimizes the average power for the single hop. We model this problem as
dynamic program (DP) and obtain the optimal solution. Next, we generalize it to
the multiuser, multihop scenario when there are multiple real time streams with
different hard deadline constraints.

 <dc:title>Linear Time Computation of Moments in Sum-Product Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bayesian online algorithms for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) need to update
their posterior distribution after seeing one single additional instance. To do
so, they must compute moments of the model parameters under this distribution.
The best existing method for computing such moments scales quadratically in the
size of the SPN, although it scales linearly for trees. This unfortunate
scaling makes Bayesian online algorithms prohibitively expensive, except for
small or tree-structured SPNs. We propose an optimal linear-time algorithm that
works even when the SPN is a general directed acyclic graph (DAG), which
significantly broadens the applicability of Bayesian online algorithms for
SPNs. There are three key ingredients in the design and analysis of our
algorithm: 1). For each edge in the graph, we construct a linear time reduction
from the moment computation problem to a joint inference problem in SPNs. 2).
Using the property that each SPN computes a multilinear polynomial, we give an
efficient procedure for polynomial evaluation by differentiation without
expanding the network that may contain exponentially many monomials. 3). We
propose a dynamic programming method to further reduce the computation of the
moments of all the edges in the graph from quadratic to linear. We demonstrate
the usefulness of our linear time algorithm by applying it to develop a linear
time assume density filter (ADF) for SPNs.

 <dc:description>  While Truncated Back-Propagation through Time (BPTT) is the most popular
approach to training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), it suffers from being
inherently sequential (making parallelization difficult) and from truncating
gradient flow between distant time-steps. We investigate whether Target
Propagation (TPROP) style approaches can address these shortcomings.
Unfortunately, extensive experiments suggest that TPROP generally underperforms
BPTT, and we end with an analysis of this phenomenon, and suggestions for
future work.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Kolmogorov complexity of x, denoted C(x), is the length of the shortest
program that generates x. For such a simple definition, Kolmogorov complexity
has a rich and deep theory, as well as applications to a wide variety of topics
including learning theory, complexity lower bounds and SAT algorithms.
  Kolmogorov complexity typically focuses on decompression, going from the
compressed program to the original string. This paper develops a dual notion of
compression, the mapping from a string to its compressed version. Typical
lossless compression algorithms such as Lempel-Ziv or Huffman Encoding always
produce a string that will decompress to the original. We define a general
compression concept based on this observation.
  For every m, we exhibit a single compression algorithm q of length about m
which for n and strings x of length n &gt;= m, the output of q will have length
within n-m+O(1) bits of C(x). We also show this bound is tight in a strong way,
for every n &gt;= m there is an x of length n with C(x) about m such that no
compression program of size slightly less than m can compress x at all.
  We also consider a polynomial time-bounded version of compression complexity
and show that similar results for this version would rule out cryptographic
one-way functions.

 <dc:description>  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) transform latent vectors into visually
plausible images. It is generally thought that the original GAN formulation
gives no out-of-the-box method to reverse the mapping, projecting images back
into latent space. We introduce a simple, gradient-based technique called
stochastic clipping. In experiments, for images generated by the GAN, we
precisely recover their latent vector pre-images 100% of the time. Additional
experiments demonstrate that this method is robust to noise. Finally, we show
that even for unseen images, our method appears to recover unique encodings.

 <dc:description>  Maximum flow is a fundamental problem in Combinatorial Optimization that has
numerous applications in both theory and practice. In this paper, we study the
flow network simplification problem, which asks to remove all the useless arcs
from the graph. To be precise, an arc is useless if it does not participate in
any simple s, t-path. Weihe [FOCS'94, JCSS'97] showed that if there exists an
$O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for simplifying a flow network, then a maximum s,
t-flow in directed planar graphs can be computed in $O(n \log n)$-time.
However, there was no known algorithm that could determine all the useless arcs
in $O(n \log n)$-time. Although an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm for computing
maximum flow on planar directed graphs without simplifying a flow network has
been later discovered by Borradaile and Klein [SODA'06, J.ACM'09], it remains
open whether a directed planar flow network can be simplified in $O(n \log
n)$-time.
  Here we present an algorithm that determines all the useless arcs in $O(n
\log n)$-time, thus completing the framework of Weihe. Our algorithm improves
upon the previous best running time of $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ for removing all the
useless arcs by Misiolek and Chen [COCOON'05, IPL'06] and by Biedl, Brejova and
Vinar [MFCS'00]. Our main algorithm requires the planar embedding to contain no
clockwise cycle, and every vertex except source and sink has degree three. The
bottleneck of our algorithm is the $O(n \log n)$ time algorithm for
preprocessing the planar embedding while all the other parts runs in linear
time.

 <dc:description>  Achievable information rates (AIRs) of wideband optical communication systems
using ~40 nm (~5 THz) EDFA and ~100 nm (~12.5 THz) distributed Raman
amplification are estimated based on a first-order perturbation analysis. The
AIRs of each individual channel have been evaluated for DP-64QAM, DP-256QAM,
and DP-1024QAM modulation formats. The impact of full-field nonlinear
compensation (FF-NLC) and probabilistically shaped constellations using a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution were studied and compared to electronic
dispersion compensation. It is found that a probabilistically shaped DP-1024QAM
constellation combined with FF-NLC yields AIRs of ~75 Tbit/s for the EDFA
scheme and ~223 Tbit/s for the Raman amplification scheme over 2000 km standard
single mode fibre transmission.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory optimization of a controlled dynamical system is an essential part
of autonomy, however many trajectory optimization techniques are limited by the
fidelity of the underlying parametric model. In the field of robotics, a lack
of model knowledge can be overcome with machine learning techniques, utilizing
measurements to build a dynamical model from the data. This paper aims to take
the middle ground between these two approaches by introducing a semi-parametric
representation of the underlying system dynamics. Our goal is to leverage the
considerable information contained in a traditional physics based model and
combine it with a data-driven, non-parametric regression technique known as a
Gaussian Process. Integrating this semi-parametric model with model predictive
pseudospectral control, we demonstrate this technique on both a cart pole and
quadrotor simulation with unmodeled damping and parametric error. In order to
manage parametric uncertainty, we introduce an algorithm that utilizes Sparse
Spectrum Gaussian Processes (SSGP) for online learning after each rollout. We
implement this online learning technique on a cart pole and quadrator, then
demonstrate the use of online learning and obstacle avoidance for the dubin
vehicle dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant progress in a number of
Machine Learning applications. However without a consistent set of evaluation
tasks, interpreting performance across test datasets is impossible. In most
previous work, characteristics of individual data points are not considered
during evaluation, and each data point is treated equally. Using Item Response
Theory (IRT) from psychometrics it is possible to model characteristics of
specific data points that then inform an estimate of model ability as compared
to a population of humans. We report the results of several experiments to
determine how different Deep Neural Network (DNN) models perform under
different training circumstances with respect to ability. As DNNs train on
larger datasets, performance begins to look like human performance under the
assumptions of IRT models. That is, easy questions start to have a higher
probability of being answered correctly than harder questions. We also report
the results of additional analyses regarding model robustness to noise and
performance as a function of training set size that further inform our main
conclusion

 <dc:description>  As an intriguing ultra-small particle-like magnetic texture, skyrmion has
attracted lots of research interests in next-generation ultra-dense and low
power magnetic memory/logic designs. Previous studies have demonstrated a
single skyrmion-domain wall pair collision in a specially designed magnetic
racetrack junction. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of multiple
skyrmions with domain wall pair in a magnetic racetrack. The numerical
micromagnetic simulation results indicate that the domain wall pair could be
pinned or depinned by the rectangular notch pinning site depending on both the
number of skyrmions in the racetrack and the magnitude of driving current
density. Such emergent dynamical property could be used to implement a
threshold-tunable step function, in which the inputs are skyrmions and
threshold could be tuned by the driving current density. The threshold-tunable
step function is widely used in logic and neural network applications. We also
present a three-input skyrmion-based majority logic gate design to demonstrate
the potential application of such dynamic interaction of multiple skyrmions and
domain wall pair.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we examine the existence of correlation between movie
similarity and low level features from respective movie content. In particular,
we demonstrate the extraction of multi-modal representation models of movies
based on subtitles, audio and metadata mining. We emphasize our research in
topic modeling of movies based on their subtitles. In order to demonstrate the
proposed content representation approach, we have built a small dataset of 160
widely known movies. We assert movie similarities, as propagated by the
singular modalities and fusion models, in the form of recommendation rankings.
We showcase a novel topic model browser for movies that allows for exploration
of the different aspects of similarities between movies and an information
retrieval system for movie similarity based on multi-modal content.

 <dc:description>  Communications at mmWave frequencies will be a key enabler of the next
generation of cellular networks, due to the multi-Gbps rate that can be
achieved. However, there are still several problems that must be solved before
this technology can be widely adopted, primarily associated with the interplay
between the variability of mmWave links and the complexity of mobile networks.
An end-to-end network simulator represents a great tool to assess the
performance of any proposed solution to meet the stringent 5G requirements.
Given the criticality of channel propagation characteristics at higher
frequencies, we present our implementation of the 3GPP channel model for the
6-100 GHz band for the ns-3 end-to-end 5G mmWave module, and detail its
associated MIMO beamforming architecture.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a variant of the framework of online learning using
expert advice with limited/bandit feedback. We consider each expert as a
learning entity, seeking to more accurately reflecting certain real-world
applications. In our setting, the feedback at any time $t$ is limited in a
sense that it is only available to the expert $i^t$ that has been selected by
the central algorithm (forecaster), \emph{i.e.}, only the expert $i^t$ receives
feedback from the environment and gets to learn at time $t$. We consider a
generic black-box approach whereby the forecaster does not control or know the
learning dynamics of the experts apart from knowing the following no-regret
learning property: the average regret of any expert $j$ vanishes at a rate of
at least $O(t_j^{\regretRate-1})$ with $t_j$ learning steps where $\regretRate
\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter.
  In the spirit of competing against the best action in hindsight in
multi-armed bandits problem, our goal here is to be competitive w.r.t. the
cumulative losses the algorithm could receive by following the policy of always
selecting one expert. We prove the following hardness result: without any
coordination between the forecaster and the experts, it is impossible to design
a forecaster achieving no-regret guarantees. In order to circumvent this
hardness result, we consider a practical assumption allowing the forecaster to
&quot;guide&quot; the learning process of the experts by filtering/blocking some of the
feedbacks observed by them from the environment, \emph{i.e.}, not allowing the
selected expert $i^t$ to learn at time $t$ for some time steps. Then, we design
a novel no-regret learning algorithm \algo for this problem setting by
carefully guiding the feedbacks observed by experts. We prove that \algo
achieves the worst-case expected cumulative regret of $O(\Time^\frac{1}{2 -
\regretRate})$ after $\Time$ time steps.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach for learning compact and intuitive distributed
representations with binary encoding. Rather than summing up expert votes as in
products of experts, we employ for each variable the opinion of the most
reliable expert. Data points are hence explained through a partitioning of the
variables into expert supports. The partitions are dynamically adapted based on
which experts are active. During the learning phase we adopt a smoothed version
of this model that uses separate mixtures for each data dimension. In our
experiments we achieve accurate reconstructions of high-dimensional data points
with at most a dozen experts.

 <dc:description>  We address the statistical and optimization impacts of using classical sketch
versus Hessian sketch to solve approximately the Matrix Ridge Regression (MRR)
problem. Prior research has considered the effects of classical sketch on least
squares regression (LSR), a strictly simpler problem. We establish that
classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR
as it does on those of LSR---namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. In
contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee, instead, the
approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the &quot;mass&quot; in the
responses and the optimal objective value.
  For both types of approximations, the regularization in the sketched MRR
problem gives it significantly different statistical properties from the
sketched LSR problem. In particular, there is a bias-variance trade-off in
sketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR. We provide upper and lower
bounds on the biases and variances of sketched MRR, these establish that the
variance is significantly increased when classical sketches are used, while the
bias is significantly increased when using Hessian sketches. Empirically,
sketched MRR solutions can have risks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude
than those of the optimal MRR solutions.
  We establish theoretically and empirically that model averaging greatly
decreases this gap. Thus, in the distributed setting, sketching combined with
model averaging is a powerful technique that quickly obtains near-optimal
solutions to the MRR problem while greatly mitigating the statistical risks
incurred by sketching.

computer vision and image processing applications. We have mentioned a number
of popular contour-based corner detectors in our paper. Among all these
detectors chord to triangular arm angle (CTAA) has been demonstrated as the
most dominant corner detector in terms of average repeatability. We introduce a

demonstrating experimental results, our proposed technique outperforms CTAA and
other detectors mentioned in this paper. The results exhibit that our proposed
method is simple yet efficient at finding out corners more accurately and
reliably.

 <dc:description>  Sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be
among the most effective in solving large-scale two-player zero-sum
extensive-form games. The convergence rates of these methods depend heavily on
the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on. We
investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form
games through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of
distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the
extensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated
entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the
strategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching
factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several
first-order methods by a factor of $\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching
factor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.
  Thus far, counterfactual regret minimization methods have been faster in
practice, and more popular, than first-order methods despite their
theoretically inferior convergence rates. Using our new weighting scheme and
practical tuning we show that, for the first time, the excessive gap technique
can be made faster than the fastest counterfactual regret minimization
algorithm, CFR+, in practice.

 <dc:description>  We focus on sorting, which is the building block of many machine learning
algorithms, and propose a novel distributed sorting algorithm, named Coded
TeraSort, which substantially improves the execution time of the TeraSort
benchmark in Hadoop MapReduce. The key idea of Coded TeraSort is to impose
structured redundancy in data, in order to enable in-network coding
opportunities that overcome the data shuffling bottleneck of TeraSort. We
empirically evaluate the performance of CodedTeraSort algorithm on Amazon EC2
clusters, and demonstrate that it achieves 1.97x - 3.39x speedup, compared with
TeraSort, for typical settings of interest.

 <dc:description>  We present here the first systematic treatment of the problems posed by the
visualization and analysis of large-scale, parallel adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) simulations on an Eulerian grid. When compared to those obtained by
constructing an intermediate unstructured mesh with fully described
connectivity, our primary results indicate a gain of at least 80\% in terms of
memory footprint, with a better rendering while retaining similar execution
speed. In this article, we describe the key concepts that allow us to obtain
these results, together with the methodology that facilitates the design,
implementation, and optimization of algorithms operating directly on such
refined meshes. This native support for AMR meshes has been contributed to the
open source Visualization Toolkit (VTK). This work pertains to a broader
long-term vision, with the dual goal to both improve interactivity when
exploring such data sets in 2 and 3 dimensions, and optimize resource
utilization.

 <dc:description>  Person Re-IDentification (Re-ID) aims to match person images captured from
two non-overlapping cameras. In this paper, a deep hybrid similarity learning
(DHSL) method for person Re-ID based on a convolution neural network (CNN) is
proposed. In our approach, a CNN learning feature pair for the input image pair
is simultaneously extracted. Then, both the element-wise absolute difference
and multiplication of the CNN learning feature pair are calculated. Finally, a
hybrid similarity function is designed to measure the similarity between the
feature pair, which is realized by learning a group of weight coefficients to
project the element-wise absolute difference and multiplication into a
similarity score. Consequently, the proposed DHSL method is able to reasonably
assign parameters of feature learning and metric learning in a CNN so that the
performance of person Re-ID is improved. Experiments on three challenging
person Re-ID databases, QMUL GRID, VIPeR and CUHK03, illustrate that the
proposed DHSL method is superior to multiple state-of-the-art person Re-ID
methods.

 <dc:description>  Agile-SD is one of the latest versions of loss-based congestion control
algorithm (CCA), which has been proposed to improve the total performance of
transmission control protocol (TCP) over high-speed and short-distance
networks. It has introduced a new mechanism, called agility factor mechanism,
which shortens the epoch time to reduce the sensitivity to packet losses and in
turn to increase the average throughput. Agile-SD has only been tested via
simulation; however, it has not been mathematically proven or evaluated. The
contribution of this paper is twofold. First, a new mathematical model for the
throughput of NewReno and Agile-SD is proposed. This model is designed using
the well-known Markov chains to validate the correctness of Agile-SD and to
show the impact of buffer size, multiplicative decrease factor, and maximum
limit of agility factor ({\lambda}max ) on the total performance. Second, an
automated algorithm configuration and parameter tuning (AACPT) technique is
employed to optimize and automate the configuration of {\lambda}max .
Furthermore, the numerical results for both NewReno and Agile-SD are compared
with the simulation results, in which the validity of the proposed model is
confirmed. Moreover, the output of the AACPT is exploited to formulate a new
equation, which calculates the optimal {\lambda}max from a given \b{eta} in
order to conserve the standard interface of the TCP. This equation increases
the scalability of Agile-SD and improves its total performance.

 <dc:title>Load Synchronization and Sustained Oscillations Induced by Transactive

 <dc:description>  Transactive or market-based coordination strategies have recently been
proposed for controlling the aggregate demand of a large number of electric
loads. Such schemes offer operational benefits such as enforcing distribution
feeder capacity limits and providing users with flexibility to consume energy
based on the price they are willing to pay. However, this paper demonstrates
that they are also prone to load synchronization and power oscillations. A
transactive energy framework has been adopted and applied to a population of
thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). A modified TCL switching logic takes
into account market coordination signals, alongside the natural
hysteresis-based switching conditions. Studies of this market-based
coordination scheme suggest that several factors may contribute to load
synchronism, including sharp changes in the market prices that are broadcast to
loads, lack of diversity in user specified bid curves, low feeder limits that
are encountered periodically, and the form of user bid curves. Case studies
illustrate challenges associated with market-based coordination strategies and
provide insights into modifications that address those issues.

 <dc:description>  Most STM systems are poorly equipped to support libraries of concurrent data
structures. One reason is that they typically detect conflicts by tracking
transactions' read sets and write sets, an approach that often leads to false
conflicts. A second is that existing data structures and libraries often need
to be rewritten from scratch to support transactional conflict detection and
rollback. This paper introduces Proust, a framework for the design and
implementation of transactional data structures. Proust is designed to maximize
re-use of existing well-engineered by providing transactional &quot;wrappers&quot; to
make existing thread-safe concurrent data structures transactional. Proustian
objects are also integrated with an underling STM system, allowing them to take
advantage of well-engineered STM conflict detection mechanisms. Proust
generalizes and unifies prior approaches such as boosting and predication.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel automated method for White Matter (WM)
lesion segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patient images. Our approach is
based on a cascade of two 3D patch-wise convolutional neural networks (CNN).
The first network is trained to be more sensitive revealing possible candidate
lesion voxels while the second network is trained to reduce the number of
misclassified voxels coming from the first network. This cascaded CNN
architecture tends to learn well from small sets of training data, which can be
very interesting in practice, given the difficulty to obtain manual label
annotations and the large amount of available unlabeled Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) data. We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method on the
public MS lesion segmentation challenge MICCAI2008 dataset, comparing it with
respect to other state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation tools. Furthermore,
the proposed method is also evaluated on two private MS clinical datasets,
where the performance of our method is also compared with different recent
public available state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation methods. At the time
of writing this paper, our method is the best ranked approach on the MICCAI2008
challenge, outperforming the rest of 60 participant methods when using all the
available input modalities (T1-w, T2-w and FLAIR), while still in the top-rank
(3rd position) when using only T1-w and FLAIR modalities. On clinical MS data,
our approach exhibits a significant increase in the accuracy segmenting of WM
lesions when compared with the rest of evaluated methods, highly correlating
($r \ge 0.97$) also with the expected lesion volume.

and generalize two different previous algorithms, one for an online network
design problem due to Berman and Coulston [4] and one for (offline) general
network design problems due to Goemans and Williamson [9]; we give an O(log

connected. We also consider a further generalization of the problem that allows
us to pay penalties in exchange for violating connectivity constraints; we give
an online O(log k)-competitive algorithm for this case as well.

 <dc:description>  Android has been the most popular smartphone system, with multiple platform
versions (e.g., KITKAT and Lollipop) active in the market. To manage the
application's compatibility with one or more platform versions, Android allows
apps to declare the supported platform SDK versions in their manifest files. In
this paper, we make a first effort to study this modern software mechanism. Our
objective is to measure the current practice of the declared SDK versions
(which we term as DSDK versions afterwards) in real apps, and the consistency
between the DSDK versions and their app API calls. To this end, we perform a
three-dimensional analysis. First, we parse Android documents to obtain a
mapping between each API and their corresponding platform versions. We then
analyze the DSDK-API consistency for over 24K apps, among which we pre-exclude
1.3K apps that provide different app binaries for different Android versions
through Google Play analysis. Besides shedding light on the current DSDK
practice, our study quantitatively measures the two side effects of
inappropriate DSDK versions: (i) around 1.8K apps have API calls that do not
exist in some declared SDK versions, which causes runtime crash bugs on those
platform versions; (ii) over 400 apps, due to claiming the outdated targeted
DSDK versions, are potentially exploitable by remote code execution. These
results indicate the importance and difficulty of declaring correct DSDK, and
our work can help developers fulfill this goal.

 <dc:description>  Comparative convexity is a generalization of convexity relying on abstract
notions of means. We define the Jensen divergence and the Jensen diversity from
the viewpoint of comparative convexity, and show how to obtain the generalized
Bregman divergences as limit cases of skewed Jensen divergences. In particular,
we report explicit formula of these generalized Bregman divergences when
considering quasi-arithmetic means. Finally, we introduce a generalization of
the Bhattacharyya statistical distances based on comparative means using
relative convexity.

 <dc:description>  We consider explicit polar constructions of blocklength $n\rightarrow\infty$
for the two extreme cases of code rates $R\rightarrow1$ and $R\rightarrow0.$
For code rates $R\rightarrow1,$ we design codes with complexity order of $n\log
n$ in code construction, encoding, and decoding. These codes achieve the
vanishing output bit error rates on the binary symmetric channels with any
transition error probability $p\rightarrow 0$ and perform this task with a
substantially smaller redundancy $(1-R)n$ than do other known high-rate codes,
such as BCH codes or Reed-Muller (RM). We then extend our design to the
low-rate codes that achieve the vanishing output error rates with the same
complexity order of $n\log n$ and an asymptotically optimal code rate
$R\rightarrow0$ for the case of $p\rightarrow1/2.$

 <dc:description>  We present a denotational account of dynamic allocation of potentially cyclic
memory cells using a monad on a functor category. We identify the collection of
heaps as an object in a different functor category equipped with a monad for
adding hiding/encapsulation capabilities to the heaps. We derive a monad for
full ground references supporting effect masking by applying a state monad
transformer to the encapsulation monad. To evaluate the monad, we present a
denotational semantics for a call-by-value calculus with full ground
references, and validate associated code transformations.

 <dc:title>A comparative study of fluid-particle coupling methods for fully

 <dc:description>  The direct numerical simulation of particulate systems offers a unique
approach to study the dynamics of fluid-solid suspensions by fully resolving
the submerged particles and without introducing empirical models. For the
lattice Boltzmann method, different variants exist to incorporate the
fluid-particle interaction into the simulation. This paper provides a detailed
and systematic comparison of two different methods, namely the momentum
exchange method and the partially saturated cells method by Noble and
Torczynski. Three subvariants of each method are used in the benchmark scenario
of a single heavy sphere settling in ambient fluid to study their
characteristics and accuracy for particle Reynolds numbers from 185 up to 365.
The sphere must be resolved with at least 24 computational cells per diameter
to achieve velocity errors below 5%. The momentum exchange method is found to
be more accurate in predicting the streamwise velocity component whereas the
partially saturated cells method is more accurate in the spanwise components.
The study reveals that the resolution should be chosen with respect to the
coupling dynamics, and not only based on the flow properties, to avoid large
errors in the fluid-particle interaction.

 <dc:title>Models of Type Theory with Strict Equality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Capriotti, Paolo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This thesis introduces the idea of two-level type theory, an extension of
Martin-L\&quot;of type theory that adds a notion of strict equality as an internal
primitive.
  A type theory with a strict equality alongside the more conventional form of
equality, the latter being of fundamental importance for the recent innovation
of homotopy type theory (HoTT), was first proposed by Voevodsky, and is usually
referred to as HTS.
  Here, we generalise and expand this idea, by developing a semantic framework
that gives a systematic account of type formers for two-level systems, and
proving a conservativity result relating back to a conventional type theory
like HoTT.
  Finally, we show how a two-level theory can be used to provide partial
solutions to open problems in HoTT. In particular, we use it to construct
semi-simplicial types, and lay out the foundations of an internal theory of
$(\infty, 1)$-categories.

 <dc:description>  In many linear inverse problems, we want to estimate an unknown vector
belonging to a high-dimensional (or infinite-dimensional) space from few linear
measurements. To overcome the ill-posed nature of such problems, we use a
low-dimension assumption on the unknown vector: it belongs to a low-dimensional
model set. The question of whether it is possible to recover such an unknown
vector from few measurements then arises. If the answer is yes, it is also
important to be able to describe a way to perform such a recovery. We describe
a general framework where appropriately chosen random measurements guarantee
that recovery is possible. We further describe a way to study the performance
of recovery methods that consist in the minimization of a regularization
function under a data-fit constraint.

 <dc:description>  We study consensus processes on the complete graph of $n$ nodes. Initially,
each node supports one from up to n opinions. Nodes randomly and in parallel
sample the opinions of constant many nodes. Based on these samples, they use an
update rule to change their own opinion.
  The goal is to reach consensus, a configuration where all nodes support the
same opinion. We compare two well-known update rules: 2-Choices and 3-Majority.
In the former, each node samples two nodes and adopts their opinion if they
agree. In the latter, each node samples three nodes: If an opinion is supported
by at least two samples the node adopts it, otherwise it randomly adopts one of
the sampled opinions. Known results for these update rules focus on initial
configurations with a limited number of colors (say $n^{1/3}$ ), or typically
assume a bias, where one opinion has a much larger support than any other. For
such biased configurations, the time to reach consensus is roughly the same for
2-Choices and 3-Majority.
  Interestingly, we prove that this is no longer true for configurations with a
large number of initial colors. In particular, we show that 3-Majority reaches
consensus with high probability in $O(n^{3/4}\log^{7/8}n)$ rounds, while
2-Choices can need $\Omega(n/\log n)$ rounds. We thus get the first
unconditional sublinear bound for 3-Majority and the first result separating
the consensus time of these processes. Along the way, we develop a framework
that allows a fine-grained comparison between consensus processes from a
specific class. We believe that this framework might help to classify the
performance of more consensus processes.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present new algorithms and analysis for the linear inverse
sensor placement and scheduling problems over multiple time instances with
power and communications constraints. The proposed algorithms, which deal
directly with minimizing the mean squared error (MSE), are based on the convex
relaxation approach to address the binary optimization scheduling problems that
are formulated in sensor network scenarios. We propose to balance the energy
and communications demands of operating a network of sensors over time while we
still guarantee a minimum level of estimation accuracy. We measure this
accuracy by the MSE for which we provide average case and lower bounds analyses
that hold in general, irrespective of the scheduling algorithm used. We show
experimentally how the proposed algorithms perform against state-of-the-art
methods previously described in the literature.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a unified framework to analyze the performance of
dense small cell networks (SCNs) in terms of the coverage probability and the
area spectral efficiency (ASE). In our analysis, we consider a practical path
loss model that accounts for both non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight
(LOS) transmissions. Furthermore, we adopt a generalized fading model, in which
Rayleigh fading, Rician fading and Nakagami-m fading can be treated in a
unified framework. The analytical results of the coverage probability and the
ASE are derived, using a generalized stochastic geometry analysis. Different
from existing work that does not differentiate NLOS and LOS transmissions, our
results show that NLOS and LOS transmissions have a significant impact on the
coverage probability and the ASE performance, particularly when the SCNs grow
dense. Furthermore, our results establish for the first time that the
performance of the SCNs can be divided into four regimes, according to the
intensity (aka density) of BSs, where in each regime the performance is
dominated by different factors.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we explore the use of unsupervised methods for detecting
cognates in multilingual word lists. We use online EM to train sound segment
similarity weights for computing similarity between two words. We tested our
online systems on geographically spread sixteen different language groups of
the world and show that the Online PMI system (Pointwise Mutual Information)
outperforms a HMM based system and two linguistically motivated systems:
LexStat and ALINE. Our results suggest that a PMI system trained in an online
fashion can be used by historical linguists for fast and accurate
identification of cognates in not so well-studied language families.

 <dc:title>A Bayesian framework for distributed estimation of arrival rates in

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider a network of agents monitoring a spatially
distributed arrival process. Each node measures the number of arrivals seen at
its monitoring point in a given time-interval with the objective of estimating
the unknown local arrival rate. We propose an asynchronous distributed approach
based on a Bayesian model with unknown hyperparameter, where each node computes
the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator of its local arrival rate in a
distributed way. As a result, the estimation at each node &quot;optimally&quot; fuses the
information from the whole network through a distributed optimization
algorithm. Moreover, we propose an ad-hoc distributed estimator, based on a
consensus algorithm for time-varying and directed graphs, which exhibits
reduced complexity and exponential convergence. We analyze the performance of
the proposed distributed estimators, showing that they: (i) are reliable even
in presence of limited local data, and (ii) improve the estimation accuracy
compared to the purely decentralized setup. Finally, we provide a statistical
characterization of the proposed estimators. In particular, for the ad-hoc
estimator, we show that as the number of nodes goes to infinity its mean square
error converges to the optimal one. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations confirm
the theoretical characterization and highlight the appealing performances of
the estimators.

 <dc:description>  A novel method to determine the switching of controllers to increase the
performance of a system is presented. Three controllers are utilized to capture
three behaviors representative of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). An
underactuated nonlinear controller is derived to transit the vehicle between
locations; a fully-actuated nonlinear controller is given to station-keep the
vehicle at a setpoint; and a linear anti-windup controller is presented for the
reversing mode of operation. Given a trajectory to follow, a performance-based
supervisory switching control system (PBSSC) dictates the switching between
controllers to improve system performance. Experimental results are shown that
indicate that the PBSSC system is able to mitigate errors in pose better than
any of the individual controllers.

 <dc:description>  Field trials of a 4 meter long, 180 kilogram, unmanned surface vehicle (USV)
have been conducted to evaluate the performance of station-keeping heading and
position controllers in an outdoor marine environment disturbed by wind and
current. The USV has a twin hull configuration and a custom-designed propulsion
system, which consists of two azimuthing thrusters, one for each hull.
Nonlinear proportional derivative, backstepping and sliding mode feedback
controllers were tested in winds of about 4-5 knots, with and without wind
feedforward control. The controllers were tested when the longitudinal axis of
the USV was aligned with the mean wind direction and when the longitudinal axis
was perpendicular to the mean wind direction. It was found that the sliding
mode controller performed best overall and that the addition of wind
feedforward control did not significantly improve its effectiveness. However,
wind feedforward control did substantially improve the performance of the
proportional derivative and backstepping controllers when the mean wind
direction was perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the USV. An analysis of
the length scales present in the power spectrum of the turbulent speed
fluctuations in the wind suggests that a single anemometer is sufficient to
characterize the speed and direction of the wind acting on the USV.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this study is the characterization of the computing resources used
by researchers at the &quot;Instituto de Astrof\'isica de Canarias&quot; (IAC). Since
there is a huge demand of computing time and we use tools such as HTCondor to
implement High Throughput Computing (HTC) across all available PCs, it is
essential for us to assess in a quantitative way, using objective parameters,
the performances of our computing nodes. In order to achieve that, we have run
a set of benchmark tests on a number of different desktop and laptop PC models
among those used in our institution. In particular, we run the &quot;Polyhedron
Fortran Benchmarks&quot; suite, using three different compilers: GNU Fortran
Compiler, Intel Fortran Compiler and the PGI Fortran Compiler; execution times
are then normalized to the reference values published by Polyhedron. The same
tests were run multiple times on a same PCs, and on 3 to 5 PCs of the same
model (whenever possible) to check for repeatability and consistency of the
results. We found that in general execution times, for a given PC model, are
consistent within an uncertainty of about 10%, and show a gain in CPU speed of
a factor of about 3 between the oldest PCs used at the IAC (7-8 years old) and
the newest ones.

 <dc:description>  Pushing popular content to cheap &quot;helper&quot; nodes (e.g., small cells) during
off-peak hours has recently been proposed to cope with the increase in mobile
data traffic. User requests can be served locally from these helper nodes, if
the requested content is available in at least one of the nearby helpers.
Nevertheless, the collective storage of a few nearby helper nodes does not
usually suffice to achieve a high enough hit rate in practice. We propose to
depart from the assumption of hard cache hits, common in existing works, and
consider &quot;soft&quot; cache hits, where if the original content is not available,
some related contents that are locally cached can be recommended instead. Given
that Internet content consumption is entertainment-oriented, we argue that
there exist scenarios where a user might accept an alternative content (e.g.,
better download rate for alternative content, low rate plans, etc.), thus
avoiding to access expensive/congested links. We formulate the problem of
optimal edge caching with soft cache hits in a relatively generic setup,
propose efficient algorithms, and analyze the expected gains. We then show
using synthetic and real datasets of related video contents that promising
caching gains could be achieved in practice.

 <dc:title>Clustering articles based on semantic similarity</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Document clustering is generally the first step for topic identification.
Since many clustering methods operate on the similarities between documents, it
is important to build representations of these documents which keep their
semantics as much as possible and are also suitable for efficient similarity
calculation. The metadata of articles in the Astro dataset contribute to a
semantic matrix, which uses a vector space to capture the semantics of entities
derived from these articles and consequently supports the contextual
exploration of these entities in LittleAriadne. However, this semantic matrix
does not allow to calculate similarities between articles directly. In this
paper, we will describe in detail how we build a semantic representation for an
article from the entities that are associated with it. Base on such semantic
representations of articles, we apply two standard clustering methods, K-Means
and the Louvain community detection algorithm, which leads to our two
clustering solutions labelled as OCLC-31 (standing for K-Means) and
OCLC-Louvain (standing for Louvain). In this paper, we will give the
implementation details and a basic comparison with other clustering solutions
that are reported in this special issue.

 <dc:description>  Bipartite data is common in data engineering and brings unique challenges,
particularly when it comes to clustering tasks that impose on strong structural
assumptions. This work presents an unsupervised method for assessing similarity
in bipartite data. Similar to some co-clustering methods, the method is based
on regular equivalence in graphs. The algorithm uses spectral properties of a
bipartite adjacency matrix to estimate similarity in both dimensions. The
method is reflexive in that similarity in one dimension is used to inform
similarity in the other. Reflexive regular equivalence can also use the
structure of transitivities -- in a network sense -- the contribution of which
is controlled by the algorithm's only free-parameter, $\alpha$. The method is
completely unsupervised and can be used to validate assumptions of
co-similarity, which are required but often untested, in co-clustering
analyses. Three variants of the method with different normalizations are tested
on synthetic data. The method is found to be robust to noise and well-suited to
asymmetric co-similar structure, making it particularly informative for cluster
analysis and recommendation in bipartite data of unknown structure. In
experiments, the convergence and speed of the algorithm are found to be stable
for different levels of noise. Real-world data from a network of malaria genes
are analyzed, where the similarity produced by the reflexive method is shown to
out-perform other measures' ability to correctly classify genes.

 <dc:description>  Establishing trust between developers working at distant sites facilitates
team collaboration in distributed software development. While previous research
has focused on how to build and spread trust in absence of direct, face-to-face
communication, it has overlooked the effects of the propensity to trust, i.e.,
the trait of personality representing the individual disposition to perceive
the others as trustworthy. In this study, we present a preliminary,
quantitative analysis on how the propensity to trust affects the success of
collaborations in a distributed project, where the success is represented by
pull requests whose code changes and contributions are successfully merged into
the project's repository.

 <dc:description>  Cloud Computing is a business model revolution more than a technological one.
It capitalized on various technologies that have proved themselves and reshaped
the use of computers by replacing their local use by a centralized one where
shared resources are stored and managed by a third-party in a way transparent
to end-users. With this new use came new needs and one of them is the need to
search through Cloud services and select the ones that meet certain
requirements. To address this need, we have developed, in a previous work, the
Cloud Service Research and Selection System (CSRSS) which aims to allow Cloud
users to search through Cloud services in the database and find the ones that
match their requirements. It is based on the Skyline and ELECTRE IS. In this
paper, we improve the system by introducing 7 new dimensions related to QoS
constraints. Our work's main contribution is conceiving an Agent that uses both
the Skyline and an outranking method, called ELECTREIsSkyline, to determine
which Cloud services meet better the users' requirements while respecting QoS
properties. We programmed and tested this method for a total of 10 dimensions
and for 50 000 cloud services. The first results are very promising and show
the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  The increasing number of robots in home environments leads to an emerging
coexistence between humans and robots. Robots undertake common tasks and
support the residents in their everyday life. People appreciate the presence of
robots in their environment as long as they keep the control over them. One
important aspect is the control of a robot's workspace. Therefore, we introduce
virtual borders to precisely and flexibly define the workspace of mobile
robots. First, we propose a novel framework that allows a person to
interactively restrict a mobile robot's workspace. To show the validity of this
framework, a concrete implementation based on visual markers is implemented.
Afterwards, the mobile robot is capable of performing its tasks while
respecting the new virtual borders. The approach is accurate, flexible and less
time consuming than explicit robot programming. Hence, even non-experts are
able to teach virtual borders to their robots which is especially interesting
in domains like vacuuming or service robots in home environments.

 <dc:description>  Understanding human migration is of great interest to demographers and social
scientists. User generated digital data has made it easier to study such
patterns at a global scale. Geo coded Twitter data, in particular, has been
shown to be a promising source to analyse large scale human migration. But
given the scale of these datasets, a lot of manual effort has to be put into
processing and getting actionable insights from this data.
  In this paper, we explore feasibility of using a new tool, tensor
decomposition, to understand trends in global human migration. We model human
migration as a three mode tensor, consisting of (origin country, destination
country, time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to get meaningful low
dimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5
years and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration
patterns.

 <dc:description>  The theory of sparse stochastic processes offers a broad class of statistical
models to study signals. In this framework, signals are represented as
realizations of random processes that are solution of linear stochastic
differential equations driven by white L\'evy noises. Among these processes,
generalized Poisson processes based on compound-Poisson noises admit an
interpretation as random L-splines with random knots and weights. We
demonstrate that every generalized L\'evy process-from Gaussian to sparse-can
be understood as the limit in law of a sequence of generalized Poisson
processes. This enables a new conceptual understanding of sparse processes and
suggests simple algorithms for the numerical generation of such objects.

 <dc:description>  Advances in cellular networks such as device-to-device communications and
full-duplex radios, as well as the inherent elimination of intra-cell
interference achieved by network-controlled multiple access schemes, motivates
the investigation of the cross-mode interference properties under a guard
region corresponding to the Voronoi cell of an access point (AP). By modeling
the positions of interfering APs and user equipments (UEs) as Poisson
distributed, analytical expressions for the statistics of the cross-mode
interference generated by either APs or UEs are obtained based on appropriately
defined density functions. The considered system model and analysis are general
enough to capture many operational scenarios of practical interest, including
conventional downlink/uplink transmissions with nearest AP association, as well
as transmissions where not both communicating nodes lie within the same cell.
Analysis provides insights on the level of protection offered by a Voronoi
guard region and its dependence on type of interference and receiver position.
Numerical examples demonstrate the validity/accuracy of the analysis in
obtaining the system coverage probability for operational scenarios of
practical interest.

 <dc:title>A Sampling Framework for Solving Physics-driven Inverse Source Problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Partial differential equations are central to describing many physical
phenomena. In many applications these phenomena are observed through a sensor
network, with the aim of inferring their underlying properties. Leveraging from
certain results in sampling and approximation theory, we present a new
framework for solving a class of inverse source problems for physical fields
governed by linear partial differential equations. Specifically, we demonstrate
that the unknown field sources can be recovered from a sequence of, so called,
generalised measurements by using multidimensional frequency estimation
techniques. Next we show that---for physics-driven fields---this sequence of
generalised measurements can be estimated by computing a linear weighted-sum of
the sensor measurements; whereby the exact weights (of the sums) correspond to
those that reproduce multidimensional exponentials, when used to linearly
combine translates of a particular prototype function related to the Green's
function of our underlying field. Explicit formulae are then derived for the
sequence of weights, that map sensor samples to the exact sequence of
generalised measurements when the Green's function satisfies the generalised
Strang-Fix condition. Otherwise, the same mapping yields a close approximation
of the generalised measurements. Based on this new framework we develop
practical, noise robust, sensor network strategies for solving the inverse
source problem, and then present numerical simulation results to verify their
performance.

 <dc:title>Towards a Theory of Complexity of Regular Languages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Brzozowski, Janusz A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We survey recent results concerning the complexity of regular languages
represented by their minimal deterministic finite automata. In addition to the
quotient complexity of the language -- which is the number of its (left)
quotients, and is the same as its state complexity -- we also consider the size
of its syntactic semigroup and the quotient complexity of its atoms -- basic
components of every regular language. We then turn to the study of the
quotient/state complexity of common operations on regular languages: reversal,
(Kleene) star, product (concatenation) and boolean operations. We examine
relations among these complexity measures. We discuss several subclasses of
regular languages defined by convexity. In many, but not all, cases there exist
&quot;most complex&quot; languages, languages satisfying all these complexity measures.

 <dc:description>  Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN) open an interdisciplinary area within
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) research, with a tremendous impact in healthcare
area where sensors are used to monitor, collect and transmit biological
parameters of the human body. We propose the rst network-MAC cross-layer
broadcast protocol in WBAN. Our protocol, evaluated in the OMNET++ simulator
enriched with realistic human body mobility models and channel models issued
from the recent research on biomedical and health informatics, outperforms
existing at broadcast strategies in terms of percentage of covered nodes,
energy consumption and correct reception of causally-ordered packets (i.e.
packets are received in the same order as they were sent by the sink).
Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of both existing at broadcast
strategies and our new protocol face to various transmission rates and human
body mobility. Existing at broadcast strategies without exception start to have
a drastic drop of performances for transmission rates above 11Kb/s while our
cross-layer protocol performances maintains its good performances for
transmission rates up to 190Kb/s.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the information retrieval (IR) community has witnessed the
first successful applications of deep neural network models to short-text
matching and ad-hoc retrieval. It is exciting to see the research on deep
neural networks and IR converge on these tasks of shared interest. However, the
two communities have less in common when it comes to the choice of programming
languages. Indri, an indexing framework popularly used by the IR community, is
written in C++, while Torch, a popular machine learning library for deep
learning, is written in the light-weight scripting language Lua. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Luandri (pronounced &quot;laundry&quot;), a simple interface for
exposing the search capabilities of Indri to Torch models implemented in Lua.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The novel Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization (UORO) algorithm allows for
online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent
network models. It works in a streaming fashion and avoids backtracking through
past activations and inputs. UORO is computationally as costly as Truncated
Backpropagation Through Time (truncated BPTT), a widespread algorithm for
online learning of recurrent networks. UORO is a modification of NoBackTrack
that bypasses the need for model sparsity and makes implementation easy in
current deep learning frameworks, even for complex models.
  Like NoBackTrack, UORO provides unbiased gradient estimates; unbiasedness is
the core hypothesis in stochastic gradient descent theory, without which
convergence to a local optimum is not guaranteed. On the contrary, truncated
BPTT does not provide this property, leading to possible divergence.
  On synthetic tasks where truncated BPTT is shown to diverge, UORO converges.
For instance, when a parameter has a positive short-term but negative long-term
influence, truncated BPTT diverges unless the truncation span is very
significantly longer than the intrinsic temporal range of the interactions,
while UORO performs well thanks to the unbiasedness of its gradients.

 <dc:description>  The recent breakthrough paper by Calude et al. has given the first algorithm
for solving parity games in quasi-polynomial time, where previously the best
algorithms were mildly subexponential. We devise an alternative
quasi-polynomial time algorithm based on progress measures, which allows us to
reduce the space required from quasi-polynomial to nearly linear. Our key
technical tools are a novel concept of ordered tree coding, and a succinct tree
coding result that we prove using bounded adaptive multi-counters, both of
which are interesting in their own right.

 <dc:description>  Social contact networks underlying epidemic processes in humans and animals
are highly dynamic. The spreading of infections on such temporal networks can
differ dramatically from spreading on static networks. We theoretically
investigate the effects of concurrency, the number of neighbors that a node has
at a given time point, on the epidemic threshold in the stochastic
susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on temporal network models. We show
that network dynamics can suppress epidemics (i.e., yield a higher epidemic
threshold) when the nodes' concurrency is low, but can also enhance epidemics
when the concurrency is high. We analytically determine different phases of
this concurrency-induced transition, and confirm our results with numerical
simulations.

 <dc:description>  The prevalence of smart mobile devices has promoted the popularity of mobile
applications (a.k.a. apps). Supporting mobility has become a promising trend in
software engineering research. This article presents an empirical study of
behavioral service profiles collected from millions of users whose devices are
deployed with Wandoujia, a leading Android app store service in China. The
dataset of Wandoujia service profiles consists of two kinds of user behavioral
data from using 0.28 million free Android apps, including (1) app management
activities (i.e., downloading, updating, and uninstalling apps) from over 17
million unique users and (2) app network usage from over 6 million unique
users. We explore multiple aspects of such behavioral data and present patterns
of app usage. Based on the findings as well as derived knowledge, we also
suggest some new open opportunities and challenges that can be explored by the
research community, including app development, deployment, delivery, revenue,
etc.

 <dc:description>  Caching popular contents at the edge of the network can positively impact the
performance and future sustainability of wireless networks in several ways,
e.g., end-to-end access delay reduction and peak rate increase. In this paper,
we aim at showing that non-negligible performance enhancements can be observed
in terms of network interference footprint as well. To this end, we consider a
full-duplex small-cell network consisting of non-cooperative cache-aided base
stations, which communicate simultaneously with both downlink users and
wireless backhaul nodes. We propose a novel caching model seeking to mimic a
geographical policy based on local files popularity and calculate the
corresponding cache hit probability. Subsequently we study the performance of
the considered network in terms of throughput gain with respect to its
cache-free half-duplex counterpart. Numerical results corroborate our
theoretical findings and highlight remarkable performance gains when moving
from cache-free to cache-aided full-duplex small-cell networks.

 <dc:description>  Our world can be succinctly and compactly described as structured scenes of
objects and relations. A typical room, for example, contains salient objects
such as tables, chairs and books, and these objects typically relate to each
other by their underlying causes and semantics. This gives rise to correlated
features, such as position, function and shape. Humans exploit knowledge of
objects and their relations for learning a wide spectrum of tasks, and more
generally when learning the structure underlying observed data. In this work,
we introduce relation networks (RNs) - a general purpose neural network
architecture for object-relation reasoning. We show that RNs are capable of
learning object relations from scene description data. Furthermore, we show
that RNs can act as a bottleneck that induces the factorization of objects from
entangled scene description inputs, and from distributed deep representations
of scene images provided by a variational autoencoder. The model can also be
used in conjunction with differentiable memory mechanisms for implicit relation
discovery in one-shot learning tasks. Our results suggest that relation
networks are a potentially powerful architecture for solving a variety of
problems that require object relation reasoning.

 <dc:title>Game-theoretic Model of Computation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yamada, Norihiro</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The present paper introduces an intrinsic notion of &quot;(effective)
computability&quot; in game semantics motivated by the fact that strategies in game
semantics have been defined recursive if they are &quot;computable in an extrinsic
sense&quot;, i.e., they are representable by partial recursive functions, and so it
has been difficult to regard game semantics as an autonomous foundation of
computation. As a consequence, we have formulated a general notion of
&quot;algorithms&quot; under the name of effective strategies, giving rise to a
mathematical model of computation in the same sense as Turing machines but
beyond computation on natural numbers, e.g., higher-order one, solely in terms
of games and strategies. It subsumes computation of the programming language
PCF, and so it is in particular Turing complete. Notably, effective strategies
have a natural notion of types (i.e., games) unlike Turing machines, while they
are non-inductively defined as opposed to partial recursive functions as well
as semantic in contrast with lambda-calculi and combinatory logic. Thus, in a
sense, we have captured a mathematical (or semantic) notion of computation (and
computability) that is more general than the &quot;classical ones&quot; in a fundamental
level. Exploiting the flexibility of game semantics, our game-theoretic model
of computation is intended to give a mathematical foundation of various
(constructive) logics and programming languages.

 <dc:description>  The notion of a Private Information Retrieval (PIR) code was recently
introduced by Fazeli, Vardy and Yaakobi who showed that this class of codes
permit PIR at reduced levels of storage overhead in comparison with
replicated-server PIR. In the present paper, the construction of an $(n,k)$
$\tau$-server binary, linear PIR code having parameters $n = \sum\limits_{i =
0}^{\ell} {m \choose i}$, $k = {m \choose \ell}$ and $\tau = 2^{\ell}$ is
presented. These codes are obtained through homogeneous-polynomial evaluation
and correspond to the binary, Projective Reed Muller (PRM) code. The
construction can be extended to yield PIR codes for any $\tau$ of the form
$2^{\ell}$, $2^{\ell}-1$ and any value of $k$, through a combination of
single-symbol puncturing and shortening of the PRM code. Each of these code
constructions above, have smaller storage overhead in comparison with other PIR
codes appearing in the literature.
  For the particular case of $\tau=3,4$, we show that the codes constructed
here are optimal, systematic PIR codes by providing an improved lower bound on
the block length $n(k, \tau)$ of a systematic PIR code. It follows from a
result by Vardy and Yaakobi, that these codes also yield optimal, systematic
primitive multi-set $(n, k, \tau)_B$ batch codes for $\tau=3,4$. The PIR code
constructions presented here also yield upper bounds on the generalized Hamming
weights of binary PRM codes.

 <dc:description>  Computations have helped elucidate the dynamics of Earth's mantle for several
decades already. The numerical methods that underlie these simulations have
greatly evolved within this time span, and today include dynamically changing
and adaptively refined meshes, sophisticated and efficient solvers, and
parallelization to large clusters of computers. At the same time, many of these
methods -- discussed in detail in a previous paper in this series -- were
developed and tested primarily using model problems that lack many of the
complexities that are common to the realistic models our community wants to
solve today.
  With several years of experience solving complex and realistic models, we
here revisit some of the algorithm designs of the earlier paper and discuss the
incorporation of more complex physics. In particular, we re-consider time
stepping and mesh refinement algorithms, evaluate approaches to incorporate
compressibility, and discuss dealing with strongly varying material
coefficients, latent heat, and how to track chemical compositions and
heterogeneities. Taken together and implemented in a high-performance,
massively parallel code, the techniques discussed in this paper then allow for
high resolution, 3d, compressible, global mantle convection simulations with
phase transitions, strongly temperature dependent viscosity and realistic
material properties based on mineral physics data.

 <dc:description>  Information systems with witnesses have been introduced in [D. Spreen.
Generalised information systems capture L-domains. arXiv:1610.02260v2] as a
logic-style representation of L-domains: The category of such information
systems with approximable mappings as morphisms is equivalent to the category
of L-domains with Scott continuous functions, which is known to be Cartesian
closed. In the present paper a direct proof of the Cartesian closure of the
category of information systems with witnesses and approximable mapppings is
given. As is shown, the collection of approximable mappings between two
information systems with witnesses comes with a natural information system
structure.

 <dc:description>  Keypoint detection is one of the most important pre-processing steps in tasks
such as face modeling, recognition and verification. In this paper, we present
an iterative method for Keypoint Estimation and Pose prediction of
unconstrained faces by Learning Efficient H-CNN Regressors (KEPLER) for
addressing the face alignment problem. Recent state of the art methods have
shown improvements in face keypoint detection by employing Convolution Neural
Networks (CNNs). Although a simple feed forward neural network can learn the
mapping between input and output spaces, it cannot learn the inherent
structural dependencies. We present a novel architecture called H-CNN
(Heatmap-CNN) which captures structured global and local features and thus
favors accurate keypoint detecion. HCNN is jointly trained on the visibility,
fiducials and 3D-pose of the face. As the iterations proceed, the error
decreases making the gradients small and thus requiring efficient training of
DCNNs to mitigate this. KEPLER performs global corrections in pose and
fiducials for the first four iterations followed by local corrections in the
subsequent stage. As a by-product, KEPLER also provides 3D pose (pitch, yaw and
roll) of the face accurately. In this paper, we show that without using any 3D
information, KEPLER outperforms state of the art methods for alignment on
challenging datasets such as AFW and AFLW.

 <dc:description>  In search and rescue missions, time is an important factor; fast navigation
and quickly acquiring situation awareness might be matters of life and death.
Hence, the use of robots in such scenarios has been restricted by the time
needed to explore and build a map. One way to speed up exploration and mapping
is to reason about unknown parts of the environment using prior information.
While previous research on using external priors for robot mapping mainly
focused on accurate maps or aerial images, such data are not always possible to
get, especially indoor. We focus on emergency maps as priors for robot mapping
since they are easy to get and already extensively used by firemen in rescue
missions. However, those maps can be outdated, information might be missing,
and the scales of rooms are typically not consistent.
  We have developed a formulation of graph-based SLAM that incorporates
information from an emergency map. The graph-SLAM is optimized using a
combination of robust kernels, fusing the emergency map and the robot map into
one map, even when faced with scale inaccuracies and inexact start poses.
  We typically have more than 50% of wrong correspondences in the settings
studied in this paper, and the method we propose correctly handles them.
Experiments in an office environment show that we can handle up to 70% of wrong
correspondences and still get the expected result. The robot can navigate and
explore while taking into account places it has not yet seen. We demonstrate
this in a test scenario and also show that the emergency map is enhanced by
adding information not represented such as closed doors or new walls.

 <dc:description>  Text Proposals have emerged as a class-dependent version of object proposals
- efficient approaches to reduce the search space of possible text object
locations in an image. Combined with strong word classifiers, text proposals
currently yield top state of the art results in end-to-end scene text
recognition. In this paper we propose an improvement over the original Text
Proposals algorithm of Gomez and Karatzas (2016), combining it with Fully
Convolutional Networks to improve the ranking of proposals. Results on the

 <dc:title>Collective Motion under Beacon-referenced Cyclic Pursuit</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cyclic pursuit frameworks, which are built upon pursuit interactions between
neighboring agents in a cycle graph, provide an efficient way to create useful
global behaviors in a collective of autonomous robots. Previous work had
considered cyclic pursuit with a constant bearing (CB) pursuit law, and
demonstrated the existence of circling equilibria for the corresponding
dynamics. In this work, we propose a beacon-referenced version of the CB
pursuit law, wherein a stationary beacon provides an additional reference for
the individual agents in a collective. When implemented in a cyclic framework,
we show that the resulting dynamics admit relative equilibria corresponding to
a circling orbit around the beacon, with the circling radius and the
distribution of agents along the orbit determined by parameters of the proposed
pursuit law. We also derive necessary conditions for stability of the circling
equilibria, which provides a guide for parameter selection. Finally, by
introducing a change of variables, we demonstrate the existence of a family of
invariant manifolds related to spiraling motions around the beacon which
preserve the &quot;pure shape&quot; of the collective, and study the reduced dynamics on
a representative manifold.

 <dc:description>  We study a model for switching strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on
adaptive networks of player pairings that coevolve as players attempt to
maximize their return. We use a node-based strategy model wherein each player
follows one strategy at a time (cooperate or defect) across all of its
neighbors, changing that strategy and possibly changing partners in response to
local changes in the network of player pairing and in the strategies used by
connected partners. We compare and contrast numerical simulations with existing
pair approximation differential equations for describing this system, as well
as more accurate equations developed here using the framework of approximate
master equations. We explore the parameter space of the model, demonstrating
the relatively high accuracy of the approximate master equations for describing
the system observations made from simulations. We study two variations of this
partner-switching model to investigate the system evolution, predict stationary
states, and compare the total utilities and other qualitative differences
between these two model variants.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a semi-supervised discrete choice model to calibrate discrete
choice models when relatively few requests have both choice sets and stated
preferences but the majority only have the choice sets. Two classic
semi-supervised learning algorithms, the expectation maximization algorithm and
the cluster-and-label algorithm, have been adapted to our choice modeling
problem setting. We also develop two new algorithms based on the
cluster-and-label algorithm. The new algorithms use the Bayesian Information
Criterion to evaluate a clustering setting to automatically adjust the number
of clusters. Two computational studies including a hotel booking case and a
large-scale airline itinerary shopping case are presented to evaluate the
prediction accuracy and computational effort of the proposed algorithms.
Algorithmic recommendations are rendered under various scenarios.

 <dc:title>On the Bit Complexity of Sum-of-Squares Proofs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Raghavendra, Prasad</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It has often been claimed in recent papers that one can find a degree d
Sum-of-Squares proof if one exists via the Ellipsoid algorithm. In [O17], Ryan
O'Donnell notes this widely quoted claim is not necessarily true. He presents
an example of a polynomial system with bounded coeffcients that admits
low-degree proofs of non-negativity, but these proofs necessarily involve
numbers with an exponential number of bits, causing the Ellipsoid algorithm to
take exponential time. In this paper we obtain both positive and negative
results on the bit complexity of SoS proofs. First, we propose a suffcient
condition on a polynomial system that implies a bound on the coefficients in an
SoS proof. We demonstrate that this sufficient condition is applicable for
common use-cases of the SoS algorithm, such as Max-CSP, Balanced Separator,
Max- Clique, Max-Bisection, and Unit-Vector constraints. On the negative side,
O'Donnell asked whether every polynomial system containing Boolean constraints
admits proofs of polynomial bit complexity. We answer this question in the
negative, giving a counterexample system and non-negative polynomial which has
degree two SoS proofs, but no SoS proof with small coefficients until degree
Omega(sqrt(n))

that its disruptive power is compared to that of the Internet and the Web in
their early days. As a result, all the software development revolving around
the Blockchain technology is growing at a staggering rate. In this paper, we
acknowledge the need for software engineers to devise specialized tools and
techniques for blockchain-oriented software development. From current
challenges concerning the definition of new professional roles, demanding
testing activities and novel tools for software architecture, we take a step
forward by proposing new directions on the basis of a curate corpus of
blockchain-oriented software repositories, detected by exploiting the
information enclosed in the 2016 Moody's Blockchain Report and teh market
capitalization of cryptocurrencies. Ensuring effective testing activities,
enhancing collaboration in large teams, and facilitating the development of
smart contracts all appear as key factors in the future of blockchain-oriented
software development.

 <dc:description>  Current surveillance and control systems still require human supervision and
intervention. This work presents a novel automatic handgun detection system in
videos appropriate for both, surveillance and control purposes. We reformulate
this detection problem into the problem of minimizing false positives and solve
it by building the key training data-set guided by the results of a deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) classifier, then assessing the best
classification model under two approaches, the sliding window approach and
region proposal approach. The most promising results are obtained by Faster
R-CNN based model trained on our new database. The best detector show a high
potential even in low quality youtube videos and provides satisfactory results
as automatic alarm system. Among 30 scenes, it successfully activates the alarm
after five successive true positives in less than 0.2 seconds, in 27 scenes. We
also define a new metric, Alarm Activation per Interval (AApI), to assess the
performance of a detection model as an automatic detection system in videos.

 <dc:description>  Data-driven anomaly detection methods suffer from the drawback of detecting
all instances that are statistically rare, irrespective of whether the detected
instances have real-world significance or not. In this paper, we are interested
in the problem of specifically detecting anomalous instances that are known to
have high real-world utility, while ignoring the low-utility statistically
anomalous instances. To this end, we propose a novel method called Latent
Laplacian Maximum Entropy Discrimination (LatLapMED) as a potential solution.
This method uses the EM algorithm to simultaneously incorporate the Geometric
Entropy Minimization principle for identifying statistical anomalies, and the
Maximum Entropy Discrimination principle to incorporate utility labels, in
order to detect high-utility anomalies. We apply our method in both simulated
and real datasets to demonstrate that it has superior performance over existing
alternatives that independently pre-process with unsupervised anomaly detection
algorithms before classifying.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present BubbleView, an alternative methodology for eye
tracking using discrete mouse clicks to measure which information people
consciously choose to examine. BubbleView is a mouse-contingent, moving-window
interface in which participants are presented with a series of blurred images
and click to reveal &quot;bubbles&quot; - small, circular areas of the image at original
resolution, similar to having a confined area of focus like the eye fovea.
Across 10 experiments with 28 different parameter combinations, we evaluated
BubbleView on a variety of image types: information visualizations, natural
images, static webpages, and graphic designs, and compared the clicks to eye
fixations collected with eye-trackers in controlled lab settings. We found that
BubbleView clicks can both (i) successfully approximate eye fixations on
different images, and (ii) be used to rank image and design elements by
importance. BubbleView is designed to collect clicks on static images, and
works best for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information
visualization or measuring image importance. BubbleView data is cleaner and
more consistent than related methodologies that use continuous mouse movements.
Our analyses validate the use of mouse-contingent, moving-window methodologies
as approximating eye fixations for different image and task types.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Spatial Degrees of Freedom for High Data Rate Ultrasound

 <dc:description>  We propose and demonstrate an ultrasonic communication link using spatial
degrees of freedom to increase data rates for deeply implantable medical
devices. Low attenuation and millimeter wavelengths make ultrasound an ideal
communication medium for miniaturized low-power implants. While small spectral
bandwidth has drastically limited achievable data rates in conventional
ultrasonic implants, large spatial bandwidth can be exploited by using multiple
transducers in a multiple-input/multiple-output system to provide spatial
multiplexing gain without additional power, larger bandwidth, or complicated
packaging. We experimentally verify the communication link in mineral oil with
a transmitter and receiver 5 cm apart, each housing two custom-designed
mm-sized piezoelectric transducers operating at the same frequency. Two streams
of data modulated with quadrature phase-shift keying at 125 kbps are
simultaneously transmitted and received on both channels, effectively doubling
the data rate to 250 kbps with a measured bit error rate below 1e-4. We also
evaluate the performance and robustness of the channel separation network by
testing the communication link after introducing position offsets. These
results demonstrate the potential of spatial multiplexing to enable more
complex implant applications requiring higher data rates.

 <dc:title>An Analysis of Parallelized Motion Masking Using Dual-Mode Single

 <dc:description>  Motion detection in video is important for a number of applications and
fields. In video surveillance, motion detection is an essential accompaniment
to activity recognition for early warning systems. Robotics also has much to
gain from motion detection and segmentation, particularly in high speed motion
tracking for tactile systems. There are a myriad of techniques for detecting
and masking motion in an image. Successful systems have used Gaussian Models to
discern background from foreground in an image (motion from static imagery).
However, particularly in the case of a moving camera or frame of reference, it
is necessary to compensate for the motion of the camera when attempting to
discern objects moving in the foreground. For example, it is possible to
estimate motion of the camera through optical flow methods or temporal
differencing and then compensate for this motion in a background subtraction
model. We selection a method by Yi et al. using Dual-Mode Single Gaussian
Models which does just this. We implement the technique in Intel's Thread
Building Blocks (TBB) and NVIDIA's CUDA libraries. We then compare
parallelization improvements with a theoretical analysis of speedups based on
the characteristics of our selected model and attributes of both TBB and CUDA.
We make our implementation available to the public.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first introduce the NFV architecture and the use of IPv6
Segment Routing (SRv6) network programming model to support Service Function
Chaining in a NFV scenario. We describe the concepts of SR-aware and SR-unaware

The operations to support SR-aware and SR-unaware VNFs are described at an

hosted in a NFV node. The proposed solution has been implemented for a Linux
based NFV host and the software is available as Open Source. Finally, a

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a simple, yet powerful pipeline for medical image
segmentation that combines Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) with Fully
Convolutional Residual Networks (FC-ResNets). We propose and examine a design
that takes particular advantage of recent advances in the understanding of both
Convolutional Neural Networks as well as ResNets. Our approach focuses upon the
importance of a trainable pre-processing when using FC-ResNets and we show that
a low-capacity FCN model can serve as a pre-processor to normalize medical
input data. In our image segmentation pipeline, we use FCNs to obtain
normalized images, which are then iteratively refined by means of a FC-ResNet
to generate a segmentation prediction. As in other fully convolutional
approaches, our pipeline can be used off-the-shelf on different image
modalities. We show that using this pipeline, we exhibit state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging Electron Microscopy benchmark, when compared to
other 2D methods. We improve segmentation results on CT images of liver
lesions, when contrasting with standard FCN methods. Moreover, when applying
our 2D pipeline on a challenging 3D MRI prostate segmentation challenge we
reach results that are competitive even when compared to 3D methods. The
obtained results illustrate the strong potential and versatility of the
pipeline by achieving highly accurate results on multi-modality images from
different anatomical regions and organs.

 <dc:title>RIPML: A Restricted Isometry Property based Approach to Multilabel

 <dc:description>  The multilabel learning problem with large number of labels, features, and
data-points has generated a tremendous interest recently. A recurring theme of
these problems is that only a few labels are active in any given datapoint as
compared to the total number of labels. However, only a small number of
existing work take direct advantage of this inherent extreme sparsity in the
label space. By the virtue of Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), satisfied by
many random ensembles, we propose a novel procedure for multilabel learning
known as RIPML. During the training phase, in RIPML, labels are projected onto
a random low-dimensional subspace followed by solving a least-square problem in
this subspace. Inference is done by a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) based approach.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIPML by conducting extensive simulations
and comparing results with the state-of-the-art linear dimensionality reduction
based approaches.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic complexity is concerned with updating the output of a problem when
the input is slightly changed. We study the dynamic complexity of model
checking a fixed monadic second-order formula over evolving subgraphs of a
fixed maximal graph having bounded tree-width; here the subgraph evolves by
losing or gaining edges (from the maximal graph). We show that this problem is
in DynFO (with LOGSPACE precomputation), via a reduction to a Dyck reachability
problem on an acyclic automaton.

 <dc:description>  There has recently been considerable interest in completing a low-rank matrix
or tensor given only a small fraction (or few linear combinations) of its
entries. Related approaches have found considerable success in the area of
recommender systems, under machine learning. From a statistical estimation
point of view, the gold standard is to have access to the joint probability
distribution of all pertinent random variables, from which any desired optimal
estimator can be readily derived. In practice high-dimensional joint
distributions are very hard to estimate, and only estimates of low-dimensional
projections may be available. We show that it is possible to identify
higher-order joint PMFs from lower-order marginalized PMFs using coupled
low-rank tensor factorization. Our approach features guaranteed identifiability
when the full joint PMF is of low-enough rank, and effective approximation
otherwise. We provide an algorithmic approach to compute the sought factors,
and illustrate the merits of our approach using rating prediction as an
example.

 <dc:title>The Simulator: Understanding Adaptive Sampling in the

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel technique for analyzing adaptive sampling called the {\em
Simulator}. Our approach differs from the existing methods by considering not
how much information could be gathered by any fixed sampling strategy, but how
difficult it is to distinguish a good sampling strategy from a bad one given
the limited amount of data collected up to any given time. This change of
perspective allows us to match the strength of both Fano and change-of-measure
techniques, without succumbing to the limitations of either method. For
concreteness, we apply our techniques to a structured multi-arm bandit problem
in the fixed-confidence pure exploration setting, where we show that the
constraints on the means imply a substantial gap between the
moderate-confidence sample complexity, and the asymptotic sample complexity as
$\delta \to 0$ found in the literature. We also prove the first instance-based
lower bounds for the top-k problem which incorporate the appropriate
log-factors. Moreover, our lower bounds zero-in on the number of times each
\emph{individual} arm needs to be pulled, uncovering new phenomena which are
drowned out in the aggregate sample complexity. Our new analysis inspires a
simple and near-optimal algorithm for the best-arm and top-k identification,
the first {\em practical} algorithm of its kind for the latter problem which
removes extraneous log factors, and outperforms the state-of-the-art in
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Developing a Brain-Computer Interface~(BCI) for seizure prediction can help
epileptic patients have a better quality of life. However, there are many
difficulties and challenges in developing such a system as a real-life support
for patients. Because of the nonstationary nature of EEG signals, normal and
seizure patterns vary across different patients. Thus, finding a group of
manually extracted features for the prediction task is not practical. Moreover,
when using implanted electrodes for brain recording massive amounts of data are
produced. This big data calls for the need for safe storage and high
computational resources for real-time processing. To address these challenges,
a cloud-based BCI system for the analysis of this big EEG data is presented.
First, a dimensionality-reduction technique is developed to increase
classification accuracy as well as to decrease the communication bandwidth and
computation time. Second, following a deep-learning approach, a stacked
autoencoder is trained in two steps for unsupervised feature extraction and
classification. Third, a cloud-computing solution is proposed for real-time
analysis of big EEG data. The results on a benchmark clinical dataset
illustrate the superiority of the proposed patient-specific BCI as an
alternative method and its expected usefulness in real-life support of epilepsy
patients.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of efficient packet dissemination in wireless
networks with point-to-multi-point wireless broadcast channels. We propose a
dynamic policy, which achieves the broadcast capacity of the network. This
policy is obtained by first transforming the original multi-hop network into a
precedence-relaxed virtual single-hop network and then finding an optimal
broadcast policy for the relaxed network. The resulting policy is shown to be
throughput-optimal for the original wireless network using a sample-path
argument. We also prove the NP-completeness of the finite-horizon broadcast
problem, which is in contrast with the polynomial time solvability of the
problem with point-to-point channels. Illustrative simulation results
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed broadcast policy in achieving the full
broadcast capacity with low delay.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Indexes to Expedite Spatial-Visual Search</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Due to the growth of geo-tagged images, recent web and mobile applications
provide search capabilities for images that are similar to a given query image
and simultaneously within a given geographical area. In this paper, we focus on
designing index structures to expedite these spatial-visual searches. We start
by baseline indexes that are straightforward extensions of the current popular
spatial (R*-tree) and visual (LSH) index structures. Subsequently, we propose
hybrid index structures that evaluate both spatial and visual features in
tandem. The unique challenge of this type of query is that there are
inaccuracies in both spatial and visual features. Therefore, different
traversals of the index structures may produce different images as output, some
of which more relevant to the query than the others. We compare our hybrid
structures with a set of baseline indexes in both performance and result
accuracy using three real world datasets from Flickr, Google Street View, and
GeoUGV.

 <dc:title>A Correlation-Breaking Interleaving of Polar Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  It's known that the bit errors of polar codes with successive cancellation
(SC) decoding are coupled. However, existing concatenation schemes of polar
codes with other error correction codes rarely take this coupling effect into
consideration. To achieve a better BER performance, a concatenation scheme,
which divides all $N_l$ bits in a LDPC block into $N_l$ polar blocks to
completely de-correlate the possible coupled errors, is first proposed. This
interleaving is called the blind interleaving (BI) and can keep the simple SC
polar decoding while achieving a better BER performance than the
state-of-the-art (SOA) concatenation of polar codes with LDPC codes. For better
balance of performance and complexity, a novel interleaving scheme, named the
correlation-breaking interleaving (CBI), is proposed by breaking the
correlation of the errors among the correlated bits of polar codes. This CBI
scheme 1) achieves a comparable BER performance as the BI scheme with a smaller
memory size and a shorter turnaround time; 2) and enjoys a performance
robustness with reduced block lengths. Numerical results have shown that CBI
with small block lengths achieves almost the same performance at BER=$10^{-4}$
compared with CBI with block lengths $8$ times larger.

 <dc:description>  The set-membership information fusion problem is investigated for general
multisensor nonlinear dynamic systems. Compared with linear dynamic systems and
point estimation fusion in mean squared error sense, it is a more challenging
nonconvex optimization problem. Usually, to solve this problem, people try to
find an efficient or heuristic fusion algorithm. It is no doubt that an
analytical fusion formula should be much significant for rasing accuracy and
reducing computational burden. However, since it is a more complicated than the
convex quadratic optimization problem for linear point estimation fusion, it is
not easy to get the analytical fusion formula. In order to overcome the
difficulty of this problem, two popular fusion architectures are considered:
centralized and distributed set-membership information fusion. Firstly, both of
them can be converted into a semidefinite programming problem which can be
efficiently computed, respectively. Secondly, their analytical solutions can be
derived surprisingly by using decoupling technique. It is very interesting that
they are quite similar in form to the classic information filter. In the two
analytical fusion formulae, the information of each sensor can be clearly
characterized, and the knowledge of the correlation among measurement noises
across sensors are not required. Finally, multi-algorithm fusion is used to
minimize the size of the state bounding ellipsoid by complementary advantages
of multiple parallel algorithms. A typical numerical example in target tracking
demonstrates the effectiveness of the centralized, distributed, and
multi-algorithm set-membership fusion algorithms. In particular, it shows that
multi-algorithm fusion performs better than the centralized and distributed
fusion.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the interactions between different combinatorial optimisation
problems in real-world applications is a challenging task. Recently, the
traveling thief problem (TTP), as a combination of the classical traveling
salesperson problem and the knapsack problem, has been introduced to study
these interactions in a systematic way. We investigate the underlying
non-linear packing while traveling (PWT) problem of the TTP where items have to
be selected along a fixed route. We give an exact dynamic programming approach
for this problem and a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) when
maximising the benefit that can be gained over the baseline travel cost. Our
experimental investigations show that our new approaches outperform current
state-of-the-art approaches on a wide range of benchmark instances.

 <dc:description>  We propose a direct estimation method for R\'{e}nyi and f-divergence measures
based on a new graph theoretical interpretation. Suppose that we are given two
sample sets $X$ and $Y$, respectively with $N$ and $M$ samples, where
$\eta:=M/N$ is a constant value. Considering the $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN)
graph of $Y$ in the joint data set $(X,Y)$, we show that the average powered
ratio of the number of $X$ points to the number of $Y$ points among all $k$-NN
points is proportional to R\'{e}nyi divergence of $X$ and $Y$ densities. A
similar method can also be used to estimate f-divergence measures. We derive
bias and variance rates, and show that for the class of $\gamma$-H\&quot;{o}lder
smooth functions, the estimator achieves the MSE rate of
$O(N^{-2\gamma/(\gamma+d)})$. Furthermore, by using a weighted ensemble
estimation technique, for density functions with continuous and bounded
derivatives of up to the order $d$, and some extra conditions at the support
set boundary, we derive an ensemble estimator that achieves the parametric MSE
rate of $O(1/N)$. Our estimators are more computationally tractable than other
competing estimators, which makes them appealing in many practical
applications.

 <dc:title>Continuous Relaxations for the Traveling Salesman Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this work, we construct heuristic approaches for the traveling salesman
problem (TSP) based on embedding the discrete optimization problem into
continuous spaces. We explore multiple embedding techniques -- namely, the
construction of dynamical flows on the manifold of orthogonal matrices and
associated Procrustes approximations of the TSP cost function. In particular,
we find that the Procrustes approximation provides a competitive biasing
approach for the Lin--Kernighan heuristic. The Lin--Kernighan heuristic is
typically based on the computation of edges that have a &quot;high probability&quot; of
being in the shortest tour, thereby effectively pruning the search space for
the $k$-opt moves. This computation is traditionally based on generating
$1$-trees for a modified distance matrix obtained by a subgradient optimization
method. Our novel approach, instead, relies on the solution of a two-sided
orthogonal Procrustes problem, a natural relaxation of the combinatorial
optimization problem to the manifold of orthogonal matrices and the subsequent
use of this solution to bias the $k$-opt moves in the Lin--Kernighan heuristic.
Although the initial cost of computing these edges using the Procrustes
solution is higher than the 1-tree approach, we find that the Procrustes
solution, when coupled with a homotopy computation, contains valuable
information regarding the optimal edges. We explore the Procrustes based
approach on several TSP instances and find that our approach often requires
fewer $k$-opt moves.

 <dc:description>  Efficient routing is one of the key challenges for next generation vehicular
networks in order to provide fast and reliable communication in a smart city
context. Various routing protocols have been proposed for determining optimal
routing paths in highly dynamic topologies. However, it is the dilemma of those
kinds of networks that good paths are used intensively, resulting in congestion
and path quality degradation. In this paper, we adopt ideas from multipath
routing and propose a simple decentral scheme for Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET)
routing, which handles passive load balancing without requiring additional
communication effort. It can easily be applied to existing routing protocols to
achieve load balancing without changing the routing process itself. In
comprehensive simulation studies, we apply the proposed load balancing
technique to multiple example protocols and evaluate its effects on the network
performance. The results show that all considered protocols can achieve
significantly higher reliability and improved Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)
values by applying the proposed load balancing scheme.

 <dc:description>  In industrial control systems, devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) are commonly used to directly interact with sensors and actuators, and
perform local automatic control. PLCs run software on two different layers: a)
firmware (i.e. the OS) and b) control logic (processing sensor readings to
determine control actions). In this work, we discuss ladder logic bombs, i.e.
malware written in ladder logic (or one of the other IEC 61131-3-compatible
languages). Such malware would be inserted by an attacker into existing control
logic on a PLC, and either persistently change the behavior, or wait for
specific trigger signals to activate malicious behaviour. For example, the LLB
could replace legitimate sensor readings with manipulated values. We see the
concept of LLBs as a generalization of attacks such as the Stuxnet attack. We
introduce LLBs on an abstract level, and then demonstrate several designs based
on real PLC devices in our lab. In particular, we also focus on stealthy LLBs,
i.e. LLBs that are hard to detect by human operators manually validating the
program running in PLCs. In addition to introducing vulnerabilities on the
logic layer, we also discuss countermeasures and we propose two detection
techniques.

 <dc:description>  We consider the transmission of a common message from a transmitter to three
receivers over a broadcast channel, referred to as a multicast channel in this
case. All the receivers are allowed to cooperate with each other over
full-duplex bi-directional non-orthogonal cooperation links. We investigate the
information-theoretic upper and lower bounds on the transmission rate. In
particular, we propose a three-receiver fully interactive cooperation scheme
(3FC) based on superpositions of CF and DF at the receivers. In the 3FC scheme,
the receivers interactively perform compress-forward (CF) simultaneously to
initiate the scheme, and then decode-forward (DF) sequentially to allow a
correlation of each layer of the DF superposition in cooperation with the
transmitter toward the next receiver in the chain to improve the achievable
rate. The analysis leads to a closed-form expression that allows for numerical
evaluation, and also gives some insight on key points to design interactive
schemes. The numerical results provided in the Gaussian case show that the
proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes and show the benefit of
interaction.

 <dc:title>Rushing Full Speed with LTE-Advanced is Economical - A Power Consumption
  Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Boosting data rates in LTE mobile networks is one of the key features of
LTE-Advanced. This improved user experience is achieved by Carrier Aggregation
(CA), in which the available spectrum of an operator is bundled out of several
frequency bands. Accordingly, the user equipment has to supply multiple
reception chains and therefore consumes considerably more power during a
transmission. On the other hand, transmissions terminate faster, which enables
a quick switchover into energy-saving mode. In order to examine these opposed
facts, empirical analyses of existing devices are first carried out.
Subsequently, we present a new CA enhancement of an existing context-aware
power consumption model which incorporates the development density of the
environment and the mobile device mobility. Based on the extended model we
perform a detailed power consumption analysis and show that CA leads to power
savings of 31% if the data rate doubled for large file transmissions. In
addition, we show that CA can lead to power savings even from a data rate
increase of 25%, regardless of mobility and urban development density. Besides,
the measurement results show that CA operated in the same band leads to a lower
power consumption than inter-band CA.

 <dc:description>  The LHCb experiment stores around $10^{11}$ collision events per year. A
typical physics analysis deals with a final sample of up to $10^7$ events.
Event preselection algorithms (lines) are used for data reduction. Since the
data are stored in a format that requires sequential access, the lines are
grouped into several output file streams, in order to increase the efficiency
of user analysis jobs that read these data. The scheme efficiency heavily
depends on the stream composition. By putting similar lines together and
balancing the stream sizes it is possible to reduce the overhead. We present a
method for finding an optimal stream composition. The method is applied to a
part of the LHCb data (Turbo stream) on the stage where it is prepared for user
physics analysis. This results in an expected improvement of 15% in the speed
of user analysis jobs, and will be applied on data to be recorded in 2017.

 <dc:description>  A shape visibility representation displays a graph so that each vertex is
represented by an orthogonal polygon of a particular shape and for each edge
there is a horizontal or vertical line of sight between the polygons assigned
to its endvertices. Special shapes are rectangles, L, T, E and H-shapes, and
caterpillars. A flat rectangle is a horizontal bar of height $\epsilon&gt;0$. A
graph is 1-planar if there is a drawing in the plane such that each edge is
crossed at most once and is IC-planar if in addition no two crossing edges
share a vertex.
  We show that every IC-planar graph has a flat rectangle visibility
representation and that every 1-planar graph has a T-shape visibility
representation. The representations use quadratic area and can be computed in
linear time from a given embedding.

 <dc:description>  People can refer to quantities in a visual scene by using either exact
cardinals (e.g. one, two, three) or natural language quantifiers (e.g. few,
most, all). In humans, these two processes underlie fairly different cognitive
and neural mechanisms. Inspired by this evidence, the present study proposes
two models for learning the objective meaning of cardinals and quantifiers from
visual scenes containing multiple objects. We show that a model capitalizing on
a 'fuzzy' measure of similarity is effective for learning quantifiers, whereas
the learning of exact cardinals is better accomplished when information about
number is provided.

 <dc:title>Magnetic MIMO Signal Processing and Optimization for Wireless Power

 <dc:description>  In magnetic resonant coupling (MRC) enabled multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, multiple transmitters (TXs) each
with one single coil are used to enhance the efficiency of simultaneous power
transfer to multiple single-coil receivers (RXs) by constructively combining
their induced magnetic fields at the RXs, a technique termed &quot;magnetic
beamforming&quot;. In this paper, we study the optimal magnetic beamforming design
in a multi-user MIMO MRC-WPT system. We introduce the multi-user power region
that constitutes all the achievable power tuples for all RXs, subject to the
given total power constraint over all TXs as well as their individual peak
voltage and current constraints. We characterize each boundary point of the
power region by maximizing the sum-power deliverable to all RXs subject to
their minimum harvested power constraints. For the special case without the TX
peak voltage and current constraints, we derive the optimal TX current
allocation for the single-RX setup in closed-form as well as that for the
multi-RX setup. In general, the problem is a non-convex quadratically
constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), which is difficult to solve. For the
case of one single RX, we show that the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the
problem is tight. For the general case with multiple RXs, based on SDR we
obtain two approximate solutions by applying time-sharing and randomization,
respectively. Moreover, for practical implementation of magnetic beamforming,
we propose a novel signal processing method to estimate the magnetic MIMO
channel due to the mutual inductances between TXs and RXs. Numerical results
show that our proposed magnetic channel estimation and adaptive beamforming
schemes are practically effective, and can significantly improve the power
transfer efficiency and multi-user performance trade-off in MIMO MRC-WPT
systems.

 <dc:description>  Betweenness is a well-known centrality measure that ranks the nodes according
to their participation in the shortest paths of a network. In several
scenarios, having a high betweenness can have a positive impact on the node
itself. Hence, in this paper we consider the problem of determining how much a
vertex can increase its centrality by creating a limited amount of new edges
incident to it. In particular, we study the problem of maximizing the
betweenness score of a given node -- Maximum Betweenness Improvement (MBI) --
and that of maximizing the ranking of a given node -- Maximum Ranking
Improvement (MRI). We show that MBI cannot be approximated in polynomial-time
within a factor $(1-\frac{1}{2e})$ and that MRI does not admit any
polynomial-time constant factor approximation algorithm, both unless $P=NP$. We
then propose a simple greedy approximation algorithm for MBI with an almost
tight approximation ratio and we test its performance on several real-world
networks. We experimentally show that our algorithm highly increases both the
betweenness score and the ranking of a given node ant that it outperforms
several competitive baselines. To speed up the computation of our greedy
algorithm, we also propose a new dynamic algorithm for updating the betweenness
of one node after an edge insertion, which might be of independent interest.
Using the dynamic algorithm, we are now able to compute an approximation of MBI
on networks with up to $10^5$ edges in most cases in a matter of seconds or a
few minutes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate a multi-node multi-antenna wireless-powered
sensor networks (WPSN) comprised of one power beacon and multiple sensor nodes.
We have implemented a real-life multi-node multi-antenna WPSN testbed that
operates in real time. We propose a beam-splitting beamforming technique that
enables a power beacon to split microwave energy beams towards multiple nodes
for simultaneous charging. We experimentally demonstrate that the
beam-splitting beamforming technique achieves the Pareto optimality. For a
perpetual operation of the sensor nodes, we adopt an energy neutral control
algorithm that keeps a sensor node alive by balancing the harvested and the
consumed power. The joint beam-splitting and energy neutral control algorithm
is designed by means of the Lyapunov optimization technique. By experiments, we
have shown that the proposed algorithm can successfully keep all sensor nodes
alive by optimally splitting energy beams towards multiple sensor nodes.

 <dc:description>  Operational maturity of biological control systems have fuelled the
inspiration for a large number of mathematical and logical models for control,
automation and optimisation. The human brain represents the most sophisticated
control architecture known to us and is a central motivation for several
research attempts across various domains. In the present work, we introduce an
algorithm for mathematical optimisation that derives its intuition from the
hierarchical and distributed operations of the human motor system. The system
comprises global leaders, local leaders and an effector population that adapt
dynamically to attain global optimisation via a feedback mechanism coupled with
the structural hierarchy. The hierarchical system operation is distributed into
local control for movement and global controllers that facilitate gross motion
and decision making. We present our algorithm as a variant of the classical
Differential Evolution algorithm, introducing a hierarchical crossover
operation. The discussed approach is tested exhaustively on standard test
functions as well as the CEC 2017 benchmark. Our algorithm significantly
outperforms various standard algorithms as well as their popular variants as
discussed in the results.

 <dc:description>  Technological evolution of mobile user equipments (UEs), such as smartphones
or laptops, goes hand-in-hand with evolution of new mobile applications.
However, running computationally demanding applications at the UEs is
constrained by limited battery capacity and energy consumption of the UEs.
Suitable solution extending the battery life-time of the UEs is to offload the
applications demanding huge processing to a conventional centralized cloud
(CC). Nevertheless, this option introduces significant execution delay
consisting in delivery of the offloaded applications to the cloud and back plus
time of the computation at the cloud. Such delay is inconvenient and make the
offloading unsuitable for real-time applications. To cope with the delay
problem, a new emerging concept, known as mobile edge computing (MEC), has been
introduced. The MEC brings computation and storage resources to the edge of
mobile network enabling to run the highly demanding applications at the UE
while meeting strict delay requirements. The MEC computing resources can be
exploited also by operators and third parties for specific purposes. In this
paper, we first describe major use cases and reference scenarios where the MEC
is applicable. After that we survey existing concepts integrating MEC
functionalities to the mobile networks and discuss current advancement in
standardization of the MEC. The core of this survey is, then, focused on
user-oriented use case in the MEC, i.e., computation offloading. In this
regard, we divide the research on computation offloading to three key areas: i)
decision on computation offloading, ii) allocation of computing resource within
the MEC, and iii) mobility management. Finally, we highlight lessons learned in
area of the MEC and we discuss open research challenges yet to be addressed in
order to fully enjoy potentials offered by the MEC.

 <dc:description>  Experimental testing of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) has been performed
to evaluate the performance of two low-level controllers when displacement and
drag properties are time-varying and uncertain. The USV is a 4.3 meter long,
150 kilogram wave adaptive modular vessel (WAM-V) with an inflatable twin hull
configuration and waterjet propulsion. Open loop maneuvering tests were
conducted to characterize the dynamics of the vehicle. The hydrodynamic
coefficients of the vehicle were determined through system identification of
the maneuvering data and were used for simulations during control system
development. The resulting controllers were experimentally field tested
on-water. Variable mass and drag tests show that the vehicle is best controlled
by a model reference adaptive backstepping speed and heading controller. The
backstepping controller developed by Liao et. al (2010) is modified to account
for an overprediction of necessary control action and motor saturation. It is
shown that when an adaptive algorithm is implemented for the surge control
subsystem of the modified backstepping controller, the effects of variable mass
and drag are mitigated.

learning and signal processing. Because of these nonlinearities, conventional
estimators based on empirical risk minimization generally involve solving a
non-convex optimization program. We propose anchored regression, a new approach
based on convex programming that amounts to maximizing a linear functional
(perhaps augmented by a regularizer) over a convex set. The proposed convex
program is formulated in the natural space of the problem, and avoids the
introduction of auxiliary variables, making it computationally favorable.
Working in the native space also provides great flexibility as structural
priors (e.g., sparsity) can be seamlessly incorporated.
  For our analysis, we model the equations as being drawn from a fixed set
according to a probability law. Our main results provide guarantees on the
accuracy of the estimator in terms of the number of equations we are solving,
the amount of noise present, a measure of statistical complexity of the random
equations, and the geometry of the regularizer at the true solution. We also
provide recipes for constructing the anchor vector (that determines the linear
functional to maximize) directly from the observed data.

 <dc:description>  In 1979 Valiant showed that the complexity class VP_e of families with
polynomially bounded formula size is contained in the class VP_s of families
that have algebraic branching programs (ABPs) of polynomially bounded size.
Motivated by the problem of separating these classes we study the topological
closure VP_e-bar, i.e. the class of polynomials that can be approximated
arbitrarily closely by polynomials in VP_e. We describe VP_e-bar with a
strikingly simple complete polynomial (in characteristic different from 2)
whose recursive definition is similar to the Fibonacci numbers. Further
understanding this polynomial seems to be a promising route to new formula
lower bounds.
  Our methods are rooted in the study of ABPs of small constant width. In 1992
Ben-Or and Cleve showed that formula size is polynomially equivalent to width-3
ABP size. We extend their result (in characteristic different from 2) by
showing that approximate formula size is polynomially equivalent to approximate
width-2 ABP size. This is surprising because in 2011 Allender and Wang gave
explicit polynomials that cannot be computed by width-2 ABPs at all! The
details of our construction lead to the aforementioned characterization of
VP_e-bar.
  As a natural continuation of this work we prove that the class VNP can be
described as the class of families that admit a hypercube summation of
polynomially bounded dimension over a product of polynomially many affine
linear forms. This gives the first separations of algebraic complexity classes
from their nondeterministic analogs.

 <dc:description>  We investigate languages recognized by well structured transition systems
(WSTS) with upward (resp. downward) compatibility. We show that under mild
assumptions every two disjoint WSTS languages are regular separable, i.e.,
there exists a regular language containing one of them and disjoint from the
other. In particular, if a language, as well as its complement, are both
recognized by a WSTS, then they are necessarily regular.

 <dc:description>  Let $(I,+)$ be a finite abelian group and $\mathbf{A}$ be a circular
convolution operator on $\ell^2(I)$. The problem under consideration is how to
construct minimal $\Omega \subset I$ and $l_i$ such that $Y=\{\mathbf{e}_i,
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{e}_i, \cdots, \mathbf{A}^{l_i}\mathbf{e}_i: i\in \Omega\}$ is
a frame for $\ell^2(I)$, where $\{\mathbf{e}_i: i\in I\}$ is the canonical
basis of $\ell^2(I)$. This problem is motivated by the spatiotemporal sampling
problem in discrete spatially invariant evolution systems. We will show that
the cardinality of $\Omega $ should be at least equal to the largest geometric
multiplicity of eigenvalues of $\mathbf{A}$, and we consider the universal
spatiotemporal sampling sets $(\Omega, l_i)$ for convolution operators
$\mathbf{A}$ with eigenvalues subject to the same largest geometric
multiplicity. We will give an algebraic characterization for such sampling sets
and show how this problem is linked with sparse signal processing theory and
polynomial interpolation theory.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we define the overflow problem of a network coding storage
system in which the encoding parameter and the storage parameter are
mismatched. Through analyses and experiments, we first show the impacts of the
overflow problem in a network coding scheme, which not only waste storage
spaces, but also degrade coding efficiency. To avoid the overflow problem, we
then develop the network coding based secure storage (NCSS) scheme. Thanks to
considering both security and storage requirements in encoding procedures and
distributed architectures, the NCSS can improve the performance of a cloud
storage system from both the aspects of storage cost and coding processing
time. We analyze the maximum allowable stored encoded data under the perfect
secrecy criterion, and provide the design guidelines for the secure cloud
storage system to enhance coding efficiency and achieve the minimal storage
cost.

that enables network administrators to detect and mitigate prefix hijacking
incidents, against their own prefixes. ARTEMIS is based on the real-time
monitoring of BGP data in the Internet, and software-defined networking (SDN)
principles, and can completely mitigate a prefix hijacking within a few minutes
(e.g., 5-6 mins in our experiments) after it has been launched.

 <dc:description>  Influence maximization is the problem of finding influential users, or nodes,
in a graph so as to maximize the spread of information. It has many
applications in advertising and marketing on social networks. In this paper, we
study a highly generic version of influence maximization, one of optimizing
influence campaigns by sequentially selecting &quot;spread seeds&quot; from a set of
influencers, a small subset of the node population, under the hypothesis that,
in a given campaign, previously activated nodes remain &quot;persistently&quot; active
throughout and thus do not yield further rewards. This problem is in particular
relevant for an important form of online marketing, known as influencer
marketing, in which the marketers target a sub-population of influential
people, instead of the entire base of potential buyers. Importantly, we make no
assumptions on the underlying diffusion model and we work in a setting where
neither a diffusion network nor historical activation data are available. We
call this problem online influencer marketing with persistence (in short,
OIMP). We first discuss motivating scenarios and present our general approach.
We introduce an estimator on the influencers' remaining potential -- the
expected number of nodes that can still be reached from a given influencer --
and justify its strength to rapidly estimate the desired value, relying on real
data gathered from Twitter. We then describe a novel algorithm, GT-UCB, relying
on upper confidence bounds on the remaining potential. We show that our
approach leads to high-quality spreads on both simulated and real datasets,
even though it makes almost no assumptions on the diffusion medium.
Importantly, it is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art influence
maximization methods, making it possible to deal with large-scale online
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Until now mean-field-type game theory was not focused on
cognitively-plausible models of choices in humans, animals, machines, robots,
software-defined and mobile devices strategic interactions. This work presents
some effects of users' psychology in mean-field-type games. In addition to the
traditional &quot;material&quot; payoff modelling, psychological patterns are introduced
in order to better capture and understand behaviors that are observed in
engineering practice or in experimental settings. The psychological payoff
value depends upon choices, mean-field states, mean-field actions, empathy and
beliefs. It is shown that the affective empathy enforces mean-field equilibrium
payoff equity and improves fairness between the players. It establishes
equilibrium systems for such interactive decision-making problems. Basic
empathy concepts are illustrated in several important problems in engineering
including resource sharing, packet collision minimization, energy markets, and
forwarding in Device-to-Device communications. The work conducts also an
experiment with 47 people who have to decide whether to cooperate or not. The
basic Interpersonal Reactivity Index of empathy metrics were used to measure
the empathy distribution of each participant. Android app called Empathizer is
developed to analyze systematically the data obtained from the participants.
The experimental results reveal that the dominated strategies of the classical
game theory are not dominated any more when users' psychology is involved, and
a significant level of cooperation is observed among the users who are
positively partially empathetic.

algorithmic point of view, and develops topological tools for improved
algorithms. We survey results in computational topology that are concerned with
graphs drawn on surfaces. Typical questions include representing surfaces and
graphs embedded on them computationally, deciding whether a graph embeds on a
surface, solving computational problems related to homotopy, optimizing curves
and graphs on surfaces, and solving standard graph algorithm problems more
efficiently in the case of surface-embedded graphs.

 <dc:description>  Strategic decision making involves affective and cognitive functions like
reasoning, cognitive and emotional empathy which may be subject to age and
gender differences. However, empathy-related changes in strategic
decision-making and their relation to age, gender and neuropsychological
functions have not been studied widely. In this article, we study a one-shot
prisoner dilemma from a psychological game theory viewpoint. Forty seven
participants (28 women and 19 men), aged 18 to 42 years, were tested with a
empathy questionnaire and a one-shot prisoner dilemma questionnaire comprising
a closiness option with the other participant. The percentage of cooperation
and defection decisions was analyzed. A new empathetic payoff model was
calculated to fit the observations from the test whether multi-dimensional
empathy levels matter in the outcome. A significant level of cooperation is
observed in the experimental one-shot game. The collected data suggests that
perspective taking, empathic concern and fantasy scale are strongly correlated
and have an important effect on cooperative decisions. However, their effect in
the payoff is not additive. Mixed scales as well as other non-classified
subscales (25+8 out of 47) were observed from the data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce the novel framework of distributionally robust
games. These are multi-player games where each player models the state of
nature using a worst-case distribution, also called adversarial distribution.
Thus each player's payoff depends on the other players' decisions and on the
decision of a virtual player (nature) who selects an adversarial distribution
of scenarios. This paper provides three main contributions. Firstly, the
distributionally robust game is formulated using the statistical notions of
$f$-divergence between two distributions, here represented by the adversarial
distribution, and the exact distribution. Secondly, the complexity of the
problem is significantly reduced by means of triality theory. Thirdly,
stochastic Bregman learning algorithms are proposed to speedup the computation
of robust equilibria. Finally, the theoretical findings are illustrated in a
convex setting and its limitations are tested with a non-convex non-concave
function.

adoption are the understandable and intuitive nature of the task, its
relatively small size and storage requirements and the accessibility and
ease-of-use of the database itself. The MNIST database was derived from a
larger dataset known as the NIST Special Database 19 which contains digits,
uppercase and lowercase handwritten letters. This paper introduces a variant of
the full NIST dataset, which we have called Extended MNIST (EMNIST), which
follows the same conversion paradigm used to create the MNIST dataset. The
result is a set of datasets that constitute a more challenging classification
tasks involving letters and digits, and that shares the same image structure
and parameters as the original MNIST task, allowing for direct compatibility
with all existing classifiers and systems. Benchmark results are presented
along with a validation of the conversion process through the comparison of the
classification results on converted NIST digits and the MNIST digits.

 <dc:title>Domain Adaptation for Visual Applications: A Comprehensive Survey</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Csurka, Gabriela</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to give an overview of domain adaptation and
transfer learning with a specific view on visual applications. After a general
motivation, we first position domain adaptation in the larger transfer learning
problem. Second, we try to address and analyze briefly the state-of-the-art
methods for different types of scenarios, first describing the historical
shallow methods, addressing both the homogeneous and the heterogeneous domain
adaptation methods. Third, we discuss the effect of the success of deep
convolutional architectures which led to new type of domain adaptation methods
that integrate the adaptation within the deep architecture. Fourth, we overview
the methods that go beyond image categorization, such as object detection or
image segmentation, video analyses or learning visual attributes. Finally, we
conclude the paper with a section where we relate domain adaptation to other
machine learning solutions.

 <dc:description>  Being an unsupervised machine learning and data mining technique,
biclustering and its multimodal extensions are becoming popular tools for
analysing object-attribute data in different domains. Apart from conventional
clustering techniques, biclustering is searching for homogeneous groups of
objects while keeping their common description, e.g., in binary setting, their
shared attributes. In bioinformatics, biclustering is used to find genes, which
are active in a subset of situations, thus being candidates for biomarkers.
However, the authors of those biclustering techniques that are popular in gene
expression analysis, may overlook the existing methods. For instance, BiMax
algorithm is aimed at finding biclusters, which are well-known for decades as
formal concepts. Moreover, even if bioinformatics classify the biclustering
methods according to reasonable domain-driven criteria, their classification
taxonomies may be different from survey to survey and not full as well. So, in
this paper we propose to use concept lattices as a tool for taxonomy building
(in the biclustering domain) and attribute exploration as means for
cross-domain taxonomy completion.

 <dc:description>  Wikipedia is one of the most popular sites on the Web, with millions of users
relying on it to satisfy a broad range of information needs every day. Although
it is crucial to understand what exactly these needs are in order to be able to
meet them, little is currently known about why users visit Wikipedia. The goal
of this paper is to fill this gap by combining a survey of Wikipedia readers
with a log-based analysis of user activity. Based on an initial series of user
surveys, we build a taxonomy of Wikipedia use cases along several dimensions,
capturing users' motivations to visit Wikipedia, the depth of knowledge they
are seeking, and their knowledge of the topic of interest prior to visiting
Wikipedia. Then, we quantify the prevalence of these use cases via a
large-scale user survey conducted on live Wikipedia with almost 30,000
responses. Our analyses highlight the variety of factors driving users to
Wikipedia, such as current events, media coverage of a topic, personal
curiosity, work or school assignments, or boredom. Finally, we match survey
responses to the respondents' digital traces in Wikipedia's server logs,
enabling the discovery of behavioral patterns associated with specific use
cases. For instance, we observe long and fast-paced page sequences across
topics for users who are bored or exploring randomly, whereas those using
Wikipedia for work or school spend more time on individual articles focused on
topics such as science. Our findings advance our understanding of reader
motivations and behavior on Wikipedia and can have implications for developers
aiming to improve Wikipedia's user experience, editors striving to cater to
their readers' needs, third-party services (such as search engines) providing
access to Wikipedia content, and researchers aiming to build tools such as
recommendation engines.

 <dc:title>Theorem Proving Based on Semantics of DNA Strand Graph</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Because of several technological limitations of traditional silicon based
computing, for past few years a paradigm shift, from silicon to carbon, is
occurring in computational world. DNA computing has been considered to be quite
promising in solving computational and reasoning problems by using DNA strands.
Resolution, an important aspect of automated theorem proving and mathematical
logic, is a rule of inference which leads to proof by contradiction technique
for sentences in propositional logic and first-order logic. This can also be
called refutation theorem-proving. In this paper we have shown how the theorem
proving with resolution refutation by DNA computation can be represented by the
semantics of process calculus and strand graph.

 <dc:description>  Scheduling surgeries is a challenging task due to the fundamental uncertainty
of the clinical environment, as well as the risks and costs associated with
under- and over-booking. We investigate neural regression algorithms to
estimate the parameters of surgery case durations, focusing on the issue of
heteroscedasticity. We seek to simultaneously estimate the duration of each
surgery, as well as a surgery-specific notion of our uncertainty about its
duration. Estimating this uncertainty can lead to more nuanced and effective
scheduling strategies, as we are able to schedule surgeries more efficiently
while allowing an informed and case-specific margin of error. Using surgery
records %from the UC San Diego Health System, from a large United States health
system we demonstrate potential improvements on the order of 20% (in terms of
minutes overbooked) compared to current scheduling techniques. Moreover, we
demonstrate that surgery durations are indeed heteroscedastic. We show that
models that estimate case-specific uncertainty better fit the data (log
likelihood). Additionally, we show that the heteroscedastic predictions can
more optimally trade off between over and under-booking minutes, especially
when idle minutes and scheduling collisions confer disparate costs.

 <dc:title>Stabilizing Tube-Based Model Predictive Control: Terminal Set and Cost

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a stabilizing tube-based MPC synthesis for LPV systems.
We employ terminal constraint sets which are required to be controlled
periodically contractive. Periodically (or finite-step) contractive sets are
easier to compute and can be of lower complexity than &quot;true&quot; contractive ones,
lowering the required computational effort both off-line and on-line. Under
certain assumptions on the tube parameterization, recursive feasibility of the
scheme is proven. Subsequently, asymptotic stability of the origin is
guaranteed through the construction of a suitable terminal cost based on a
novel Lyapunov-like metric for compact convex sets containing the origin. A
periodic variant on the well-known homothetic tube parameterization that
satisfies the necessary assumptions and yields a tractable LPV MPC algorithm is
derived. The resulting MPC algorithm requires the on-line solution of a single
linear program with linear complexity in the prediction horizon. The properties
of the approach are demonstrated by a numerical example.

 <dc:title>AP-initiated Multi-User Transmissions in IEEE 802.11ax WLANs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Next-generation 802.11ax WLANs will make extensive use of multi-user
communications in both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) directions to achieve high
and efficient spectrum utilization in scenarios with many user stations per
access point. It will become possible with the support of multi-user (MU)
multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division
multiple access (OFDMA) transmissions. In this paper, we first overview the
novel characteristics introduced by IEEE 802.11ax to implement AP-initiated
OFDMA and MU-MIMO transmissions in both downlink and uplink directions. Namely,
we describe the changes made at the physical layer and at the medium access
control layer to support OFDMA, the use of \emph{trigger frames} to schedule
uplink multi-user transmissions, and the new \emph{multi-user RTS/CTS
mechanism} to protect large multi-user transmissions from collisions. Then, in
order to study the achievable throughput of an 802.11ax network, we use both
mathematical analysis and simulations to numerically quantify the benefits of
MU transmissions and the impact of 802.11ax overheads on the WLAN saturation
throughput. Results show the advantages of MU transmissions in scenarios with
many user stations, also providing some novel insights on the conditions in
which 802.11ax WLANs are able to maximize their performance, such as the
existence of an optimal number of active user stations in terms of throughput,
or the need to provide strict prioritization to AP-initiated MU transmissions
to avoid collisions with user stations.

narratives in scientific literature. We take a sequence labeling approach to
this problem, and label clauses within experiment narratives to identify the
different parts of the experiment. Our dataset consists of paragraphs taken
from open access PubMed papers labeled with rhetorical information as a result
of our pilot annotation. Our model is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells that labels clauses. The clause
representations are computed by combining word representations using a novel
attention mechanism that involves a separate RNN. We compare this model against
LSTMs where the input layer has simple or no attention and a feature rich CRF
model. Furthermore, we describe how our work could be useful for information
extraction from scientific literature.

 <dc:title>Block- and Rank-Sparse Recovery for Direction Finding in Partly

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A sparse recovery approach for direction finding in partly calibrated arrays
composed of subarrays with unknown displacements is introduced. The proposed
method is based on mixed nuclear norm and 1 norm minimization and exploits
block-sparsity and low-rank structure in the signal model. For efficient
implementation a compact equivalent problem reformulation is presented. The new
technique is applicable to subarrays of arbitrary topologies and grid-based
sampling of the subarray manifolds. In the special case of subarrays with a
common baseline our new technique admits extension to a gridless
implementation. As shown by simulations, our new block- and rank-sparse
direction finding technique for partly calibrated arrays outperforms the state
of the art method RARE in difficult scenarios of low sample numbers, low
signal-to-noise ratio or correlated signals.

 <dc:description>  We define a new general model of stochastically evolving graphs, namely the
\emph{Edge-Uniform Stochastically-Evolving Graphs}. In this model, each
possible edge of an underlying general static graph evolves independently being
either alive or dead at each discrete time step of evolution following a
(Markovian) stochastic rule. The stochastic rule is identical for each possible
edge and may depend on the previous $k \ge 0$ observations of the edge's state.
  We examine two kinds of random walks for a single agent taking place in such
a dynamic graph: (i) The \emph{Random Walk with a Delay} (\emph{RWD}), where at
each step the agent chooses (uniformly at random) an incident possible edge
(i.e. an incident edge in the underlying static graph) and then it waits till
the edge becomes alive to traverse it. (ii) The more natural \emph{Random Walk
on what is Available} (\emph{RWA}) where the agent only looks at alive incident
edges at each time step and traverses one of them uniformly at random. Our
study is on bounding the \emph{cover time}, i.e. the expected time until each
node is visited at least once by the agent.
  For \emph{RWD}, we provide the first upper bounds for the cases $k = 0, 1$ by
correlating \emph{RWD} with a simple random walk on a static graph. Moreover,
we present a modified electrical network theory capturing the $k = 0$ case and
a mixing-time argument toward an upper bound for the case $k = 1$.
  For \emph{RWA}, we derive the first upper bounds for the cases $k = 0, 1$,
too, by reducing \emph{RWA} to an \emph{RWD}-equivalent walk with a modified
delay. Finally, for the case $k = 1$, we prove that when the underlying graph
is complete, then the cover time is $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ (i.e. it matches the
cover time on the static complete graph) under only a mild condition on the
edge-existence probabilities determined by the stochastic rule.

 <dc:description>  Cell nuclei segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the analysis
of biomedical images. With ever-growing sizes and amounts of three-dimensional
images to be processed, there is a need for better and faster segmentation
methods. Graph-based image segmentation has seen a rise in popularity in recent
years, but is seen as very costly with regard to computational demand. We
propose a new segmentation algorithm which overcomes these limitations. Our
method uses recursive balanced graph partitioning to segment foreground
components of a fast and efficient binarization. We construct a model for the
cell nuclei to guide the partitioning process. Our algorithm is compared to
other state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms in an experimental evaluation on
two sets of realistically simulated inputs. Our method is faster, has similar
or better quality and an acceptable memory overhead.

 <dc:description>  This article studies the Gram random matrix model $G=\frac1T\Sigma^{\rm
T}\Sigma$, $\Sigma=\sigma(WX)$, classically found in the analysis of random
feature maps and random neural networks, where $X=[x_1,\ldots,x_T]\in{\mathbb
R}^{p\times T}$ is a (data) matrix of bounded norm, $W\in{\mathbb R}^{n\times
p}$ is a matrix of independent zero-mean unit variance entries, and
$\sigma:{\mathbb R}\to{\mathbb R}$ is a Lipschitz continuous (activation)
function --- $\sigma(WX)$ being understood entry-wise. By means of a key
concentration of measure lemma arising from non-asymptotic random matrix
arguments, we prove that, as $n,p,T$ grow large at the same rate, the resolvent
$Q=(G+\gamma I_T)^{-1}$, for $\gamma&gt;0$, has a similar behavior as that met in
sample covariance matrix models, involving notably the moment
$\Phi=\frac{T}n{\mathbb E}[G]$, which provides in passing a deterministic
equivalent for the empirical spectral measure of $G$. Application-wise, this
result enables the estimation of the asymptotic performance of single-layer
random neural networks. This in turn provides practical insights into the
underlying mechanisms into play in random neural networks, entailing several
unexpected consequences, as well as a fast practical means to tune the network
hyperparameters.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present experimental studies on a cooperative control
system for human-robotic networks with inter-robot communication delays. We
first design a cooperative controller to be implemented on each robot so that
their motion are synchronized to a reference motion desired by a human
operator, and then point out that each robot motion ensures passivity.
Inter-robot communication channels are then designed via so-called scattering
transformation which is a technique to passify the delayed channel. The
resulting robotic network is then connected with human operator based on
passivity theory. In order to demonstrate the present control architecture, we
build an experimental testbed consisting of multiple robots and a tablet. In
particular, we analyze the effects of the communication delays on the human
operator's behavior.

 <dc:title>The Effect of Color Space Selection on Detectability and

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the effect of color space selection on
detectability and discriminability of colored objects under various conditions.
20 color spaces from the literature are evaluated on a large dataset of
simulated and real images. We measure the suitability of color spaces from two
different perspectives: detectability and discriminability of various color
groups. Through experimental evaluation, we found that there is no single
optimal color space suitable for all color groups. The color spaces have
different levels of sensitivity to different color groups and they are useful
depending on the color of the sought object. Overall, the best results were
achieved in both simulated and real images using color spaces C1C2C3, UVW and
XYZ. In addition, using a simulated environment, we show a practical
application of color space selection in the context of top-down control in
active visual search. The results indicate that on average color space C1C2C3
followed by HSI and XYZ achieve the best time in searching for objects of
various colors. Here, the right choice of color space can improve time of
search on average by 20%. As part of our contribution, we also introduce a
large dataset of simulated 3D objects

 <dc:description>  Block Coordinate Update (BCU) methods enjoy low per-update computational
complexity because every time only one or a few block variables would need to
be updated among possibly a large number of blocks. They are also easily
parallelized and thus have been particularly popular for solving problems
involving large-scale dataset and/or variables. In this paper, we propose a
primal-dual BCU method for solving linearly constrained convex program in
multi-block variables. The method is an accelerated version of a primal-dual
algorithm proposed by the authors, which applies randomization in selecting
block variables to update and establishes an $O(1/t)$ convergence rate under
weak convexity assumption. We show that the rate can be accelerated to
$O(1/t^2)$ if the objective is strongly convex. In addition, if one block
variable is independent of the others in the objective, we then show that the
algorithm can be modified to achieve a linear rate of convergence. The
numerical experiments show that the accelerated method performs stably with a
single set of parameters while the original method needs to tune the parameters
for different datasets in order to achieve a comparable level of performance.

 <dc:description>  The time complexity of data clustering has been viewed as fundamentally
quadratic, slowing with the number of data items, as each item is compared for
similarity to preceding items. Clustering of large data sets has been
infeasible without resorting to probabilistic methods or to capping the number
of clusters. Here we introduce MIMOSA, a novel class of algorithms which
achieve linear time computational complexity on clustering tasks. MIMOSA
algorithms mark and match partial-signature keys in a hash table to obtain
exact, error-free cluster retrieval. Benchmark measurements, on clustering a
data set of 10,000,000 news articles by news topic, found that a MIMOSA
implementation finished more than four orders of magnitude faster than a
standard centroid implementation.

 <dc:description>  Sampling from large networks represents a fundamental challenge for social
network research. In this paper, we explore the sensitivity of different
sampling techniques (node sampling, edge sampling, random walk sampling, and
snowball sampling) on social networks with attributes. We consider the special
case of networks (i) where we have one attribute with two values (e.g., male
and female in the case of gender), (ii) where the size of the two groups is
unequal (e.g., a male majority and a female minority), and (iii) where nodes
with the same or different attribute value attract or repel each other (i.e.,
homophilic or heterophilic behavior). We evaluate the different sampling
techniques with respect to conserving the position of nodes and the visibility
of groups in such networks. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic and
empirical social networks. Our results provide evidence that different network
sampling techniques are highly sensitive with regard to capturing the expected
centrality of nodes, and that their accuracy depends on relative group size
differences and on the level of homophily that can be observed in the network.
We conclude that uninformed sampling from social networks with attributes thus
can significantly impair the ability of researchers to draw valid conclusions
about the centrality of nodes and the visibility or invisibility of groups in
social networks.

 <dc:description>  With the range and sensitivity of algorithmic decisions expanding at a
break-neck speed, it is imperative that we aggressively investigate whether
programs are biased. We propose a novel probabilistic program analysis
technique and apply it to quantifying bias in decision-making programs.
Specifically, we (i) present a sound and complete automated verification
technique for proving quantitative properties of probabilistic programs; (ii)
show that certain notions of bias, recently proposed in the fairness
literature, can be phrased as quantitative correctness properties; and (iii)
present FairSquare, the first verification tool for quantifying program bias,
and evaluate it on a range of decision-making programs.

 <dc:title>Toward Abstraction from Multi-modal Data: Empirical Studies on Multiple

 <dc:description>  The abstraction tasks are challenging for multi- modal sequences as they
require a deeper semantic understanding and a novel text generation for the
data. Although the recurrent neural networks (RNN) can be used to model the
context of the time-sequences, in most cases the long-term dependencies of
multi-modal data make the back-propagation through time training of RNN tend to
vanish in the time domain. Recently, inspired from Multiple Time-scale
Recurrent Neural Network (MTRNN), an extension of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
called Multiple Time-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (MTGRU), has been proposed to
learn the long-term dependencies in natural language processing. Particularly
it is also able to accomplish the abstraction task for paragraphs given that
the time constants are well defined. In this paper, we compare the MTRNN and
MTGRU in terms of its learning performances as well as their abstraction
representation on higher level (with a slower neural activation). This was done
by conducting two studies based on a smaller data- set (two-dimension time
sequences from non-linear functions) and a relatively large data-set
(43-dimension time sequences from iCub manipulation tasks with multi-modal
data). We conclude that gated recurrent mechanisms may be necessary for
learning long-term dependencies in large dimension multi-modal data-sets (e.g.
learning of robot manipulation), even when natural language commands was not
involved. But for smaller learning tasks with simple time-sequences, generic
version of recurrent models, such as MTRNN, were sufficient to accomplish the
abstraction task.

 <dc:description>  Collaborative filtering is a broad and powerful framework for building
recommendation systems that has seen widespread adoption. Over the past decade,
the propensity of such systems for favoring popular products and thus creating
echo chambers have been observed. This has given rise to an active area of
research that seeks to diversify recommendations generated by such algorithms.
  We address the problem of increasing diversity in recommendation systems that
are based on collaborative filtering that use past ratings to predicting a
rating quality for potential recommendations. Following our earlier work, we
formulate recommendation system design as a subgraph selection problem from a
candidate super-graph of potential recommendations where both diversity and
rating quality are explicitly optimized: (1) On the modeling side, we define a
new flexible notion of diversity that allows a system designer to prescribe the
number of recommendations each item should receive, and smoothly penalizes
deviations from this distribution. (2) On the algorithmic side, we show that
minimum-cost network flow methods yield fast algorithms in theory and practice
for designing recommendation subgraphs that optimize this notion of diversity.
(3) On the empirical side, we show the effectiveness of our new model and
method to increase diversity while maintaining high rating quality in standard
rating data sets from Netflix and MovieLens.

 <dc:description>  We consider the $\#\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard problem of counting all matchings with
exactly $k$ edges in a given input graph $G$; we prove that it remains
$\#\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard on graphs $G$ that are line graphs or bipartite graphs
with degree $2$ on one side. In our proofs, we use that $k$-matchings in line
graphs can be equivalently viewed as edge-injective homomorphisms from the
disjoint union of $k$ length-$2$ paths into (arbitrary) host graphs. Here, a
homomorphism from $H$ to $G$ is edge-injective if it maps any two distinct
edges of $H$ to distinct edges in $G$. We show that edge-injective
homomorphisms from a pattern graph $H$ can be counted in polynomial time if $H$
has bounded vertex-cover number after removing isolated edges. For hereditary
classes $\mathcal{H}$ of pattern graphs, we complement this result: If the
graphs in $\mathcal{H}$ have unbounded vertex-cover number even after deleting
isolated edges, then counting edge-injective homomorphisms with patterns from
$\mathcal{H}$ is $\#\mathsf{W}[1]$-hard. Our proofs rely on an edge-colored
variant of Holant problems and a delicate interpolation argument; both may be
of independent interest.

box with an interaction class label that connects them. HOI detection is a
fundamental problem in computer vision as it provides semantic information
about the interactions among the detected objects. We introduce HICO-DET, a new
large benchmark for HOI detection, by augmenting the current HICO
classification benchmark with instance annotations. We propose Human-Object
Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (HO-RCNN), a novel DNN-based
framework for HOI detection. At the core of our HO-RCNN is the Interaction
Pattern, a novel DNN input that characterizes the spatial relations between two
bounding boxes. We validate the effectiveness of our HO-RCNN using HICO-DET.
Experiments demonstrate that our HO-RCNN, by exploiting human-object spatial
relations through Interaction Patterns, significantly improves the performance
of HOI detection over baseline approaches.

 <dc:title>Cache-Aided Content Delivery over Erasure Broadcast Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A cache-aided broadcast network is studied, in which a server delivers
contents to a group of receivers over a packet erasure broadcast channel (BC).
The receivers are divided into two sets with regards to their channel
qualities: the weak and strong receivers, where all the weak receivers have
statistically worse channel qualities than all the strong receivers. The weak
receivers, in order to compensate for the high erasure probability they
encounter over the channel, are equipped with cache memories of equal size,
while the receivers in the strong set have no caches. Data can be pre-delivered
to weak receivers' caches over the off-peak traffic period before the receivers
reveal their demands. Allowing arbitrary erasure probabilities for the weak and
strong receivers, a joint caching and channel coding scheme, which divides each
file into several subfiles, and applies a different caching and delivery scheme
for each subfile, is proposed. It is shown that all the receivers, even those
without any cache memories, benefit from the presence of caches across the
network. An information theoretic trade-off between the cache size and the
achievable rate is formulated. It is shown that the proposed scheme improves
upon the state-of-the-art in terms of the achievable trade-off.

 <dc:title>Improving the upper bound on the length of the shortest reset words</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Szyku&#x142;a, Marek</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We improve the best known upper bound on the length of the shortest reset
words of synchronizing automata. The new bound is slightly better than $114 n^3
/ 685 + O(n^2)$. The \v{C}ern\'y conjecture states that $(n-1)^2$ is an upper
bound. So far, the best general upper bound was $(n^3-n)/6-1$ obtained by
J.-E.~Pin and P.~Frankl in 1982. Despite a number of efforts, it remained
unchanged for about 35 years.
  To obtain the new upper bound we utilize avoiding words. A word is avoiding
for a state $q$ if after reading the word the automaton cannot be in $q$. We
obtain upper bounds on the length of the shortest avoiding words, and using the
approach of Trahtman from 2011 combined with the well known Frankl theorem from
1982, we improve the general upper bound on the length of the shortest reset
words. For all the bounds, there exist polynomial algorithms finding a word of
length not exceeding the bound.

 <dc:description>  LCLs or locally checkable labelling problems (e.g. maximal independent set,
maximal matching, and vertex colouring) in the LOCAL model of computation are
very well-understood in cycles (toroidal 1-dimensional grids): every problem
has a complexity of $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log^* n)$, or $\Theta(n)$, and the design
of optimal algorithms can be fully automated.
  This work develops the complexity theory of LCL problems for toroidal
2-dimensional grids. The complexity classes are the same as in the
1-dimensional case: $O(1)$, $\Theta(\log^* n)$, and $\Theta(n)$. However, given
an LCL problem it is undecidable whether its complexity is $\Theta(\log^* n)$
or $\Theta(n)$ in 2-dimensional grids.
  Nevertheless, if we correctly guess that the complexity of a problem is
$\Theta(\log^* n)$, we can completely automate the design of optimal
algorithms. For any problem we can find an algorithm that is of a normal form
$A' \circ S_k$, where $A'$ is a finite function, $S_k$ is an algorithm for
finding a maximal independent set in $k$th power of the grid, and $k$ is a
constant.
  Finally, partially with the help of automated design tools, we classify the
complexity of several concrete LCL problems related to colourings and
orientations.

 <dc:description>  Reduction of communication and efficient partitioning are key issues for
achieving scalability in hierarchical $N$-Body algorithms like FMM. In the
present work, we propose four independent strategies to improve partitioning
and reduce communication. First of all, we show that the conventional wisdom of
using space-filling curve partitioning may not work well for boundary integral
problems, which constitute about 50% of FMM's application user base. We propose
an alternative method which modifies orthogonal recursive bisection to solve
the cell-partition misalignment that has kept it from scaling previously.
Secondly, we optimize the granularity of communication to find the optimal
balance between a bulk-synchronous collective communication of the local
essential tree and an RDMA per task per cell. Finally, we take the dynamic
sparse data exchange proposed by Hoefler et al. and extend it to a hierarchical
sparse data exchange, which is demonstrated at scale to be faster than the MPI
library's MPI_Alltoallv that is commonly used.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose the Templet -- a runtime system for actor
programming of high performance computing in C++. We provide a compact source
code of the runtime system, which uses standard library of C++11 only. We
demonstrate how it differs from the classic implementations of the actor model.
The practical significance of the Templet was examined by comparative study on
the performance of three applications: the reference code in C++, managed by
the OpenMP; the actor code in C++, managed by the Templet; the actor code in
Java, managed by the Akka. As a test problem we used a numerical algorithm for
solving the heat equation.

 <dc:description>  Adversarial learning methods are a promising approach to training robust deep
networks, and can generate complex samples across diverse domains. They also
can improve recognition despite the presence of domain shift or dataset bias:
several adversarial approaches to unsupervised domain adaptation have recently
been introduced, which reduce the difference between the training and test
domain distributions and thus improve generalization performance. Prior
generative approaches show compelling visualizations, but are not optimal on
discriminative tasks and can be limited to smaller shifts. Prior discriminative
approaches could handle larger domain shifts, but imposed tied weights on the
model and did not exploit a GAN-based loss. We first outline a novel
generalized framework for adversarial adaptation, which subsumes recent
state-of-the-art approaches as special cases, and we use this generalized view
to better relate the prior approaches. We propose a previously unexplored
instance of our general framework which combines discriminative modeling,
untied weight sharing, and a GAN loss, which we call Adversarial Discriminative
Domain Adaptation (ADDA). We show that ADDA is more effective yet considerably
simpler than competing domain-adversarial methods, and demonstrate the promise
of our approach by exceeding state-of-the-art unsupervised adaptation results
on standard cross-domain digit classification tasks and a new more difficult
cross-modality object classification task.

 <dc:description>  In the era of big data, reducing data dimensionality is critical in many
areas of science. Widely used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) addresses this
problem by computing a low dimensional data embedding that maximally explain
variance of the data. However, PCA has two major weaknesses. Firstly, it only
considers linear correlations among variables (features), and secondly it is
not suitable for categorical data. We resolve these issues by proposing
Maximally Correlated Principal Component Analysis (MCPCA). MCPCA computes
transformations of variables whose covariance matrix has the largest Ky Fan
norm. Variable transformations are unknown, can be nonlinear and are computed
in an optimization. MCPCA can also be viewed as a multivariate extension of
Maximal Correlation. For jointly Gaussian variables we show that the covariance
matrix corresponding to the identity (or the negative of the identity)
transformations majorizes covariance matrices of non-identity functions. Using
this result we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for nonlinear functions of
jointly Gaussian variables for every rank constraint. For categorical variables
we characterize global MCPCA optimizers for the rank one constraint based on
the leading eigenvector of a matrix computed using pairwise joint
distributions. For a general rank constraint we propose a block coordinate
descend algorithm and show its convergence to stationary points of the MCPCA
optimization. We compare MCPCA with PCA and other state-of-the-art
dimensionality reduction methods including Isomap, LLE, multilayer autoencoders
(neural networks), kernel PCA, probabilistic PCA and diffusion maps on several
synthetic and real datasets. We show that MCPCA consistently provides improved
performance compared to other methods.

 <dc:description>  The beyond worst-case synthesis problem was introduced recently by Bruy\`ere
et al. [BFRR14]: it aims at building system controllers that provide strict
worst-case performance guarantees against an antagonistic environment while
ensuring higher expected performance against a stochastic model of the
environment. Our work extends the framework of [BFRR14] and follow-up papers,
which focused on quantitative objectives, by addressing the case of
$\omega$-regular conditions encoded as parity objectives, a natural way to
represent functional requirements of systems.
  We build strategies that satisfy a main parity objective on all plays, while
ensuring a secondary one with sufficient probability. This setting raises new
challenges in comparison to quantitative objectives, as one cannot easily mix
different strategies without endangering the functional properties of the
system. We establish that, for all variants of this problem, deciding the
existence of a strategy lies in ${\sf NP} \cap {\sf coNP}$, the same complexity
class as classical parity games. Hence, our framework provides additional
modeling power while staying in the same complexity class.

 <dc:description>  A Costas array is a permutation array for which the vectors joining pairs of
$1$s are all distinct. We propose a new three-dimensional combinatorial object
related to Costas arrays: an order $n$ Costas cube is an array $(d_{i,j,k})$ of
size $n \times n \times n$ over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ for which each of the three
projections of the array onto two dimensions, namely $(\sum_i d_{i,j,k})$ and
$(\sum_j d_{i,j,k})$ and $(\sum_k d_{i,j,k})$, is an order $n$ Costas array. We
determine all Costas cubes of order at most $29$, showing that Costas cubes
exist for all these orders except $18$ and $19$ and that a significant
proportion of the Costas arrays of certain orders occur as projections of
Costas cubes. We then present constructions for four infinite families of
Costas cubes.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a framework for the modeling of sequential data capturing
pathways of varying lengths observed in a network. Such data are important,
e.g., when studying click streams in information networks, travel patterns in
transportation systems, information cascades in social networks, biological
pathways or time-stamped social interactions. While it is common to apply graph
analytics and network analysis to such data, recent works have shown that
temporal correlations can invalidate the results of such methods. This raises a
fundamental question: when is a network abstraction of sequential data
justified? Addressing this open question, we propose a framework which combines
Markov chains of multiple, higher orders into a multi-layer graphical model
that captures temporal correlations in pathways at multiple length scales
simultaneously. We develop a model selection technique to infer the optimal
number of layers of such a model and show that it outperforms previously used
Markov order detection techniques. An application to eight real-world data sets
on pathways and temporal networks shows that it allows to infer graphical
models which capture both topological and temporal characteristics of such
data. Our work highlights fallacies of network abstractions and provides a
principled answer to the open question when they are justified. Generalizing
network representations to multi-order graphical models, it opens perspectives
for new data mining and knowledge discovery algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The poor contrast and the overlapping of cervical cell cytoplasm are the
major issues in the accurate segmentation of cervical cell cytoplasm. This
paper presents an automated unsupervised cytoplasm segmentation approach which
can effectively find the cytoplasm boundaries in overlapping cells. The
proposed approach first segments the cell clumps from the cervical smear image
and detects the nuclei in each cell clump. A modified Otsu method with prior
class probability is proposed for accurate segmentation of nuclei from the cell
clumps. Using distance regularized level set evolution, the contour around each
nucleus is evolved until it reaches the cytoplasm boundaries. Promising results
were obtained by experimenting on ISBI 2015 challenge dataset.

 <dc:description>  Software developers are faced with the issue of either adapting their
programming model to the execution model (e.g. cloud platforms) or finding
appropriate tools to adapt the model and code automatically. A recent execution
model which would benefit from automated enablement is Function-as-a-Service.
Automating this process requires a pipeline which includes steps for code
analysis, transformation and deployment. In this paper, we outline the design
and runtime characteristics of Podilizer, a tool which implements the pipeline
specifically for Java source code as input and AWS Lambda as output. We
contribute technical and economic metrics about this concrete 'FaaSification'
process by observing the behaviour of Podilizer with two representative Java
software projects.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we explore remarkable similarities between multi-transactional
behaviors of smart contracts in cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and classical
problems of shared-memory concurrency. We examine two real-world examples from
the Ethereum blockchain and analyzing how they are vulnerable to bugs that are
closely reminiscent to those that often occur in traditional concurrent
programs. We then elaborate on the relation between observable contract
behaviors and well-studied concurrency topics, such as atomicity, interference,
synchronization, and resource ownership. The described
contracts-as-concurrent-objects analogy provides deeper understanding of
potential threats for smart contracts, indicate better engineering practices,
and enable applications of existing state-of-the-art formal verification
techniques.

 <dc:description>  While liking or upvoting a post on a mobile app is easy to do, replying with
a written note is much more difficult, due to both the cognitive load of coming
up with a meaningful response as well as the mechanics of entering the text.
Here we present a novel textual reply generation model that goes beyond the
current auto-reply and predictive text entry models by taking into account the
content preferences of the user, the idiosyncrasies of their conversational
style, and even the structure of their social graph. Specifically, we have
developed two types of models for personalized user interactions: a
content-based conversation model, which makes use of location together with
user information, and a social-graph-based conversation model, which combines
content-based conversation models with social graphs.

 <dc:description>  A new class of Second generation high-performance computing applications with
heterogeneous, dynamic and data-intensive properties have an extended set of
requirements, which cover application deployment, resource allocation,
-control, and I/O scheduling. These requirements are not met by the current
production HPC platform models and policies. This results in a loss of
opportunity, productivity and innovation for new computational methods and
tools. It also decreases effective system utilization for platform providers
due to unsupervised workarounds and rogue resource management strategies
implemented in application space. In this paper we critically discuss the
dominant HPC platform model and describe the challenges it creates for second
generation applications because of its asymmetric resource view, interfaces and
software deployment policies. We present an extended, more symmetric and
application-centric platform model that adds decentralized deployment,
introspection, bidirectional control and information flow and more
comprehensive resource scheduling. We describe cHPC: an early prototype of a
non-disruptive implementation based on Linux Containers (LXC). It can operate
alongside existing batch queuing systems and exposes a symmetric platform API
without interfering with existing applications and usage modes. We see our
approach as a viable, incremental next step in HPC platform evolution that
benefits applications and platform providers alike. To demonstrate this
further, we layout out a roadmap for future research and experimental
evaluation.

 <dc:description>  Clause-elimination procedures that simplify formulas in conjunctive normal
form play an important role in modern SAT solving. Before or during the actual
solving process, such procedures identify and remove clauses that are
irrelevant to the solving result. These simplifications usually rely on
so-called redundancy properties that characterize cases in which the removal of
a clause does not affect the satisfiability status of a formula. One
particularly successful redundancy property is that of blocked clauses, because
it generalizes several other redundancy properties. To find out whether a
clause is blocked---and therefore redundant---one only needs to consider its
resolution environment, i.e., the clauses with which it can be resolved. For
this reason, we say that the redundancy property of blocked clauses is local.
In this paper, we show that there exist local redundancy properties that are
even more general than blocked clauses. We present a semantic notion of
blocking and prove that it constitutes the most general local redundancy
property. We furthermore introduce the syntax-based notions of set-blocking and
super-blocking, and show that the latter coincides with our semantic blocking
notion. In addition, we show how semantic blocking can be alternatively
characterized via Davis and Putnam's rule for eliminating atomic formulas.
Finally, we perform a detailed complexity analysis and relate our novel
redundancy properties to prominent redundancy properties from the literature.

 <dc:description>  The ability of physical layer relay caching to increase the degrees of
freedom (DoF) of a single cell was recently illustrated. In this paper, we
extend this result to the case of multiple cells in which a caching relay is
shared among multiple non-cooperative base stations (BSs). In particular, we
show that a large DoF gain can be achieved by exploiting the benefits of having
a shared relay that cooperates with the BSs. We first propose a cache-assisted
relaying protocol that improves the cooperation opportunity between the BSs and
the relay. Next, we consider the cache content placement problem that aims to
design the cache content at the relay such that the DoF gain is maximized. We
propose an optimal algorithm and a near-optimal low-complexity algorithm for
the cache content placement problem. Simulation results show significant
improvement in the DoF gain using the proposed relay-caching protocol.

 <dc:description>  Network densification and heterogenisation through the deployment of small
cellular access points (picocells and femtocells) are seen as key mechanisms in
handling the exponential increase in cellular data traffic. Modelling such
networks by leveraging tools from Stochastic Geometry has proven particularly
useful in understanding the fundamental limits imposed on network coverage and
capacity by co-channel interference. Most of these works however assume
infinite sized and uniformly distributed networks on the Euclidean plane. In
contrast, we study finite sized non-uniformly distributed networks, and find
the optimal non-uniform distribution of access points which maximises network
coverage for a given non-uniform distribution of mobile users, and vice versa.

 <dc:description>  The paper [1] shows that simple linear classifier can compete with complex
deep learning algorithms in text classification applications. Combining bag of
words (BoW) and linear classification techniques, fastText [1] attains same or
only slightly lower accuracy than deep learning algorithms [2-9] that are
orders of magnitude slower. We proved formally that fastText can be transformed
into a simpler equivalent classifier, which unlike fastText does not have any
hidden layer. We also proved that the necessary and sufficient dimensionality
of the word vector embedding space is exactly the number of document classes.
These results help constructing more optimal linear text classifiers with
guaranteed maximum classification capabilities. The results are proven exactly
by pure formal algebraic methods without attracting any empirical data.

 <dc:description>  Recent work on follow the perturbed leader (FTPL) algorithms for the
adversarial multi-armed bandit problem has highlighted the role of the hazard
rate of the distribution generating the perturbations. Assuming that the hazard
rate is bounded, it is possible to provide regret analyses for a variety of
FTPL algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem. This paper pushes the
inquiry into regret bounds for FTPL algorithms beyond the bounded hazard rate
condition. There are good reasons to do so: natural distributions such as the
uniform and Gaussian violate the condition. We give regret bounds for both
bounded support and unbounded support distributions without assuming the hazard
rate condition. We also disprove a conjecture that the Gaussian distribution
cannot lead to a low-regret algorithm. In fact, it turns out that it leads to
near optimal regret, up to logarithmic factors. A key ingredient in our
approach is the introduction of a new notion called the generalized hazard
rate.

 <dc:description>  Dataset augmentation, the practice of applying a wide array of
domain-specific transformations to synthetically expand a training set, is a
standard tool in supervised learning. While effective in tasks such as visual
recognition, the set of transformations must be carefully designed,
implemented, and tested for every new domain, limiting its re-use and
generality. In this paper, we adopt a simpler, domain-agnostic approach to
dataset augmentation. We start with existing data points and apply simple
transformations such as adding noise, interpolating, or extrapolating between
them. Our main insight is to perform the transformation not in input space, but
in a learned feature space. A re-kindling of interest in unsupervised
representation learning makes this technique timely and more effective. It is a
simple proposal, but to-date one that has not been tested empirically. Working
in the space of context vectors generated by sequence-to-sequence models, we
demonstrate a technique that is effective for both static and sequential data.

 <dc:description>  To cope with recent exponential increases in demand for mobile data, wireless
Internet service providers (ISPs) are increasingly changing their pricing plans
and deploying WiFi hotspots to offload their mobile traffic. However, these
ISP-centric approaches for traffic management do not always match the interests
of mobile users. Users face a complex, multi-dimensional tradeoff between cost,
throughput, and delay in making their offloading decisions: while they may save
money and receive a higher throughput by waiting for WiFi access, they may not
wait for WiFi if they are sensitive to delay. To navigate this tradeoff, we
develop AMUSE (Adaptive bandwidth Management through USer-Empowerment), a
functional prototype of a practical, cost-aware WiFi offloading system that
takes into account a user's throughput-delay tradeoffs and cellular budget
constraint. Based on predicted future usage and WiFi availability, AMUSE
decides which applications to offload to what times of the day. Since nearly
all traffic flows from mobile devices are TCP flows, we introduce a new
receiver-side bandwidth allocation mechanism to practically enforce the
assigned rate of each TCP application. Thus, AMUSE users can optimize their
bandwidth rates according to their own cost-throughput-delay tradeoff without
relying on support from different apps' content servers. Through a measurement
study of 20 smartphone users' traffic usage traces, we observe that though
users already offload a large amount of some application types, our framework
can offload a significant additional portion of users' cellular traffic. We
implement AMUSE and evaluate its effectiveness with 3G and WiFi usage data
obtained from a trial with 37 mobile users. Our results show that AMUSE
improves user utility, when compared with AMUSE, other offloading algorithms
yield 14\% and 27\% lower user utilities for light and heavy users,
respectively.

 <dc:description>  The problem of (approximately) counting the independent sets of a bipartite
graph (#BIS) is the canonical approximate counting problem that is complete in
the intermediate complexity class #RH\Pi_1. It is believed that #BIS does not
have an efficient approximation algorithm but also that it is not NP-hard. We
study the robustness of the intermediate complexity of #BIS by considering
variants of the problem parameterised by the size of the independent set. We
exhaustively map the complexity landscape for three problems, with respect to
exact computation and approximation and with respect to conventional and
parameterised complexity. The three problems are counting independent sets of a
given size, counting independent sets with a given number of vertices in one
vertex class and counting maximum independent sets amongst those with a given
number of vertices in one vertex class. Among other things, we show that all of
these problems are NP-hard to approximate within any polynomial ratio. (This is
surprising because the corresponding problems without the size parameter are
complete in #RH\Pi_1, and hence are not believed to be NP-hard.) We also show
that the first problem is #W[1]-hard to solve exactly but admits an FPTRAS,
whereas the other two are W[1]-hard to approximate even within any polynomial
ratio. Finally, we show that, when restricted to graphs of bounded degree, all
three problems have efficient exact fixed-parameter algorithms.

 <dc:title>On the Necessity of Structured Codes for Communications over MAC with

 <dc:description>  The problem of three-user multiple-access channel (MAC) with noiseless
feedback is investigated. A new coding strategy is presented. The coding scheme
builds upon the natural extension of the Cover-Leung (CL) scheme; and uses
quasi-linear codes. A new single-letter achievable rate region is derived. The
new achievable region strictly contains the CL region. This is shown through an
example. In this example, the coding scheme achieves optimality in terms of
transmission rates. It is shown that any optimality achieving scheme for this
example must have a specific algebraic structure. Particularly, the codebooks
must be closed under binary addition.

 <dc:description>  A Turmit is a Turing machine that works over a two-dimensional grid, that is,
an agent that moves, reads and writes symbols over the cells of the grid. Its
state is an arrow and, depending on the symbol that it reads, it turns to the
left or to the right, switching the symbol at the same time. Several symbols
are admitted, and the rule is specified by the turning sense that the machine
has over each symbol. Turmites are a generalization of Langtons ant, and they
present very complex and diverse behaviors. We prove that any Turmite, except
for those whose rule does not depend on the symbol, can simulate any Turing
Machine. We also prove the P-completeness of prediction their future behavior
by explicitly giving a log-space reduction from the Topological Circuit Value
Problem. A similar result was already established for Langtons ant; here we use
a similar technique but prove a stronger notion of simulation, and for a more
general family.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a bi-level discrete-time control framework with
real-time constraints, consisting of several local controllers and a central
controller. The objective is to bridge the gap between the online convex
optimization and real-time control literature by proposing an online control
algorithm with small dynamic regret, which is a natural performance criterion
in nonstationary environments related to real-time control problems. We
illustrate how the proposed algorithm can be applied to real-time control of
power setpoints in an electrical grid.

 <dc:description>  We study a demand response problem from utility (also referred to as
operator)'s perspective with realistic settings, in which the utility faces
uncertainty and limited communication. Specifically, the utility does not know
the cost function of consumers and cannot have multiple rounds of information
exchange with consumers. We formulate an optimization problem for the utility
to minimize its operational cost considering time-varying demand response
targets and responses of consumers. We develop a joint online learning and
pricing algorithm. In each time slot, the utility sends out a price signal to
all consumers and estimates the cost functions of consumers based on their
noisy responses. We measure the performance of our algorithm using regret
analysis and show that our online algorithm achieves logarithmic regret with
respect to the operating horizon. In addition, our algorithm employs linear
regression to estimate the aggregate response of consumers, making it easy to
implement in practice. Simulation experiments validate the theoretic results
and show that the performance gap between our algorithm and the offline
optimality decays quickly.

 <dc:description>  As humans we possess an intuitive ability for navigation which we master
through years of practice; however existing approaches to model this trait for
diverse tasks including monitoring pedestrian flow and detecting abnormal
events have been limited by using a variety of hand-crafted features. Recent
research in the area of deep-learning has demonstrated the power of learning
features directly from the data; and related research in recurrent neural
networks has shown exemplary results in sequence-to-sequence problems such as
neural machine translation and neural image caption generation. Motivated by
these approaches, we propose a novel method to predict the future motion of a
pedestrian given a short history of their, and their neighbours, past
behaviour. The novelty of the proposed method is the combined attention model
which utilises both &quot;soft attention&quot; as well as &quot;hard-wired&quot; attention in order
to map the trajectory information from the local neighbourhood to the future
positions of the pedestrian of interest. We illustrate how a simple
approximation of attention weights (i.e hard-wired) can be merged together with
soft attention weights in order to make our model applicable for challenging
real world scenarios with hundreds of neighbours. The navigational capability
of the proposed method is tested on two challenging publicly available
surveillance databases where our model outperforms the current-state-of-the-art
methods. Additionally, we illustrate how the proposed architecture can be
directly applied for the task of abnormal event detection without handcrafting
the features.

 <dc:description>  In order to accurately detect defects in patterned fabric images, a novel
detection algorithm based on Gabor-HOG (GHOG) and low-rank decomposition is
proposed in this paper. Defect-free pattern fabric images have the specified
direction, while defects damage their regularity of direction. Therefore, a
direction-aware descriptor is designed, denoted as GHOG, a combination of Gabor
and HOG, which is extremely valuable for localizing the defect region. Upon
devising a powerful directional descriptor, an efficient low-rank decomposition
model is constructed to divide the matrix generated by the directional feature
extracted from image blocks into a low-rank matrix (background information) and
a sparse matrix (defect information). A nonconvex log det(.) as a smooth
surrogate function for the rank instead of the nuclear norm is also exploited
to improve the efficiency of the low-rank model. Moreover, the computational
efficiency is further improved by utilizing the alternative direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Thereafter, the saliency map generated by the sparse matrix
is segmented via the optimal threshold algorithm to locate the defect regions.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively detect
patterned fabric defects and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We show the equivalence of two state-of-the-art link prediction/knowledge
graph completion methods: Nickel et al's holographic embedding and Trouillon et
al.'s complex embedding. We first consider a spectral version of the
holographic embedding, exploiting the frequency domain in the Fourier transform
for efficient computation. The analysis of the resulting method reveals that it
can be viewed as an instance of the complex embedding with certain constraints
cast on the initial vectors upon training. Conversely, any complex embedding
can be converted to an equivalent holographic embedding.

to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first dataset of its kind with
pixel-level annotations pertaining to invasive species in a marine environment.
Diverse outdoor illumination, a range of object shapes, colour, and severe
occlusion provide a significant real world challenge for the computer vision
community. An accompanying ground-truthing tool for superpixel labeling, Truth
and Crop, is also introduced. Finally, we provide a baseline using a variant of
Fully Convolutional Networks, and report results in terms of the standard mean

 <dc:description>  The weighted tree augmentation problem (WTAP) is a fundamental network design
problem. We are given an undirected tree $G = (V,E)$, an additional set of
edges $L$ called links and a cost vector $c \in \mathbb{R}^L_{\geq 1}$. The
goal is to choose a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq L$ such that $G = (V, E
\cup S)$ is $2$-edge-connected. In the unweighted case, that is, when we have
$c_\ell = 1$ for all $\ell \in L$, the problem is called the tree augmentation
problem (TAP).
  Both problems are known to be APX-hard, and the best known approximation
factors are $2$ for WTAP by (Frederickson and J\'aJ\'a, '81) and $\tfrac{3}{2}$
for TAP due to (Kortsarz and Nutov, TALG '16). In the case where all link costs
are bounded by a constant $M$, (Adjiashvili, SODA '17) recently gave a $\approx
1.96418+\varepsilon$-approximation algorithm for WTAP under this assumption.
This is the first approximation with a better guarantee than $2$ that does not
require restrictions on the structure of the tree or the links.
  In this paper, we improve Adjiashvili's approximation to a
$\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$-approximation for WTAP under the bounded cost
assumption. We achieve this by introducing a strong LP that combines
$\{0,\frac{1}{2}\}$-Chv\'atal-Gomory cuts for the standard LP for the problem
with bundle constraints from Adjiashvili. We show that our LP can be solved
efficiently and that it is exact for some instances that arise at the core of
Adjiashvili's approach. This results in the improved guarantee of
$\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$. For TAP, this is the best known LP-based result, and
matches the bound of $\frac{3}{2}+\varepsilon$ achieved by the best SDP-based
algorithm due to (Cheriyan and Gao, arXiv '15).

 <dc:description>  When Requirements Engineering(RE) models are unreasonably complex, they
cannot support efficient decision making. SHORT is a tool to simplify that
reasoning by exploiting the &quot;key&quot; decisions within RE models. These &quot;keys&quot; have
the property that once values are assigned to them, it is very fast to reason
over the remaining decisions. Using these &quot;keys&quot;, reasoning about RE models can
be greatly SHORTened by focusing stakeholder discussion on just these key
decisions.
  This paper evaluates the SHORT tool on eight complex RE models. We find that
the number of keys are typically only 12% of all decisions. Since they are so
few in number, keys can be used to reason faster about models. For example,
using keys, we can optimize over those models (to achieve the most goals at
least cost) two to three orders of magnitude faster than standard methods.
Better yet, finding those keys is not difficult: SHORT runs in low order
polynomial time and terminates in a few minutes for the largest models.

the dynamic formation of a fog network can be challenging. In essence, a given
fog node must smartly select the set of neighboring fog nodes that can provide
low-latency computations. In this paper, this problem of fog network formation
and task distribution is studied considering a hybrid cloud-fog architecture.
The goal of the proposed framework is to minimize the maximum computational
latency by enabling a given fog node to form a suitable fog network, under
uncertainty on the arrival process of neighboring fog nodes. To solve this
problem, a novel approach based on the online secretary framework is proposed.
To find the desired set of neighboring fog nodes, an online algorithm is
developed to enable a task initiating fog node to decide on which other nodes
can be used as part of its fog network, to offload computational tasks, without
knowing any prior information on the future arrivals of those other nodes.
Simulation results show that the proposed online algorithm can successfully
select an optimal set of neighboring fog nodes while achieving a latency that
is as small as the one resulting from an ideal, offline scheme that has
complete knowledge of the system. The results also show how, using the proposed
approach, the computational tasks can be properly distributed between the fog
network and a remote cloud server.

 <dc:description>  Given a graph, the sparsest cut problem asks for a subset of vertices whose
edge expansion (the normalized cut given by the subset) is minimized. In this
paper, we study a generalization of this problem seeking for $ k $ disjoint
subsets of vertices (clusters) whose all edge expansions are small and
furthermore, the number of vertices remained in the exterior of the subsets
(outliers) is also small. We prove that although this problem is $ NP-$hard for
trees, it can be solved in polynomial time for all weighted trees, provided
that we restrict the search space to subsets which induce connected subgraphs.
The proposed algorithm is based on dynamic programming and runs in the worst
case in $ O(k^2 n^3) $, when $ n $ is the number of vertices and $ k $ is the
number of clusters. It also runs in linear time when the number of clusters and
the number of outliers is bounded by a constant.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of outlier robust PCA (OR-PCA) where the goal is to
recover principal directions despite the presence of outlier data points. That
is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-\alpha)$ fraction of the points are
noisy samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $\alpha$ fraction of the
points can be arbitrary outliers, the goal is to recover the subspace
accurately. Existing results for \OR-PCA have serious drawbacks: while some
results are quite weak in the presence of noise, other results have runtime
quadratic in dimension, rendering them impractical for large scale
applications.
  In this work, we provide a novel thresholding based iterative algorithm with
per-iteration complexity at most linear in the data size. Moreover, the
fraction of outliers, $\alpha$, that our method can handle is tight up to
constants while providing nearly optimal computational complexity for a general
noise setting. For the special case where the inliers are obtained from a
low-dimensional subspace with additive Gaussian noise, we show that a
modification of our thresholding based method leads to significant improvement
in recovery error (of the subspace) even in the presence of a large fraction of
outliers.

 <dc:description>  We examine the problem of joint top-down active search of multiple objects
under interaction, e.g., person riding a bicycle, cups held by the table, etc..
Such objects under interaction often can provide contextual cues to each other
to facilitate more efficient search. By treating each detector as an agent, we
present the first collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
algorithm to learn the optimal policy for joint active object localization,
which effectively exploits such beneficial contextual information. We learn
inter-agent communication through cross connections with gates between the
Q-networks, which is facilitated by a novel multi-agent deep Q-learning
algorithm with joint exploitation sampling. We verify our proposed method on
multiple object detection benchmarks. Not only does our model help to improve
the performance of state-of-the-art active localization models, it also reveals
interesting co-detection patterns that are intuitively interpretable.

 <dc:description>  The problem of population recovery refers to estimating a distribution based
on incomplete or corrupted samples. Consider a random poll of sample size $n$
conducted on a population of individuals, where each pollee is asked to answer
$d$ binary questions. We consider one of the two polling impediments: (a) in
lossy population recovery, a pollee may skip each question with probability
$\epsilon$, (b) in noisy population recovery, a pollee may lie on each question
with probability $\epsilon$. Given $n$ lossy or noisy samples, the goal is to
estimate the probabilities of all $2^d$ binary vectors simultaneously within
accuracy $\delta$ with high probability.
  This paper settles the sample complexity of population recovery. For lossy
model, the optimal sample complexity is
$\tilde\Theta(\delta^{-2\max\{\frac{\epsilon}{1-\epsilon},1\}})$, improving the
state of the art by Moitra and Saks in several ways: a lower bound is
established, the upper bound is improved and the result depends at most on the
logarithm of the dimension. Surprisingly, the sample complexity undergoes a
phase transition from parametric to nonparametric rate when $\epsilon$ exceeds
$1/2$. For noisy population recovery, the sharp sample complexity turns out to
be more sensitive to dimension and scales as $\exp(\Theta(d^{1/3}
\log^{2/3}(1/\delta)))$ except for the trivial cases of $\epsilon=0,1/2$ or
$1$.
  For both models, our estimators simply compute the empirical mean of a
certain function, which is found by pre-solving a linear program (LP).
Curiously, the dual LP can be understood as Le Cam's method for lower-bounding
the minimax risk, thus establishing the statistical optimality of the proposed
estimators. The value of the LP is determined by complex-analytic methods.

 <dc:description>  We study the Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm for
non-convex optimization. The algorithm performs stochastic gradient descent,
where in each step it injects appropriately scaled Gaussian noise to the
update. We analyze the algorithm's hitting time to an arbitrary subset of the
parameter space. Two results follow from our general theory: First, we prove
that for empirical risk minimization, if the empirical risk is point-wise close
to the (smooth) population risk, then the algorithm achieves an approximate
local minimum of the population risk in polynomial time, escaping suboptimal
local minima that only exist in the empirical risk. Second, we show that SGLD
improves on one of the best known learnability results for learning linear
classifiers under the zero-one loss.

reminded by Jan\v{c}ar that the claim is not so dependable. In this paper, we
develop a new complete proof for EXPTIME-hardness of branching bisimilarity on

PSPACE-hard and in EXPTIME. This improves previous P-hard and NEXPTIME result.

 <dc:description>  It has been a long-standing problem to efficiently learn a halfspace using as
few labels as possible in the presence of noise. In this work, we propose an
efficient Perceptron-based algorithm for actively learning homogeneous
halfspaces under the uniform distribution over the unit sphere. Under the
bounded noise condition~\cite{MN06}, where each label is flipped with
probability at most $\eta &lt; \frac 1 2$, our algorithm achieves a near-optimal
label complexity of
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{(1-2\eta)^2}\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$ in time
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{\epsilon(1-2\eta)^3}\right)$. Under the adversarial
noise condition~\cite{ABL14, KLS09, KKMS08}, where at most a $\tilde
\Omega(\epsilon)$ fraction of labels can be flipped, our algorithm achieves a
near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(d\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$
in time $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{\epsilon}\right)$. Furthermore, we show that
our active learning algorithm can be converted to an efficient passive learning
algorithm that has near-optimal sample complexities with respect to $\epsilon$
and $d$.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of enumerating the satisfying valuations of a circuit
while bounding the delay, i.e., the time needed to compute each successive
valuation. We focus on the class of structured d-DNNF circuits originally
introduced in knowledge compilation, a sub-area of artificial intelligence. We
propose an algorithm for these circuits that enumerates valuations with linear
preprocessing and delay linear in the Hamming weight of each valuation.
Moreover, valuations of constant Hamming weight can be enumerated with linear
preprocessing and constant delay.
  Our results yield a framework for efficient enumeration that applies to all
problems whose solutions can be compiled to structured d-DNNFs. In particular,
we use it to recapture classical results in database theory, for factorized
database representations and for MSO evaluation. This gives an independent
proof of constant-delay enumeration for MSO formulae with first-order free
variables on bounded-treewidth structures.

design errors typically found in fixed-point digital systems, considering
finite word-length effects. In particular, the present toolbox works as a
front-end to a recently introduced verification tool, known as Digital-System
Verifier, and checks overflow, limit cycle, quantization, stability, and
minimum phase errors, in digital systems represented by transfer-function and
state-space equations. It provides a command-line version, with simplified
access to specific functions, and a graphical-user interface, which was
developed as a MATLAB application. The resulting toolbox is important for the
verification community, since it shows the applicability of verification to

 <dc:description>  Considering user preferences is a determining factor in optimizing the value
of a software release. This is due to the fact that user preferences for
software features specify the values of those features and consequently
determine the value of the release. Certain features of a software however, may
encourage or discourage users to prefer (select or use) other features. As
such, value of a software feature could be positively or negatively influenced
by other features. Such influences are known as Value-related Feature
(Requirement) Dependencies. Value-related dependencies need to be considered in
software release planning as they influence the value of the optimal subset of
the features selected by the release planning models. Hence, we have proposed
considering value-related feature dependencies in software release planning
through mining user preferences for software features. We have demonstrated the
validity and practicality of the proposed approach by studying a real world
software project.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic variance reduction algorithms have recently become popular for
minimizing the average of a large but finite number of loss functions. In this
paper, we propose a novel Riemannian extension of the Euclidean stochastic
variance reduced gradient algorithm (R-SVRG) to a manifold search space. The
key challenges of averaging, adding, and subtracting multiple gradients are
addressed with retraction and vector transport. We present a global convergence
analysis of the proposed algorithm with a decay step size and a local
convergence rate analysis under a fixed step size under some natural
assumptions. The proposed algorithm is applied to problems on the Grassmann
manifold, such as principal component analysis, low-rank matrix completion, and
computation of the Karcher mean of subspaces, and outperforms the standard
Riemannian stochastic gradient descent algorithm in each case.

 <dc:description>  Perception-driven approach and end-to-end system are two major vision-based
frameworks for self-driving cars. However, it is difficult to introduce
attention and historical information of autonomous driving process, which are
the essential factors for achieving human-like driving into these two methods.
In this paper, we propose a novel model for self-driving cars named
brain-inspired cognitive model with attention (CMA). This model consists of
three parts: a convolutional neural network for simulating human visual cortex,
a cognitive map built to describe relationships between objects in complex
traffic scene and a recurrent neural network that combines with the real-time
updated cognitive map to implement attention mechanism and long-short term
memory. The benefit of our model is that can accurately solve three tasks
simultaneously:1) detection of the free space and boundaries of the current and
adjacent lanes. 2)estimation of obstacle distance and vehicle attitude, and 3)
learning of driving behavior and decision making from human driver. More
significantly, the proposed model could accept external navigating instructions
during an end-to-end driving process. For evaluation, we build a large-scale
road-vehicle dataset which contains more than forty thousand labeled road
images captured by three cameras on our self-driving car. Moreover, human
driving activities and vehicle states are recorded in the meanwhile.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, various sensors are collecting, storing and transmitting tremendous
trajectory data, and it is known that raw trajectory data seriously wastes the
storage, network band and computing resource. Line simplification (LS)
algorithms are an effective approach to attacking this issue by compressing
data points in a trajectory to a set of continuous line segments, and are
commonly used in practice. However, existing LS algorithms are not sufficient
for the needs of sensors in mobile devices. In this study, we first develop a
one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithm (OPERB), which scans
each data point in a trajectory once and only once. We then propose an
aggressive one-pass error bounded trajectory simplification algorithm
(OPERB-A), which allows interpolating new data points into a trajectory under
certain conditions. Finally, we experimentally verify that our approaches
(OPERB and OPERB-A) are both efficient and effective, using four real-life
trajectory datasets.

 <dc:description>  Differentially-private histograms have emerged as a key tool for location
privacy. While past mechanisms have included theoretical &amp; experimental
analysis, it has recently been observed that much of the existing literature
does not fully provide differential privacy. The missing component, private
parameter tuning, is necessary for rigorous evaluation of these mechanisms.
Instead works frequently tune on training data to optimise parameters without
consideration of privacy; in other cases selection is performed arbitrarily and
independent of data, degrading utility. We address this open problem by
deriving a principled tuning mechanism that privately optimises data-dependent
error bounds. Theoretical results establish privacy and utility while extensive
experimentation demonstrates that we can practically achieve true end-to-end
privacy.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a novel method of realizing discrete-time (D-T)
signal amplification using Nano-Electro-Mechanical (NEMS) devices. The
amplifier uses mechanical devices instead of traditional solid-state circuits.
The proposed NEMS-based D-T amplifier provides high gain and operate on a wide
dynamic range of signals, consuming only a few micro watts of power. The
proposed concept is subsequently verified using Verilog-A model of the NEMS
device. Modifications in the proposed amplifier to suit different
specifications are also presented.

 <dc:title>On the Unambiguous Distance of Multi-Carrier Phase Ranging with Random
  Hopped Frequencie</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In a multi-carrier phase ranging (MPR) system, the distance that radio signal
travels is estimated through phase shift of multiple carrier frequencies. Due
to phase ambiguity, a unique estimation can only be obtained within the
unambiguous distance (UD), which depends on the carrier frequencies used for
ranging. Without external information, the maximum measurable distance of an
MPR system is defined by its UD. The MPR system employing random frequency
hopping (FH) waveform has a strong anti-jamming capability and sees promising
potentials in many fields. However, it is challenging to depict its measurable
distance. Different from current MPR system employing deterministic
frequencies, the carrier frequency under the FH waveform hops randomly within
the occupied bandwidth. Consequently, the UD is a random variable. In this
paper, we try to find a deterministic value to depict the UD of an MPR system
under the random spaced frequencies (RSF) configuration, serving as a metric of
its measurable distance in engineering applications. It is safe to adopt the
lower bound of the random UD as the metric, but the measurable distance may be
drastically underestimated. Alternatively, we propose to adopt the upper bound
of the random UD as the metric, because when the RSF set contains more than a
dozen of carriers, i) we prove the probability that the random UD obtains its
upper bound is very close to 1 if phase noise is not introduced; ii)
simulations show that the upper bound can also be obtained reliably in the
presence of phase noise. As a comparison, the practical measurable range of the
MPR system under the traditional linearly spaced frequencies (LSF)
configuration is only a fraction of its theoretical UD because the UD is more
sensitive to phase error.

 <dc:description>  3D face reconstruction from a single image is a classical and challenging
problem, with wide applications in many areas. Inspired by recent works in face
animation from RGB-D or monocular video inputs, we develop a novel method for
reconstructing 3D faces from unconstrained 2D images, using a coarse-to-fine
optimization strategy. First, a smooth coarse 3D face is generated from an
example-based bilinear face model, by aligning the projection of 3D face
landmarks with 2D landmarks detected from the input image. Afterwards, using
global corrective deformation fields, the coarse 3D face is refined using
photometric consistency constraints, resulting in a medium face shape. Finally,
a shape-from-shading method is applied on the medium face to recover fine
geometric details. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of accuracy and detail recovery, which is demonstrated in extensive experiments
using real world models and publicly available datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers wireless-powered cooperative jamming (CJ) to secure
communication between a transmitter (Tx) and an information receiver (IR), in
the presence of an energy receiver (ER) which is termed as a potential
eavesdropper. The full-duplex jammer harvests energy from the Tx's information
signal and transmits jamming signal at the same time, where the jamming signal
not only confounds the ER (potential eavesdropper) but also charges the ER. Our
goal is to maximize the secrecy information rate by jointly optimizing the
power allocation at the Tx and jammer while maintaining the harvested energy
requirement of the ER. The studied problem is non-convex and we propose the
optimal solution based on the Lagrange method. Simulation results show that the
proposed scheme significantly outperforms the benchmark schemes.

 <dc:title>Reproducing and learning new algebraic operations on word embeddings
  using genetic programming</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Santana, Roberto</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Word-vector representations associate a high dimensional real-vector to every
word from a corpus. Recently, neural-network based methods have been proposed
for learning this representation from large corpora. This type of
word-to-vector embedding is able to keep, in the learned vector space, some of
the syntactic and semantic relationships present in the original word corpus.
This, in turn, serves to address different types of language classification
tasks by doing algebraic operations defined on the vectors. The general
practice is to assume that the semantic relationships between the words can be
inferred by the application of a-priori specified algebraic operations. Our
general goal in this paper is to show that it is possible to learn methods for
word composition in semantic spaces. Instead of expressing the compositional
method as an algebraic operation, we will encode it as a program, which can be
linear, nonlinear, or involve more intricate expressions. More remarkably, this
program will be evolved from a set of initial random programs by means of
genetic programming (GP). We show that our method is able to reproduce the same
behavior as human-designed algebraic operators. Using a word analogy task as
benchmark, we also show that GP-generated programs are able to obtain accuracy
values above those produced by the commonly used human-designed rule for
algebraic manipulation of word vectors. Finally, we show the robustness of our
approach by executing the evolved programs on the word2vec GoogleNews vectors,
learned over 3 billion running words, and assessing their accuracy in the same
word analogy task.

 <dc:title>Embeddings of Schatten Norms with Applications to Data Streams</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Yi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Woodruff, David P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given an $n \times d$ matrix $A$, its Schatten-$p$ norm, $p \geq 1$, is
defined as $\|A\|_p = \left (\sum_{i=1}^{\textrm{rank}(A)}\sigma_i(A)^p \right
)^{1/p}$, where $\sigma_i(A)$ is the $i$-th largest singular value of $A$.
These norms have been studied in functional analysis in the context of
non-commutative $\ell_p$-spaces, and recently in data stream and linear
sketching models of computation. Basic questions on the relations between these
norms, such as their embeddability, are still open. Specifically, given a set
of matrices $A^1, \ldots, A^{\operatorname{poly}(nd)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$, suppose we want to construct a linear map $L$ such that $L(A^i) \in
\mathbb{R}^{n' \times d'}$ for each $i$, where $n' \leq n$ and $d' \leq d$, and
further, $\|A^i\|_p \leq \|L(A^i)\|_q \leq D_{p,q} \|A^i\|_p$ for a given
approximation factor $D_{p,q}$ and real number $q \geq 1$. Then how large do
$n'$ and $d'$ need to be as a function of $D_{p,q}$?
  We nearly resolve this question for every $p, q \geq 1$, for the case where
$L(A^i)$ can be expressed as $R \cdot A^i \cdot S$, where $R$ and $S$ are
arbitrary matrices that are allowed to depend on $A^1, \ldots, A^t$, that is,
$L(A^i)$ can be implemented by left and right matrix multiplication. Namely,
for every $p, q \geq 1$, we provide nearly matching upper and lower bounds on
the size of $n'$ and $d'$ as a function of $D_{p,q}$. Importantly, our upper
bounds are {\it oblivious}, meaning that $R$ and $S$ do not depend on the
$A^i$, while our lower bounds hold even if $R$ and $S$ depend on the $A^i$. As
an application of our upper bounds, we answer a recent open question of Blasiok
et al. about space-approximation trade-offs for the Schatten $1$-norm, showing
in a data stream it is possible to estimate the Schatten-$1$ norm up to a
factor of $D \geq 1$ using $\tilde{O}(\min(n,d)^2/D^4)$ space.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies energy-efficient coordinated beamforming in multi-cell
multi-user multigroup multicast multiple-input single-output systems. We aim at
maximizing the network energy efficiency by taking into account the fact that
some of the radio frequency chains can be switched off in order to save power.
We consider the antenna specific maximum power constraints to avoid non-linear
distortion in power amplifiers and user-specific quality of service (QoS)
constraints to guarantee a certain QoS levels. We first introduce binary
antenna selection variables and use the perspective formulation to model the
relation between them and the beamformers. Subsequently, we propose a new
formulation which reduces the feasible set of the continuous relaxation,
resulting in better performance compared to the original perspective
formulation based problem. However, the resulting optimization problem is a
mixed-Boolean non-convex fractional program, which is difficult to solve. We
follow the standard continuous relaxation of the binary antenna selection
variables, and then reformulate the problem such that it is amendable to
successive convex approximation. Thereby, solving the continuous relaxation
mostly results in near-binary solution. To recover the binary variables from
the continuous relaxation, we switch off all the antennas for which the
continuous values are smaller than a small threshold. Numerical results
illustrate the superior convergence result and significant achievable gains in
terms of energy efficiency with the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:title>Approximation Algorithms for Independence and Domination on B$_1$-VPG
  and B$_1$-EPG Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mehrabi, Saeed</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A graph $G$ is called B$_k$-VPG (resp., B$_k$-EPG), for some constant $k\geq
0$, if it has a string representation on a grid such that each vertex is an
orthogonal path with at most $k$ bends and two vertices are adjacent in $G$ if
and only if the corresponding strings intersect (resp., the corresponding
strings share at least one grid edge). If two adjacent strings of a B$_k$-VPG
graph intersect exactly once, then the graph is called a one-string B$_k$-VPG
graph.
  In this paper, we study the Maximum Independent Set and Minimum Dominating
Set problems on B$_1$-VPG and B$_1$-EPG graphs. We first give a simple $O(\log
n)$-approximation algorithm for the Maximum Independent Set problem on
B$_1$-VPG graphs, improving the previous $O((\log n)^2)$-approximation
algorithm of Lahiri et al. (COCOA 2015). Then, we consider the Minimum
Dominating Set problem. We give an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for this
problem on one-string B$_1$-VPG graphs, providing the first constant-factor
approximation algorithm for this problem. Moreover, we show that the Minimum
Dominating Set problem is APX-hard on B$_1$-EPG graphs, ruling out the
possibility of a PTAS unless P=NP. Finally, we give constant-factor
approximation algorithms for this problem on two non-trivial subclasses of
B$_1$-EPG graphs. To our knowledge, these are the first results for the Minimum
Dominating Set problem on B$_1$-EPG graphs, partially answering a question
posed by Epstein et al. (WADS 2013).

corpus of 1,627 articles that were manually fact-checked by professional
journalists from BuzzFeed. The articles originated from 9 well-known political
publishers, 3 each from the mainstream, the hyperpartisan left-wing, and the
hyperpartisan right-wing. In sum, the corpus contains 299 fake news, 97% of
which originated from hyperpartisan publishers.
  We propose and demonstrate a new way of assessing style similarity between
text categories via Unmasking---a meta-learning approach originally devised for
authorship verification---, revealing that the style of left-wing and
right-wing news have a lot more in common than any of the two have with the
mainstream. Furthermore, we show that hyperpartisan news can be discriminated
well by its style from the mainstream (F1=0.78), as can be satire from both
(F1=0.81). Unsurprisingly, style-based fake news detection does not live up to
scratch (F1=0.46). Nevertheless, the former results are important to implement
pre-screening for fake news detectors.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a randomized approach for incrementally building deep
neural networks, where a supervisory mechanism is proposed to constrain the
random assignment of the weights and biases, and all the hidden layers have
direct links to the output layer. A fundamental result on the universal
approximation property is established for such a class of randomized leaner
models, namely deep stochastic configuration networks (DeepSCNs). A learning
algorithm is presented to implement DeepSCNs with either specific architecture
or self-organization. The read-out weights attached with all direct links from
each hidden layer to the output layer are evaluated by the least squares
method. Given a set of training examples, DeepSCNs can speedily produce a
learning representation, that is, a collection of random basis functions with
the cascaded inputs together with the read-out weights. An empirical study on a
function approximation is carried out to demonstrate some properties of the
proposed deep learner model.

 <dc:title>Obvious Strategyproofness Needs Monitoring for Good Approximations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Obvious strategyproofness (OSP) is an appealing concept as it allows to
maintain incentive compatibility even in the presence of agents that are not
fully rational, e.g., those who struggle with contingent reasoning [Li, 2015].
However, it has been shown to impose some limitations, e.g., no OSP mechanism
can return a stable matching [Ashlagi and Gonczarowski, 2015].
  We here deepen the study of the limitations of OSP mechanisms by looking at
their approximation guarantees for basic optimization problems paradigmatic of
the area, i.e., machine scheduling and facility location. We prove a number of
bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP mechanisms, which show that OSP
can come at a significant cost. However, rather surprisingly, we prove that OSP
mechanisms can return optimal solutions when they use monitoring -- a novel
mechanism design paradigm that introduces a mild level of scrutiny on agents'
declarations [Kovacs et al., 2015].

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method for fast image
segmentation. We re-examine the locality-preserving character of spectral
clustering by constructing a graph over image regions with both global and
local connections. Our novel approach to build graph connections relies on two
key observations: 1) local region pairs that co-occur frequently will have a
high probability to reside on a common object; 2) spatially distant regions in
a common object often exhibit similar visual saliency, which implies their
neighborship in a manifold. We present a novel energy function to efficiently
conduct graph partitioning. Based on multiple high quality partitions, we show
that the generated eigenvector histogram based representation can automatically
drive effective unary potentials for a hierarchical random field model to
produce multi-class segmentation. Sufficient experiments, on the BSDS500
benchmark, large-scale PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets, demonstrate the
competitive segmentation accuracy and significantly improved efficiency of our
proposed method compared with other state of the arts.

 <dc:description>  Over the past decade, online social networks (OSNs) such as Twitter and

major evolution would be to leverage the characteristics of OSNs to evaluate
the effectiveness of the many routing schemes developed by the research
community in real-world scenarios. In this demo, we showcase AlleyOop Social, a
secure delay tolerant networking research platform that serves as a real-life
mobile social networking application for iOS devices. AlleyOop Social allows
users to interact, publish messages, and discover others that share common
interests in an intermittent network using Bluetooth, peer-to-peer WiFi, and
infrastructure WiFi. The research platform serves as an overlay application for
the Secure Opportunistic Schemes (SOS) middleware which allows different
routing schemes to be easily implemented relieving the burden of security and

 <dc:description>  In this work we formulate the problem of image captioning as a multimodal
translation task. Analogous to machine translation, we present a
sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural networks (RNN) model for image caption
generation. Different from most existing work where the whole image is
represented by convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, we propose to
represent the input image as a sequence of detected objects which feeds as the
source sequence of the RNN model. In this way, the sequential representation of
an image can be naturally translated to a sequence of words, as the target
sequence of the RNN model. To represent the image in a sequential way, we
extract the objects features in the image and arrange them in a order using
convolutional neural networks. To further leverage the visual information from
the encoded objects, a sequential attention layer is introduced to selectively
attend to the objects that are related to generate corresponding words in the
sentences. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed
approach on popular benchmark dataset, i.e., MS COCO, and the proposed model
surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in all metrics following the dataset
splits of previous work. The proposed approach is also evaluated by the
evaluation server of MS COCO captioning challenge, and achieves very
competitive results, e.g., a CIDEr of 1.029 (c5) and 1.064 (c40).

 <dc:title>On Loss Functions for Deep Neural Networks in Classification</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are currently among the most commonly used classifiers.
Despite easily achieving very good performance, one of the best selling points
of these models is their modular design - one can conveniently adapt their
architecture to specific needs, change connectivity patterns, attach
specialised layers, experiment with a large amount of activation functions,
normalisation schemes and many others. While one can find impressively wide
spread of various configurations of almost every aspect of the deep nets, one
element is, in authors' opinion, underrepresented - while solving
classification problems, vast majority of papers and applications simply use
log loss. In this paper we try to investigate how particular choices of loss
functions affect deep models and their learning dynamics, as well as resulting
classifiers robustness to various effects. We perform experiments on classical
datasets, as well as provide some additional, theoretical insights into the
problem. In particular we show that L1 and L2 losses are, quite surprisingly,
justified classification objectives for deep nets, by providing probabilistic
interpretation in terms of expected misclassification. We also introduce two
losses which are not typically used as deep nets objectives and show that they
are viable alternatives to the existing ones.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a vision-only model for gaming AI which uses a late integration
deep convolutional network architecture trained in a purely supervised
imitation learning context. Although state-of-the-art deep learning models for
video game tasks generally rely on more complex methods such as deep-Q
learning, we show that a supervised model which requires substantially fewer
resources and training time can already perform well at human reaction speeds
on the N64 classic game Super Smash Bros. We frame our learning task as a
30-class classification problem, and our CNN model achieves 80% top-1 and 95%
top-3 validation accuracy. With slight test-time fine-tuning, our model is also
competitive during live simulation with the highest-level AI built into the
game. We will further show evidence through network visualizations that the
network is successfully leveraging temporal information during inference to aid
in decision making. Our work demonstrates that supervised CNN models can
provide good performance in challenging policy prediction tasks while being
significantly simpler and more lightweight than alternatives.

 <dc:description>  Shape registration is the process of aligning one 3D model to another. Most
previous methods to align shapes with no known correspondences attempt to solve
for both the transformation and correspondences iteratively. We present a shape
registration approach that solves for the transformation using fuzzy
correspondences to maximize the overlap between the given shape and the target
shape. A coarse to fine approach with Levenberg-Marquardt method is used for
optimization. Real and synthetic experiments show our approach is robust and
outperforms other state of the art methods when point clouds are noisy, sparse,
and have non-uniform density. Experiments show our method is more robust to
initialization and can handle larger scale changes and rotation than other
methods. We also show that the approach can be used for 2D-3D alignment via
ray-point alignment.

 <dc:description>  Allometric scaling can reflect underlying mechanisms, dynamics and structures
in complex systems; examples include typical scaling laws in biology, ecology
and urban development. In this work, we study allometric scaling in scientific
fields. By performing an analysis of the outputs/inputs of various scientific
fields, including the numbers of publications, citations, and references, with
respect to the number of authors, we find that in all fields that we have
studied thus far, including physics, mathematics and economics, there are
allometric scaling laws relating the outputs/inputs and the sizes of scientific
fields. Furthermore, the exponents of the scaling relations have remained quite
stable over the years. We also find that the deviations of individual subfields
from the overall scaling laws are good indicators for ranking subfields
independently of their sizes.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study the quantitative relation between the recursive
teaching dimension (RTD) and the VC dimension (VCD) of concept classes of
finite sizes. The RTD of a concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0, 1\}^n$,
introduced by Zilles et al. (2011), is a combinatorial complexity measure
characterized by the worst-case number of examples necessary to identify a
concept in $\mathcal C$ according to the recursive teaching model.
  For any finite concept class $\mathcal C \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ with
$\mathrm{VCD}(\mathcal C)=d$, Simon &amp; Zilles (2015) posed an open problem
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d)$, i.e., is RTD linearly upper bounded by VCD?
Previously, the best known result is an exponential upper bound
$\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d \cdot 2^d)$, due to Chen et al. (2016). In this
paper, we show a quadratic upper bound: $\mathrm{RTD}(\mathcal C) = O(d^2)$,
much closer to an answer to the open problem. We also discuss the challenges in
fully solving the problem.

 <dc:title>An Adaptivity Hierarchy Theorem for Property Testing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Adaptivity is known to play a crucial role in property testing. In
particular, there exist properties for which there is an exponential gap
between the power of \emph{adaptive} testing algorithms, wherein each query may
be determined by the answers received to prior queries, and their
\emph{non-adaptive} counterparts, in which all queries are independent of
answers obtained from previous queries.
  In this work, we investigate the role of adaptivity in property testing at a
finer level. We first quantify the degree of adaptivity of a testing algorithm
by considering the number of &quot;rounds of adaptivity&quot; it uses. More accurately,
we say that a tester is $k$-(round) adaptive if it makes queries in $k+1$
rounds, where the queries in the $i$'th round may depend on the answers
obtained in the previous $i-1$ rounds. Then, we ask the following question:
  Does the power of testing algorithms smoothly grow with the number of rounds
of adaptivity?
  We provide a positive answer to the foregoing question by proving an
adaptivity hierarchy theorem for property testing. Specifically, our main
result shows that for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $0 \le k \le n^{0.99}$ there
exists a property $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ of functions for which (1) there exists a
$k$-adaptive tester for $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ with query complexity
$\tilde{O}(k)$, yet (2) any $(k-1)$-adaptive tester for $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$
must make $\Omega(n)$ queries. In addition, we show that such a qualitative
adaptivity hierarchy can be witnessed for testing natural properties of graphs.

 <dc:description>  Joint allocation of spectrum and user association is considered for a large
cellular network. The objective is to optimize a network utility function such
as average delay given traffic statistics collected over a slow timescale. A
key challenge is scalability: given $n$ Access Points (APs), there are $O(2^n)$
ways in which the APs can share the spectrum. The number of variables is
reduced from $O(2^n)$ to $O(nk)$, where $k$ is the number of users, by
optimizing over local overlapping neighborhoods, defined by interference
conditions, and by exploiting the existence of sparse solutions in which the
spectrum is divided into $k+1$ segments. We reformulate the problem by
optimizing the assignment of subsets of active APs to those segments. An
$\ell_0$ constraint enforces a one-to-one mapping of subsets to spectrum, and
an iterative (reweighted $\ell_1$) algorithm is used to find an approximate
solution. Numerical results for a network with 100 APs serving several hundred
users show the proposed method achieves a substantial increase in total
throughput relative to benchmark schemes.

 <dc:description>  Convnets have enabled significant progress in pedestrian detection recently,
but there are still open questions regarding suitable architectures and
training data. We revisit CNN design and point out key adaptations, enabling
plain FasterRCNN to obtain state-of-the-art results on the Caltech dataset.
  To achieve further improvement from more and better data, we introduce
CityPersons, a new set of person annotations on top of the Cityscapes dataset.
The diversity of CityPersons allows us for the first time to train one single
CNN model that generalizes well over multiple benchmarks. Moreover, with
additional training with CityPersons, we obtain top results using FasterRCNN on
Caltech, improving especially for more difficult cases (heavy occlusion and
small scale) and providing higher localization quality.

 <dc:description>  Multiplayer online battle arena has become a popular game genre. It also
received increasing attention from our research community because they provide
a wealth of information about human interactions and behaviors. A major problem
is extracting meaningful patterns of activity from this type of data, in a way
that is also easy to interpret. Here, we propose to exploit tensor
decomposition techniques, and in particular Non-negative Tensor Factorization,
to discover hidden correlated behavioral patterns of play in a popular game:
League of Legends. We first collect the entire gaming history of a group of
about one thousand players, totaling roughly $100K$ matches. By applying our
methodological framework, we then separate players into groups that exhibit
similar features and playing strategies, as well as similar temporal
trajectories, i.e., behavioral progressions over the course of their gaming
history: this will allow us to investigate how players learn and improve their
skills.

 <dc:description>  Robust PCA methods are typically batch algorithms which requires loading all
observations into memory before processing. This makes them inefficient to
process big data. In this paper, we develop an efficient online robust
principal component methods, namely online moving window robust principal
component analysis (OMWRPCA). Unlike existing algorithms, OMWRPCA can
successfully track not only slowly changing subspace but also abruptly changed
subspace. By embedding hypothesis testing into the algorithm, OMWRPCA can
detect change points of the underlying subspaces. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate the superior performance of OMWRPCA compared with other
state-of-art approaches. We also apply the algorithm for real-time background
subtraction of surveillance video.

 <dc:description>  The astonishing spread of Android OS, not only in smartphones and tablets but
also in IoT devices, makes this operating system a very tempting target for
malware threats. Indeed, the latter are expanding at a similar rate. In this
respect, malware fingerprints, whether based on cryptographic or fuzzy-hashing,
are the first defense line against such attacks. Fuzzy-hashing fingerprints are
suitable for capturing malware static features. Moreover, they are more
resilient to small changes in the actual static content of malware files. On
the other hand, dynamic analysis is another technique for malware detection
that uses emulation environments to extract behavioral features of Android
malware. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no such fingerprinting
technique that leverages dynamic analysis and would act as the first defense
against Android malware attacks. In this paper, we address the following
question: could we generate effective fingerprints for Android malware through
dynamic analysis? To this end, we propose DySign, a novel technique for
fingerprinting Android malware's dynamic behaviors. This is achieved through
the generation of a digest from the dynamic analysis of a malware sample on
existing known malware. It is important to mention that: (i) DySign
fingerprints are approximated of the observed behaviors during dynamic analysis
so as to achieve resiliency to small changes in the behaviors of future malware
variants; (ii) Fingerprint computation is agnostic to the analyzed malware
sample or family. DySign leverages state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques to generate the aforementioned fingerprints, which are then
leveraged to build an enhanced Android malware detection system with family
attribution.

 <dc:description>  Finding the optimally performing configuration of a software system for a
given setting is often challenging. Recent approaches address this challenge by
learning performance models based on a sample set of configurations. However,
building an accurate performance model can be very expensive (and is often
infeasible in practice). The central insight of this paper is that exact
performance values (e.g. the response time of a software system) are not
required to rank configurations and to identify the optimal one. As shown by
our experiments, models that are cheap to learn but inaccurate (with respect to
the difference between actual and predicted performance) can still be used rank
configurations and hence find the optimal configuration. This novel
\emph{rank-based approach} allows us to significantly reduce the cost (in terms
of number of measurements of sample configuration) as well as the time required
to build models. We evaluate our approach with 21 scenarios based on 9 software
systems and demonstrate that our approach is beneficial in 16 scenarios; for
the remaining 5 scenarios, an accurate model can be built by using very few
samples anyway, without the need for a rank-based approach.

 <dc:description>  Informally, a chemical reaction network is &quot;atomic&quot; if each reaction may be
interpreted as the rearrangement of indivisible units of matter. There are
several reasonable definitions formalizing this idea. We investigate the
computational complexity of deciding whether a given network is atomic
according to each of these definitions.
  Our first definition, primitive atomic, which requires each reaction to
preserve the total number of atoms, is to shown to be equivalent to mass
conservation. Since it is known that it can be decided in polynomial time
whether a given chemical reaction network is mass-conserving, the equivalence
gives an efficient algorithm to decide primitive atomicity.
  Another definition, subset atomic, further requires that all atoms are
species. We show that deciding whether a given network is subset atomic is in
$\textsf{NP}$, and the problem &quot;is a network subset atomic with respect to a
given atom set&quot; is strongly $\textsf{NP}$-$\textsf{Complete}$.
  A third definition, reachably atomic, studied by Adleman, Gopalkrishnan et
al., further requires that each species has a sequence of reactions splitting
it into its constituent atoms. We show that there is a $\textbf{polynomial-time
algorithm}$ to decide whether a given network is reachably atomic, improving
upon the result of Adleman et al. that the problem is $\textbf{decidable}$. We
show that the reachability problem for reachably atomic networks is
$\textsf{Pspace}$-$\textsf{Complete}$.
  Finally, we demonstrate equivalence relationships between our definitions and
some special cases of another existing definition of atomicity due to Gnacadja.

 <dc:title>Poisson Cluster Process: Bridging the Gap Between PPP and 3GPP HetNet

 <dc:description>  The growing complexity of heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets) has
necessitated the need to consider variety of user and base station (BS)
configurations for realistic performance evaluation and system design. This is
directly reflected in the HetNet simulation models considered by
standardization bodies, such as the third generation partnership project
(3GPP). Complementary to these simulation models, stochastic geometry based
approach modeling the user and BS locations as independent and homogeneous
Poisson point processes (PPPs) has gained prominence in the past few years.
Despite its success in revealing useful insights, this PPP-based model is not
rich enough to capture all the spatial configurations that appear in real world
HetNet deployments (on which 3GPP simulation models are based). In this paper,
we bridge the gap between the 3GPP simulation models and the popular PPP-based
analytical model by developing a new unified HetNet model in which a fraction
of users and some BS tiers are modeled as Poisson cluster processes (PCPs).
This model captures both non-uniformity and coupling in the BS and user
locations. For this setup, we derive exact expression for downlink coverage
probability under maximum signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) cell association
model. As intermediate results, we define and evaluate sum-product functionals
for PPP and PCP. Special instances of the proposed model are shown to closely
resemble different configurations considered in 3GPP HetNet models. Our results
concretely demonstrate that the performance trends are highly sensitive to the
assumptions made on the user and SBS configurations.

 <dc:description>  Vertex Separation Minimization Problem (VSMP) consists of finding a layout of
a graph G = (V,E) which minimizes the maximum vertex cut or separation of a
layout. It is an NP-complete problem in general for which metaheuristic
techniques can be applied to find near optimal solution. VSMP has applications
in VLSI design, graph drawing and computer language compiler design. VSMP is
polynomially solvable for grids, trees, permutation graphs and cographs.
Construction heuristics play a very important role in the metaheuristic
techniques as they are responsible for generating initial solutions which lead
to fast convergence. In this paper, we have proposed three construction
heuristics H1, H2 and H3 and performed experiments on Grids, Small graphs,
Trees and Harwell Boeing graphs, totaling 248 instances of graphs. Experiments
reveal that H1, H2 and H3 are able to achieve best results for 88.71%, 43.5%
and 37.1% of the total instances respectively while the best construction
heuristic in the literature achieves the best solution for 39.9% of the total
instances. We have also compared the results with the state-of-the-art
metaheuristic GVNS and observed that the proposed construction heuristics
improves the results for some of the input instances. It was found that GVNS
obtained best results for 82.9% instances of all input instances and the
heuristic H1 obtained best results for 82.3% of all input instances.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a zoom-out-and-in network for generating object
proposals. We utilize different resolutions of feature maps in the network to
detect object instances of various sizes. Specifically, we divide the anchor
candidates into three clusters based on the scale size and place them on
feature maps of distinct strides to detect small, medium and large objects,
respectively. Deeper feature maps contain region-level semantics which can help
shallow counterparts to identify small objects. Therefore we design a zoom-in
sub-network to increase the resolution of high level features via a
deconvolution operation. The high-level features with high resolution are then
combined and merged with low-level features to detect objects. Furthermore, we
devise a recursive training pipeline to consecutively regress region proposals
at the training stage in order to match the iterative regression at the testing
stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on ILSVRC DET
and MS COCO datasets, where our algorithm performs better than the
state-of-the-arts in various evaluation metrics. It also increases average
precision by around 2% in the detection system.

 <dc:description>  The adoption of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in educational
institutions is increasing day by day. Many countries are insisting the use of
FOSS in their government sectors and few are in the process of adopting FOSS
strategies. The reasons for adopting FOSS are: total cost ownership, free to
make copies and distribution, software legality, reliability, availability,
performance, security and other pedagogical and administrative benefits. In
this research paper, the alternative educational framework has been used to
identify the FOSS tools and software by considering the various strategic
areas, polices and phased approach to identify the suitable FOSS tools for the
courses of various specializations of Information Technology programme in
College of Applied Sciences, Sultanate of Oman. As a result of this research, a
list of alternative FOSS tools and software for the courses of IT programme has
been identified and recommended.

 <dc:title>Playing Games with Bounded Entropy</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider zero-sum repeated games when the maximizer is
restricted to strategies requiring no more than a limited amount of randomness.
Particularly we analyze the maxmin payoff of the maximizer in two models: the
first model (the Gossner and Vieille model) forces the maximizer to randomize
her action in each stage just by conditioning her decision to outcomes of a
given sequence of random source, while in the second model (the Gossner and
Tomala model) the maximizer is a team of players who are free to randomize
privately their corresponding actions but do not access to any explicit source
of shared randomness needed for cooperation. The works of Gossner and Vieille,
and Gossner and Tomala adopted the method of types to establish their results
while we utilize the idea of random hashing which is the core of randomness
extractors in the information theory literature. Besides we adopt the
well-studied tool of simulation of a source from another source. By utilizing
this tools, we are able to not only simplify the prior results, but also extend
them. We characterize the maxmin payoff of the maximizer in the repeated games
under study. Particularly, the maxmin payoff of the first model is fully
described by the function $J(h)$ which is the maximum payoff that the maximizer
can secure in a one shot game by choosing mixed strategies of entropy at most
$h$. In the second part of the paper, we study the computational aspects of
$J(h)$. We provide three explicit lower bounds on the entropy-payoff tradeoff
curve. To do this, we provide and utilize new results for the set of
distributions that guarantee a certain payoff for Alice. In particular, we
study how this set of distributions shrinks as we increase the security level.
While the use of total variation distance is common in game theory, our
derivation indicates the suitability of utilizing the Renyi-divergence of order
two.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to point out a new connection between
information theory and dynamical systems. In the information theory side, we
consider rate distortion theory, which studies lossy data compression of
stochastic processes under distortion constraints. In the dynamical systems
side, we consider mean dimension theory, which studies how many parameters per
second we need to describe a dynamical system. The main results are new
variational principles connecting rate distortion function to metric mean
dimension.

 <dc:title>From Pragmatic to Systematic Software Process Improvement: An Evaluated

 <dc:description>  Software processes improvement (SPI) is a challenging task, as many different
stakeholders, project settings, and contexts and goals need to be considered.
SPI projects are often operated in a complex and volatile environment and,
thus, require a sound management that is resource-intensive requiring many
stakeholders to contribute to the process assessment, analysis, design,
realisation, and deployment. Although there exist many valuable SPI approaches,
none address the needs of both process engineers and project managers. This
article presents an Artefact-based Software Process Improvement &amp; Management
approach (ArSPI) that closes this gap. ArSPI was developed and tested across
several SPI projects in large organisations in Germany and Eastern Europe. The
approach further encompasses a template for initiating, performing, and
managing SPI projects by defining a set of 5 key artefacts and 24 support
artefacts. We present ArSPI and discus results of its validation indicating
ArSPI to be a helpful instrument to set up and steer SPI projects.

 <dc:description>  Software process lines provide a systematic approach to develop and manage
software processes. It defines a reference process containing general process
assets, whereas a well-defined customization approach allows process engineers
to create new process variants, e.g., by extending or modifying process assets.
Variability operations are an instrument to realize flexibility by explicitly
declaring required modifications, which are applied to create a procedurally
generated company-specific process. However, little is known about which
variability operations are suitable in practice. In this article, we present a
study on the feasibility of variability operations to support the development
of software process lines in the context of the V-Modell XT. We analyze which
variability operations are defined and practically used. We provide an initial
catalog of variability operations as an improvement proposal for other process
models. Our findings show that 69 variability operation types are defined
across several metamodel versions of which, however, 25 remain unused. The
found variability operations allow for systematically modifying the content of
process model elements and the process documentation, and they allow for
altering the structure of a process model and its description. Furthermore, we
also find that variability operations can help process engineers to compensate
process metamodel evolution.

 <dc:description>  Searching persons in large-scale image databases with the query of natural
language description has important applications in video surveillance. Existing
methods mainly focused on searching persons with image-based or attribute-based
queries, which have major limitations for a practical usage. In this paper, we
study the problem of person search with natural language description. Given the
textual description of a person, the algorithm of the person search is required
to rank all the samples in the person database then retrieve the most relevant
sample corresponding to the queried description. Since there is no person
dataset or benchmark with textual description available, we collect a
large-scale person description dataset with detailed natural language
annotations and person samples from various sources, termed as CUHK Person
Description Dataset (CUHK-PEDES). A wide range of possible models and baselines
have been evaluated and compared on the person search benchmark. An Recurrent
Neural Network with Gated Neural Attention mechanism (GNA-RNN) is proposed to
establish the state-of-the art performance on person search.

 <dc:title>On Optimal Ternary Locally Repairable Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In an $[n,k,d]$ linear code, a code symbol is said to have locality $r$ if it
can be repaired by accessing at most $r$ other code symbols. For an $(n,k,r)$
\emph{locally repairable code} (LRC), the minimum distance satisfies the
well-known Singleton-like bound $d\le n-k-\lceil k/r\rceil +2$. In this paper,
we study optimal ternary LRCs meeting this Singleton-like bound by employing a
parity-check matrix approach. It is proved that there are only $8$ classes of
possible parameters with which optimal ternary LRCs exist. Moreover, we obtain
explicit constructions of optimal ternary LRCs for all these $8$ classes of
parameters, where the minimum distance could only be 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the effects of social interactions in task al- location using
Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT). We propose a simple task-allocation game and
study how different learning mechanisms can give rise to specialised and non-
specialised colonies under different ecological conditions. By combining
agent-based simulations and adaptive dynamics we show that social learning can
result in colonies of generalists or specialists, depending on ecological
parameters. Agent-based simulations further show that learning dynamics play a
crucial role in task allocation. In particular, introspective individual
learning readily favours the emergence of specialists, while a process
resembling task recruitment favours the emergence of generalists.

 <dc:title>Locally Repairable Codes with Multiple $(r_{i}, \delta_{i})$-Localities</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In distributed storage systems, locally repairable codes (LRCs) are
introduced to realize low disk I/O and repair cost. In order to tolerate
multiple node failures, the LRCs with \emph{$(r, \delta)$-locality} are further
proposed. Since hot data is not uncommon in a distributed storage system, both
Zeh \emph{et al.} and Kadhe \emph{et al.} focus on the LRCs with \emph{multiple
localities or unequal localities} (ML-LRCs) recently, which said that the
localities among the code symbols can be different. ML-LRCs are attractive and
useful in reducing repair cost for hot data. In this paper, we generalize the
ML-LRCs to the $(r,\delta)$-locality case of multiple node failures, and define
an LRC with multiple $(r_{i}, \delta_{i})_{i\in [s]}$ localities ($s\ge 2$),
where $r_{1}\leq r_{2}\leq\dots\leq r_{s}$ and
$\delta_{1}\geq\delta_{2}\geq\dots\geq\delta_{s}\geq2$. Such codes ensure that
some hot data could be repaired more quickly and have better failure-tolerance
in certain cases because of relatively smaller $r_{i}$ and larger $\delta_{i}$.
Then, we derive a Singleton-like upper bound on the minimum distance for the
proposed LRCs by employing the regenerating-set technique. Finally, we obtain a
class of explicit and structured constructions of optimal ML-LRCs, and further
extend them to the cases of multiple $(r_{i}, \delta)_{i\in [s]}$ localities.

 <dc:description>  Most traditional algorithms for compressive sensing image reconstruction
suffer from the intensive computation. Recently, deep learning-based
reconstruction algorithms have been reported, which dramatically reduce the
time complexity than iterative reconstruction algorithms. In this paper, we
propose a novel \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esidual \textbf{R}econstruction Network
(DR$^{2}$-Net) to reconstruct the image from its Compressively Sensed (CS)
measurement. The DR$^{2}$-Net is proposed based on two observations: 1) linear
mapping could reconstruct a high-quality preliminary image, and 2) residual
learning could further improve the reconstruction quality. Accordingly,
DR$^{2}$-Net consists of two components, \emph{i.e.,} linear mapping network
and residual network, respectively. Specifically, the fully-connected layer in
neural network implements the linear mapping network. We then expand the linear
mapping network to DR$^{2}$-Net by adding several residual learning blocks to
enhance the preliminary image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
DR$^{2}$-Net outperforms traditional iterative methods and recent deep
learning-based methods by large margins at measurement rates 0.01, 0.04, 0.1,
and 0.25, respectively. The code of DR$^{2}$-Net has been released on:

 <dc:description>  Context: Surveys constitute an valuable tool to capture a large-scale
snapshot of the state of the practice. Apparently trivial to adopt, surveys
hide, however, several pitfalls that might hinder rendering the result valid
and, thus, useful. Goal: We aim at providing an overview of main pitfalls in
software engineering surveys and report on practical ways to deal with them.
Method: We build on the experiences we collected in conducting many studies and
distill the main lessons learnt. Results: The eight lessons learnt we report
cover different aspects of the survey process ranging from the design of
initial research objectives to the design of a questionnaire. Conclusions: Our
hope is that by sharing our lessons learnt, combined with a disciplined
application of the general survey theory, we contribute to improving the
quality of the research results achievable by employing software engineering
surveys.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning algorithms, in particular convolutional networks, have rapidly
become a methodology of choice for analyzing medical images. This paper reviews
the major deep learning concepts pertinent to medical image analysis and
summarizes over 300 contributions to the field, most of which appeared in the
last year. We survey the use of deep learning for image classification, object
detection, segmentation, registration, and other tasks and provide concise
overviews of studies per application area. Open challenges and directions for
future research are discussed.

in the literature by considering the tests from an abstract $C$-algebra. This
paper extends the notion of $C$-sets to $C$-monoids which include the
composition of programs as well as composition of programs with tests. For the
class of $C$-monoids where the $C$-algebras are adas a canonical representation
in terms of functional $C$-monoids is obtained.

 <dc:title>Hypercube LSH for approximate near neighbors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A celebrated technique for finding near neighbors for the angular distance
involves using a set of \textit{random} hyperplanes to partition the space into
hash regions [Charikar, STOC 2002]. Experiments later showed that using a set
of \textit{orthogonal} hyperplanes, thereby partitioning the space into the
Voronoi regions induced by a hypercube, leads to even better results [Terasawa
and Tanaka, WADS 2007]. However, no theoretical explanation for this
improvement was ever given, and it remained unclear how the resulting hypercube
hash method scales in high dimensions.
  In this work, we provide explicit asymptotics for the collision probabilities
when using hypercubes to partition the space. For instance, two near-orthogonal
vectors are expected to collide with probability $(\frac{1}{\pi})^{d + o(d)}$
in dimension $d$, compared to $(\frac{1}{2})^d$ when using random hyperplanes.
Vectors at angle $\frac{\pi}{3}$ collide with probability
$(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi})^{d + o(d)}$, compared to $(\frac{2}{3})^d$ for random
hyperplanes, and near-parallel vectors collide with similar asymptotic
probabilities in both cases.
  For $c$-approximate nearest neighbor searching, this translates to a decrease
in the exponent $\rho$ of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) methods of a factor
up to $\log_2(\pi) \approx 1.652$ compared to hyperplane LSH. For $c = 2$, we
obtain $\rho \approx 0.302 + o(1)$ for hypercube LSH, improving upon the $\rho
\approx 0.377$ for hyperplane LSH. We further describe how to use hypercube LSH
in practice, and we consider an example application in the area of lattice
algorithms.

 <dc:title>Canonical Representations for Circular-Arc Graphs Using Flip Sets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chandoo, Maurice</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>G.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show that computing canonical representations for circular-arc (CA) graphs
reduces to computing certain subsets of vertices called flip sets. For a broad
class of CA graphs, which we call uniform, it suffices to compute a CA
representation to find such flip sets. As a consequence canonical
representations for uniform CA graphs can be obtained in polynomial-time. We
then investigate what kind of CA graphs pose a challenge to this approach. This
leads us to introduce the notion of restricted CA matrices and show that the
canonical representation problem for CA graphs is logspace-reducible to that of
restricted CA matrices. As a byproduct, we obtain the result that CA graphs
without induced 4-cycles can be canonized in logspace.

 <dc:description>  What is the best way to describe a user in a social network with just a few
numbers? Mathematically, this is equivalent to assigning a vector
representation to each node in a graph, a process called graph embedding. We
propose a novel framework, GEM-D that unifies most of the past algorithms such
as LapEigs, DeepWalk and node2vec. GEM-D achieves its goal by decomposing any
graph embedding algorithm into three building blocks: node proximity function,
warping function and loss function. Based on thorough analysis of GEM-D, we
propose a novel algorithm, called UltimateWalk, which outperforms the
most-recently proposed state-of-the-art DeepWalk and node2vec. The
contributions of this work are: (1) The proposed framework, GEM-D unifies the
past graph embedding algorithms and provides a general recipe of how to design
a graph embedding; (2) the nonlinearlity in the warping function contributes
significantly to the quality of embedding and the exponential function is
empirically optimal; (3) the proposed algorithm, UltimateWalk is one-click (no
user-defined parameters), scalable and has a closed-form solution.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of controlling the dynamic behavior of
a multi-robot system while interacting with the environment. In particular, we
propose a general methodology that, by means of locally scaling inter-robot
coupling relationships, leads to achieving a desired interactive behavior. The
proposed method is shown to guarantee passivity preservation, which ensures a
safe interaction. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated in
simulation, over large-scale multi-robot systems.

 <dc:description>  Maximally recoverable codes are codes designed for distributed storage which
combine quick recovery from single node failure and optimal recovery from
catastrophic failure. Gopalan et al [SODA 2017] studied the alphabet size
needed for such codes in grid topologies and gave a combinatorial
characterization for it.
  Consider a labeling of the edges of the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$
with labels coming from $F_2^d$ , that satisfies the following condition: for
any simple cycle, the sum of the labels over its edges is nonzero. The minimal
d where this is possible controls the alphabet size needed for maximally
recoverable codes in n x n grid topologies.
  Prior to the current work, it was known that d is between $(\log n)^2$ and
$n\log n$. We improve both bounds and show that d is linear in n. The upper
bound is a recursive construction which beats the random construction. The
lower bound follows by first relating the problem to the independence number of
the Birkhoff polytope graph, and then providing tight bounds for it using the
representation theory of the symmetric group.

 <dc:description>  This paper reconsiders the problem of the absent-minded driver who must
choose between alternatives with different payoff with imperfect recall and
varying degrees of knowledge of the system. The classical absent-minded driver
problem represents the case with limited information and it has bearing on the
general area of communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design,
auctions, theories of knowledge, belief, and rational agency. Within the
framework of extensive games, this problem has applications to many artificial
intelligence scenarios. It is obvious that the performance of the agent
improves as information available increases. It is shown that a non-uniform
assignment strategy for successive choices does better than a fixed probability
strategy. We consider both classical and quantum approaches to the problem. We
argue that the superior performance of quantum decisions with access to
entanglement cannot be fairly compared to a classical algorithm. If the
cognitive systems of agents are taken to have access to quantum resources, or
have a quantum mechanical basis, then that can be leveraged into superior
performance.

 <dc:title>Evaluation of Lane Departure Correction Systems Using a Stochastic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Evaluating the effectiveness and benefits of driver assistance systems is
crucial for improving the system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework for testing and evaluating lane departure correction systems at a low
cost by using lane departure events reproduced from naturalistic driving data.
First, 529,096 lane departure events were extracted from the Safety Pilot Model
Deployment (SPMD) database collected by the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute. Second, a stochastic lane departure model
consisting of eight random key variables was developed to reduce the dimension
of the data description and improve the computational efficiency. As such, we
used a bounded Gaussian mixture model (BGM) model to describe drivers'
stochastic lane departure behaviors. Then, a lane departure correction system
with an aim point controller was designed, and a batch of lane departure events
were reproduced from the learned stochastic driver model. Finally, we assessed
the developed evaluation approach by comparing lateral departure areas of
vehicles between with and without correction controller. The simulation results
show that the proposed method can effectively evaluate lane departure
correction systems.

 <dc:description>  We present a detailed study on application of factor graphs and the belief
propagation (BP) algorithm to the power system state estimation (SE) problem.
We start from the BP solution for the linear DC model, for which we provide a
detailed convergence analysis. Using insights from the DC model, we use two
different approaches to derive the BP algorithm for the non-linear AC model.
The first method directly applies BP methodology, however, providing only
approximate BP solution for the AC model. In the second approach, we make a key
further step by providing the solution in which the BP is applied sequentially
over the AC model, akin to what is done by the Gauss-Newton method. The
resulting BP-based Gauss-Newton algorithm has the interpretation of a fully
distributed Gauss-Newton method with the same accuracy as the centralized SE,
preserving a number of advantages of the BP framework. The paper provides
extensive numerical study of the proposed algorithms, provides details on their
convergence properties, and gives a number of useful insights for their
implementation.

 <dc:description>  A crucial function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate
localization. Lane-level accuracy is not readily available from low-cost Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers because of factors such as
multipath error and atmospheric bias. Approaches such as Differential GNSS can
improve localization accuracy, but usually require investment in expensive base
stations. Connected vehicle technologies provide an alternative approach to
improving the localization accuracy. It will be shown in this paper that
localization accuracy can be enhanced using crude GNSS measurements from a
group of connected vehicles, by matching their locations to a digital map. A
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is used to jointly estimate the common
biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicle positions. Multipath biases, which
introduce receiver-specific (non-common) error, are mitigated by a
multi-hypothesis detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation of the
estimations is exploited through the prediction-update process. The proposed
approach is compared to existing methods using both simulations and
experimental results. It was found that the proposed algorithm can eliminate
the common biases and reduce the localization error to below 1 meter under open
sky conditions.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a systematic theoretical and empirical comparison of the
major algorithms that have been proposed for learning Harmonic and Optimality
Theory grammars (HG and OT, respectively). By comparing learning algorithms, we
are also able to compare the closely related OT and HG frameworks themselves.
Experimental results show that the additional expressivity of the HG framework
over OT affords performance gains in the task of predicting the surface word
order of Czech sentences. We compare the perceptron with the classic Gradual
Learning Algorithm (GLA), which learns OT grammars, as well as the popular
Maximum Entropy model. In addition to showing that the perceptron is
theoretically appealing, our work shows that the performance of the HG model it
learns approaches that of the upper bound in prediction accuracy on a held out
test set and that it is capable of accurately modeling observed variation.

 <dc:description>  Models of complex systems are widely used in the physical and social
sciences, and the concept of layering, typically building upon graph-theoretic
structure, is a common feature. We describe an intuitionistic substructural
logic that gives an account of layering. The logic is a bunched system,
combining the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a
non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its
associated implications. We give soundness and completeness theorems for a
labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. We then
give an equivalent relational semantics, itself proven equivalent to an
algebraic semantics via a representation theorem. We utilise this result in two
ways. First, we prove decidability of the logic by showing the finite
embeddability property holds for the algebraic semantics. Second, we prove a
Stone-type duality theorem for the logic. By introducing the notions of ILGL
hyperdoctrine and indexed layered frame we are able to extend this result to a
predicate version of the logic and prove soundness and completeness theorems
for an extension of the layered graph semantics . We indicate the utility of
predicate ILGL with a resource-labelled bigraph model.

 <dc:description>  Besides independent learning, human learning process is highly improved by
summarizing what has been learned, communicating it with peers, and
subsequently fusing knowledge from different sources to assist the current
learning goal. This collaborative learning procedure ensures that the knowledge
is shared, continuously refined, and concluded from different perspectives to
construct a more profound understanding. The idea of knowledge transfer has led
to many advances in machine learning and data mining, but significant
challenges remain, especially when it comes to reinforcement learning,
heterogeneous model structures, and different learning tasks. Motivated by
human collaborative learning, in this paper we propose a collaborative deep
reinforcement learning (CDRL) framework that performs adaptive knowledge
transfer among heterogeneous learning agents. Specifically, the proposed CDRL
conducts a novel deep knowledge distillation method to address the
heterogeneity among different learning tasks with a deep alignment network.
Furthermore, we present an efficient collaborative Asynchronous Advantage

 <dc:description>  Distributed training of deep learning models on large-scale training data is
typically conducted with asynchronous stochastic optimization to maximize the
rate of updates, at the cost of additional noise introduced from asynchrony. In
contrast, the synchronous approach is often thought to be impractical due to
idle time wasted on waiting for straggling workers. We revisit these
conventional beliefs in this paper, and examine the weaknesses of both
approaches. We demonstrate that a third approach, synchronous optimization with
backup workers, can avoid asynchronous noise while mitigating for the worst
stragglers. Our approach is empirically validated and shown to converge faster
and to better test accuracies.

 <dc:description>  Diagnosis of breast carcinomas has so far been limited to the morphological
interpretation of epithelial cells and the assessment of epithelial tissue
architecture. Consequently, most of the automated systems have focused on
characterizing the epithelial regions of the breast to detect cancer. In this
paper, we propose a system for classification of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)
stained breast specimens based on convolutional neural networks that primarily
targets the assessment of tumor-associated stroma to diagnose breast cancer
patients. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system using a large
cohort containing 646 breast tissue biopsies. Our evaluations show that the
proposed system achieves an area under ROC of 0.92, demonstrating the
discriminative power of previously neglected tumor-associated stroma as a
diagnostic biomarker.

 <dc:title>Conditional Lower Bounds for All-Pairs Max-Flow</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Krauthgamer, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Trabelsi, Ohad</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We provide evidence that computing the maximum flow value between every pair
of nodes in a directed graph on $n$ nodes, $m$ edges,and capacities in the
range $[1..n]$, which we call the All-Pairs Max-Flow problem, cannot be solved
in time that is faster significantly (i.e., by a polynomial factor) than $O(n^2
m)$. Since a single maximum $st$-flow in such graphs can be solved in time
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ [Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014],we conclude that the
all-pairs version might require time equivalent to $\tilde\Omega(n^{3/2})$
computations of maximum $st$-flow,which strongly separates the directed case
from the undirected one. Moreover, if maximum $st$-flow can be solved in time
$\tilde{O}(m)$,then the runtime of $\tilde\Omega(n^2)$ computations is needed.
The latter settles a conjecture of Lacki, Nussbaum, Sankowski, and Wulf-Nilsen
[FOCS 2012] negatively.
  Specifically, we show that in sparse graphs $G=(V,E,w)$, if one can compute
the maximum $st$-flow from every $s$ in an input set of sources $S\subseteq V$
to every $t$ in an input set of sinks $T\subseteq V$ in time $O((|S| |T|
m)^{1-\epsilon})$,for some $|S|$, $|T|$, and a constant $\epsilon&gt;0$,then
MAX-CNF-SAT with $n'$ variables and $m'$ clauses can be solved in time
${m'}^{O(1)}2^{(1-\delta)n'}$ for a constant $\delta(\epsilon)&gt;0$,a problem for
which not even $2^{n'}/poly(n')$ algorithms are known. Such runtime for
MAX-CNF-SAT would in particular refute the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis
(SETH). Hence, we improve the lower bound of Abboud, Vassilevska-Williams, and
Yu [STOC 2015], who showed that for every fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$ and
$|S|=|T|=O(\sqrt{n})$, if the above problem can be solved in time
$O(n^{3/2-\epsilon})$, then some incomparable conjecture is false. Furthermore,
a larger lower bound than ours implies strictly super-linear time for maximum
$st$-flow problem, which would be an amazing breakthrough.

 <dc:title>Precise Null Pointer Analysis Through Global Value Numbering</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Precise analysis of pointer information plays an important role in many
static analysis techniques and tools today. The precision, however, must be
balanced against the scalability of the analysis. This paper focusses on
improving the precision of standard context and flow insensitive alias analysis
algorithms at a low scalability cost. In particular, we present a
semantics-preserving program transformation that drastically improves the
precision of existing analyses when deciding if a pointer can alias NULL. Our
program transformation is based on Global Value Numbering, a scheme inspired
from compiler optimizations literature. It allows even a flow-insensitive
analysis to make use of branch conditions such as checking if a pointer is NULL
and gain precision. We perform experiments on real-world code to measure the
overhead in performing the transformation and the improvement in the precision
of the analysis. We show that the precision improves from 86.56% to 98.05%,
while the overhead is insignificant.

 <dc:description>  Insider trading is one of the numerous white collar crimes that can
contribute to the instability of the economy. Traditionally, the detection of
illegal insider trades has been a human-driven process. In this paper, we
collect the insider tradings made available by the US Securities and Exchange
Commissions (SEC) through the EDGAR system, with the aim of initiating an
automated large-scale and data-driven approach to the problem of identifying
illegal insider tradings. The goal of the study is the identification of
interesting patterns, which can be indicators of potential anomalies. We use
the collected data to construct networks that capture the relationship between
trading behaviors of insiders. We explore different ways of building networks
from insider trading data, and argue for a need of a structure that is capable
of capturing higher order relationships among traders. Our results suggest the
discovery of interesting patterns.

 <dc:description>  Bitcoin, Ethereum and other blockchain-based cryptocurrencies, as deployed
today, cannot scale for wide-spread use. A leading approach for cryptocurrency
scaling is a smart contract mechanism called a payment channel which enables
two mutually distrustful parties to transact efficiently (and only requires a
single transaction in the blockchain to set-up). Payment channels can be linked
together to form a payment network, such that payments between any two parties
can (usually) be routed through the network along a path that connects them.
Crucially, both parties can transact without trusting hops along the route.
  In this paper, we propose a novel variant of payment channels, called
Sprites, that reduces the worst-case &quot;collateral cost&quot; that each hop along the
route may incur. The benefits of Sprites are two-fold. 1) In Lightning Network,
a payment across a path of $\ell$ channels requires locking up collateral for
$\Theta(\ell\Delta)$ time, where $\Delta$ is the time to commit an on-chain
transaction. Sprites reduces this cost to $O(\ell + \Delta)$. 2) Unlike prior
work, Sprites supports partial withdrawals and deposits, during which the
channel can continue to operate without interruption.
  In evaluating Sprites we make several additional contributions. First, our
simulation-based security model is the first formalism to model timing
guarantees in payment channels. Our construction is also modular, making use of
a generic abstraction from folklore, called the &quot;state channel,&quot; which we are
the first to formalize. We also provide a simulation framework for payment
network protocols, which we use to confirm that the Sprites construction
mitigates against throughput-reducing attacks.

 <dc:description>  Visualizing high-dimensional data has been a focus in data analysis
communities for decades, which has led to the design of many algorithms, some
of which are now considered references (such as t-SNE for example). In our era
of overwhelming data volumes, the scalability of such methods have become more
and more important. In this work, we present a method which allows to apply any
visualization or embedding algorithm on very large datasets by considering only
a fraction of the data as input and then extending the information to all data
points using a graph encoding its global similarity. We show that in most
cases, using only $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ samples is sufficient to diffuse the
information to all $N$ data points. In addition, we propose quantitative
methods to measure the quality of embeddings and demonstrate the validity of
our technique on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  Network systems and their control are highly important and appear in a
variety of applications, including vehicle platooning and formation con- trol.
Especially vehicle platoons are highly investigated and an interesting problem
that arises in this area is string stability, which broadly spoken means that a
input signal amplifies unbounded as it travels through the vehicle string.
However, various definitions are commonly used. In this paper, we aim to
formalise the notion of string stability and illustrate the importance of those
distinctions on simulation examples. A second goal is to generalise the found
definitions for general network systems.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar is widely used in vehicles for applications
such as adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance. In this paper, we
propose an IEEE 802.11ad-based radar for long-range radar (LRR) applications at
the 60 GHz unlicensed band. We exploit the preamble of a single-carrier (SC)
physical layer (PHY) frame, which consists of Golay complementary sequences
with good correlation properties, as a radar waveform. This system enables a
joint waveform for automotive radar and a potential mmWave vehicular
communication system based on IEEE 802.11ad, allowing hardware reuse. To
formulate an integrated framework of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication and
LRR based on a mmWave consumer wireless local area network (WLAN) standard, we
make typical assumptions for LRR applications and incorporate the full duplex
radar assumption due to the possibility of sufficient isolation and
self-interference cancellation. We develop single- and multi-frame radar
receiver algorithms for target detection as well as range and velocity
estimation within a coherent processing interval. Our proposed radar processing
algorithms leverage channel estimation and time-frequency synchronization
techniques used in a conventional IEEE 802.11ad receiver with minimal
modifications. Analysis and simulations show that in a single target scenario,
a Gbps data rate is achieved simultaneously with cm-level range accuracy and
cm/s-level velocity accuracy. The target vehicle is detected with a high
probability of detection ($&gt;$99.9$\%$) at a low false alarm of 10$^{-6}$ for an
equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) of 43 dBm up to a vehicle
separation distance of 200 m.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces Progressively Diffused Networks (PDNs) for unifying
multi-scale context modeling with deep feature learning, by taking semantic
image segmentation as an exemplar application. Prior neural networks, such as
ResNet, tend to enhance representational power by increasing the depth of
architectures and driving the training objective across layers. However, we
argue that spatial dependencies in different layers, which generally represent
the rich contexts among data elements, are also critical to building deep and
discriminative representations. To this end, our PDNs enables to progressively
broadcast information over the learned feature maps by inserting a stack of
information diffusion layers, each of which exploits multi-dimensional
convolutional LSTMs (Long-Short-Term Memory Structures). In each LSTM unit, a
special type of atrous filters are designed to capture the short range and long
range dependencies from various neighbors to a certain site of the feature map
and pass the accumulated information to the next layer. From the extensive
experiments on semantic image segmentation benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet Parsing,
PASCAL VOC2012 and PASCAL-Part), our framework demonstrates the effectiveness
to substantially improve the performances over the popular existing neural
network models, and achieves state-of-the-art on ImageNet Parsing for large
scale semantic segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Modern software-based services are implemented as distributed systems with
complex behavior and failure modes. Many large tech organizations are using
experimentation to verify the reliability of such systems. We use the term
&quot;Chaos Engineering&quot; to refer to this approach, and discuss the underlying
principles and how to use it to run experiments.

 <dc:title>Novel Techniques to Derive Capacity Results for Multi-User Interference
  Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Interference Channels (ICs) represent fundamental building blocks of
wireless communication networks. Despite considerable progress in network
information theory, available capacity results for ICs, specifically those with
more than two users, are still very limited. One of the main difficulties in
the analysis of these networks is how to establish useful capacity outer bounds
for them. In this paper, novel techniques requiring subtle sequential
application of Csiszar-Korner identity are developed to establish efficient
single-letter outer bounds on the sum-rate capacity of interference networks.
By using the outer bounds, a full characterization of the sum-rate capacity is
then derived for various multi-user ICs under specific conditions. Our capacity
results hold for both discrete and Gaussian networks.

 <dc:description>  An $(n,k,r)$ \emph{locally repairable code} (LRC) is an $[n,k,d]$ linear code
where every code symbol can be repaired from at most $r$ other code symbols. An
LRC is said to be optimal if the minimum distance attains the Singleton-like
bound $d \le n-k-\lceil k/r \rceil +2$. The \emph{generalized Hamming weights}
(GHWs) of linear codes are fundamental parameters which have many useful
applications. Generally it is difficult to determine the GHWs of linear codes.
In this paper, we study the GHWs of LRCs. Firstly, we obtain a generalized
Singleton-like bound on the $i$-th $(1\le i \le k)$ GHWs of general $(n,k,r)$
LRCs. Then, it is shown that for an optimal $(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \mid k$, its
weight hierarchy can be completely determined, and the $i$-th GHW of an optimal
$(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \mid k$ attains the proposed generalized Singleton-like
bound for all $1\le i \le k$. For an optimal $(n,k,r)$ LRC with $r \nmid k$, we
give lower bounds on the GHWs of the LRC and its dual code. Finally, two
general bounds on linear codes in terms of the GHWs are presented. Moreover, it
is also shown that some previous results on the bounds of minimum distances of
linear codes can also be explained or refined in terms of the GHWs.

 <dc:title>Relay-Aided MIMO Cellular Networks Using Opposite Directional
  Interference Alignment</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kim, Hoyoun</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>No, Jong-Seon</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first propose interference alignment (IA) scheme for uplink
transmission of multiple-input-mulitple-output (MIMO) cellular network with a
help of relay which operates in halfduplex mode. The proposed scheme only
requires global channel state information (CSI) knowledge at relay and no
transmitter beamforming and time extension is required at user equipment (UE),
which differs from the conventional IA schemes for cellular network. We derive
the feasibility condition of the proposed scheme for the general network
configuration and analyze the degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance of the
proposed IA scheme. Extension of proposed scheme for downlink and full-duplex
network are further described in this paper. It is also shown that the same
advantage as the uplink case can be obtained for downlink case through relay
induced interfering multiple access channel (IMAC) and interfering broadcast
channel (IBC) duality. Furthermore, full-duplex network is shown to have same
advantages with half-duplex cases.

 <dc:title>Blocking Self-avoiding Walks Stops Cyber-epidemics: A Scalable GPU-based

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Cyber-epidemics, the widespread of fake news or propaganda through social
media, can cause devastating economic and political consequences. A common
countermeasure against cyber-epidemics is to disable a small subset of
suspected social connections or accounts to effectively contain the epidemics.
An example is the recent shutdown of 125,000 ISIS-related Twitter accounts.
Despite many proposed methods to identify such subset, none are scalable enough
to provide high-quality solutions in nowadays billion-size networks.
  To this end, we investigate the Spread Interdiction problems that seek most
effective links (or nodes) for removal under the well-known Linear Threshold
model. We propose novel CPU-GPU methods that scale to networks with billions of
edges, yet, possess rigorous theoretical guarantee on the solution quality. At
the core of our methods is an $O(1)$-space out-of-core algorithm to generate a
new type of random walks, called Hitting Self-avoiding Walks (HSAWs). Such a
low memory requirement enables handling of big networks and, more importantly,
hiding latency via scheduling of millions of threads on GPUs. Comprehensive
experiments on real-world networks show that our algorithms provides much
higher quality solutions and are several order of magnitude faster than the
state-of-the art. Comparing to the (single-core) CPU counterpart, our GPU
implementations achieve significant speedup factors up to 177x on a single GPU
and 338x on a GPU pair.

 <dc:description>  Sensor management in multi-object stochastic systems is a theoretically and
computationally challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to
the multi-target multi-sensor control problem within the partially observed
Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. We model the multi-object state as a
labeled multi-Bernoulli random finite set (RFS), and use the labeled
multi-Bernoulli filter in conjunction with minimizing a task-driven control
objective function: posterior expected error of cardinality and state (PEECS).
A major contribution is a guided search for multi-dimensional optimization in
the multi-sensor control command space, using coordinate descent method. In
conjunction with the Generalized Covariance Intersection method for
multi-sensor fusion, a fast multi-sensor algorithm is achieved. Numerical
studies are presented in several scenarios where numerous controllable (mobile)
sensors track multiple moving targets with different levels of observability.
The results show that our method works significantly faster than the approach
taken by a state of art method, with similar tracking errors.

 <dc:title>Robust Sparse Estimation Tasks in High Dimensions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we initiate the study of whether or not sparse estimation tasks
can be performed efficiently in high dimensions, in the robust setting where an
$\eps$-fraction of samples are corrupted adversarially. We study the natural
robust version of two classical sparse estimation problems, namely, sparse mean
estimation and sparse PCA in the spiked covariance model. For both of these
problems, we provide the first efficient algorithms that provide non-trivial
error guarantees in the presence of noise, using only a number of samples which
is similar to the number required for these problems without noise. In
particular, our sample complexities are sublinear in the ambient dimension $d$.
Our work also suggests evidence for new computational-vs-statistical gaps for
these problems (similar to those for sparse PCA without noise) which only arise
in the presence of noise.

 <dc:description>  A novel semantic approach to data selection and compression is presented for
the dynamic adaptation of IoT data processing and transmission within &quot;wireless
islands&quot;, where a set of sensing devices (sensors) are interconnected through
one-hop wireless links to a computational resource via a local access point.
The core of the proposed technique is a cooperative framework where local
classifiers at the mobile nodes are dynamically crafted and updated based on
the current state of the observed system, the global processing objective and
the characteristics of the sensors and data streams. The edge processor plays a
key role by establishing a link between content and operations within the
distributed system. The local classifiers are designed to filter the data
streams and provide only the needed information to the global classifier at the
edge processor, thus minimizing bandwidth usage. However, the better the
accuracy of these local classifiers, the larger the energy necessary to run
them at the individual sensors. A formulation of the optimization problem for
the dynamic construction of the classifiers under bandwidth and energy
constraints is proposed and demonstrated on a synthetic example.

 <dc:description>  Distributed optimization algorithms are widely used in many industrial
machine learning applications. However choosing the appropriate algorithm and
cluster size is often difficult for users as the performance and convergence
rate of optimization algorithms vary with the size of the cluster. In this
paper we make the case for an ML-optimizer that can select the appropriate
algorithm and cluster size to use for a given problem. To do this we propose
building two models: one that captures the system level characteristics of how
computation, communication change as we increase cluster sizes and another that
captures how convergence rates change with cluster sizes. We present
preliminary results from our prototype implementation called Hemingway and
discuss some of the challenges involved in developing such a system.

have even period and almost perfect autocorrelation. However, the evaluation of
the linear complexity of these sequences is really difficult. In this paper, we
continue the study of [1]. We first express the multiple roots of character
polynomials of SLCE sequences into certain kinds of Jacobi sums. Then by making
use of Gauss sums and Jacobi sums in the &quot;semiprimitive&quot; case, we derive new
divisibility results for SLCE sequences.

 <dc:description>  Traditionally, multi-layer neural networks use dot product between the output
vector of previous layer and the incoming weight vector as the input to
activation function. The result of dot product is unbounded, thus increases the
risk of large variance. Large variance of neuron makes the model sensitive to
the change of input distribution, thus results in poor generalization, and
aggravates the internal covariate shift which slows down the training. To bound
dot product and decrease the variance, we propose to use cosine similarity or
centered cosine similarity (Pearson Correlation Coefficient) instead of dot
product in neural networks, which we call cosine normalization. We compare
cosine normalization with batch, weight and layer normalization in
fully-connected neural networks as well as convolutional networks on the data
sets of MNIST, 20NEWS GROUP, CIFAR-10/100 and SVHN. Experiments show that
cosine normalization achieves better performance than other normalization
techniques.

 <dc:description>  Photos are becoming spontaneous, objective, and universal sources of
information. This paper develops evolving situation recognition using photo
streams coming from disparate sources combined with the advances of deep
learning. Using visual concepts in photos together with space and time
information, we formulate the situation detection into a semi-supervised
learning framework and propose new graph-based models to solve the problem. To
extend the method for unknown situations, we introduce a soft label method
which enables the traditional semi-supervised learning framework to accurately
predict predefined labels as well as effectively form new clusters. To overcome
the noisy data which degrades graph quality, leading to poor recognition
results, we take advantage of two kinds of noise-robust norms which can
eliminate the adverse effects of outliers in visual concepts and improve the
accuracy of situation recognition. Finally, we demonstrate the idea and the
effectiveness of the proposed model on Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100
Million.

 <dc:description>  Caching at mobile devices, accompanied by device-to-device (D2D)
communications, is one promising technique to accommodate the exponentially
increasing mobile data traffic. While most previous works ignored user
mobility, there are some recent works taking it into account. However, the
duration of user contact times has been ignored, making it difficult to
explicitly characterize the effect of mobility. In this paper, we adopt the
alternating renewal process to model the duration of both the contact and
inter-contact times, and investigate how the caching performance is affected by
mobility. The data offloading ratio, i.e., the proportion of requested data
that can be delivered via D2D links, is taken as the performance metric. We
first approximate the distribution of the communication time for a given user
by beta distribution through moment matching. With this approximation, an
accurate expression of the data offloading ratio is derived. For the
homogeneous case where the average contact and inter-contact times of different
user pairs are identical, we prove that the data offloading ratio increases
with the user moving speed, assuming that the transmission rate remains the
same. Simulation results are provided to show the accuracy of the approximate
result, and also validate the effect of user mobility.

 <dc:description>  Restricted Boltzmann Machines are described by the Gibbs measure of a
bipartite spin glass, which in turn corresponds to the one of a generalised
Hopfield network. This equivalence allows us to characterise the state of these
systems in terms of retrieval capabilities, both at low and high load. We study
the paramagnetic-spin glass and the spin glass-retrieval phase transitions, as
the pattern (i.e. weight) distribution and spin (i.e. unit) priors vary
smoothly from Gaussian real variables to Boolean discrete variables. Our
analysis shows that the presence of a retrieval phase is robust and not
peculiar to the standard Hopfield model with Boolean patterns. The retrieval
region is larger when the pattern entries and retrieval units get more peaked
and, conversely, when the hidden units acquire a broader prior and therefore
have a stronger response to high fields. Moreover, at low load retrieval always
exists below some critical temperature, for every pattern distribution ranging
from the Boolean to the Gaussian case.

 <dc:description>  Multi-label submodular Markov Random Fields (MRFs) have been shown to be
solvable using max-flow based on an encoding of the labels proposed by
Ishikawa, in which each variable $X_i$ is represented by $\ell$ nodes (where
$\ell$ is the number of labels) arranged in a column. However, this method in
general requires $2\,\ell^2$ edges for each pair of neighbouring variables.
This makes it inapplicable to realistic problems with many variables and
labels, due to excessive memory requirement. In this paper, we introduce a
variant of the max-flow algorithm that requires much less storage.
Consequently, our algorithm makes it possible to optimally solve multi-label
submodular problems involving large numbers of variables and labels on a
standard computer.

 <dc:description>  Multi-label image classification is a fundamental but challenging task in
computer vision. Great progress has been achieved by exploiting semantic
relations between labels in recent years. However, conventional approaches are
unable to model the underlying spatial relations between labels in multi-label
images, because spatial annotations of the labels are generally not provided.
In this paper, we propose a unified deep neural network that exploits both
semantic and spatial relations between labels with only image-level
supervisions. Given a multi-label image, our proposed Spatial Regularization
Network (SRN) generates attention maps for all labels and captures the
underlying relations between them via learnable convolutions. By aggregating
the regularized classification results with original results by a ResNet-101
network, the classification performance can be consistently improved. The whole
deep neural network is trained end-to-end with only image-level annotations,
thus requires no additional efforts on image annotations. Extensive evaluations
on 3 public datasets with different types of labels show that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts and has strong generalization
capability. Analysis of the learned SRN model demonstrates that it can
effectively capture both semantic and spatial relations of labels for improving
classification performance.

 <dc:description>  The rapid growth in the number and variety of connected devices requires 5G
wireless systems to cope with a very heterogeneous traffic mix. As a
consequence, the use of a fixed TTI during transmission is not necessarily the
most efficacious method when heterogeneous traffic types need to be
simultaneously serviced.This work analyzes the benefits of scheduling based on
exploiting scalable TTI, where the channel assignment and the TTI duration are
adapted to the deadlines and requirements of different services. We formulate
an optimization problem by taking individual service requirements into
consideration. We then prove that the optimization problem is NP-hard and
provide a heuristic algorithm, which provides an effective solution to the
problem. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm is capable of
finding near-optimal solutions to meet the latency requirements of mission
critical communication services, while providing a good throughput performance
for mobile broadband services.

 <dc:title>$\delta$-Greedy $t$-spanner</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bar-On, Gali</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Carmi, Paz</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new geometric spanner, $\delta$-Greedy, whose construction is
based on a generalization of the known Path-Greedy and Gap-Greedy spanners. The
$\delta$-Greedy spanner combines the most desirable properties of geometric
spanners both in theory and in practice. More specifically, it has the same
theoretical and practical properties as the Path-Greedy spanner: a natural
definition, small degree, linear number of edges, low weight, and strong
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$. The $\delta$-Greedy
algorithm is an improvement over the Path-Greedy algorithm with respect to the
number of shortest path queries and hence with respect to its construction
time. We show how to construct such a spanner for a set of $n$ points in the
plane in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time.
  The $\delta$-Greedy spanner has an additional parameter, $\delta$, which
indicates how close it is to the Path-Greedy spanner on the account of the
number of shortest path queries. For $\delta = t$ the output spanner is
identical to the Path-Greedy spanner, while the number of shortest path queries
is, in practice, linear.
  Finally, we show that for a set of $n$ points placed independently at random
in a unit square the expected construction time of the $\delta$-Greedy
algorithm is $O(n \log n)$. Our analysis indicates that the $\delta$-Greedy
spanner gives the best results among the known spanners of expected $O(n \log
n)$ time for random point sets. Moreover, the analysis implies that by setting
$\delta = t$, the $\delta$-Greedy algorithm provides a spanner identical to the
Path-Greedy spanner in expected $O(n \log n)$ time.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the physical layer multicasting to multiple
co-channel groups in large-scale antenna systems. The users within each group
are interested in a common message and different groups have distinct messages.
In particular, we aim at designing the precoding vectors solving the so-called
quality of service (QoS) and weighted max-min fairness (MMF) problems, assuming
that the channel state information is available at the base station (BS). To
solve both problems, the baseline approach exploits the semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) technique. Considering a BS with $N$ antennas, the SDR complexity is more
than $\mathcal{O}(N^{6})$, which prevents its application in large-scale
antenna systems. To overcome this issue, we present two new classes of
algorithms that, not only have significantly lower computational complexity
than existing solutions, but also largely outperform the SDR based methods.
Moreover, we present a novel duality between transformed versions of the QoS
and the weighted MMF problems. The duality explicitly determines the solution
to the weighted MMF problem given the solution to the QoS problem, and vice
versa. Numerical results are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
solutions and to make comparisons with existing alternatives under different
operating conditions.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach for efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)
search in high dimensional spaces, extending the idea of Product Quantization.
We propose a two-level product and vector quantization tree that reduces the
number of vector comparisons required during tree traversal. Our approach also
includes a novel highly parallelizable re-ranking method for candidate vectors
by efficiently reusing already computed intermediate values. Due to its small
memory footprint during traversal, the method lends itself to an efficient,
parallel GPU implementation. This Product Quantization Tree (PQT) approach
significantly outperforms recent state of the art methods for high dimensional
nearest neighbor queries on standard reference datasets. Ours is the first work
that demonstrates GPU performance superior to CPU performance on high
dimensional, large scale ANN problems in time-critical real-world applications,
like loop-closing in videos.

 <dc:description>  Various hypotheses exist about the paths used for communication between the
nodes of complex networks. Most studies simply suppose that communication goes
via shortest paths, while others have more explicit assumptions about how
routing (alternatively navigation or search) works or should work in real
networks. However, these assumptions are rarely checked against real data. Here
we directly analyze the structure of operational paths using real measurements.
For this purpose we use existing and newly created datasets having both the
topology of the network and a sufficient number of empirically-determined paths
over it. Such datasets are processed for air transportation networks, the human
brain, the Internet and the fit-fat-cat word ladder game. Our results suggest
that from the great number of possible paths, nature seems to pick according to
some simple rules, which we will refer to as routing policies. First we
confirm, that the preference of short paths is an inevitable policy element,
however the observed stretch of the paths suggests that there are other
policies at work simultaneously. We identify two additional policies common in
our networks: the &quot;conform hierarchy&quot;, meaning that the paths should obey the
structural hierarchy of the network, and the &quot;prefer downstream&quot; policy which
promotes avoiding the network core if possible. Building upon these simple
policies, we propose a synthetic routing policy which can recover the basic
statistical properties of the operational paths in networks. Our results can be
helpful in estimating the reaction of complex systems for stress coming from
the outside more accurately than the shortest path assumption permits.

model (CGM) introduced by Leskovec et al. [19]. Until now only empirical
studies of this model were done. In this paper, we present the first
theoretical proof that the sizes of cascades generated by the CGM follow the
power-law distribution, which is consistent with multiple empirical analysis of
the large social networks. We compared the assumptions of our model with the

 <dc:description>  Parrondo's paradox is ubiquitous in games, ratchets and random walks.The
apparent paradox, devised by J.~M.~R.~Parrondo, that two losing games $A$ and
$B$ can produce an winning outcome has been adapted in many physical and
biological systems to explain their working. However, proposals on
demonstrating Parrondo's paradox using quantum walks failed {for large number
of steps}. In this work, we show that instead of a single coin if we consider a
two coin initial state which may or may not be entangled, we can observe a
genuine Parrondo's paradox with quantum walks. Further we focus on reasons for
this and pin down the asymmetry in initial two-coin state or asymmetry in shift
operator, either of which are necessary for observing a genuine Parrondo's
paradox. We extend our work to a 3-coin initial state too with similar results.
The implications of our work for observing quantum ratchet like behavior using
quantum walks is also discussed.

 <dc:description>  The development of reliable imaging biomarkers for the analysis of colorectal
cancer (CRC) in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained histopathology images
requires an accurate and reproducible classification of the main tissue
components in the image. In this paper, we propose a system for CRC tissue
classification based on convolutional networks (ConvNets). We investigate the
importance of stain normalization in tissue classification of CRC tissue
samples in H&amp;E-stained images. Furthermore, we report the performance of
ConvNets on a cohort of rectal cancer samples and on an independent publicly
available dataset of colorectal H&amp;E images.

 <dc:description>  Binary search finds a given element in a sorted array with an optimal number
of $\log n$ queries. However, binary search fails even when the array is only
slightly disordered or access to its elements is subject to errors. We study
the worst-case query complexity of search algorithms that are robust to
imprecise queries and that adapt to perturbations of the order of the elements.
We give (almost) tight results for various parameters that quantify query
errors and that measure array disorder. In particular, we exhibit settings
where query complexities of $\log n + ck$, $(1+\varepsilon)\log n + ck$, and
$\sqrt{cnk}+o(nk)$ are best-possible for parameter value $k$, any
$\varepsilon&gt;0$, and constant $c$.

 <dc:description>  Polychronous neural groups are effective structures for the recognition of
precise spike-timing patterns but the detection method is an inefficient
multi-stage brute force process that works off-line on pre-recorded simulation
data. This work presents a new model of polychronous patterns that can capture
precise sequences of spikes directly in the neural simulation. In this scheme,
each neuron is assigned a randomized code that is used to tag the post-synaptic
neurons whenever a spike is transmitted. This creates a polychronous code that
preserves the order of pre-synaptic activity and can be registered in a hash
table when the post-synaptic neuron spikes. A polychronous code is a
sub-component of a polychronous group that will occur, along with others, when
the group is active. We demonstrate the representational and pattern
recognition ability of polychronous codes on a direction selective visual task
involving moving bars that is typical of a computation performed by simple
cells in the cortex. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm far
exceeds existing polychronous group detection methods and is well suited for
online detection.

 <dc:description>  Automatic non-invasive assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
malignancy has the potential to substantially enhance tumor treatment
strategies for HCC patients. In this work we present a novel framework to
automatically characterize the malignancy of HCC lesions from DWI images. We
predict HCC malignancy in two steps: As a first step we automatically segment
HCC tumor lesions using cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCN). A
3D neural network (SurvivalNet) then predicts the HCC lesions' malignancy from
the HCC tumor segmentation. We formulate this task as a classification problem
with classes being &quot;low risk&quot; and &quot;high risk&quot; represented by longer or shorter
survival times than the median survival. We evaluated our method on DWI of 31
HCC patients. Our proposed framework achieves an end-to-end accuracy of 65%
with a Dice score for the automatic lesion segmentation of 69% and an accuracy
of 68% for tumor malignancy classification based on expert annotations. We
compared the SurvivalNet to classical handcrafted features such as Histogram
and Haralick and show experimentally that SurvivalNet outperforms the
handcrafted features in HCC malignancy classification. End-to-end assessment of
tumor malignancy based on our proposed fully automatic framework corresponds to
assessment based on expert annotations with high significance (p&gt;0.95).

 <dc:title>Refined Vertex Sparsifiers of Planar Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Krauthgamer, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rika, Inbal</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the following version of cut sparsification. Given a large
edge-weighted network $G$ with $k$ terminal vertices, compress it into a
smaller network $H$ with the same terminals, such that every minimum terminal
cut in $H$ approximates the corresponding one in $G$, up to a factor $q\geq 1$
that is called the quality. (The case $q=1$ is known also as a mimicking
network). We provide new insights about the structure of minimum terminal cuts,
leading to new results for cut sparsifiers of planar graphs. Our first
contribution identifies a subset of the minimum terminal cuts, which we call
elementary, that generates all the others. Consequently, $H$ is a cut
sparsifier if and only if it preserves all the elementary terminal cuts (up to
this factor $q$). This structural characterization lead to improved bounds on
the size of $H$. For example, it improve the bound of mimicking-network size
for planar graphs into a near-optimal one. Our second and main contribution is
to refine the known bounds in terms of $\gamma=\gamma(G)$, which is defined as
the minimum number of faces that are incident to all the terminals in a planar
graph $G$. We prove that the number of elementary terminal cuts is
$O((2k/\gamma)^{2\gamma})$ (compared to $O(2^k)$ terminal cuts), and
furthermore obtain a mimicking-network of size $O(\gamma 2^{2\gamma} k^4)$,
which is near-optimal as a function of $\gamma$. In the analysis we break the
elementary terminal cuts into fragments, and count them carefully. Our third
contribution is a duality between cut sparsification and distance
sparsification for certain planar graphs, when the sparsifier $H$ is required
to be a minor of $G$. This duality connects problems that were previously
studied separately, implying new results, new proofs of known results, and
equivalences between open gaps.

 <dc:description>  We present a model that takes into account the coupling between evolutionary
game dynamics and social influence. Importantly, social influence and game
dynamics take place in different domains, which we model as different layers of
a multiplex network. We show that the coupling between these dynamical
processes can lead to cooperation in scenarios where the pure game dynamics
predicts defection. In addition, we show that the structure of the network
layers and the relation between them can further increase cooperation.
Remarkably, if the layers are related in a certain way, the system can reach a
polarized metastable state.These findings could explain the prevalence of
polarization observed in many social dilemmas.

 <dc:description>  What we eat is one of the most frequent and important health decisions we
make in daily life, yet it remains notoriously difficult to capture and
understand. Effective food journaling is thus a grand challenge in personal
health informatics. In this paper we describe a system for food journaling
called I Ate This, which is inspired by the Remote Food Photography Method
(RFPM). I Ate This is simple: you use a smartphone app to take a photo and give
a very basic description of any food or beverage you are about to consume.
Later, a qualified dietitian will evaluate your photo, giving you feedback on
how you did and where you can improve. The aim of I Ate This is to provide a
convenient, visual and reliable way to help users learn from their eating
habits and nudge them towards better choices each and every day. Ultimately,
this incremental approach can lead to long-term behaviour change. Our goal is
to bring RFPM to a wider audience, through APIs that can be incorporated into
other apps.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Photographs taken through a glass surface often contain an approximately
linear superposition of reflected and transmitted layers. Decomposing an image
into these layers is generally an ill-posed task and the use of an additional
image prior and user provided cues is presently necessary in order to obtain
good results. Current annotation approaches rely on a strong sparsity
assumption. For images with significant texture this assumption does not
typically hold, thus rendering the annotation process unviable. In this paper
we show that using a Gaussian Mixture Model patch prior, the correct local
decomposition can almost always be found as one of 100 likely modes of the
posterior. Thus, the user need only choose one of these modes in a sparse set
of patches and the decomposition may then be completed automatically. We
demonstrate the performance of our method using synthesized and real reflection
images.

 <dc:title>Practical, Linear-time, Fully Distributed Algorithms for Irregular
  Gather and Scatter</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tr&#xe4;ff, Jesper Larsson</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present new, simple, fully distributed, practical algorithms with linear
time communication cost for irregular gather and scatter operations in which
processors contribute or consume possibly different amounts of data. In a
linear cost transmission model with start-up latency $\alpha$ and cost per unit
$\beta$, the new algorithms take time $3|{\log_2 p}|\alpha+\beta \sum_{i\neq
r}m_i$ where $p$ is the number of processors, $m_i$ the amount of data for
processor $i, 0\leq i&lt;p$, and processor $r, 0\leq r&lt;p$ a root processor
determined by the algorithm. For a fixed, externally given root processor $r$,
there is an additive penalty of at most $\beta(M_{d'}-m_{r_{d'}}-\sum_{0\leq
j&lt;d'}M_j)$ time steps where each $M_j$ is the total amount of data in a tree of
$2^j$ different processors with roots $r_j$ as constructed by the algorithm.
The worst-case penalty is less than $\beta \sum_{i\neq r}m_i$ time steps. The
algorithms have attractive properties for implementing the operations for MPI
(the Message-Passing Interface). Standard algorithms using fixed trees take
time either $|{\log_2 p}|(\alpha+\beta \sum_{i\neq r} m_i)$ in the worst case,
or $\sum_{i\neq r}(\alpha+\beta m_i)$. We have used the new algorithms to give
prototype implementations for the MPI_Gatherv and MPI_Scatterv collectives of
MPI, and present benchmark results from a small and a medium-large InfiniBand
cluster. In order to structure the experimental evaluation we formulate new
performance guidelines for irregular collectives that can be used to assess the
performance in relation to the corresponding regular collectives. We show that
the new algorithms can fulfill these performance expectations with a large
margin, and that standard implementations do not.

 <dc:description>  Automatic segmentation of the liver and hepatic lesions is an important step
towards deriving quantitative biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis and
computer-aided decision support systems. This paper presents a method to
automatically segment liver and lesions in CT and MRI abdomen images using
cascaded fully convolutional neural networks (CFCNs) enabling the segmentation
of a large-scale medical trial or quantitative image analysis. We train and
cascade two FCNs for a combined segmentation of the liver and its lesions. In
the first step, we train a FCN to segment the liver as ROI input for a second
FCN. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of
step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100
hepatic tumor volumes. Validations on further datasets show that CFCN-based
semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver
with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally
demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on an 38 MRI liver tumor
volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.

 <dc:title>On the Spectral Efficiency and Fairness in Full-Duplex Cellular Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  To increase the spectral efficiency of wireless networks without requiring
full-duplex capability of user devices, a potential solution is the recently
proposed three-node full-duplex mode. To realize this potential, networks
employing three-node full-duplex transmissions must deal with self-interference
and user-to-user interference, which can be managed by frequency channel and
power allocation techniques. Whereas previous works investigated either
spectral efficient or fair mechanisms, a scheme that balances these two metrics
among users is investigated in this paper. This balancing scheme is based on a
new solution method of the multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the
weighted sum of the per-user spectral efficiency and the minimum spectral
efficiency among users. The mixed integer non-linear nature of this problem is
dealt by Lagrangian duality. Based on the proposed solution approach, a
low-complexity centralized algorithm is developed, which relies on large scale
fading measurements that can be advantageously implemented at the base station.
Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm increases the spectral
efficiency and fairness among users without the need of weighting the spectral
efficiency. An important conclusion is that managing user-to-user interference
by resource assignment and power control is crucial for ensuring spectral
efficient and fair operation of full-duplex networks.

 <dc:description>  Evaluating the accuracies of models for match outcome predictions is nice and
well but in the end the real proof is in the money to be made by betting. To
evaluate the question whether the models developed by us could be used easily
to make money via sports betting, we evaluate three cases: NCAAB post-season,
NBA season, and NFL season, and find that it is possible yet not without its
pitfalls. In particular, we illustrate that high accuracy does not
automatically equal high pay-out, by looking at the type of match-ups that are
predicted correctly by different models.

 <dc:title>Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on

 <dc:description>  Machine learning has been used to detect new malware in recent years, while
malware authors have strong motivation to attack such algorithms. Malware
authors usually have no access to the detailed structures and parameters of the
machine learning models used by malware detection systems, and therefore they
can only perform black-box attacks. This paper proposes a generative
adversarial network (GAN) based algorithm named MalGAN to generate adversarial
malware examples, which are able to bypass black-box machine learning based
detection models. MalGAN uses a substitute detector to fit the black-box
malware detection system. A generative network is trained to minimize the
generated adversarial examples' malicious probabilities predicted by the
substitute detector. The superiority of MalGAN over traditional gradient based
adversarial example generation algorithms is that MalGAN is able to decrease
the detection rate to nearly zero and make the retraining based defensive
method against adversarial examples hard to work.

 <dc:description>  We extend Fano's inequality, which controls the average probability of
(disjoint) events in terms of the average of some Kullback-Leibler divergences,
to work with arbitrary [0,1]-valued random variables. Our simple two-step
methodology is general enough to cover the case of an arbitrary (possibly
continuously infinite) family of distributions as well as [0,1]-valued random
variables not necessarily summing up to 1. Several novel applications are
provided, in which the consideration of random variables is particularly handy.
The most important applications deal with the problem of Bayesian posterior
concentration (minimax or distribution-dependent) rates and with a lower bound
on the regret in non-stochastic sequential learning. We also improve in passing
some earlier fundamental results: in particular, we provide a simple and
enlightening proof of the refined Pinsker's inequality of Ordentlich and
Weinberger and derive a sharper Bretagnolle-Huber inequality.

 <dc:description>  We propose an extended framework for marginalized domain adaptation, aimed at
addressing unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised scenarios. We argue
that the denoising principle should be extended to explicitly promote
domain-invariant features as well as help the classification task. Therefore we
propose to jointly learn the data auto-encoders and the target classifiers.
First, in order to make the denoised features domain-invariant, we propose a
domain regularization that may be either a domain prediction loss or a maximum
mean discrepancy between the source and target data. The noise marginalization
in this case is reduced to solving the linear matrix system $AX=B$ which has a
closed-form solution. Second, in order to help the classification, we include a
class regularization term. Adding this component reduces the learning problem
to solving a Sylvester linear matrix equation $AX+BX=C$, for which an efficient
iterative procedure exists as well. We did an extensive study to assess how
these regularization terms improve the baseline performance in the three domain
adaptation scenarios and present experimental results on two image and one text
benchmark datasets, conventionally used for validating domain adaptation
methods. We report our findings and comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Assurance of information-flow security by formal methods is mandated in
security certification of separation kernels. As an industrial standard for
improving safety, ARINC 653 has been complied with by mainstream separation
kernels. Due to the new trend of integrating safe and secure functionalities
into one separation kernel, security analysis of ARINC 653 as well as a formal
specification with security proofs are thus significant for the development and
certification of ARINC 653 compliant Separation Kernels (ARINC SKs). This paper
presents a specification development and security analysis method for ARINC SKs
based on refinement. We propose a generic security model and a stepwise
refinement framework. Two levels of functional specification are developed by
the refinement. A major part of separation kernel requirements in ARINC 653 are
modeled, such as kernel initialization, two-level scheduling, partition and
process management, and inter-partition communication. The formal specification
and its security proofs are carried out in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover. We
have reviewed the source code of one industrial and two open-source ARINC SK
implementations, i.e. VxWorks 653, XtratuM, and POK, in accordance with the
formal specification. During the verification and code review, six security
flaws, which can cause information leakage, are found in the ARINC 653 standard
and the implementations.

 <dc:title>The use of distributed thermal storage in district heating grids for

 <dc:description>  The work presented in this paper relates to a small scale district heating
network heated by a gas fired CHP. In most common situations, such a CHP is
heat driven operated, meaning that the CHP will switch on whenever heat is
needed, while not taking into account the demand of electricity at that time.
In this paper however, an active control strategy is developed, aiming to
maximize the profit of the CHP, selling its electricity to the spot market. The
CHP will therefore switch on at moments of high electricity prices.
Nevertheless, since there never is a perfect match between the demand of heat
and the demand of electricity, a thermal energy storage is included in the
network to overcome the difference between supply and demand of heat in the
network. In this study, three different storage concepts are compared: (1) a
central buffer tank next to the CHP; (2) small storage vessels distributed over
the different connected buildings; and (3) the use of the thermal mass if the
buildings as storage capacity. Besides the development of the control
algorithms based on model predictive control, a simulation model of the network
is described to evaluate the performance of the different storage concept
during a representative winter week. The results show that the presented
control algorithm can significantly influence the heat demand profile of the
connected buildings. As a results, active control of the CHP can drastically
increase the profit of the CHP. The concept with the distributed buffers gives
the best results, however the profit for the thermal mass concept is only
marginally smaller. Since in this latter case no significant investment costs
are needed, the conclusion for this case study is that the use of thermal mass
of buildings for demand side management in district heating systems is very
promising.

 <dc:description>  With the latest technology of vectoring, DSL data rates in the order of
100Mbps have become a reality that is under field deployment. The key is to
cancel crosstalk from other lines, which is also known as multiuser MIMO
cancellation for wireless communications. During the DSL system upgrade phase
of field deployment, mix of legacy and vectoring-enabled VDSL lines is
inevitable and a channel estimation solution for the entire mix is needed
before vectoring can be enforced. This paper describes a practical method for
crosstalk channel estimation for downstream vectoring, assuming that a
vectoring-enabled DSLAM forces DMT symbol-level timing to be aligned for all of
the lines, but also assuming that the location of synch symbols are aligned
only among vectoring-enabled lines. Each vectoring-enabled receiver is capable
of reporting error samples to vectoring-DSLAM. The estimation method is not
only practical, but also matches the performance of Maximum-Likelihood
estimator for the selected training sequences.

 <dc:description>  The rising attention to the spreading of fake news and unsubstantiated rumors
on online social media and the pivotal role played by confirmation bias led
researchers to investigate different aspects of the phenomenon. Experimental
evidence showed that confirmatory information gets accepted even if containing
deliberately false claims while dissenting information is mainly ignored or
might even increase group polarization. It seems reasonable that, to address
misinformation problem properly, we have to understand the main determinants
behind content consumption and the emergence of narratives on online social
media. In this paper we address such a challenge by focusing on the discussion
around the Italian Constitutional Referendum by conducting a quantitative,
cross-platform analysis on both Facebook public pages and Twitter accounts. We
observe the spontaneous emergence of well-separated communities on both
platforms. Such a segregation is completely spontaneous, since no
categorization of contents was performed a priori. By exploring the dynamics
behind the discussion, we find that users tend to restrict their attention to a
specific set of Facebook pages/Twitter accounts. Finally, taking advantage of
automatic topic extraction and sentiment analysis techniques, we are able to
identify the most controversial topics inside and across both platforms. We
measure the distance between how a certain topic is presented in the
posts/tweets and the related emotional response of users. Our results provide
interesting insights for the understanding of the evolution of the core
narratives behind different echo chambers and for the early detection of
massive viral phenomena around false claims.

PPAD$~\cap~$PLS that have resisted, in some cases for decades, attempts to put
them in polynomial time. No complete problem was known for CLS, and in previous
work, the problems ContractionMap, i.e., the problem of finding an approximate
fixpoint of a contraction map, and PLCP, i.e., the problem of solving a
P-matrix Linear Complementarity Problem, were identified as prime candidates.
  First, we present a new CLS-complete problem MetaMetricContractionMap, which
is closely related to the ContractionMap. Second, we introduce
EndOfPotentialLine, which captures aspects of PPAD and PLS directly via a
monotonic directed path, and show that EndOfPotentialLine is in CLS via a
two-way reduction to EndOfMeteredLine. The latter was defined to keep track of
how far a vertex is on the PPAD path via a restricted potential function.
Third, we reduce PLCP to EndOfPotentialLine, thus making EndOfPotentialLine and
EndOfMeteredLine at least as likely to be hard for CLS as PLCP. This last
result leverages the monotonic structure of Lemke paths for PLCP problems,
making EndOfPotentialLine a likely candidate to capture the exact complexity of
PLCP; we note that the structure of Lemke-Howson paths for finding a Nash
equilibrium in a two-player game very directly motivated the definition of the
complexity class PPAD, which eventually ended up capturing this problem's
complexity exactly.

 <dc:description>  The widespread availability of GPS information in everyday devices such as
cars, smartphones and smart watches make it possible to collect large amount of
geospatial trajectory information. A particularly important, yet technically
challenging, application of this data is to identify the underlying road
network and keep it updated under various changes. In this paper, we propose
efficient algorithms that can generate accurate maps in both batch and online
settings. Our algorithms utilize techniques from graph spanners so that they
produce maps can effectively handle a wide variety of road and intersection
shapes. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of our algorithms over two real-world
datasets and under a wide variety of performance metrics. Our experiments show
a significant improvement over prior work. In particular, we observe an
increase in Biagioni f-score of up to 20% when compared to the state of the art
while reducing the execution time by an order of magnitude. We also make our
source code open source for reproducibility and enable other researchers to
build on our work.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An evolutionary model for emergence of diversity in language is developed. We
investigated the effects of two real life observations, namely, people prefer
people that they communicate with well, and people interact with people that
are physically close to each other. Clearly these groups are relatively small
compared to the entire population. We restrict selection of the teachers from
such small groups, called imitation sets, around parents. Then the child learns
language from a teacher selected within the imitation set of her parent. As a
result, there are subcommunities with their own languages developed. Within
subcommunity comprehension is found to be high. The number of languages is
related to the relative size of imitation set by a power law.

 <dc:description>  Modern distributed systems often rely on so called weakly-consistent
databases, which achieve scalability by sacrificing the consistency guarantee
of distributed transaction processing. Such databases have been formalised in
two different styles, one based on abstract executions and the other based on
dependency graphs. The choice between these styles has been made according to
intended applications: the former has been used to specify and verify the
implementation of these databases, and the latter to prove properties of
programs running on top of the databases. In this paper, we present a set of
novel algebraic laws (i.e. inequations) that connect these two styles of
specifications; the laws relate binary relations used in a specification based
on abstract executions, to those used in a specification based on dependency
graphs. We then show that this algebraic connection gives rise to so called
robustness criteria, conditions which ensures that a program running on top of
a weakly-consistent database does not exhibit anomalous behaviours due to this
weak consistency. These criteria make it easy to reason about programs running
on top of these databases, and may become a basis for dynamic or static program
analyses. For a certain class of consistency models specifications, we prove a
full abstraction result that connects the two styles of specifications.

 <dc:title>Joint Transmission with Dummy Symbols for Dynamic TDD in Ultra-Dense
  Deployments</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD) is considered a promising solution to
deal with fast-varying traffic often found in ultra-densely deployed networks.
At the same time, it generates more interference which may degrade the
performance of some user equipment (UE). When base station (BS) utilization is
low, some BSs may not have an UE to serve. Rather than going into sleep mode,
the idle BSs can help nearby UEs using joint transmission. To deal with
BS-to-BS interference, we propose using joint transmission with dummy symbols
where uplink BSs serving uplink UEs participate in the precoding. Since BSs are
not aware of the uplink symbols beforehand, any symbols with zero power can be
transmitted instead to null the BS-to-BS interference. Numerical results show
significant performance gains for uplink and downlink at low and medium
utilization. By varying the number of participating uplink BSs in the
precoding, we also show that it is possible to successfully trade performance
in the two directions.

 <dc:description>  One of the long-standing challenges in Artificial Intelligence for learning
goal-directed behavior is to build a single agent which can solve multiple
tasks. Recent progress in multi-task learning for goal-directed sequential
problems has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a student
network learns from multiple task-specific expert networks by mimicking the
task-specific policies of the expert networks. While such approaches offer a
promising solution to the multi-task learning problem, they require supervision
from large expert networks which require extensive data and computation time
for training. In this work, we propose an efficient multi-task learning
framework which solves multiple goal-directed tasks in an on-line setup without
the need for expert supervision. Our work uses active learning principles to
achieve multi-task learning by sampling the harder tasks more than the easier
ones. We propose three distinct models under our active sampling framework. An
adaptive method with extremely competitive multi-tasking performance. A
UCB-based meta-learner which casts the problem of picking the next task to
train on as a multi-armed bandit problem. A meta-learning method that casts the
next-task picking problem as a full Reinforcement Learning problem and uses
actor critic methods for optimizing the multi-tasking performance directly. We
demonstrate results in the Atari 2600 domain on seven multi-tasking instances:
three 6-task instances, one 8-task instance, two 12-task instances and one
21-task instance.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement Learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral patterns for
sequential decision making tasks wherein an agent interacts with an environment
and acquires feedback in the form of rewards sampled from it. Traditionally,
such algorithms make decisions, i.e., select actions to execute, at every
single time step of the agent-environment interactions. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, Fine Grained Action Repetition (FiGAR), which
enables the agent to decide the action as well as the time scale of repeating
it. FiGAR can be used for improving any Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm
which maintains an explicit policy estimate by enabling temporal abstractions
in the action space. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
by showing performance improvements on top of three policy search algorithms in
different domains: Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic in the Atari 2600
domain, Trust Region Policy Optimization in Mujoco domain and Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradients in the TORCS car racing domain.

 <dc:creator>Chin, Seungbeom</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new family of coherence monotones, named the \emph{generalized
coherence concurrence} (or coherence $k$-concurrence), which is an analogous
concept to the generalized entanglement concurrence. The coherence
$k$-concurrence of a state is nonzero if and only if the coherence number (a
recently introduced discrete coherence monotone) of the state is not smaller
than $k$, and a state can be converted to a state with nonzero entanglement
$k$-concurrence via incoherent operations if and only if the state has nonzero
coherence $k$-concurrence. We apply the coherence concurrence family to the
problem of wave-particle duality in multi-path interference phenomena. We
obtain a sharper equation for path distinguishability (which witness the
duality) than the known value and show that the amount of each concurrence for
the quanton state determines the number of slits which are identified
unambiguously.

 <dc:description>  We investigate approximately optimal mechanisms in settings where bidders'
utility functions are non-linear; specifically, convex, with respect to
payments (such settings arise, for instance, in procurement auctions for
energy). We provide constant factor approximation guarantees for mechanisms
that are independent of bidders' private information (i.e., prior-free), and
for mechanisms that rely to an increasing extent on that information (i.e.,
detail free). We also describe experiments, which show that for randomly drawn
monotone hazard rate distributions, our mechanisms achieve at least 80\% of the
optimal revenue, on average. Both our theoretical and experimental results show
that in the convex payment setting, it is desirable to allocate across multiple
bidders, rather than only to bidders with the highest (virtual) value, as in
the traditional quasi-linear utility setting.

 <dc:description>  Neuromorphic computing using post-CMOS technologies is gaining immense
popularity due to its promising abilities to address the memory and power
bottlenecks in von-Neumann computing systems. In this paper, we propose RESPARC
- a reconfigurable and energy efficient architecture built-on Memristive
Crossbar Arrays (MCA) for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Prior works were
primarily focused on device and circuit implementations of SNNs on crossbars.
RESPARC advances this by proposing a complete system for SNN acceleration and
its subsequent analysis. RESPARC utilizes the energy-efficiency of MCAs for
inner-product computation and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design to
incorporate the data-flow patterns in an SNN in a scalable fashion. We evaluate
the proposed architecture on different SNNs ranging in complexity from 2k-230k
neurons and 1.2M-5.5M synapses. Simulation results on these networks show that
compared to the baseline digital CMOS architecture, RESPARC achieves 500X (15X)
efficiency in energy benefits at 300X (60X) higher throughput for multi-layer
perceptrons (deep convolutional networks). Furthermore, RESPARC is a
technology-aware architecture that maps a given SNN topology to the most
optimized MCA size for the given crossbar technology.

 <dc:description>  In simulation of fluid injection in fractured geothermal reservoirs, the
characteristics of the physical processes are severely affected by the local
occurence of connected fractures. To resolve these structurally dominated
processes, there is a need to develop discretization strategies that also limit
computational effort. In this paper we present an upscaling methodology for
geothermal heat transport with fractures represented explicitly in the
computational grid. The heat transport is modeled by an advection-conduction
equation for the temperature, and solved on a highly irregular coarse grid that
preserves the fracture heterogeneity. The upscaling is based on different
strategies for the advective term and the conductive term, respectively. The
coarse scale advective term is constructed from sums of fine scale fluxes,
whereas the coarse scale conductive term is constructed based on numerically
computed basis functions. The method naturally incorporates a coupling between
the matrix and the fractures via the discretization, so that explicit transfer
terms that couple solution variables in the fractures and the matrix are
avoided. Numerical results show that the upscaling methodology performs well,
in particular for large upscaling ratios, and that it is applicable also to
highly complex fracture networks.

 <dc:description>  The paper takes the first step towards the de- velopment of a control
framework for underactuated flying humanoid robots. These robots may thus have
the capacities of flight, contact locomotion, and manipulation, and benefit
from technologies and methods developed for Whole-Body Control and Aerial
Manipulation. As in the case of quadrotors, we as- sume that the humanoid robot
is powered by four thrust forces. For convenience, these forces are placed at
the robot hands and feet. The control objective is defined as the asymptotic
stabilization of the robot centroidal momentum. This objective allows us to
track a desired trajectory for the robot center of mass and keep small errors
between a reference orientation and the robot base frame. Stability and
convergence of the robot momentum are shown to be in the sense of Lyapunov.
Simulations carried out on a model of the humanoid robot iCub verify the
soundness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  We consider learning a predictor which is non-discriminatory with respect to
a &quot;protected attribute&quot; according to the notion of &quot;equalized odds&quot; proposed by
Hardt et al. [2016]. We study the problem of learning such a non-discriminatory
predictor from a finite training set, both statistically and computationally.
We show that a post-hoc correction approach, as suggested by Hardt et al, can
be highly suboptimal, present a nearly-optimal statistical procedure, argue
that the associated computational problem is intractable, and suggest a second
moment relaxation of the non-discrimination definition for which learning is
tractable.

 <dc:description>  Redundancy is abundant in Fog networks (i.e., many computing and storage
points) and grows linearly with network size. We demonstrate the
transformational role of coding in Fog computing for leveraging such redundancy
to substantially reduce the bandwidth consumption and latency of computing. In
particular, we discuss two recently proposed coding concepts, namely Minimum
Bandwidth Codes and Minimum Latency Codes, and illustrate their impacts in Fog
computing. We also review a unified coding framework that includes the above
two coding techniques as special cases, and enables a tradeoff between
computation latency and communication load to optimize system performance. At
the end, we will discuss several open problems and future research directions.

 <dc:title>Synthesis versus analysis in patch-based image priors</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In global models/priors (for example, using wavelet frames), there is a well
known analysis vs synthesis dichotomy in the way signal/image priors are
formulated. In patch-based image models/priors, this dichotomy is also present
in the choice of how each patch is modeled. This paper shows that there is
another analysis vs synthesis dichotomy, in terms of how the whole image is
related to the patches, and that all existing patch-based formulations that
provide a global image prior belong to the analysis category. We then propose a
synthesis formulation, where the image is explicitly modeled as being
synthesized by additively combining a collection of independent patches. We
formally establish that these analysis and synthesis formulations are not
equivalent in general and that both formulations are compatible with analysis
and synthesis formulations at the patch level. Finally, we present an instance
of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that can be used to
perform image denoising under the proposed synthesis formulation, showing its
computational feasibility. Rather than showing the superiority of the synthesis
or analysis formulations, the contributions of this paper is to establish the
existence of both alternatives, thus closing the corresponding gap in the field
of patch-based image processing.

 <dc:description>  Label distribution learning (LDL) is a general learning framework, which
assigns to an instance a distribution over a set of labels rather than a single
label or multiple labels. Current LDL methods have either restricted
assumptions on the expression form of the label distribution or limitations in
representation learning, e.g., to learn deep features in an end-to-end manner.
This paper presents label distribution learning forests (LDLFs) - a novel label
distribution learning algorithm based on differentiable decision trees, which
have several advantages: 1) Decision trees have the potential to model any
general form of label distributions by a mixture of leaf node predictions. 2)
The learning of differentiable decision trees can be combined with
representation learning. We define a distribution-based loss function for a
forest, enabling all the trees to be learned jointly, and show that an update
function for leaf node predictions, which guarantees a strict decrease of the
loss function, can be derived by variational bounding. The effectiveness of the
proposed LDLFs is verified on several LDL tasks and a computer vision
application, showing significant improvements to the state-of-the-art LDL
methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an alternative way to identify nodes with high
betweenness centrality. It introduces a new metric, k-path centrality, and a
randomized algorithm for estimating it, and shows empirically that nodes with
high k-path centrality have high node betweenness centrality. The randomized
algorithm runs in time $O(\kappa^{3}n^{2-2\alpha}\log n)$ and outputs, for each
vertex v, an estimate of its k-path centrality up to additive error of $\pm
n^{1/2+ \alpha}$ with probability $1-1/n^2$. Experimental evaluations on real
and synthetic social networks show improved accuracy in detecting high
betweenness centrality nodes and significantly reduced execution time when
compared with existing randomized algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Reducing interaction nets without any specific strategy benefits from
constant time per step. On the other hand, a canonical reduction step for weak
reduction to interface normal form is linear by depth of terms. In this paper,
we refine the weak interaction calculus to reveal the actual cost of its
reduction. As a result, we obtain a notion of needed reduction that can be
implemented in constant time per step without allowing any free ports and
without sacrificing parallelism.

 <dc:title>An optimal XP algorithm for Hamiltonian cycle on graphs of bounded

 <dc:description>  For MSO$_2$-expressible problems like Edge Dominating Set or Hamiltonian
Cycle, it was open for a long time whether there is an algorithm which given a
clique-width $k$-expression of an $n$-vertex graph runs in time $f(k) \cdot
n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ for some function $f$. Recently, Fomin et al. (\emph{SIAM.
J. Computing}, 2014) presented several lower bounds; for instance, there are no
$f(k)\cdot n^{o(k)}$-time algorithms for Edge Dominating Set and for
Hamiltonian Cycle unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. They also
provided an algorithm running in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ for Edge Dominating
Set, but left open whether Hamiltonian Cycle can be solved in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$.
  In this paper, we prove that Hamiltonian Cycle can be solved in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. This improves the naive algorithm that runs in time
$n^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}$ by Espelage et al. (WG 2001). We present a general
technique of representative sets using two-edge colored multigraphs on $k$
vertices. The essential idea behind is that for a two-edge colored multigraph,
the existence of an Eulerian trail that uses edges with different colors
alternatively can be determined by two information, that are the number of
colored edges incident with each vertex and the number of connected components
containing an edge. This allows to avoid storing all possible graphs on $k$
vertices with at most $n$ edges, which gives the $n^{\mathcal{O}(k^2)}$ running
time.

 <dc:title>Preemptive Online Partitioning of Sequences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Konrad, Christian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tonoyan, Tigran</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Online algorithms process their inputs piece by piece, taking irrevocable
decisions for each data item. This model is too restrictive for most
partitioning problems, since data that is yet to arrive may render it
impossible to extend partial partitionings to the entire data set reasonably
well.
  In this work, we show that preemption might be a potential remedy. We
consider the problem of partitioning online sequences, where $p-1$ separators
need to be inserted into a sequence of integers that arrives online so as to
create $p$ contiguous partitions of similar weight. While without preemption no
algorithm with non-trivial competitive ratio is possible, if preemption is
allowed, i.e., inserted partition separators may be removed but not reinserted
again, then we show that constant competitive algorithms can be obtained. Our
contributions include:
  We first give a simple deterministic $2$-competitive preemptive algorithm for
arbitrary $p$ and arbitrary sequences. Our main contribution is the design of a
highly non-trivial partitioning scheme, which, under some natural conditions
and $p$ being a power of two, allows us to improve the competitiveness to
$1.68$. We also show that the competitiveness of deterministic (randomized)
algorithms is at least $\frac{4}{3}$ (resp. $\frac{6}{5}$).
  For $p=2$, the problem corresponds to the interesting special case of
preemptively guessing the center of a weighted request sequence. While
deterministic algorithms fail here, we provide a randomized $1.345$-competitive
algorithm for all-ones sequences and prove that this is optimal. For weighted
sequences, we give a $1.628$-competitive algorithm and a lower bound of $1.5$.

regret on a time horizon from $(\ln t)^3$ to $(\ln t)^2$ and eliminates an

gap of a problem instance. In the adversarial regime regret guarantee remains
unchanged.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In information retrieval, learning to rank constructs a machine-based ranking
model which given a query, sorts the search results by their degree of
relevance or importance to the query. Neural networks have been successfully
applied to this problem, and in this paper, we propose an attention-based deep
neural network which better incorporates different embeddings of the queries
and search results with an attention-based mechanism. This model also applies a
decoder mechanism to learn the ranks of the search results in a listwise
fashion. The embeddings are trained with convolutional neural networks or the
word2vec model. We demonstrate the performance of this model with image
retrieval and text querying data sets.

 <dc:description>  We give faster algorithms for producing sparse approximations of the
transition matrices of $k$-step random walks on undirected, weighted graphs.
These transition matrices also form graphs, and arise as intermediate objects
in a variety of graph algorithms. Our improvements are based on a better
understanding of processes that sample such walks, as well as tighter bounds on
key weights underlying these sampling processes. On a graph with $n$ vertices
and $m$ edges, our algorithm produces a graph with about $n\log{n}$ edges that
approximates the $k$-step random walk graph in about $m + n \log^4{n}$ time. In
order to obtain this runtime bound, we also revisit &quot;density independent&quot;
algorithms for sparsifying graphs whose runtime overhead is expressed only in
terms of the number of vertices.

 <dc:description>  If we assume line-of-sight propagation and perfect channel state information
at the base station -- consistent with slow moving terminals -- then a direct
performance comparison between single-cell Massive MIMO at PCS and mmWave
frequency bands is straightforward and highly illuminating. Line-of-sight
propagation is considered favorable for mmWave because of minimal attenuation,
and its facilitation of hybrid beamforming to reduce the required number of
active transceivers. We quantify the number of mmWave (60 GHz) service antennas
that are needed to duplicate the performance of a specified number of PCS (1.9
GHz) service antennas. As a baseline we consider a modest PCS deployment of 128
antennas serving 18 terminals. We find that, to achieve the same per-terminal
max-min 95%-likely downlink throughput, 10000 mmWave antennas are needed. To
match the total antenna area of the PCS array would require 128000
half-wavelength mmWave antennas, but a much reduced number is adequate because
the large number of antennas also confers greater channel orthogonality. The
principal alleged benefit of mmWave technology--vast amounts of inexpensive
spectrum--is at least partially offset by the complexity of possibly unwieldy
amounts of hardware.

 <dc:description>  In this work we deal with the so-called path convexities, defined over
special collections of paths. For example, the collection of the shortest paths
in a graph is associated with the well-known geodesic convexity, while the
collection of the induced paths is associated with the monophonic convexity;
and there are many other examples. Besides reviewing the path convexities in
the literature, we propose a general path convexity framework, of which most
existing path convexities can be viewed as particular cases. Some benefits of
the proposed framework are the systematization of the algorithmic study of
related problems and the possibility of defining new convexities not yet
investigated.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a fast and robust method for fixed pattern noise
nonuniformity correction of infrared focal plane arrays. The proposed method
requires neither shutter nor elaborate calibrations and therefore enables a
real time correction with no interruptions. Based on derivative estimation of
the fixed pattern noise from pixel sized translations of the focal plane array,
the proposed method has the advantages of being invariant to the noise
magnitude and robust to unknown camera and inter-scene movements while being
virtually transparent to the end-user.

 <dc:description>  Modern computing systems based on the von Neumann architecture are built from
silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistors that need to
operate under practically error free conditions with 1 error in $10^{15}$
switching events. The physical dimensions of CMOS transistors have scaled down
over the past five decades leading to exponential increases in functional
density and energy consumption. Today, the energy and delay reductions from
scaling have stagnated, motivating the search for a CMOS replacement. Of these,
spintronics offers a path for enhancing the functional density and scaling the
energy down to fundamental thermodynamic limits of 100kT to 1000kT. However,
spintronic devices exhibit high error rates of 1 in 10 or more when operating
at these limits, rendering them incompatible with deterministic nature of the
von Neumann architecture. We show that a Shannon-inspired statistical computing
framework can be leveraged to design a computer made from such stochastic
spintronic logic gates to provide a computational accuracy close to that of a
deterministic computer. This extraordinary result allowing a $10^{13}$ fold
relaxation in acceptable error rates is obtained by engineering the error
distribution coupled with statistical error compensation.

 <dc:description>  We prove in this paper that the expected value of the objective function of
the $k$-means++ algorithm for samples converges to population expected value.
As $k$-means++, for samples, provides with constant factor approximation for
$k$-means objectives, such an approximation can be achieved for the population
with increase of the sample size.
  This result is of potential practical relevance when one is considering using
subsampling when clustering large data sets (large data bases).

binary matrices from their row and column sums under additional constraints on
the number and pattern of entries in specified minors. While the classical
consistency and reconstruction problems for two directions in discrete
tomography can be solved in polynomial time, it turns out that these window
constraints cause various unexpected complexity jumps back and forth from
polynomial-time solvability to $\mathbb{N}\mathbb{P}$-hardness.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel and elegant solution to &quot;Multi-Source
Neural Machine Translation&quot; (MSNMT) which only relies on preprocessing a N-way
multilingual corpus without modifying the Neural Machine Translation (NMT)
architecture or training procedure. We simply concatenate the source sentences
to form a single long multi-source input sentence while keeping the target side
sentence as it is and train an NMT system using this preprocessed corpus. We
evaluate our method in resource poor as well as resource rich settings and show
its effectiveness (up to 4 BLEU using 2 source languages and up to 6 BLEU using
5 source languages) by comparing against existing methods for MSNMT. We also
provide some insights on how the NMT system leverages multilingual information
in such a scenario by visualizing attention.

 <dc:description>  Feature extraction is a critical component of many applied data science
workflows. In recent years, rapid advances in artificial intelligence and
machine learning have led to an explosion of feature extraction tools and
services that allow data scientists to cheaply and effectively annotate their
data along a vast array of dimensions---ranging from detecting faces in images
to analyzing the sentiment expressed in coherent text. Unfortunately, the
proliferation of powerful feature extraction services has been mirrored by a
corresponding expansion in the number of distinct interfaces to feature
extraction services. In a world where nearly every new service has its own API,
documentation, and/or client library, data scientists who need to combine
diverse features obtained from multiple sources are often forced to write and
maintain ever more elaborate feature extraction pipelines. To address this
challenge, we introduce a new open-source framework for comprehensive
multimodal feature extraction. Pliers is an open-source Python package that
supports standardized annotation of diverse data types (video, images, audio,
and text), and is expressly with both ease-of-use and extensibility in mind.
Users can apply a wide range of pre-existing feature extraction tools to their
data in just a few lines of Python code, and can also easily add their own
custom extractors by writing modular classes. A graph-based API enables rapid
development of complex feature extraction pipelines that output results in a
single, standardized format. We describe the package's architecture, detail its
major advantages over previous feature extraction toolboxes, and use a sample
application to a large functional MRI dataset to illustrate how pliers can
significantly reduce the time and effort required to construct sophisticated
feature extraction workflows while increasing code clarity and maintainability.

 <dc:title>Throughput Optimal Beam Alignment in Millimeter Wave Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hussain, Muddassar</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave communications rely on narrow-beam transmissions to cope with
the strong signal attenuation at these frequencies, thus demanding precise beam
alignment between transmitter and receiver. The communication overhead incurred
to achieve beam alignment may become a severe impairment in mobile networks.
This paper addresses the problem of optimizing beam alignment acquisition, with
the goal of maximizing throughput. Specifically, the algorithm jointly
determines the portion of time devoted to beam alignment acquisition, as well
as, within this portion of time, the optimal beam search parameters, using the
framework of Markov decision processes. It is proved that a bisection search
algorithm is optimal, and that it outperforms exhaustive and iterative search
algorithms proposed in the literature. The duration of the beam alignment phase
is optimized so as to maximize the overall throughput. The numerical results
show that the throughput, optimized with respect to the duration of the beam
alignment phase, achievable under the exhaustive algorithm is 88.3% lower than
that achievable under the bisection algorithm. Similarly, the throughput
achievable by the iterative search algorithm for a division factor of 4 and 8
is, respectively, 12.8% and 36.4% lower than that achievable by the bisection
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we prove a sharp limit on the community detection problem with
colored edges. We assume two equal-sized communities and there are $m$
different types of edges. If two vertices are in the same community, the
distribution of edges follows $p_i=\alpha_i\log{n}/n$ for $1\leq i \leq m$,
otherwise the distribution of edges is $q_i=\beta_i\log{n}/n$ for $1\leq i \leq
m$, where $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ are positive constants and $n$ is the total
number of vertices. Under these assumptions, a fundamental limit on community
detection is characterized using the Hellinger distance between the two
distributions. If $\sum_{i=1}^{m} {(\sqrt{\alpha_i} - \sqrt{\beta_i})}^2 &gt;2$,
then the community detection via maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is possible
with high probability. If $\sum_{i=1}^m {(\sqrt{\alpha_i} - \sqrt{\beta_i})}^2
&lt; 2$, the probability that the ML estimator fails to detect the communities
does not go to zero.

In this paper, we apply new clustering methods to improve the computational
time. We use the properties of the adjacency matrix to obtain better role
extraction. We also define a new non-recursive similarity measure and compare
its results with the ones obtained with Browet's similarity measure. We will
show the extraction of the different roles with a linear time complexity.
Finally, we test our algorithm with real data structures and analyse the limit

 <dc:description>  In this paper we explore city-level traffic and parking data to determine how
much cruising for curbside parking contributes to overall traffic congestion.
To this end, we describe a new kind of queueing network and present a
data-informed model based on this new queuing network. We leverage the
data-informed model in developing and validating a simulation tool. In
addition, we utilize curbside parking and arterial traffic volume data to
produce an estimate of the proportion of traffic searching for parking along
high occupancy arterials. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that while percentage
increase in travel time to through traffic vehicles depends on time of day, it
does not appear to depend on high volumes of through traffic. Moreover, we show
that the probability of a block-face being full is a much more viable metric
for directly controlling congestion than average occupancy rate, typically used
by municipalities.

 <dc:description>  An outlier-resistance phase retrieval algorithm based on alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is devised in this letter. Instead of
the widely used least squares criterion that is only optimal for Gaussian noise
environment, we adopt the least absolute deviation criterion to enhance the
robustness against outliers. Considering both intensity- and amplitude-based
observation models, the framework of ADMM is developed to solve the resulting
non-differentiable optimization problems. It is demonstrated that the core
subproblem of ADMM is the proximity operator of the L1-norm, which can be
computed efficiently by soft-thresholding in each iteration. Simulation results
are provided to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach
compared to the existing schemes.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we have designed and implemented, based on traditional board
games such as the game of the Goose or Parchis, an educational software that
aim to reinforce the learning of children. The idea that we are going to
develop to do this is very simple: the children play with the same rules as in
the traditional game but we add the functionality that after throwing the dice
the system asks a question randomly chosen from a predefined database that can
be easily modified, and the game piece only moves in the case the question is
answered correctly.

 <dc:description>  Personal sensory data is used by context-aware mobile applications to provide
utility. However, the same data can also be used by an adversary to make
sensitive inferences about a user thereby violating her privacy.
  We present DEEProtect, a framework that enables a novel form of inference
control, in which mobile apps with access to sensor data are limited (provably)
in their ability to make inferences about user's sensitive data and behavior.
DEEProtect adopts a two-layered privacy strategy. First, it leverages novel
autoencoder techniques to perform data minimization and limits the amount of
information being shared; the learning network is used to derive a compact
representation of sensor data consisting only of features relevant to
authorized utility-providing inferences. Second, DEEProtect obfuscates the
previously learnt features, thereby providing an additional layer of protection
against sensitive inferences. Our framework supports both conventional as well
as a novel relaxed notion of local differential privacy that enhances utility.
Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments using real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that when compared to existing approaches DEEProtect
provides provable privacy guarantees with up to 8x improvement in utility.
Finally, DEEProtect shares obfuscated but raw sensor data reconstructed from
the perturbed features, thus requiring no changes to the existing app
interfaces.

 <dc:title>Survey of Automated Vulnerability Detection and Exploit Generation
  Techniques in Cyber Reasoning Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Software is everywhere, from mission critical systems such as industrial
power stations, pacemakers and even household appliances. This growing
dependence on technology and the increasing complexity software has serious
security implications as it means we are potentially surrounded by software
that contain exploitable vulnerabilities. These challenges have made binary
analysis an important area of research in computer science and has emphasized
the need for building automated analysis systems that can operate at scale,
speed and efficacy; all while performing with the skill of a human expert.
Though great progress has been made in this area of research, there remains
limitations and open challenges to be addressed. Recognizing this need, DARPA
sponsored the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC), a competition to showcase the
current state of the art in systems that perform; automated vulnerability
detection, exploit generation and software patching. This paper is a survey of
the vulnerability detection and exploit generation techniques, underlying
technologies and related works of two of the winning systems Mayhem and
Mechanical Phish.

 <dc:description>  Edge bundling is an important concept heavily used for graph visualization
purposes. To enable the comparison with other established near-planarity models
in graph drawing, we formulate a new edge-bundling model which is inspired by
the recently introduced fan-planar graphs. In particular, we restrict the
bundling to the end segments of the edges. Similarly to 1-planarity, we call
our model 1-fan-bundle-planarity, as we allow at most one crossing per bundle.
  For the two variants where we allow either one or, more naturally, both end
segments of each edge to be part of bundles, we present edge density results
and consider various recognition questions, not only for general graphs, but
also for the outer and 2-layer variants. We conclude with a series of
challenging questions.

 <dc:description>  Boolean matrix factorisation aims to decompose a binary data matrix into an
approximate Boolean product of two low rank, binary matrices: one containing
meaningful patterns, the other quantifying how the observations can be
expressed as a combination of these patterns. We introduce the OrMachine, a
probabilistic generative model for Boolean matrix factorisation and derive a
Metropolised Gibbs sampler that facilitates efficient parallel posterior
inference. On real world and simulated data, our method outperforms all
currently existing approaches for Boolean matrix factorisation and completion.
This is the first method to provide full posterior inference for Boolean Matrix
factorisation which is relevant in applications, e.g. for controlling false
positive rates in collaborative filtering and, crucially, improves the
interpretability of the inferred patterns. The proposed algorithm scales to
large datasets as we demonstrate by analysing single cell gene expression data
in 1.3 million mouse brain cells across 11 thousand genes on commodity
hardware.

 <dc:title>A Rollback in the History of Communication-Induced Checkpointing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The literature on communication-induced checkpointing presents a family of
protocols that use logical clocks to control whether forced checkpoints must be
taken. For many years, HMNR, also called Fully Informed (FI), was the most
complex and efficient protocol of this family. The Lazy-FI protocol applies a
lazy strategy that defers the increase of logical clocks, resulting in a
protocol with better perfomance for distributed systems where processes can
take basic checkpoints at different, asymmetric, rates. Recently, the Fully
Informed aNd Efficient (FINE) protocol was proposed using the same control
structures as FI, but with a stronger and, presumably better,
checkpoint-inducing condition. FINE and its lazy version, called Lazy-FINE,
would now be the most efficient checkpointing protocols based on logical
clocks. This paper reviews this family of protocols, proves a theorem on a
condition that must be enforced by all stronger versions of FI, and proves that
both FINE and Lazy-FINE do not guarantee the absence of useless checkpoints. As
a consequence, FI and Lazy-FI can be rolled back to the position of most
efficient protocols of this family of index-based checkpointing protocols.

 <dc:title>Structured signal recovery from quadratic measurements: Breaking sample

 <dc:description>  This paper concerns the problem of recovering an unknown but structured
signal $x \in R^n$ from $m$ quadratic measurements of the form
$y_r=|&lt;a_r,x&gt;|^2$ for $r=1,2,...,m$. We focus on the under-determined setting
where the number of measurements is significantly smaller than the dimension of
the signal ($m&lt;&lt;n$). We formulate the recovery problem as a nonconvex
optimization problem where prior structural information about the signal is
enforced through constrains on the optimization variables. We prove that
projected gradient descent, when initialized in a neighborhood of the desired
signal, converges to the unknown signal at a linear rate. These results hold
for any constraint set (convex or nonconvex) providing convergence guarantees
to the global optimum even when the objective function and constraint set is
nonconvex. Furthermore, these results hold with a number of measurements that
is only a constant factor away from the minimal number of measurements required
to uniquely identify the unknown signal. Our results provide the first provably
tractable algorithm for this data-poor regime, breaking local sample complexity
barriers that have emerged in recent literature. In a companion paper we
demonstrate favorable properties for the optimization problem that may enable
similar results to continue to hold more globally (over the entire ambient
space). Collectively these two papers utilize and develop powerful tools for
uniform convergence of empirical processes that may have broader implications
for rigorous understanding of constrained nonconvex optimization heuristics.
The mathematical results in this paper also pave the way for a new generation
of data-driven phase-less imaging systems that can utilize prior information to
significantly reduce acquisition time and enhance image reconstruction,
enabling nano-scale imaging at unprecedented speeds and resolutions.

 <dc:description>  Hypothesis generation is becoming a crucial time-saving technique which
allows biomedical researchers to quickly discover implicit connections between
important concepts. Typically, these systems operate on domain-specific
fractions of public medical data. MOLIERE, in contrast, utilizes information
from over 24.5 million documents. At the heart of our approach lies a
multi-modal and multi-relational network of biomedical objects extracted from
several heterogeneous datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI). These objects include but are not limited to scientific
papers, keywords, genes, proteins, diseases, and diagnoses. We model hypotheses
using Latent Dirichlet Allocation applied on abstracts found near shortest
paths discovered within this network, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
MOLIERE by performing hypothesis generation on historical data. Our network,
implementation, and resulting data are all publicly available for the broad
scientific community.

 <dc:description>  We focus on energy harvesting (EH) two-hop communications since they are the
essential building blocks of more complicated multi-hop networks. The scenario
consists of three nodes, where an EH transmitter wants to send data to a
receiver through an EH relay. The harvested energy is used exclusively for data
transmission and we address the problem of how to efficiently use it. As in
practical scenarios, we assume only causal knowledge at the EH nodes, i.e., in
each time interval, the transmitter and the relay know their own current and
past amounts of incoming energy, battery levels, data buffer levels and channel
coefficients for their own transmit channels. Our goal is to find transmission
policies which aim at maximizing the throughput considering that the EH nodes
fully cooperate with each other to exchange their causal knowledge during a
signaling phase. We model the problem as a Markov game and propose a
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to find the transmission policies.
Furthermore, we show the trade-off between the achievable throughput and the
signaling required, and provide convergence guarantees for the proposed
algorithm. Results show that even when the signaling overhead is taken into
account, the proposed algorithm outperforms other approaches that do not
consider cooperation among the nodes.

 <dc:description>  Reason and inference require process as well as memory skills by humans.
Neural networks are able to process tasks like image recognition (better than
humans) but in memory aspects are still limited (by attention mechanism, size).
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it's modified version LSTM are able to solve
small memory contexts, but as context becomes larger than a threshold, it is
difficult to use them. The Solution is to use large external memory. Still, it
poses many challenges like, how to train neural networks for discrete memory
representation, how to describe long term dependencies in sequential data etc.
Most prominent neural architectures for such tasks are Memory networks:
inference components combined with long term memory and Neural Turing Machines:
neural networks using external memory resources. Also, additional techniques
like attention mechanism, end to end gradient descent on discrete memory
representation are needed to support these solutions. Preliminary results of
above neural architectures on simple algorithms (sorting, copying) and Question
Answering (based on story, dialogs) application are comparable with the state
of the art. In this paper, I explain these architectures (in general), the
additional techniques used and the results of their application.

 <dc:description>  Airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) point clouds over large forested areas can be
processed to segment individual trees and subsequently extract tree-level
information. Existing segmentation procedures typically detect more than 90% of
overstory trees, yet they barely detect 60% of understory trees because of the
occlusion effect of higher canopy layers. Although understory trees provide
limited financial value, they are an essential component of ecosystem
functioning by offering habitat for numerous wildlife species and influencing
stand development. Here we model the occlusion effect in terms of point
density. We estimate the fractions of points representing different canopy
layers (one overstory and multiple understory) and also pinpoint the required
density for reasonable tree segmentation (where accuracy plateaus). We show
that at a density of ~170 pt/m-sqr understory trees can likely be segmented as
accurately as overstory trees. Given the advancements of LiDAR sensor
technology, point clouds will affordably reach this required density. Using
modern computational approaches for big data, the denser point clouds can
efficiently be processed to ultimately allow accurate remote quantification of
forest resources. The methodology can also be adopted for other similar remote
sensing or advanced imaging applications such as geological subsurface
modelling or biomedical tissue analysis.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we study the social learning problem, in which agents of a
networked system collaborate to detect the state of the nature based on their
private signals. A novel distributed graphical evolutionary game theoretic
learning method is proposed. In the proposed game-theoretic method, agents only
need to communicate their binary decisions rather than the real-valued beliefs
with their neighbors, which endows the method with low communication
complexity. Under mean field approximations, we theoretically analyze the
steady state equilibria of the game and show that the evolutionarily stable
states (ESSs) coincide with the decisions of the benchmark centralized
detector. Numerical experiments are implemented to confirm the effectiveness of
the proposed game-theoretic learning method.

 <dc:title>The Dialog State Tracking Challenge with Bayesian Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nguyen, Quan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Generative model has been one of the most common approaches for solving the
Dialog State Tracking Problem with the capabilities to model the dialog
hypotheses in an explicit manner. The most important task in such Bayesian
networks models is constructing the most reliable user models by learning and
reflecting the training data into the probability distribution of user actions
conditional on networks states. This paper provides an overall picture of the
learning process in a Bayesian framework with an emphasize on the
state-of-the-art theoretical analyses of the Expectation Maximization learning
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Recognizing human activities in a sequence is a challenging area of research
in ubiquitous computing. Most approaches use a fixed size sliding window over
consecutive samples to extract features---either handcrafted or learned
features---and predict a single label for all samples in the window. Two key
problems emanate from this approach: i) the samples in one window may not
always share the same label. Consequently, using one label for all samples
within a window inevitably lead to loss of information; ii) the testing phase
is constrained by the window size selected during training while the best
window size is difficult to tune in practice. We propose an efficient algorithm
that can predict the label of each sample, which we call dense labeling, in a
sequence of human activities of arbitrary length using a fully convolutional
network. In particular, our approach overcomes the problems posed by the
sliding window step. Additionally, our algorithm learns both the features and
classifier automatically. We release a new daily activity dataset based on a
wearable sensor with hospitalized patients. We conduct extensive experiments
and demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to outperform the
state-of-the-arts in terms of classification and label misalignment measures on
three challenging datasets: Opportunity, Hand Gesture, and our new dataset.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the problem of implementing a previously proposed
distributed direct coupling quantum observer for a closed linear quantum
system. By modifying the form of the previously proposed observer, the paper
proposes a possible experimental implementation of the observer plant system
using a non-degenerate parametric amplifier and a chain of optical cavities
which are coupled together via optical interconnections. It is shown that the
distributed observer converges to a consensus in a time averaged sense in which
an output of each element of the observer estimates the specified output of the
quantum plant.

 <dc:description>  Since the events of the Arab Spring, there has been increased interest in
using social media to anticipate social unrest. While efforts have been made
toward automated unrest prediction, we focus on filtering the vast volume of
tweets to identify tweets relevant to unrest, which can be provided to
downstream users for further analysis. We train a supervised classifier that is
able to label Arabic language tweets as relevant to unrest with high
reliability. We examine the relationship between training data size and
performance and investigate ways to optimize the model building process while
minimizing cost. We also explore how confidence thresholds can be set to
achieve desired levels of performance.

 <dc:title>An Online Optimization Approach for Multi-Agent Tracking of Dynamic
  Parameters in the Presence of Adversarial Noise</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses tracking of a moving target in a multi-agent network.
The target follows a linear dynamics corrupted by an adversarial noise, i.e.,
the noise is not generated from a statistical distribution. The location of the
target at each time induces a global time-varying loss function, and the global
loss is a sum of local losses, each of which is associated to one agent. Agents
noisy observations could be nonlinear. We formulate this problem as a
distributed online optimization where agents communicate with each other to
track the minimizer of the global loss. We then propose a decentralized version
of the Mirror Descent algorithm and provide the non-asymptotic analysis of the
problem. Using the notion of dynamic regret, we measure the performance of our
algorithm versus its offline counterpart in the centralized setting. We prove
that the bound on dynamic regret scales inversely in the network spectral gap,
and it represents the adversarial noise causing deviation with respect to the
linear dynamics. Our result subsumes a number of results in the distributed
optimization literature. Finally, in a numerical experiment, we verify that our
algorithm can be simply implemented for multi-agent tracking with nonlinear
observations.

 <dc:title>Determination of hysteresis in finite-state random walks using Bayesian

 <dc:description>  Consider the problem of modeling hysteresis for finite-state random walks
using higher-order Markov chains. This Letter introduces a Bayesian framework
to determine, from data, the number of prior states of recent history upon
which a trajectory is statistically dependent. The general recommendation is to
use leave-one-out cross validation, using an easily-computable formula that is
provided in closed form. Importantly, Bayes factors using flat model priors are
biased in favor of too-complex a model (more hysteresis) when a large amount of
data is present and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is biased in favor
of too-sparse a model (less hysteresis) when few data are present.

 <dc:description>  Existing works on building a soliton transmission system only encode
information using the imaginary part of the eigenvalue, which fails to make
full use of the signal degree-of-freedoms. Motivated by this observation, we
make the first step of encoding information using (discrete) spectral
amplitudes by proposing analytical noise models for the spectral amplitudes of
$N$-solitons ($N\geq 1$). To our best knowledge, this is the first work in
building an analytical noise model for spectral amplitudes, which leads to many
interesting information theoretic questions, such as channel capacity analysis,
and has a potential of increasing the transmission rate. The noise statistics
of the spectral amplitude of a soliton are also obtained without the Gaussian
approximation.

 <dc:description>  Researchers often summarize their work in the form of scientific posters.
Posters provide a coherent and efficient way to convey core ideas expressed in
scientific papers. Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex
and time consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable,
informative, and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we
study the challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific
papers. To this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models,
is proposed. Specifically, given content to display, the key elements of a good
poster, including attributes of each panel and arrangements of graphical
elements are learned and inferred from data. During the inference stage, an MAP
inference framework is employed to incorporate some design principles. In order
to bridge the gap between panel attributes and the composition within each
panel, we also propose a recursive page splitting algorithm to generate the
panel layout for a poster. To learn and validate our model, we collect and
release a new benchmark dataset, called NJU-Fudan Paper-Poster dataset, which
consists of scientific papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively
labelled panels and attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate
the effectiveness of our approach.

 <dc:description>  There has been a recent explosion in the capabilities of game-playing
artificial intelligence. Many classes of RL tasks, from Atari games to motor
control to board games, are now solvable by fairly generic algorithms, based on
deep learning, that learn to play from experience with minimal knowledge of the
specific domain of interest. In this work, we will investigate the performance
of these methods on Super Smash Bros. Melee (SSBM), a popular console fighting
game. The SSBM environment has complex dynamics and partial observability,
making it challenging for human and machine alike. The multi-player aspect
poses an additional challenge, as the vast majority of recent advances in RL
have focused on single-agent environments. Nonetheless, we will show that it is
possible to train agents that are competitive against and even surpass human
professionals, a new result for the multi-player video game setting.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the generation of one-sentence Wikipedia biographies from
facts derived from Wikidata slot-value pairs. We train a recurrent neural
network sequence-to-sequence model with attention to select facts and generate
textual summaries. Our model incorporates a novel secondary objective that
helps ensure it generates sentences that contain the input facts. The model
achieves a BLEU score of 41, improving significantly upon the vanilla
sequence-to-sequence model and scoring roughly twice that of a simple template
baseline. Human preference evaluation suggests the model is nearly as good as
the Wikipedia reference. Manual analysis explores content selection, suggesting
the model can trade the ability to infer knowledge against the risk of
hallucinating incorrect information.

 <dc:description>  We obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm for exact tensor completion
that improves over the bound implied by reduction to matrix completion. The
algorithm recovers an unknown 3-tensor with $r$ incoherent, orthogonal
components in $\mathbb R^n$ from $r\cdot \tilde O(n^{1.5})$ randomly observed
entries of the tensor. This bound improves over the previous best one of
$r\cdot \tilde O(n^{2})$ by reduction to exact matrix completion. Our bound
also matches the best known results for the easier problem of approximate
tensor completion (Barak &amp; Moitra, 2015).
  Our algorithm and analysis extends seminal results for exact matrix
completion (Candes &amp; Recht, 2009) to the tensor setting via the sum-of-squares
method. The main technical challenge is to show that a small number of randomly
chosen monomials are enough to construct a degree-3 polynomial with precisely
planted orthogonal global optima over the sphere and that this fact can be
certified within the sum-of-squares proof system.

 <dc:description>  Optimal stopping problems consider the question of deciding when to stop an
observation-generating process in order to maximize a return. We examine the
problem of simultaneously learning and planning in such domains, when data is
collected directly from the environment. We propose GFSE, a simple and flexible
model-free policy search method that reuses data for sample efficiency by
leveraging problem structure. We bound the sample complexity of our approach to
guarantee uniform convergence of policy value estimates, tightening existing
PAC bounds to achieve logarithmic dependence on horizon length for our setting.
We also examine the benefit of our method against prevalent model-based and
model-free approaches on 3 domains taken from diverse fields.

 <dc:description>  Argument component detection (ACD) is an important sub-task in argumentation
mining. ACD aims at detecting and classifying different argument components in
natural language texts. Historical annotations (HAs) are important features the
human annotators consider when they manually perform the ACD task. However, HAs
are largely ignored by existing automatic ACD techniques. Reinforcement
learning (RL) has proven to be an effective method for using HAs in some
natural language processing tasks. In this work, we propose a RL-based ACD
technique, and evaluate its performance on two well-annotated corpora. Results
suggest that, in terms of classification accuracy, HAs-augmented RL outperforms
plain RL by at most 17.85%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised
learning algorithm by at most 11.94%.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation system is a common demand in daily life and matrix completion
is a widely adopted technique for this task. However, most matrix completion
methods lack semantic interpretation and usually result in weak-semantic
recommendations. To this end, this paper proposes a $S$emantic $A$nalysis
approach for $R$ecommendation systems $(SAR)$, which applies a two-level
hierarchical generative process that assigns semantic properties and categories
for user and item. $SAR$ learns semantic representations of users/items merely
from user ratings on items, which offers a new path to recommendation by
semantic matching with the learned representations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate $SAR$ outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.

 <dc:title>Deterministic Perturbations For Simultaneous Perturbation Methods Using

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of finding optimal parameters under simulation
optimization setup. For a $p$-dimensional parameter optimization, the classical
Kiefer-Wolfowitz Finite Difference Stochastic Approximation (FDSA) scheme uses
$p+1$ or $2p$ simulations of the system feedback for one-sided and two-sided
gradient estimates respectively. The dependence on the dimension $p$ makes FDSA
impractical for high dimensional problems. An alternative approach for gradient
estimation in high dimensional problems is the simultaneous perturbation
technique that appears in [1],[2]. The main idea in this approach is to
estimate the gradient by using only two settings of the $p$-dimensional
parameter being optimized. The two settings of the parameter are obtained by
simultaneously perturbing all the components of the parameter by adding a
random direction. A drawback of using random directions for the gradient
estimate is the very large or possibly infinite range of these random
directions (for e.g. $\pm 1$ symmetric Bernoulli perturbations typically used
in 1SPSA algorithm has a range of cardinality $2^p$ ). In this article we
consider deterministic perturbations with a range of cardinality $p+1$ to
improve the convergence of these algorithms. A novel construction of
deterministic perturbations based on specially chosen circulant matrix is
proposed. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is presented along
with numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  Identification of intended movement type and movement phase of hand grasp
shaping are critical features for the control of volitional neuroprosthetics.
We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp
shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO
regression to achieve 72% accuracy (chance = 25%) in distinguishing between
visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage
of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R2=0.4). Our
approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level
movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained
with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying
trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within
individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to
the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to
the further understanding of the cortical dynamics of human motor imagery.

 <dc:description>  Successful analysis of player skills in video games has important impacts on
the process of enhancing player experience without undermining their continuous
skill development. Moreover, player skill analysis becomes more intriguing in
team-based video games because such form of study can help discover useful
factors in effective team formation. In this paper, we consider the problem of
skill decomposition in MOBA (MultiPlayer Online Battle Arena) games, with the
goal to understand what player skill factors are essential for the outcome of a
game match. To understand the construct of MOBA player skills, we utilize
various skill-based predictive models to decompose player skills into
interpretative parts, the impact of which are assessed in statistical terms. We
apply this analysis approach on two widely known MOBAs, namely League of
Legends (LoL) and Defense of the Ancients 2 (DOTA2). The finding is that base
skills of in-game avatars, base skills of players, and players'
champion-specific skills are three prominent skill components influencing LoL's
match outcomes, while those of DOTA2 are mainly impacted by in-game avatars'
base skills but not much by the other two.

 <dc:description>  The maximum duo-preservation string mapping (Max-Duo) problem is the
complement of the well studied minimum common string partition (MCSP) problem,
both of which have applications in many fields including text compression and
bioinformatics. $k$-Max-Duo is the restricted version of Max-Duo, where every
letter of the alphabet occurs at most $k$ times in each of the strings, which
is readily reduced into the well known maximum independent set (MIS) problem on
a graph of maximum degree $\Delta \le 6(k-1)$. In particular, $2$-Max-Duo can
then be approximated arbitrarily close to $1.8$ using the state-of-the-art
approximation algorithm for the MIS problem. $2$-Max-Duo was proved APX-hard
and very recently a $(1.6 + \epsilon)$-approximation was claimed, for any
$\epsilon &gt; 0$. In this paper, we present a vertex-degree reduction technique,
based on which, we show that $2$-Max-Duo can be approximated arbitrarily close
to $1.4$.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional networks are well-known for their high computational and
memory demands. Given limited resources, how does one design a network that
balances its size, training time, and prediction accuracy? A surprisingly
effective approach to trade accuracy for size and speed is to simply reduce the
number of channels in each convolutional layer by a fixed fraction and retrain
the network. In many cases this leads to significantly smaller networks with
only minimal changes to accuracy. In this paper, we take a step further by
empirically examining a strategy for deactivating connections between filters
in convolutional layers in a way that allows us to harvest savings both in
run-time and memory for many network architectures. More specifically, we
generalize 2D convolution to use a channel-wise sparse connection structure and
show that this leads to significantly better results than the baseline approach
for large networks including VGG and Inception V3.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of deciding the satisfiability of quantifier-free
formulas in the theory of finite sets with cardinality constraints. Sets are a
common high-level data structure used in programming; thus, such a theory is
useful for modeling program constructs directly. More importantly, sets are a
basic construct of mathematics and thus natural to use when formalizing the
properties of computational systems. We develop a calculus describing a modular
combination of a procedure for reasoning about membership constraints with a
procedure for reasoning about cardinality constraints. Cardinality reasoning
involves tracking how different sets overlap. For efficiency, we avoid
considering Venn regions directly, as done in previous work. Instead, we
develop a novel technique wherein potentially overlapping regions are
considered incrementally as needed. We use a graph to track the interaction
among the different regions. The calculus has been designed to facilitate its
implementation within SMT solvers based on the DPLL(T) architecture. Initial
experimental results demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with
previous techniques and scale much better on certain classes of problems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an inequality which may be viewed as a generalization of both
the Brascamp-Lieb inequality and its reverse (Barthe's inequality), and prove
its information-theoretic (i.e.\ entropic) formulation. This result leads to a
unified approach to functional inequalities such as the variational formula of
R\'enyi entropy, hypercontractivity and its reverse, strong data processing
inequalities, and transportation-cost inequalities, whose utility in the proofs
of various coding theorems has gained growing popularity recently. We show that
our information-theoretic setting is convenient for proving properties such as
data processing, tensorization, convexity (Riesz-Thorin interpolation) and
Gaussian optimality. In particular, we elaborate on a &quot;doubling trick&quot; used by
Lieb and Geng-Nair to prove several results on Gaussian optimality. Several
applications are discussed, including a generalization of the Brascamp-Lieb
inequality involving Gaussian random transformations, the determination of
Wyner's common information of vector Gaussian sources, and the achievable rate
region of certain key generation problems in the case of vector Gaussian
sources.

 <dc:description>  Multi-view registration is a fundamental but challenging problem in 3D
reconstruction and robot vision. Although the original motion averaging
algorithm has been introduced as an effective means to solve the multi-view
registration problem, it does not consider the reliability and accuracy of each
relative motion. Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel motion averaging
algorithm for multi-view registration. Firstly, it utilizes the pair-wise
registration algorithm to estimate the relative motion and overlapping
percentage of each scan pair with a certain degree of overlap. With the
overlapping percentage available, it views the overlapping percentage as the
corresponding weight of each scan pair and proposes the weight motion averaging
algorithm, which can pay more attention to reliable and accurate relative
motions. By treating each relative motion distinctively, more accurate
registration can be achieved by applying the weighted motion averaging to
multi-view range scans. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed approach compared with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
accuracy, robustness and efficiency.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the task-space consensus problem for multiple
robotic systems with both the uncertain kinematics and dynamics and address two
main issues, i.e., the separation of the kinematic and dynamic loops in the
case of no task-space velocity measurement and the quantification of the
manipulability of the system. We propose an observer-based adaptive controller
to achieve the manipulable consensus without relying on the measurement of
task-space velocities, and also formalize the concept of manipulability to
quantify the degree of adjustability of the consensus value. The proposed
adaptive controller employs a new distributed observer that does not rely on
the joint velocity and a new kinematic parameter adaptation law with a
distributed adaptive kinematic regressor matrix that is driven by both the
observation and consensus errors. In addition, it is shown that the proposed
controller has the separation property, which yields an adaptive kinematic
controller that is applicable to most industrial/commercial robots. The
performance of the proposed observer-based adaptive schemes is shown by
numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  We present and analyze an approach for distributed stochastic optimization
which is statistically optimal and achieves near-linear speedups (up to
logarithmic factors). Our approach allows a communication-memory tradeoff, with
either logarithmic communication but linear memory, or polynomial communication
and a corresponding polynomial reduction in required memory. This
communication-memory tradeoff is achieved through minibatch-prox iterations
(minibatch passive-aggressive updates), where a subproblem on a minibatch is
solved at each iteration. We provide a novel analysis for such a minibatch-prox
procedure which achieves the statistical optimal rate regardless of minibatch
size and smoothness, thus significantly improving on prior work.

 <dc:description>  Human mobility data has been ubiquitously collected through cellular networks
and mobile applications, and publicly released for academic research and
commercial purposes for the last decade. Since releasing individual's mobility
records usually gives rise to privacy issues, datasets owners tend to only
publish aggregated mobility data, such as the number of users covered by a
cellular tower at a specific timestamp, which is believed to be sufficient for
preserving users' privacy. However, in this paper, we argue and prove that even
publishing aggregated mobility data could lead to privacy breach in
individuals' trajectories. We develop an attack system that is able to exploit
the uniqueness and regularity of human mobility to recover individual's
trajectories from the aggregated mobility data without any prior knowledge. By
conducting experiments on two real-world datasets collected from both mobile
application and cellular network, we reveal that the attack system is able to
recover users' trajectories with accuracy about 73%~91% at the scale of tens of
thousands to hundreds of thousands users, which indicates severe privacy
leakage in such datasets. Through the investigation on aggregated mobility
data, our work recognizes a novel privacy problem in publishing statistic data,
which appeals for immediate attentions from both academy and industry.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel advanced motion model to handle the irregular
motion for the cubic map projection of 360-degree video. Since the irregular
motion is mainly caused by the projection from the sphere to the cube map, we
first try to project the pixels in both the current picture and reference
picture from unfolding cube back to the sphere. Then through utilizing the
characteristic that most of the motions in the sphere are uniform, we can
derive the relationship between the motion vectors of various pixels in the
unfold cube. The proposed advanced motion model is implemented in the High
Efficiency Video Coding reference software. Experimental results demonstrate
that quite obvious performance improvement can be achieved for the sequences
with obvious motions.

 <dc:description>  Machine Learning (ML) models are applied in a variety of tasks such as
network intrusion detection or Malware classification. Yet, these models are
vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These
are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model.
The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step
towards understanding adversarial examples, we show that they are not drawn
from the same distribution than the original data, and can thus be detected
using statistical tests. Using thus knowledge, we introduce a complimentary
approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically, we
augment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained
to classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple
adversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and
saliency map methods) with several datasets. The statistical test flags sample
sets containing adversarial inputs confidently at sample sizes between 10 and
100 data points. Furthermore, our augmented model either detects adversarial
examples as outliers with high accuracy (&gt; 80%) or increases the adversary's
cost - the perturbation added - by more than 150%. In this way, we show that
statistical properties of adversarial examples are essential to their
detection.

 <dc:description>  The Apriori algorithm that mines frequent itemsets is one of the most popular
and widely used data mining algorithms. Now days many algorithms have been
proposed on parallel and distributed platforms to enhance the performance of
Apriori algorithm. They differ from each other on the basis of load balancing
technique, memory system, data decomposition technique and data layout used to
implement them. The problems with most of the distributed framework are
overheads of managing distributed system and lack of high level parallel
programming language. Also with grid computing there is always potential
chances of node failures which cause multiple re-executions of tasks. These
problems can be overcome by the MapReduce framework introduced by Google.
MapReduce is an efficient, scalable and simplified programming model for large
scale distributed data processing on a large cluster of commodity computers and
also used in cloud computing. In this paper, we present the overview of
parallel Apriori algorithm implemented on MapReduce framework. They are
categorized on the basis of Map and Reduce functions used to implement them
e.g. 1-phase vs. k-phase, I/O of Mapper, Combiner and Reducer, using
functionality of Combiner inside Mapper etc. This survey discusses and analyzes
the various implementations of Apriori on MapReduce framework on the basis of
their distinguishing characteristics. Moreover, it also includes the advantages
and limitations of MapReduce framework.

 <dc:title>Multi-Objective Event-triggered Consensus of Linear Multi-agent Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a distributed consensus algorithm for linear event-based
heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed scheme is event-triggered
in the sense that an agent selectively transmits its information within its
local neighbourhood based on a directed network topology under the fulfillment
of certain conditions. Using the Lyapunov stability theorem, the system
constraints and event-triggering condition are expressed in terms of several
linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to derive the consensus parameters. The
objective is to design the transmission threshold and minimum-norm
heterogeneous control gains which collectively ensure an exponential consensus
convergence rate for the closed-loop systems. The LMI computed control gains
are robust to uncertainty with some deviation from their nominal values
allowed. The practicability of the proposed event-based framework is further
studied by proving the Zeno behaviour exclusion. Numerical simulations quantify
the advantages of our event-triggered consensus approach in second-order,
linear and heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

 <dc:description>  Sound events often occur in unstructured environments where they exhibit wide
variations in their frequency content and temporal structure. Convolutional
neural networks (CNN) are able to extract higher level features that are
invariant to local spectral and temporal variations. Recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) are powerful in learning the longer term temporal context in the audio
signals. CNNs and RNNs as classifiers have recently shown improved performances
over established methods in various sound recognition tasks. We combine these
two approaches in a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) and apply it
on a polyphonic sound event detection task. We compare the performance of the
proposed CRNN method with CNN, RNN, and other established methods, and observe
a considerable improvement for four different datasets consisting of everyday
sound events.

 <dc:description>  One of the major challenges of model-free visual tracking problem has been
the difficulty originating from the unpredictable and drastic changes in the
appearance of objects we target to track. Existing methods tackle this problem
by updating the appearance model on-line in order to adapt to the changes in
the appearance. Despite the success of these methods however, inaccurate and
erroneous updates of the appearance model result in a tracker drift. In this
paper, we introduce a novel visual tracking algorithm based on a template
selection strategy constructed by deep reinforcement learning methods. The
tracking algorithm utilizes this strategy to choose the best template for
tracking a given frame. The template selection strategy is self-learned by
utilizing a simple policy gradient method on numerous training episodes
randomly generated from a tracking benchmark dataset. Our proposed
reinforcement learning framework is generally applicable to other confidence
map based tracking algorithms. The experiment shows that our tracking algorithm
effectively decides the best template for visual tracking.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for video-based person re-identification
using multiple Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Unlike previous work, we
intend to extract a compact yet discriminative appearance representation from
several frames rather than the whole sequence. Specifically, given a video, the
representative frames are selected based on the walking profile of consecutive
frames. A multiple CNN architecture incorporated with feature pooling is
proposed to learn and compile the features of the selected representative
frames into a compact description about the pedestrian for identification.
Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed method over existing person re-identification approaches.

 <dc:description>  Initialization of parameters in deep neural networks has been shown to have a
big impact on the performance of the networks (Mishkin &amp; Matas, 2015). The
initialization scheme devised by He et al, allowed convolution activations to
carry a constrained mean which allowed deep networks to be trained effectively
(He et al., 2015a). Orthogonal initializations and more generally orthogonal
matrices in standard recurrent networks have been proved to eradicate the
vanishing and exploding gradient problem (Pascanu et al., 2012). Majority of
current initialization schemes do not take fully into account the intrinsic
structure of the convolution operator. Using the duality of the Fourier
transform and the convolution operator, Convolution Aware Initialization builds
orthogonal filters in the Fourier space, and using the inverse Fourier
transform represents them in the standard space. With Convolution Aware
Initialization we noticed not only higher accuracy and lower loss, but faster
convergence. We achieve new state of the art on the CIFAR10 dataset, and
achieve close to state of the art on various other tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a simplified affine motion model based coding
framework to overcome the limitation of translational motion model and maintain
low computational complexity. The proposed framework mainly has three key
contributions. First, we propose to reduce the number of affine motion
parameters from 6 to 4. The proposed four-parameter affine motion model can not
only handle most of the complex motions in natural videos but also save the
bits for two parameters. Second, to efficiently encode the affine motion
parameters, we propose two motion prediction modes, i.e., advanced affine
motion vector prediction combined with a gradient-based fast affine motion
estimation algorithm and affine model merge, where the latter attempts to reuse
the affine motion parameters (instead of the motion vectors) of neighboring
blocks. Third, we propose two fast affine motion compensation algorithms. One
is the one-step sub-pixel interpolation, which reduces the computations of each
interpolation. The other is the interpolation-precision-based adaptive block
size motion compensation, which performs motion compensation at the block level
rather than the pixel level to reduce the interpolation times. Our proposed
techniques have been implemented based on the state-of-the-art high efficiency
video coding standard, and the experimental results show that the proposed
techniques altogether achieve on average 11.1% and 19.3% bits saving for random
access and low delay configurations, respectively, on typical video sequences
that have rich rotation or zooming motions. Meanwhile, the computational
complexity increases of both encoder and decoder are within an acceptable
range.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the influence of a product is crucially important for making
informed business decisions. This paper introduces a new type of skyline
queries, called uncertain reverse skyline, for measuring the influence of a
probabilistic product in uncertain data settings. More specifically, given a
dataset of probabilistic products P and a set of customers C, an uncertain
reverse skyline of a probabilistic product q retrieves all customers c in C
which include q as one of their preferred products. We present efficient
pruning ideas and techniques for processing the uncertain reverse skyline query
of a probabilistic product using R-Tree data index. We also present an
efficient parallel approach to compute the uncertain reverse skyline and
influence score of a probabilistic product. Our approach significantly
outperforms the baseline approach derived from the existing literature. The
efficiency of our approach is demonstrated by conducting extensive experiments
with both real and synthetic datasets.

 <dc:description>  Food is an integral part of our life and what and how much we eat crucially
affects our health. Our food choices largely depend on how we perceive certain
characteristics of food, such as whether it is healthy, delicious or if it
qualifies as a salad. But these perceptions differ from person to person and
one person's &quot;single lettuce leaf&quot; might be another person's &quot;side salad&quot;.
Studying how food is perceived in relation to what it actually is typically
involves a laboratory setup. Here we propose to use recent advances in image
recognition to tackle this problem. Concretely, we use data for 1.9 million
images from Instagram from the US to look at systematic differences in how a
machine would objectively label an image compared to how a human subjectively
does. We show that this difference, which we call the &quot;perception gap&quot;, relates
to a number of health outcomes observed at the county level. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that image recognition is being used to study
the &quot;misalignment&quot; of how people describe food images vs. what they actually
depict.

 <dc:title>Eigenvalues of weakly balanced signed graphs and graphs with negative

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a signed graph $G$, an induced subgraph is called a negative clique if it
is a complete graph and all of its edges are negative. In this paper, we give
the characteristic polynomials and the eigenvalues of some signed graphs having
negative cliques. This include signed cycle graphs, signed path graphs,
complete graphs with vertex-disjoint negative cliques of different orders, and
star block graphs with negative cliques. Interestingly, if we reverse the signs
of the edges of these graphs, we get the families of weakly balanced signed
graphs, thus the eigenvalues of wide classes of weakly balanced signed graphs
are also calculated. In social network theory, the eigenvalues of the signed
graphs play an important role in determining their stability and developing the
measures for the degree of balancedness.

 <dc:description>  Mobile robots are increasingly being employed for performing complex tasks in
dynamic environments. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are recognized to be
promising for specifying such tasks in a relatively simple manner. However, the
strong dependency between the learning method and the task to learn is a
well-known problem that restricts practical implementations of RL in robotics,
often requiring major modifications of parameters and adding other techniques
for each particular task. In this paper we present a practical core
implementation of RL which enables the learning process for multiple robotic
tasks with minimal per-task tuning or none. Based on value iteration methods,
this implementation includes a novel approach for action selection, called
Q-biased softmax regression (QBIASSR), which avoids poor performance of the
learning process when the robot reaches new unexplored states. Our approach
takes advantage of the structure of the state space by attending the physical
variables involved (e.g., distances to obstacles, X,Y,{\theta} pose, etc.),
thus experienced sets of states may favor the decision-making process of
unexplored or rarely-explored states. This improvement has a relevant role in
reducing the tuning of the algorithm for particular tasks. Experiments with
real and simulated robots, performed with the software framework also
introduced here, show that our implementation is effectively able to learn
different robotic tasks without tuning the learning method. Results also
suggest that the combination of true online SARSA({\lambda}) with QBIASSR can
outperform the existing RL core algorithms in low-dimensional robotic tasks.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated the deployment of millions of
sensors at the edge of the network, through Smart City infrastructure and
lifestyle devices. Cloud computing platforms are often tasked with handling
these large volumes and fast streams of data from the edge. Recently, Fog
computing has emerged as a concept for low-latency and resource-rich processing
of these observation streams, to complement Edge and Cloud computing. In this
paper, we review various dimensions of system architecture, application
characteristics and platform abstractions that are manifest in this Edge, Fog
and Cloud eco-system. We highlight novel capabilities of the Edge and Fog
layers, such as physical and application mobility, privacy sensitivity, and a
nascent runtime environment. IoT application case studies based on first-hand
experiences across diverse domains drive this categorization. We also highlight
the gap between the potential and the reality of Fog computing, and identify
challenges that need to be overcome for the solution to be sustainable.
Together, our article can help platform and application developers bridge the
gap that remains in making Fog computing viable.

 <dc:description>  The empirical fact that classifiers, trained on given data collections,
perform poorly when tested on data acquired in different settings is
theoretically explained in domain adaptation through a shift among
distributions of the source and target domains. Alleviating the domain shift
problem, especially in the challenging setting where no labeled data are
available for the target domain, is paramount for having visual recognition
systems working in the wild. As the problem stems from a shift among
distributions, intuitively one should try to align them. In the literature,
this has resulted in a stream of works attempting to align the feature
representations learned from the source and target domains. Here we take a
different route. Rather than introducing regularization terms aiming to promote
the alignment of the two representations, we act at the distribution level
through the introduction of \emph{DomaIn Alignment Layers} (\DIAL), able to
match the observed source and target data distributions to a reference one.
Thorough experiments on three different public benchmarks we confirm the power
of our approach.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel algorithm that synthesizes imperative programs for
introductory programming courses. Given a set of input-output examples and a
partial program, our algorithm generates a complete program that is consistent
with every example. Our key idea is to combine enumerative program synthesis
and static analysis, which aggressively prunes out a large search space while
guaranteeing to find, if any, a correct solution. We have implemented our
algorithm in a tool, called SIMPL, and evaluated it on 30 problems used in
introductory programming courses. The results show that SIMPL is able to solve
the benchmark problems in 6.6 seconds on average.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things typically involves a significant number of smart sensors
sensing information from the environment and sharing it to a cloud service for
processing. Various architectural abstractions, such as Fog and Edge computing,
have been proposed to localize some of the processing near the sensors and away
from the central cloud servers. In this paper, we propose Edge-Fog Cloud which
distributes task processing on the participating cloud resources in the
network. We develop the Least Processing Cost First (LPCF) method for assigning
the processing tasks to nodes which provide the optimal processing time and
near optimal networking costs. We evaluate LPCF in a variety of scenarios and
demonstrate its effectiveness in finding the processing task assignments.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a hybrid dialog state tracker enhanced by trainable
Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) for slot-filling dialog systems. Our
architecture is inspired by previously proposed neural-network-based
belief-tracking systems. In addition, we extended some parts of our modular
architecture with differentiable rules to allow end-to-end training. We
hypothesize that these rules allow our tracker to generalize better than pure
machine-learning based systems. For evaluation, we used the Dialog State
Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset - a popular belief tracking testbed with
dialogs from restaurant information system. To our knowledge, our hybrid
tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result in three out of four categories
within the DSTC2.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of online learning in a class of Markov decision
processes known as linearly solvable MDPs. In the stationary version of this
problem, a learner interacts with its environment by directly controlling the
state transitions, attempting to balance a fixed state-dependent cost and a
certain smooth cost penalizing extreme control inputs. In the current paper, we
consider an online setting where the state costs may change arbitrarily between
consecutive rounds, and the learner only observes the costs at the end of each
respective round. We are interested in constructing algorithms for the learner
that guarantee small regret against the best stationary control policy chosen
in full knowledge of the cost sequence. Our main result is showing that the
smoothness of the control cost enables the simple algorithm of following the
leader to achieve a regret of order $\log^2 T$ after $T$ rounds, vastly
improving on the best known regret bound of order $T^{3/4}$ for this setting.

 <dc:description>  Network support is a key success factor for talented people. As an example,
the Hungarian Talent Support Network involves close to 1500 Talent Points and
more than 200,000 people. This network started the Hungarian Templeton Program
identifying and helping 315 exceptional cognitive talents. This network is a
part of the European Talent Support Network initiated by the European Council
for High Ability involving more than 300 organizations in over 30 countries in
Europe and extending in other continents. These networks are giving good
examples that talented people often occupy a central, but highly dynamic
position in social networks. The involvement of such 'creative nodes' in
network-related decision making processes is vital, especially in novel
environmental challenges. Such adaptive/learning responses characterize a large
variety of complex systems from proteins, through brains to society. It is
crucial for talent support programs to use these networking and learning
processes to increase their efficiency further.

 <dc:title>Scalar and Tensor Parameters for Importing Tensor Index Notation
  including Einstein Summation Notation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Egi, Satoshi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a method for importing tensor index notation,
including Einstein summation notation, into functional programming. This method
involves introducing two types of parameters, i.e, scalar and tensor
parameters, and simplified tensor index rules that do not handle expressions
that are valid only for the Cartesian coordinate system, in which the index can
move up and down freely. An example of such an expression is &quot;c = A_i B_i&quot;. As
an ordinary function, when a tensor parameter obtains a tensor as an argument,
the function treats the tensor argument as a whole. In contrast, when a scalar
parameter obtains a tensor as an argument, the function is applied to each
component of the tensor. In this paper, we show that introducing these two
types of parameters and our simplified index rules enables us to apply
arbitrary user-defined functions to tensor arguments using index notation
including Einstein summation notation without requiring an additional
description to enable each function to handle tensors.

numerical results demonstrate that there are optimum numbers of channels uses
for both energy and information transfer for a given message length.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation for e-commerce with a mix of durable and nondurable goods has
characteristics that distinguish it from the well-studied media recommendation
problem. The demand for items is a combined effect of form utility and time
utility, i.e., a product must both be intrinsically appealing to a consumer and
the time must be right for purchase. In particular for durable goods, time
utility is a function of inter-purchase duration within product category
because consumers are unlikely to purchase two items in the same category in
close temporal succession. Moreover, purchase data, in contrast to ratings
data, is implicit with non-purchases not necessarily indicating dislike.
Together, these issues give rise to the positive-unlabeled demand-aware
recommendation problem that we pose via joint low-rank tensor completion and
product category inter-purchase duration vector estimation. We further relax
this problem and propose a highly scalable alternating minimization approach
with which we can solve problems with millions of users and millions of items
in a single thread. We also show superior prediction accuracies on multiple
real-world data sets.

 <dc:title>Interpreting Outliers: Localized Logistic Regression for Density Ratio

 <dc:description>  We propose an inlier-based outlier detection method capable of both
identifying the outliers and explaining why they are outliers, by identifying
the outlier-specific features. Specifically, we employ an inlier-based outlier
detection criterion, which uses the ratio of inlier and test probability
densities as a measure of plausibility of being an outlier. For estimating the
density ratio function, we propose a localized logistic regression algorithm.
Thanks to the locality of the model, variable selection can be
outlier-specific, and will help interpret why points are outliers in a
high-dimensional space. Through synthetic experiments, we show that the
proposed algorithm can successfully detect the important features for outliers.
Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm tends to outperform existing
algorithms in benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Object detection in videos has drawn increasing attention recently with the
introduction of the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset. Different from object
detection in static images, temporal information in videos is vital for object
detection. To fully utilize temporal information, state-of-the-art methods are
based on spatiotemporal tubelets, which are essentially sequences of associated
bounding boxes across time. However, the existing methods have major
limitations in generating tubelets in terms of quality and efficiency.
Motion-based methods are able to obtain dense tubelets efficiently, but the
lengths are generally only several frames, which is not optimal for
incorporating long-term temporal information. Appearance-based methods, usually
involving generic object tracking, could generate long tubelets, but are
usually computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a framework for
object detection in videos, which consists of a novel tubelet proposal network
to efficiently generate spatiotemporal proposals, and a Long Short-term Memory
(LSTM) network that incorporates temporal information from tubelet proposals
for achieving high object detection accuracy in videos. Experiments on the
large-scale ImageNet VID dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework for object detection in videos.

 <dc:description>  Quantum discord refers to an important aspect of quantum correlations for
bipartite quantum systems. In our earlier works we have shown that
corresponding to every graph (combinatorial) there are quantum states whose
properties are reflected in the structure of the corresponding graph. Here, we
attempt to develop a graph theoretic study of quantum discord that corresponds
to a necessary and sufficient condition of zero quantum discord states which
says that the blocks of density matrix corresponding to a zero quantum discord
state are normal and commute with each other. These blocks have a one to one
correspondence with some specific subgraphs of the graph which represents the
quantum state. We obtain a number of graph theoretic properties representing
normality and commutativity of a set of matrices which are indeed arising from
the given graph. Utilizing these properties we define graph theoretic measures
for normality and commutativity that results a formulation of graph theoretic
quantum discord. We identify classes of quantum states with zero discord using
the said formulation.

 <dc:description>  Identifying significant location categories visited by mobile users is the
key to a variety of applications. This is an extremely challenging task due to
the possible deviation between the estimated location coordinate and the actual
location, which could be on the order of kilometers. To estimate the actual
location category more precisely, we propose a novel tensor factorization
framework, through several key observations including the intrinsic
correlations between users, to infer the most likely location categories within
the location uncertainty circle. In addition, the proposed algorithm can also
predict where users are even in the absence of location information. In order
to efficiently solve the proposed framework, we propose a parameter-free and
scalable optimization algorithm by effectively exploring the sparse and
low-rank structure of the tensor. Our empirical studies show that the proposed
algorithm is both efficient and effective: it can solve problems with millions
of users and billions of location updates, and also provides superior
prediction accuracies on real-world location updates and check-in data sets.

 <dc:description>  Given a network, the statistical ensemble of its graph-Voronoi diagrams with
randomly chosen cell centers exhibits properties convertible into information
on the network's large scale structures. We define a node-pair level measure
called {\it Voronoi cohesion} which describes the probability for sharing the
same Voronoi cell, when randomly choosing $g$ centers in the network. This
measure provides information based on the global context (the network in its
entirety) a type of information that is not carried by other similarity
measures. We explore the mathematical background of this phenomenon and several
of its potential applications. A special focus is laid on the possibilities and
limitations pertaining to the exploitation of the phenomenon for community
detection purposes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the NP-hard Tree Containment problem that has important
applications in phylogenetics. The problem asks if a given leaf-labeled network
contains a subdivision of a given leaf-labeled tree. We develop a fast
algorithm for the case that the input network is indeed a tree in which
multiple leaves might share a label. By combining this algorithm with a
generalization of a previously known decomposition scheme, we improve the
running time on reticulation visible networks and nearly stable networks to
linear time. While these are special classes of networks, they rank among the
most general of the previously considered classes.

 <dc:description>  In an effort to increase the versatility of finite element codes, we explore
the possibility of automatically creating the Jacobian matrix necessary for the
gradient-based solution of nonlinear systems of equations. Particularly, we aim
to assess the feasibility of employing the automatic differentiation tool
TAPENADE for this purpose on a large Fortran codebase that is the result of
many years of continuous development. As a starting point we will describe the
special structure of finite element codes and the implications that this code
design carries for an efficient calculation of the Jacobian matrix. We will
also propose a first approach towards improving the efficiency of such a
method. Finally, we will present a functioning method for the automatic
implementation of the Jacobian calculation in a finite element software, but
will also point out important shortcomings that will have to be addressed in
the future.

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of enumerating and counting answers to $k$-ary
conjunctive queries against relational databases that may be updated by
inserting or deleting tuples. We exhibit a new notion of q-hierarchical
conjunctive queries and show that these can be maintained efficiently in the
following sense. During a linear time preprocessing phase, we can build a data
structure that enables constant delay enumeration of the query results; and
when the database is updated, we can update the data structure and restart the
enumeration phase within constant time. For the special case of self-join free
conjunctive queries we obtain a dichotomy: if a query is not q-hierarchical,
then query enumeration with sublinear$^\ast$ delay and sublinear update time
(and arbitrary preprocessing time) is impossible.
  For answering Boolean conjunctive queries and for the more general problem of
counting the number of solutions of k-ary queries we obtain complete
dichotomies: if the query's homomorphic core is q-hierarchical, then size of
the the query result can be computed in linear time and maintained with
constant update time. Otherwise, the size of the query result cannot be
maintained with sublinear update time. All our lower bounds rely on the
OMv-conjecture, a conjecture on the hardness of online matrix-vector
multiplication that has recently emerged in the field of fine-grained
complexity to characterise the hardness of dynamic problems. The lower bound
for the counting problem additionally relies on the orthogonal vectors
conjecture, which in turn is implied by the strong exponential time hypothesis.
  $^\ast)$ By sublinear we mean $O(n^{1-\varepsilon})$ for some
$\varepsilon&gt;0$, where $n$ is the size of the active domain of the current
database.

 <dc:description>  A method is devised for numerically solving a class of finite-horizon optimal
control problems subject to cascade linear discrete-time dynamics. It is
assumed that the linear state and input inequality constraints, and the
quadratic measure of performance, are all separable with respect to the spatial
dimension of the underlying cascade of sub-systems, as well as the temporal
dimension of the dynamics. By virtue of this structure, the computation cost of
an interior-point method for an equivalent quadratic programming formulation of
the optimal control problem can be made to scale linearly with the number of
sub-systems. However, the complexity of this approach grows cubically with the
time horizon. As such, computational advantage becomes apparent in situations
where the number of sub-systems is relatively large. In any case, the method is
amenable to distributed computation with low communication overhead and only
immediate upstream neighbour sharing of partial model data among processing
agents. An example is presented to illustrate an application of the main
results to model data for the cascade dynamics of an automated irrigation
channel.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a branched residual network for image classification. It
is known that high-level features of deep neural network are more
representative than lower-level features. By sharing the low-level features,
the network can allocate more memory to high-level features. The upper layers
of our proposed network are branched, so that it mimics the ensemble learning.
By mimicking ensemble learning with single network, we have achieved better
performance on ImageNet classification task.

 <dc:description>  Segmental conditional random fields (SCRFs) and connectionist temporal
classification (CTC) are two sequence labeling methods used for end-to-end
training of speech recognition models. Both models define a transcription
probability by marginalizing decisions about latent segmentation alternatives
to derive a sequence probability: the former uses a globally normalized joint
model of segment labels and durations, and the latter classifies each frame as
either an output symbol or a &quot;continuation&quot; of the previous label. In this
paper, we train a recognition model by optimizing an interpolation between the
SCRF and CTC losses, where the same recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder is
used for feature extraction for both outputs. We find that this multitask
objective improves recognition accuracy when decoding with either the SCRF or
CTC models. Additionally, we show that CTC can also be used to pretrain the RNN
encoder, which improves the convergence rate when learning the joint model.

 <dc:description>  Complex Event Recognition applications exhibit various types of uncertainty,
ranging from incomplete and erroneous data streams to imperfect complex event
patterns. We review Complex Event Recognition techniques that handle, to some
extent, uncertainty. We examine techniques based on automata, probabilistic
graphical models and first-order logic, which are the most common ones, and
approaches based on Petri Nets and Grammars, which are less frequently used. A
number of limitations are identified with respect to the employed languages,
their probabilistic models and their performance, as compared to the purely
deterministic cases. Based on those limitations, we highlight promising
directions for future work.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the channel estimation (CE) and multi-user detection
(MUD) problems in cloud radio access network (C-RAN). Assuming that active
users are sparse in the network, we solve CE and MUD problems with compressed
sensing (CS) technology to greatly reduce the long identification pilot
overhead. A mixed L{2,1}-regularization functional for extended sparse
group-sparsity recovery is proposed to exploit the inherently sparse property
existing both in user activities and remote radio heads (RRHs) that active
users are attached to. Empirical and theoretical guidelines are provided to
help choosing tuning parameters which have critical effect on the performance
of the penalty functional. To speed up the processing procedure, based on
alternating direction method of multipliers and variable splitting strategy, an
efficient algorithm is formulated which is guaranteed to be convergent.
Numerical results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed
functional and efficient algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We propose an intelligent proactive content caching scheme to reduce the
energy consumption in wireless downlink. We consider an online social network
(OSN) setting where new contents are generated over time, and remain
\textit{relevant} to the user for a random lifetime. Contents are downloaded to
the user equipment (UE) through a time-varying wireless channel at an energy
cost that depends on the channel state and the number of contents downloaded.
The user accesses the OSN at random time instants, and consumes all the
relevant contents. To reduce the energy consumption, we propose
\textit{proactive caching} of contents under favorable channel conditions to a
finite capacity cache memory. Assuming that the channel quality (or
equivalently, the cost of downloading data) is memoryless over time slots, we
show that the optimal caching policy, which may replace contents in the cache
with shorter remaining lifetime with contents at the server that remain
relevant longer, has certain threshold structure with respect to the channel
quality. Since the optimal policy is computationally demanding in practice, we
introduce a simplified caching scheme and optimize its parameters using policy
search. We also present two lower bounds on the energy consumption. We
demonstrate through numerical simulations that the proposed caching scheme
significantly reduces the energy consumption compared to traditional reactive
caching tools, and achieves close-to-optimal performance for a wide variety of
system parameters.

 <dc:description>  Comparing images to recommend items from an image-inventory is a subject of
continued interest. Added with the scalability of deep-learning architectures
the once `manual' job of hand-crafting features have been largely alleviated,
and images can be compared according to features generated from a deep
convolutional neural network. In this paper, we compare distance metrics (and
divergences) to rank features generated from a neural network, for
content-based image retrieval. Specifically, after modelling individual images
using approximations of mixture models or sparse covariance estimators, we
resort to their information-theoretic and Riemann geometric comparisons. We
show that using approximations of mixture models enable us to compute a
distance measure based on the Wasserstein metric that requires less effort than
other computationally intensive optimal transport plans; finally, an affine
invariant metric is used to compare the optimal transport metric to its Riemann
geometric counterpart -- we conclude that although expensive, retrieval metric
based on Wasserstein geometry is more suitable than information theoretic
comparison of images. In short, we combine GPU scalability in learning deep
feature vectors with statistically efficient metrics that we foresee being
utilised in a commercial setting.

 <dc:description>  The concept of SDN has emerged as a way to address numerous challenges with
traditional network architectures by decoupling network control and forwarding.
So far, the use cases for SDN mainly targeted data-center applications. This
article considers SDN for network carriers, facing operation of large-scale
networks with millions of customers, multiple technologies, and high
availability demands. With specific carrier-grade features such as scalability,
reliability, flexibility, modularity, and virtualization in mind, the SPARC EU
project has developed the SPARC SplitArchitecture concept. The
SplitArchitecture control plane allows hierarchical layering of several control
plane layers which can be flexibly mapped to data plane layers. Between control
layers open interfaces are used. Furthermore, SplitArchitecture proposes an
additional split of forwarding and processing functions in data path elements,
enabling switch based OAM functionality and handling of tunneling techniques.
The SplitArchitecture concept is evaluated in a prototype demonstrating an SDN
version of BRAS: the floating BRAS. The floating BRAS allows creation of
residential Internet access services with dynamically managed BRAS instances.
The demo is based on a controller enabling protected MPLS transport connections
spanning SDN-controlled aggregation and IP/MPLS-based core domains. The
prototype showcases how SplitArchitecture enables virtualization of service
nodes in an SDN-controlled network, leading to increased flexibility in
configuration and placement of service creation functions. Overall, the results
show that it is technically and economically beneficial to apply SDN, and
specifically the SplitArchitecture concept, to the carrier domain.

 <dc:description>  Given data over the joint distribution of two random variables $X$ and $Y$,
we consider the problem of inferring the most likely causal direction between
$X$ and $Y$. In particular, we consider the general case where both $X$ and $Y$
may be univariate or multivariate, and of the same or mixed data types. We take
an information theoretic approach, based on Kolmogorov complexity, from which
it follows that first describing the data over cause and then that of effect
given cause is shorter than the reverse direction.
  The ideal score is not computable, but can be approximated through the
Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. Based on MDL, we propose two
scores, one for when both $X$ and $Y$ are of the same single data type, and one
for when they are mixed-type. We model dependencies between $X$ and $Y$ using
classification and regression trees. As inferring the optimal model is NP-hard,
we propose Crack, a fast greedy algorithm to determine the most likely causal
direction directly from the data.
  Empirical evaluation on a wide range of data shows that Crack reliably, and
with high accuracy, infers the correct causal direction on both univariate and
multivariate cause-effect pairs over both single and mixed-type data.

 <dc:description>  Although there is consensus that software defined networking and network
functions virtualization overhaul service provisioning and deployment, the
community still lacks a definite answer on how carrier-grade operations praxis
needs to evolve. This article presents what lies beyond the first evolutionary
steps in network management, identifies the challenges in service verification,
observability, and troubleshooting, and explains how to address them using our
Service Provider DevOps (SP-DevOps) framework. We compendiously cover the
entire process from design goals to tool realization and employ an elastic
version of an industry-standard use case to show how on-the-fly verification,
software-defined monitoring, and automated troubleshooting of services reduce
the cost of fault management actions. We assess SP-DevOps with respect to key
attributes of software-defined telecommunication infrastructures both
qualitatively and quantitatively, and demonstrate that SP-DevOps paves the way
toward carrier-grade operations and management in the network virtualization
era.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, energy-efficient transmission schemes achieving maximal
throughput over a finite time interval are studied in a problem setting
including energy harvests, data arrivals and channel variation. The goal is to
express the offline optimal policy in a way that facilitates a good online
solution. We express any throughput maximizing energy efficient offline
schedule (EE-TM-OFF) explicitly in terms of water levels. This allows per-slot
real-time evaluation of transmit power and rate decisions, using estimates of
the associated offline water levels. To compute the online power level, we
construct a stochastic dynamic program that incorporates the offline optimal
solution as a stochastic process. We introduce the &quot;Immediate Fill&quot; metric
which provides a lower bound on the efficiency of any online policy with
respect to the corresponding optimal offline solution. The online algorithms
obtained this way exhibit performance close to the offline optimal, not only in
the long run but also in short problem horizons, deeming them suitable for
practical implementations.

 <dc:description>  This work proves a new result on the correct convergence of Min-Sum Loopy
Belief Propagation (LBP) in an interpolation problem on a square grid graph.
The focus is on the notion of local solutions, a numerical quantity attached to
each site of the graph that can be used for obtaining MAP estimates. The main
result is that over an $N\times N$ grid graph with a one-run boundary
configuration, the local solutions at each $i \in B$ can be calculated using
Min-Sum LBP by passing difference messages in $2N$ iterations, which parallels
the well-known convergence time in trees.

 <dc:description>  FPGA-based hardware accelerators for convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
have obtained great attentions due to their higher energy efficiency than GPUs.
However, it is challenging for FPGA-based solutions to achieve a higher
throughput than GPU counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate that FPGA
acceleration can be a superior solution in terms of both throughput and energy
efficiency when a CNN is trained with binary constraints on weights and
activations. Specifically, we propose an optimized FPGA accelerator
architecture tailored for bitwise convolution and normalization that features
massive spatial parallelism with deep pipelines stages. A key advantage of the
FPGA accelerator is that its performance is insensitive to data batch size,
while the performance of GPU acceleration varies largely depending on the batch
size of the data. Experiment results show that the proposed accelerator
architecture for binary CNNs running on a Virtex-7 FPGA is 8.3x faster and 75x
more energy-efficient than a Titan X GPU for processing online individual
requests in small batch sizes. For processing static data in large batch sizes,
the proposed solution is on a par with a Titan X GPU in terms of throughput
while delivering 9.5x higher energy efficiency.

 <dc:description>  To reduce cost in storing, processing and visualizing a large-scale point
cloud, we consider a randomized resampling strategy to select a representative
subset of points while preserving application-dependent features. The proposed
strategy is based on graphs, which can represent underlying surfaces and lend
themselves well to efficient computation. We use a general feature-extraction
operator to represent application-dependent features and propose a general
reconstruction error to evaluate the quality of resampling. We obtain a general
form of optimal resampling distribution by minimizing the reconstruction error.
The proposed optimal resampling distribution is guaranteed to be shift,
rotation and scale-invariant in the 3D space. We next specify the
feature-extraction operator to be a graph filter and study specific resampling
strategies based on all-pass, low-pass, high-pass graph filtering and graph
filter banks. We finally apply the proposed methods to three applications:
large-scale visualization, accurate registration and robust shape modeling. The
empirical performance validates the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed resampling methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel scheme for synchronizing four drive and four response
systems is proposed by the authors. The idea of multi switching and dual
combination synchronization is extended to dual combination-combination multi
switching synchronization involving eight chaotic systems and is a first of its
kind. Due to the multiple combination of chaotic systems and multi switching
the resultant dynamic behaviour is so complex that, in communication theory,
transmission and security of the resultant signal is more effective. Using
Lyapunov stability theory, sufficient conditions are achieved and suitable
controllers are designed to realise the desired synchronization. Corresponding
theoretical analysis is presented and numerical simulations performed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  In order to obtain reliable accuracy estimates for automatic MOOC dropout
predictors, it is important to train and test them in a manner consistent with
how they will be used in practice. Yet most prior research on MOOC dropout
prediction has measured test accuracy on the same course used for training the
classifier, which can lead to overly optimistic accuracy estimates. In order to
understand better how accuracy is affected by the training+testing regime, we
compared the accuracy of a standard dropout prediction architecture
(clickstream features + logistic regression) across 4 different training
paradigms. Results suggest that (1) training and testing on the same course
(&quot;post-hoc&quot;) can overestimate accuracy by several percentage points; (2)
dropout classifiers trained on proxy labels based on students' persistence are
surprisingly competitive with post-hoc training (87.33% versus 90.20% AUC
averaged over 8 weeks of 40 HarvardX MOOCs); and (3) classifier performance
does not vary significantly with the academic discipline. Finally, we also
research new dropout prediction architectures based on deep, fully-connected,
feed-forward neural networks and find that (4) networks with as many as 5
hidden layers can statistically significantly increase test accuracy over that
of logistic regression.

 <dc:description>  The R package frailtySurv for simulating and fitting semi-parametric shared
frailty models is introduced. frailtySurv implements semi-parametric consistent
estimators for a variety of frailty distributions, including gamma, log-normal,
inverse Gaussian and power variance function, and provides consistent
estimators of the standard errors of the parameters' estimators. The
parameters' estimators are asymptotically normally distributed, and therefore
statistical inference based on the results of this package, such as hypothesis
testing and confidence intervals, can be performed using the normal
distribution. Extensive simulations demonstrate the flexibility and correct
implementation of the estimator. Two case studies performed with
publicly-available datasets demonstrate applicability of the package. In the
Diabetic Retinopathy Study, the onset of blindness is clustered by patient, and
in a large hard drive failure dataset, failure times are thought to be
clustered by the hard drive manufacturer and model.

 <dc:description>  The event-based model (EBM) for data-driven disease progression modeling
estimates the sequence in which biomarkers for a disease become abnormal. This
helps in understanding the dynamics of disease progression and facilitates
early diagnosis by staging patients on a disease progression timeline. Existing
EBM methods are all generative in nature. In this work we propose a novel
discriminative approach to EBM, which is shown to be more accurate as well as
computationally more efficient than existing state-of-the art EBM methods. The
method first estimates for each subject an approximate ordering of events, by
ranking the posterior probabilities of individual biomarkers being abnormal.
Subsequently, the central ordering over all subjects is estimated by fitting a
generalized Mallows model to these approximate subject-specific orderings based
on a novel probabilistic Kendall's Tau distance. To evaluate the accuracy, we
performed extensive experiments on synthetic data simulating the progression of
Alzheimer's disease. Subsequently, the method was applied to the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to estimate the central event
ordering in the dataset. The experiments benchmark the accuracy of the new
model under various conditions and compare it with existing state-of-the-art
EBM methods. The results indicate that discriminative EBM could be a simple and
elegant approach to disease progression modeling.

 <dc:description>  Zone-level occupancy counting is a critical technology for smart buildings
and can be used for several applications such as building energy management,
surveillance, and public safety. Existing occupancy counting techniques
typically require installation of large number of occupancy monitoring sensors
inside a building as well as an established network. In this study, in order to
achieve occupancy counting, we consider the use of WiFi probe requests that are
continuously transmitted from WiFi enabled smart devices. To this end, WiFi
Pineapple equipment are used for passively capturing ambient probe requests
from WiFi devices such as smart phones and tablets, where no connectivity to a
WiFi network is required. This information is then used to localize users
within coarsely defined occupancy zones, and subsequently to obtain occupancy
count within each zone at different time scales. An interacting multi-model
Kalman filter technique is developed to improve occupancy counting accuracy.
Our numerical results using WiFi data collected at a university building show
that utilization of WiFi probe requests can be considered a viable solution
tool for zone-level occupancy counting in smart buildings.

 <dc:title>Phase Transitions of Spectral Initialization for High-Dimensional

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We study a spectral initialization method that serves a key role in recent
work on estimating signals in nonconvex settings. Previous analysis of this
method focuses on the phase retrieval problem and provides only performance
bounds. In this paper, we consider arbitrary generalized linear sensing models
and present a precise asymptotic characterization of the performance of the
method in the high-dimensional limit. Our analysis also reveals a phase
transition phenomenon that depends on the ratio between the number of samples
and the signal dimension. When the ratio is below a minimum threshold, the
estimates given by the spectral method are no better than random guesses drawn
from a uniform distribution on the hypersphere, thus carrying no information;
above a maximum threshold, the estimates become increasingly aligned with the
target signal. The computational complexity of the method, as measured by the
spectral gap, is also markedly different in the two phases. Worked examples and
numerical results are provided to illustrate and verify the analytical
predictions. In particular, simulations show that our asymptotic formulas
provide accurate predictions for the actual performance of the spectral method
even at moderate signal dimensions.

 <dc:description>  Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) is envisioned to be one of the most
challenging security problems in the coming decade. One key challenge in CIP is
the ability to allocate resources, either personnel or cyber, to critical
infrastructures with different vulnerability and criticality levels. In this
work, a contract-theoretic approach is proposed to solve the problem of
resource allocation in critical infrastructure with asymmetric information. A
control center (CC) is used to design contracts and offer them to
infrastructures' owners. A contract can be seen as an agreement between the CC
and infrastructures using which the CC allocates resources and gets rewards in
return. Contracts are designed in a way to maximize the CC's benefit and
motivate each infrastructure to accept a contract and obtain proper resources
for its protection. Infrastructures are defined by both vulnerability levels
and criticality levels which are unknown to the CC. Therefore, each
infrastructure can claim that it is the most vulnerable or critical to gain
more resources. A novel mechanism is developed to handle such an asymmetric
information while providing the optimal contract that motivates each
infrastructure to reveal its actual type. The necessary and sufficient
conditions for such resource allocation contracts under asymmetric information
are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed contract-theoretic
approach maximizes the CC's utility while ensuring that no infrastructure has
an incentive to ask for another contract, despite the lack of exact information
at the CC.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the notion of admissibility for randomised strategies
in concurrent games. Intuitively, an admissible strategy is one where the
player plays `as well as possible', because there is no other strategy that
dominates it, i.e., that wins (almost surely) against a super set of
adversarial strategies. We prove that admissible strategies always exist in
concurrent games, and we characterise them precisely. Then, when the objectives
of the players are omega-regular, we show how to perform assume-admissible
synthesis, i.e., how to compute admissible strategies that win (almost surely)
under the hypothesis that the other players play admissible

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on traffic camera calibration and visual speed
measurement from a single monocular camera, which is an important task of
visual traffic surveillance. Existing methods addressing this problem are hard
to compare due to lack of a common dataset with reliable ground truth.
Therefore, it is not clear how the methods compare in various aspects and what
are the factors affecting their performance. We captured a new dataset of 18
full-HD videos, each around one hour long, captured at 6 different locations.
Vehicles in videos (20,865 instances in total) are annotated with precise speed
measurements from optical gates using LIDAR and verified with several reference
GPS tracks. We provide the videos and metadata (calibration, lengths of
features in image, annotations, etc.) for future comparison and evaluation.
Camera calibration is the most crucial part of the speed measurement;
therefore, we provide a review of the methods and analyze a recently published
method for fully automatic camera calibration and vehicle speed measurement and
report the results on this dataset in detail.

 <dc:description>  Sampling in shift-invariant spaces is a realistic model for signals with
smooth spectrum. In this paper, we consider phaseless sampling and
reconstruction of real-valued signals in a shift-invariant space from their
magnitude measurements on the whole Euclidean space and from their phaseless
samples taken on a discrete set with finite sampling density. We introduce an
undirected graph to a signal and use connectivity of the graph to characterize
whether the signal can be determined, up to a sign, from its magnitude
measurements on the whole Euclidean space. Under the local complement property
assumption on a shift-invariant space, we find a discrete set with finite
sampling density such that signals in the shift-invariant space, that are
determined from their magnitude measurements on the whole Euclidean space, can
be reconstructed in a stable way from their phaseless samples taken on that
discrete set. In this paper, we also propose a reconstruction algorithm which
provides a suboptimal approximation to the original signal when its noisy
phaseless samples are available only. Finally, numerical simulations are
performed to demonstrate the robust reconstruction of box spline signals from
their noisy phaseless samples.

 <dc:description>  The performance of a noisy linear time-invariant (LTI) plant, controlled over
a noiseless digital channel with transmission delay, is investigated in this
paper. The rate-limited channel connects the single measurement output of the
plant to its single control input through a causal, but otherwise arbitrary,
coder-controller pair. An infomation-theoretic approach is utilized to analyze
the minimal average data rate required to attain the quadratic performance when
the channel imposes a known constant delay on the transmitted data. This
infimum average data rate is shown to be lower bounded by minimizing the
directed information rate across a set of LTI filters and an additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. It is demonstrated that the presence of time
delay in the channel increases the data rate needed to achieve a certain level
of performance. The applicability of the results is verified through a
numerical example. In particular, we show by simulations that when the optimal
filters are used but the AWGN channel (used in the lower bound) is replaced by
a simple scalar uniform quantizer, the resulting operational data rates are at
most around 0.3 bits above the lower bounds.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on fully automatic traffic surveillance camera
calibration, which we use for speed measurement of passing vehicles. We improve
over a recent state-of-the-art camera calibration method for traffic
surveillance based on two detected vanishing points. More importantly, we
propose a novel automatic scene scale inference method. The method is based on
matching bounding boxes of rendered 3D models of vehicles with detected
bounding boxes in the image. The proposed method can be used from arbitrary
viewpoints, since it has no constraints on camera placement. We evaluate our
method on the recent comprehensive dataset for speed measurement BrnoCompSpeed.
Experiments show that our automatic camera calibration method by detection of
two vanishing points reduces error by 50% (mean distance ratio error reduced
from 0.18 to 0.09) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. We also
show that our scene scale inference method is more precise, outperforming both
state-of-the-art automatic calibration method for speed measurement (error
reduction by 86% -- 7.98km/h to 1.10km/h) and manual calibration (error
reduction by 19% -- 1.35km/h to 1.10km/h). We also present qualitative results
of the proposed automatic camera calibration method on video sequences obtained
from real surveillance cameras in various places, and under different lighting
conditions (night, dawn, day).

 <dc:title>3-Dimensional Optical Orthogonal Codes with Ideal Autocorrelation-Bounds
  and Optimal Constructions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alderson, Tim L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Several new constructions of 3-dimensional optical orthogonal codes are
presented here. In each case the codes have ideal autocorrelation $\mathbf{
\lambda_a=0} $, and in all but one case a cross correlation of $
\mathbf{\lambda_c=1} $. All codes produced are optimal with respect to the
applicable Johnson bound either presented or developed here. Thus, on one hand
the codes are as large as possible, and on the other, the bound(s) are shown to
be tight. All codes are constructed by using a particular automorphism (a
Singer cycle) of $ \mathbf{ PG(k,q)} $, the finite projective geometry of
dimension $ k $ over the field of order $ \mathbf{q} $, or by using an affine
analogue in $ AG(k,q) $.

 <dc:title>Online Representation Learning with Multi-layer Hebbian Networks for

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning permits the development of algorithms that are able to
adapt to a variety of different data sets using the same underlying rules
thanks to the autonomous discovery of discriminating features during training.
Recently, a new class of Hebbian-like and local unsupervised learning rules for
neural networks have been developed that minimise a similarity matching
cost-function. These have been shown to perform sparse representation learning.
This study tests the effectiveness of one such learning rule for learning
features from images. The rule implemented is derived from a nonnegative
classical multidimensional scaling cost-function, and is applied to both single
and multi-layer architectures. The features learned by the algorithm are then
used as input to an SVM to test their effectiveness in classification on the
established CIFAR-10 image dataset. The algorithm performs well in comparison
to other unsupervised learning algorithms and multi-layer networks, thus
suggesting its validity in the design of a new class of compact, online
learning networks.

 <dc:description>  Two of the most fundamental prototypes of greedy optimization are the
matching pursuit and Frank-Wolfe algorithms. In this paper, we take a unified
view on both classes of methods, leading to the first explicit convergence
rates of matching pursuit methods in an optimization sense, for general sets of
atoms. We derive sublinear ($1/t$) convergence for both classes on general
smooth objectives, and linear convergence on strongly convex objectives, as
well as a clear correspondence of algorithm variants. Our presented algorithms
and rates are affine invariant, and do not need any incoherence or sparsity
assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Strong and supportive social relationships are fundamental to our well-being.
However, there are costs to their maintenance, resulting in a trade-off between
quality and quantity, a typical strategy being to put a lot of effort on a few
high-intensity relationships while maintaining larger numbers of less close
relationships. It has also been shown that there are persistent individual
differences in this pattern; some individuals allocate their efforts more
uniformly across their networks, while others strongly focus on their closest
relationships. Furthermore, some individuals maintain more stable networks than
others. Here, we focus on how personality traits of individuals affect this
picture, using mobile phone calls records and survey data from the Mobile
Territorial Lab (MTL) study. In particular, we look at the relationship between
personality traits and the (i) persistence of social signatures, namely the
similarity of the social signature shape of an individual measured in different
time intervals; (ii) the turnover in egocentric networks, that is, differences
in the set of alters present at two consecutive temporal intervals; and (iii)
the rank dynamics defined as the variation of alter rankings in egocentric
networks in consecutive intervals. We observe that some traits have effects on
the stability of the social signatures as well as network turnover and rank
dynamics. As an example, individuals who score highly in the Openness to
Experience trait tend to have higher levels of network turnover and larger
alter rank variations. On broader terms, our study shows that personality
traits clearly affect the ways in which individuals maintain their personal
networks.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel label fusion technique as well as a crowdsourcing protocol
to efficiently obtain accurate epithelial cell segmentations from non-expert
crowd workers. Our label fusion technique simultaneously estimates the true
segmentation, the performance levels of individual crowd workers, and an image
segmentation model in the form of a pairwise Markov random field. We term our
approach image-aware STAPLE (iaSTAPLE) since our image segmentation model
seamlessly integrates into the well-known and widely used STAPLE approach. In
an evaluation on a light microscopy dataset containing more than 5000 membrane
labeled epithelial cells of a fly wing, we show that iaSTAPLE outperforms
STAPLE in terms of segmentation accuracy as well as in terms of the accuracy of
estimated crowd worker performance levels, and is able to correctly segment 99%
of all cells when compared to expert segmentations. These results show that
iaSTAPLE is a highly useful tool for crowd sourcing image segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Brains need to predict how the body reacts to motor commands. It is an open
question how networks of spiking neurons can learn to reproduce the non-linear
body dynamics caused by motor commands, using local, online and stable learning
rules. Here, we present a supervised learning scheme for the feedforward and
recurrent connections in a network of heterogeneous spiking neurons. The error
in the output is fed back through fixed random connections with a negative
gain, causing the network to follow the desired dynamics, while an online and
local rule changes the weights. The rule for Feedback-based Online Local
Learning Of Weights (FOLLOW) is local in the sense that weight changes depend
on the presynaptic activity and the error signal projected onto the
postsynaptic neuron. We provide examples of learning linear, non-linear and
chaotic dynamics, as well as the dynamics of a two-link arm. Using the Lyapunov
method, and under reasonable assumptions and approximations, we show that
FOLLOW learning is stable uniformly, with the error going to zero
asymptotically.

 <dc:title>Mathematical Backdoors in Symmetric Encryption Systems - Proposal for a
  Backdoored AES-like Block Cipher</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bannier, Arnaud</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Filiol, Eric</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent years have shown that more than ever governments and intelligence
agencies try to control and bypass the cryptographic means used for the
protection of data. Backdooring encryption algorithms is considered as the best
way to enforce cryptographic control. Until now, only implementation backdoors
(at the protocol/implementation/management level) are generally considered. In
this paper we propose to address the most critical issue of backdoors:
mathematical backdoors or by-design backdoors, which are put directly at the
mathematical design of the encryption algorithm. While the algorithm may be
totally public, proving that there is a backdoor, identifying it and exploiting
it, may be an intractable problem. We intend to explain that it is probably
possible to design and put such backdoors. Considering a particular family
(among all the possible ones), we present BEA-1, a block cipher algorithm which
is similar to the AES and which contains a mathematical backdoor enabling an
operational and effective cryptanalysis. The BEA-1 algorithm (80-bit block
size, 120-bit key, 11 rounds) is designed to resist to linear and differential
cryptanalyses. A challenge will be proposed to the cryptography community soon.
Its aim is to assess whether our backdoor is easily detectable and exploitable
or not.

 <dc:description>  Social media and user-generated content (UGC) are increasingly important
features of journalistic work in a number of different ways. However, their use
presents major challenges, not least because information posted on social media
is not always reliable and therefore its veracity needs to be checked before it
can be considered as fit for use in the reporting of news. We report on the
results of a series of in-depth ethnographic studies of journalist work
practices undertaken as part of the requirements gathering for a prototype of a
social media verification 'dashboard' and its subsequent evaluation. We
conclude with some reflections upon the broader implications of our findings
for the design of tools to support journalistic work.

 <dc:description>  Bias is a common problem in today's media, appearing frequently in text and
in visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better
methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists --those who are motivated
to effect change related to some topic, need better methods to identify and
counteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases
in mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that
supports identification of, and action on bias in visual news media. In
particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of
bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling
activists to inform the public of bias and take action by engaging people in
conversation with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform

 <dc:title>Timely CSI Acquisition Exploiting Full Duplex</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Arnau, Jesus</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Kountouris, Marios</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a method for acquiring accurate and timely channel
state information (CSI) by leveraging full-duplex transmission. Specifically,
we propose a mobile communication system in which base stations continuously
transmit a pilot sequence in the uplink frequency band, while terminals use
self-interference cancellation capabilities to obtain CSI at any time. Our
proposal outperforms its half-duplex counterpart by at least 50% in terms of
throughput while ensuring the same (or even lower) outage probability.
Remarkably, it also outperforms using full duplex for downlink data
transmission for low values of downlink bandwidth and received power.

 <dc:description>  Hyperbolicity measures, in terms of (distance) metrics, how close a given
graph is to being a tree. Due to its relevance in modeling real-world networks,
hyperbolicity has seen intensive research over the last years. Unfortunately,
the best known algorithms for computing the hyperbolicity number of a graph
(the smaller, the more tree-like) have running time $O(n^4)$, where $n$ is the
number of graph vertices. Exploiting the framework of parameterized complexity
analysis, we explore possibilities for &quot;linear-time FPT&quot; algorithms to compute
hyperbolicity. For instance, we show that hyperbolicity can be computed in time
$O(2^{O(k)} + n +m)$ ($m$ being the number of graph edges) while at the same
time, unless the SETH fails, there is no $2^{o(k)}n^2$-time algorithm.

 <dc:title>Iterative bidding in electricity markets: rationality and robustness</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  This paper studies an electricity market consisting of an independent system
operator (ISO) and a group of generators. The goal is to solve the DC optimal
power flow (DC-OPF) problem: have the generators collectively meet the power
demand while minimizing the aggregate generation cost and respecting line flow
limits in the network. The ISO by itself cannot solve the DC-OPF problem as
generators are strategic and do not share their cost functions. Instead, each
generator submits to the ISO a bid, consisting of the price per unit of
electricity at which it is willing to provide power. Based on the bids, the ISO
decides how much production to allocate to each generator to minimize the total
payment while meeting the load and satisfying the line limits. We provide a
provably correct, decentralized iterative scheme, termed BID ADJUSTMENT
ALGORITHM, for the resulting Bertrand competition game. Regarding convergence,
we show that the algorithm takes the generators' bids to any desired
neighborhood of the efficient Nash equilibrium at a linear convergence rate. As
a consequence, the optimal production of the generators converges to the
optimizer of the DC-OPF problem. Regarding robustness, we show that the
algorithm is robust to affine perturbations in the bid adjustment scheme and
that there is no incentive for any individual generator to deviate from the
algorithm by using an alternative bid update scheme. We also establish the
algorithm robustness to collusion, i.e., we show that, as long as each bus with
generation has a generator following the strategy, there is no incentive for
any group of generators to share information with the intent of tricking the
system to obtain a higher payoff. Simulations illustrate our results.

 <dc:description>  We explore design principles for general pixel-level prediction problems,
from low-level edge detection to mid-level surface normal estimation to
high-level semantic segmentation. Convolutional predictors, such as the
fully-convolutional network (FCN), have achieved remarkable success by
exploiting the spatial redundancy of neighboring pixels through convolutional
processing. Though computationally efficient, we point out that such approaches
are not statistically efficient during learning precisely because spatial
redundancy limits the information learned from neighboring pixels. We
demonstrate that stratified sampling of pixels allows one to (1) add diversity
during batch updates, speeding up learning; (2) explore complex nonlinear
predictors, improving accuracy; and (3) efficiently train state-of-the-art
models tabula rasa (i.e., &quot;from scratch&quot;) for diverse pixel-labeling tasks. Our
single architecture produces state-of-the-art results for semantic segmentation
on PASCAL-Context dataset, surface normal estimation on NYUDv2 depth dataset,
and edge detection on BSDS.

 <dc:description>  A number of fundamental quantities in statistical signal processing and
information theory can be expressed as integral functions of two probability
density functions. Such quantities are called density functionals as they map
density functions onto the real line. For example, information divergence
functions measure the dissimilarity between two probability density functions
and are useful in a number of applications. Typically, estimating these
quantities requires complete knowledge of the underlying distribution followed
by multi-dimensional integration. Existing methods make parametric assumptions
about the data distribution or use non-parametric density estimation followed
by high-dimensional integration. In this paper, we propose a new alternative.
We introduce the concept of &quot;data-driven basis functions&quot; - functions of
distributions whose value we can estimate given only samples from the
underlying distributions without requiring distribution fitting or direct
integration. We derive a new data-driven complete basis that is similar to the
deterministic Bernstein polynomial basis and develop two methods for performing
basis expansions of functionals of two distributions. We also show that the new
basis set allows us to approximate functions of distributions as closely as
desired. Finally, we evaluate the methodology by developing data driven
estimators for the Kullback-Leibler divergences and the Hellinger distance and
by constructing empirical estimates of tight bounds on the Bayes error rate.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning techniques, namely convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
regression forests, have recently shown great promise in performing 6-DoF
localization of monocular images. However, in most cases image-sequences,
rather only single images, are readily available. To this extent, none of the
proposed learning-based approaches exploit the valuable constraint of temporal
smoothness, often leading to situations where the per-frame error is larger
than the camera motion. In this paper we propose a recurrent model for
performing 6-DoF localization of video-clips. We find that, even by considering
only short sequences (20 frames), the pose estimates are smoothed and the
localization error can be drastically reduced. Finally, we consider means of
obtaining probabilistic pose estimates from our model. We evaluate our method
on openly-available real-world autonomous driving and indoor localization
datasets.

 <dc:title>Competition and Selection Among Conventions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In many domains, a latent competition among different conventions determines
which one will come to dominate. One sees such effects in the success of
community jargon, of competing frames in political rhetoric, or of terminology
in technical contexts. These effects have become widespread in the online
domain, where the data offers the potential to study competition among
conventions at a fine-grained level.
  In analyzing the dynamics of conventions over time, however, even with
detailed on-line data, one encounters two significant challenges. First, as
conventions evolve, the underlying substance of their meaning tends to change
as well; and such substantive changes confound investigations of social
effects. Second, the selection of a convention takes place through the complex
interactions of individuals within a community, and contention between the
users of competing conventions plays a key role in the convention's evolution.
Any analysis must take place in the presence of these two issues.
  In this work we study a setting in which we can cleanly track the competition
among conventions. Our analysis is based on the spread of low-level authoring
conventions in the eprint arXiv over 24 years: by tracking the spread of macros
and other author-defined conventions, we are able to study conventions that
vary even as the underlying meaning remains constant. We find that the
interaction among co-authors over time plays a crucial role in the selection of
them; the distinction between more and less experienced members of the
community, and the distinction between conventions with visible versus
invisible effects, are both central to the underlying processes. Through our
analysis we make predictions at the population level about the ultimate success
of different synonymous conventions over time--and at the individual level
about the outcome of &quot;fights&quot; between people over convention choices.

 <dc:description>  Listing all triangles in an undirected graph is a fundamental graph primitive
with numerous applications. It is trivially solvable in time cubic in the
number of vertices. It has seen a significant body of work contributing to both
theoretical aspects (e.g., lower and upper bounds on running time, adaption to
new computational models) as well practical aspects (e.g. algorithms tuned for
large graphs). Motivated by the fact that the worst-case running time is cubic,
we perform a systematic parameterized complexity study of triangle enumeration,
providing both positive results (new enumerative kernelizations, &quot;subcubic&quot;
parameterized solving algorithms) as well as negative results (likely
uselessness in terms of &quot;faster&quot; parameterized algorithms of certain parameters
such as graph diameter).

signals as interference-free, multipath-afflicted, spoofed, or jammed according
to observations of received power and correlation function distortion. It does
not depend on external hardware or a network connection and can be readily
implemented on many receivers via a firmware update. Crucially, the detector
can with high probability distinguish low-power spoofing from ordinary
multipath. In testing against over 25 high-quality empirical data sets yielding
over 900,000 separate detection tests, the detector correctly alarms on all
malicious spoofing or jamming attacks while maintaining a &lt;0.6% single-channel
false alarm rate.

 <dc:description>  Evaluating the effectiveness and benefits of driver assistance systems is
essential for improving the system performance. In this paper, we propose an
efficient evaluation method for a semi-autonomous lane departure correction
system. To achieve this, we apply a bounded Gaussian mixture model to describe
drivers' stochastic lane departure behavior learned from naturalistic driving
data, which can regenerate departure behaviors to evaluate the lane departure
correction system. In the stochastic lane departure model, we conduct a
dimension reduction to reduce the computation cost. Finally, to show the
advantages of our proposed evaluation approach, we compare steering systems
with and without lane departure assistance based on the stochastic lane
departure model. The simulation results show that the proposed method can
effectively evaluate the lane departure correction system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent advances in one-shot learning have produced models that can learn from
a handful of labeled examples, for passive classification and regression tasks.
This paper combines reinforcement learning with one-shot learning, allowing the
model to decide, during classification, which examples are worth labeling. We
introduce a classification task in which a stream of images are presented and,
on each time step, a decision must be made to either predict a label or pay to
receive the correct label. We present a recurrent neural network based
action-value function, and demonstrate its ability to learn how and when to
request labels. Through the choice of reward function, the model can achieve a
higher prediction accuracy than a similar model on a purely supervised task, or
trade prediction accuracy for fewer label requests.

 <dc:description>  Long linear codes constructed from toric varieties over finite fields, their
multiplicative structure and decoding. The main theme is the inherent
multiplicative structure on toric codes. The multiplicative structure allows
for \emph{decoding}, resembling the decoding of Reed-Solomon codes and aligns
with decoding by error correcting pairs. We have used the multiplicative
structure on toric codes to construct linear secret sharing schemes with
\emph{strong multiplication} via Massey's construction generalizing the Shamir
Linear secret sharing shemes constructed from Reed-Solomon codes. We have
constructed quantum error correcting codes from toric surfaces by the
Calderbank-Shor-Steane method.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider contractive systems whose trajectories evolve on a compact and
convex state-space. It is well-known that if the time-varying vector field of
the system is periodic then the system admits a unique globally asymptotically
stable periodic solution. Obtaining explicit information on this periodic
solution and its dependence on various parameters is important both
theoretically and in numerous applications. We develop an approach for
approximating such a periodic trajectory using the periodic trajectory of a
simpler system (e.g. an LTI system). Our approximation includes an error bound
that is based on the input-to-state stability property of contractive systems.
We show that in some cases this error bound can be computed explicitly. We also
use the bound to derive a new theoretical result, namely, that a contractive
system with an additive periodic input behaves like a low pass filter. We
demonstrate our results using several examples from systems biology.

 <dc:description>  Advances in natural language processing tasks have gained momentum in recent
years due to the increasingly popular neural network methods. In this paper, we
explore deep learning techniques for answering multi-step reasoning questions
that operate on semi-structured tables. Challenges here arise from the level of
logical compositionality expressed by questions, as well as the domain
openness. Our approach is weakly supervised, trained on question-answer-table
triples without requiring intermediate strong supervision. It performs two
phases: first, machine understandable logical forms (programs) are generated
from natural language questions following the work of [Pasupat and Liang,
2015]. Second, paraphrases of logical forms and questions are embedded in a
jointly learned vector space using word and character convolutional neural
networks. A neural scoring function is further used to rank and retrieve the
most probable logical form (interpretation) of a question. Our best single
model achieves 34.8% accuracy on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, while the best
ensemble of our models pushes the state-of-the-art score on this task to 38.7%,
thus slightly surpassing both the engineered feature scoring baseline, as well
as the Neural Programmer model of [Neelakantan et al., 2016].

 <dc:description>  We study the parsing complexity of Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) in
the formalism of Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994). As our main result, we prove
that any parsing algorithm for this formalism will necessarily take exponential
time when the size of the grammar, and not only the length of the input
sentence, is included in the analysis. This result sets the formalism of
Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994) apart from weakly equivalent formalisms such as
Tree-Adjoining Grammar (TAG), for which parsing can be performed in time
polynomial in the combined size of grammar and input sentence. Our proof
highlights important differences between the formalism of Vijay-Shanker and
Weir (1994) and contemporary incarnations of CCG.

 <dc:description>  A Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is defined by its unique characteristics
involving both the cyber and physical domains. Their hybrid nature introduces
new attack vectors, but also provides an opportunity to design new security
defenses. In this paper, we present a new domain-specific security mechanism,
FIRED, that leverages physical properties such as inertia of the CPS to improve
security.
  FIRED is simple to describe and implement. It goes through two operations:
Reset and Diversify, as frequently as possible -- typically in the order of
seconds or milliseconds. The combined effect of these operations is that
attackers are unable to gain persistent control of the system. The CPS stays
safe and stable even under frequent resets because of the inertia present.
Further, resets simplify certain diversification mechanisms and makes them
feasible to implement in CPSs with limited computing resources.
  We evaluate our idea on two real-world systems: an engine management unit of
a car and a flight controller of a quadcopter. Roughly speaking, these two
systems provide typical and extreme operational requirements for evaluating
FIRED in terms of stability, algorithmic complexity, and safety requirements.
We show that FIRED provides robust security guarantees against hijacking
attacks and persistent CPS threats. We find that our defense is suitable for
emerging CPS such as commodity unmanned vehicles that are currently unregulated
and cost sensitive.

 <dc:description>  Metric learning methods for dimensionality reduction in combination with
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) have been extensively deployed in many
classification, data embedding, and information retrieval applications.
However, most of these approaches involve pairwise training data comparisons,
and thus have quadratic computational complexity with respect to the size of
training set, preventing them from scaling to fairly big datasets. Moreover,
during testing, comparing test data against all the training data points is
also expensive in terms of both computational cost and resources required.
Furthermore, previous metrics are either too constrained or too expressive to
be well learned. To effectively solve these issues, we present an
exemplar-centered supervised shallow parametric data embedding model, using a
Maximally Collapsing Metric Learning (MCML) objective. Our strategy learns a
shallow high-order parametric embedding function and compares training/test
data only with learned or precomputed exemplars, resulting in a cost function
with linear computational complexity for both training and testing. We also
empirically demonstrate, using several benchmark datasets, that for
classification in two-dimensional embedding space, our approach not only gains
speedup of kNN by hundreds of times, but also outperforms state-of-the-art
supervised embedding approaches.

 <dc:description>  Location-based augmented reality games have entered the mainstream with the
nearly overnight success of Niantic's Pok\'emon Go. Unlike traditional video
games, the fact that players of such games carry out actions in the external,
physical world to accomplish in-game objectives means that the large-scale
adoption of such games motivate people, en masse, to do things and go places
they would not have otherwise done in unprecedented ways. The social
implications of such mass-mobilisation of individual players are, in general,
difficult to anticipate or characterise, even for the short-term. In this work,
we focus on disaster relief, and the short- and long-term implications that a
proliferation of AR games like Pok\'emon Go, may have in disaster-prone regions
of the world. We take a distributed cognition approach and focus on one natural
disaster-prone region of New Zealand, the city of Wellington.

 <dc:description>  A $(t, s, v)$-all-or-nothing transform is a bijective mapping defined on
$s$-tuples over an alphabet of size $v$, which satisfies the condition that the
values of any $t$ input co-ordinates are completely undetermined, given only
the values of any $s-t$ output co-ordinates. The main question we address in
this paper is: for which choices of parameters does a $(t, s,
v)$-all-or-nothing transform (AONT) exist? More specifically, if we fix $t$ and
$v$, we want to determine the maximum integer $s$ such that a $(t, s, v)$-AONT
exists. We mainly concentrate on the case $t=2$ for arbitrary values of $v$,
where we obtain various necessary as well as sufficient conditions for
existence of these objects. We consider both linear and general (linear or
nonlinear) AONT. We also show some connections between AONT, orthogonal arrays
and resilient functions.

 <dc:description>  A semiorder is a model of preference relations where each element $x$ is
associated with a utility value $\alpha(x)$, and there is a threshold $t$ such
that $y$ is preferred to $x$ iff $\alpha(y) &gt; \alpha(x)+t$. These are motivated
by the notion that there is some uncertainty in the utility values we assign an
object or that a subject may be unable to distinguish a preference between
objects whose values are close. However, they fail to model the well-known
phenomenon that preferences are not always transitive. Also, if we are
uncertain of the utility values, it is not logical that preference is
determined absolutely by a comparison of them with an exact threshold. We
propose a new model in which there are two thresholds, $t_1$ and $t_2$; if the
difference $\alpha(y) - \alpha(x)$ less than $t_1$, then $y$ is not preferred
to $x$; if the difference is greater than $t_2$ then $y$ is preferred to $x$;
if it is between $t_1$ and $t_2$, then then $y$ may or may not be preferred to
$x$. We call such a relation a double-threshold semiorder, and the
corresponding directed graph $G = (V,E)$ a double threshold digraph. Every
directed acyclic graph is a double threshold graph; bounds on $t_2/t_1$ give a
nested hierarchy of subclasses of the directed acyclic graphs. In this paper we
characterize the subclasses in terms of forbidden subgraphs, and give
algorithms for finding an assignment of of utility values that explains the
relation in terms of a given $(t_1,t_2)$ or else produces a forbidden subgraph,
and finding the minimum value $\lambda$ of $t_2/t_1$ that is satisfiable for a
given directed acyclic graph. We show that $\lambda$ gives a measure of the
complexity of a directed acyclic graph with respect to several optimization
problems that are NP-hard on arbitrary directed acyclic graphs.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Macdonald et. al. showed that many algorithmic problems for
finitely generated nilpotent groups including computation of normal forms, the
subgroup membership problem, the conjugacy problem, and computation of subgroup
presentations can be done in Logspace. Here we follow their approach and show
that all these problems are complete for the uniform circuit class TC^0 -
uniformly for all r-generated nilpotent groups of class at most c for fixed r
and c. In order to solve these problems in TC^0, we show that the unary version
of the extended gcd problem (compute greatest common divisors and express them
as linear combinations) is in TC^0. Moreover, if we allow a certain binary
representation of the inputs, then the word problem and computation of normal
forms is still in uniform TC^0, while all the other problems we examine are
shown to be TC^0-Turing reducible to the binary extended gcd problem.

 <dc:description>  Photography usually requires optics in conjunction with a recording device
(an image sensor). Eliminating the optics could lead to new form factors for
cameras. Here, we report a simple demonstration of imaging using a bare CMOS
sensor that utilizes computation. The technique relies on the space variant
point-spread functions resulting from the interaction of a point source in the
field of view with the image sensor. These space-variant point-spread functions
are combined with a reconstruction algorithm in order to image simple objects
displayed on a discrete LED array as well as on an LCD screen. We extended the
approach to video imaging at the native frame rate of the sensor. Finally, we
performed experiments to analyze the parametric impact of the object distance.
Improving the sensor designs and reconstruction algorithms can lead to useful
cameras without optics.

 <dc:title>On Interpolation and Symbol Elimination in Theory Extensions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sofronie-Stokkermans, Viorica</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we study possibilities of interpolation and symbol elimination
in extensions of a theory ${\cal T}_0$ with additional function symbols whose
properties are axiomatised using a set of clauses. We analyze situations in
which we can perform such tasks in a hierarchical way, relying on existing
mechanisms for symbol elimination in ${\cal T}_0$. This is for instance
possible if the base theory allows quantifier elimination. We analyze
possibilities of extending such methods to situations in which the base theory
does not allow quantifier elimination but has a model completion which does. We
illustrate the method on various examples.

 <dc:description>  We characterize the practical photon-counting receiver in optical scattering
communication with finite sampling rate and electrical noise. In the receiver
side, the detected signal can be characterized as a series of pulses generated
by photon-multiplier (PMT) detector and held by the pulse-holding circuits,
which are then sampled by the analog-to-digit convertor (ADC) with finite
sampling rate and counted by a rising-edge pulse detector. However, the finite
small pulse width incurs the dead time effect that may lead to sub-Poisson
distribution on the recorded pulses. We analyze first-order and second-order
moments on the number of recorded pulses with finite sampling rate at the
receiver side under two cases where the sampling period is shorter than or
equal to the pulse width as well as longer than the pulse width. Moreover, we
adopt the maximum likelihood (ML) detection. In order to simplify the analysis,
we adopt binomial distribution approximation on the number of recorded pulses
in each slot. A tractable holding time and decision threshold selection rule is
provided aiming to maximize the minimal Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between
the two distributions. The performance of proposed sub-Poisson distribution and
the binomial approximation are verified by the experimental results. The
equivalent arrival rate and holding time predicted by the of sub-Poisson model
and the associated proposed binomial distribution on finite sampling rate and
the electrical noise are validated by the simulation results. The proposed the
holding time and decision threshold selection rule performs close to the
optimal one.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing interest in the use of millimeter wave bands for 5G
cellular systems comes renewed interest in resource sharing. Properties of
millimeter wave bands such as massive bandwidth, highly directional antennas,
high penetration loss, and susceptibility to shadowing, suggest technical
advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing in millimeter wave cellular
networks. However, technical advantages do not necessarily translate to
increased profit for service providers, or increased consumer surplus. In this
paper, detailed network simulations are used to better understand the economic
implications of resource sharing in a vertically differentiated duopoly market
for cellular service. The results suggest that resource sharing is less often
profitable for millimeter wave service providers compared to microwave cellular
service providers, and does not necessarily increase consumer surplus.

 <dc:description>  We revisit the high-dimensional content identification with lossy recovery
problem (Tuncel and G\&quot;und\&quot;uz, 2014) and establish an exponential strong
converse theorem. As a corollary of the exponential strong converse theorem, we
derive an upper bound on the joint identification-error and excess-distortion
exponent for the problem. Our main results can be specialized to the
biometrical identification problem~(Willems, 2003) and the content
identification problem~(Tuncel, 2009) since these two problems are both special
cases of the content identification with lossy recovery problem. We leverage
the information spectrum method introduced by Oohama and adapt the strong
converse techniques therein to be applicable to the problem at hand.

 <dc:description>  In this study, the authors develop a structural model that combines a macro
diffusion model with a micro choice model to control for the effect of social
influence on the mobile app choices of customers over app stores. Social
influence refers to the density of adopters within the proximity of other
customers. Using a large data set from an African app store and Bayesian
estimation methods, the authors quantify the effect of social influence and
investigate the impact of ignoring this process in estimating customer choices.
The findings show that customer choices in the app store are explained better
by offline than online density of adopters and that ignoring social influence
in estimations results in biased estimates. Furthermore, the findings show that
the mobile app adoption process is similar to adoption of music CDs, among all
other classic economy goods. A counterfactual analysis shows that the app store
can increase its revenue by 13.6% through a viral marketing policy (e.g., a
sharing with friends and family button).

 <dc:description>  Binary Knapsack Problem (BKP) is to select a subset of an element (item) set
with the highest value while keeping the total weight within the capacity of
the knapsack. This paper presents an integer programming model for a variation
of BKP where the value of each element may depend on selecting or ignoring
other elements. Strengths of such Value-Related Dependencies are assumed to be
imprecise and hard to specify. To capture this imprecision, we have proposed
modeling value-related dependencies using fuzzy graphs and their algebraic
structure.

 <dc:description>  Real-time monitoring and responses to emerging public health threats rely on
the availability of timely surveillance data. During the early stages of an
epidemic, the ready availability of line lists with detailed tabular
information about laboratory-confirmed cases can assist epidemiologists in
making reliable inferences and forecasts. Such inferences are crucial to
understand the epidemiology of a specific disease early enough to stop or
control the outbreak. However, construction of such line lists requires
considerable human supervision and therefore, difficult to generate in
real-time. In this paper, we motivate Guided Deep List, the first tool for
building automated line lists (in near real-time) from open source reports of
emerging disease outbreaks. Specifically, we focus on deriving epidemiological
characteristics of an emerging disease and the affected population from reports
of illness. Guided Deep List uses distributed vector representations (ala
word2vec) to discover a set of indicators for each line list feature. This
discovery of indicators is followed by the use of dependency parsing based
techniques for final extraction in tabular form. We evaluate the performance of
Guided Deep List against a human annotated line list provided by HealthMap
corresponding to MERS outbreaks in Saudi Arabia. We demonstrate that Guided
Deep List extracts line list features with increased accuracy compared to a
baseline method. We further show how these automatically extracted line list
features can be used for making epidemiological inferences, such as inferring
demographics and symptoms-to-hospitalization period of affected individuals.

 <dc:description>  With the tremendous increase of the Internet traffic, achieving the best
performance with limited resources is becoming an extremely urgent problem. In
order to address this concern, in this paper, we build an optimization problem
which aims to maximize the total utility of traffic flows with the capacity
constraint of nodes and links in the network. Based on Duality Theory, we
propose an iterative algorithm which adjusts the rates of traffic flows and
capacity of nodes and links simultaneously to maximize the total utility.
Simulation results show that our algorithm performs better than the NUP
algorithm on BA and ER network models, which has shown to get the best
performance so far. Since our research combines the topology information with
capacity constraint, it may give some insights for resource allocation in real
communication networks.

 <dc:description>  Children can use the statistical regularities of their environment to learn
word meanings, a mechanism known as cross-situational learning. We take a
computational approach to investigate how the information present during each
observation in a cross-situational framework can affect the overall acquisition
of word meanings. We do so by formulating various in-the-moment learning
mechanisms that are sensitive to different statistics of the environment, such
as counts and conditional probabilities. Each mechanism introduces a unique
source of competition or mutual exclusivity bias to the model; the mechanism
that maximally uses the model's knowledge of word meanings performs the best.
Moreover, the gap between this mechanism and others is amplified in more
challenging learning scenarios, such as learning from few examples.

 <dc:description>  Cascades on online networks have been a popular subject of study in the past
decade, and there is a considerable literature on phenomena such as diffusion
mechanisms, virality, cascade prediction, and peer network effects. However, a
basic question has received comparatively little attention: how desirable are
cascades on a social media platform from the point of view of users? While
versions of this question have been considered from the perspective of the
producers of cascades, any answer to this question must also take into account
the effect of cascades on their audience. In this work, we seek to fill this
gap by providing a consumer perspective of cascade.
  Users on online networks play the dual role of producers and consumers.
First, we perform an empirical study of the interaction of Twitter users with
retweet cascades. We measure how often users observe retweets in their home
timeline, and observe a phenomenon that we term the &quot;Impressions Paradox&quot;: the
share of impressions for cascades of size k decays much slower than frequency
of cascades of size k. Thus, the audience for cascades can be quite large even
for rare large cascades. We also measure audience engagement with retweet
cascades in comparison to non-retweeted content. Our results show that cascades
often rival or exceed organic content in engagement received per impression.
This result is perhaps surprising in that consumers didn't opt in to see tweets
from these authors. Furthermore, although cascading content is widely popular,
one would expect it to eventually reach parts of the audience that may not be
interested in the content. Motivated by our findings, we posit a theoretical
model that focuses on the effect of cascades on the audience. Our results on
this model highlight the balance between retweeting as a high-quality content
selection mechanism and the role of network users in filtering irrelevant
content.

 <dc:description>  Colorization of grayscale images has been a hot topic in computer vision.
Previous research mainly focuses on producing a colored image to match the
original one. However, since many colors share the same gray value, an input
grayscale image could be diversely colored while maintaining its reality. In
this paper, we design a novel solution for unsupervised diverse colorization.
Specifically, we leverage conditional generative adversarial networks to model
the distribution of real-world item colors, in which we develop a fully
convolutional generator with multi-layer noise to enhance diversity, with
multi-layer condition concatenation to maintain reality, and with stride 1 to
keep spatial information. With such a novel network architecture, the model
yields highly competitive performance on the open LSUN bedroom dataset. The
Turing test of 80 humans further indicates our generated color schemes are
highly convincible.

 <dc:description>  Derivational morphology is a fundamental and complex characteristic of
language. In this paper we propose the new task of predicting the derivational
form of a given base-form lemma that is appropriate for a given context. We
present an encoder--decoder style neural network to produce a derived form
character-by-character, based on its corresponding character-level
representation of the base form and the context. We demonstrate that our model
is able to generate valid context-sensitive derivations from known base forms,
but is less accurate under a lexicon agnostic setting.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a method by which a generative model learning the joint
distribution between actions and future states can be used to automatically
infer a control scheme for any desired reward function, which may be altered on
the fly without retraining the model. In this method, the problem of action
selection is reduced to one of gradient descent on the latent space of the
generative model, with the model itself providing the means of evaluating
outcomes and finding the gradient, much like how the reward network in Deep
Q-Networks (DQN) provides gradient information for the action generator. Unlike
DQN or Actor-Critic, which are conditional models for a specific reward, using
a generative model of the full joint distribution permits the reward to be
changed on the fly. In addition, the generated futures can be inspected to gain
insight in to what the network 'thinks' will happen, and to what went wrong
when the outcomes deviate from prediction.

 <dc:title>Discussion quality diffuses in the digital public square</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Studies of online social influence have demonstrated that friends have
important effects on many types of behavior in a wide variety of settings.
However, we know much less about how influence works among relative strangers
in digital public squares, despite important conversations happening in such
spaces. We present the results of a study on large public Facebook pages where
we randomly used two different methods--most recent and social feedback--to
order comments on posts. We find that the social feedback condition results in
higher quality viewed comments and response comments. After measuring the
average quality of comments written by users before the study, we find that
social feedback has a positive effect on response quality for both low and high
quality commenters. We draw on a theoretical framework of social norms to
explain this empirical result. In order to examine the influence mechanism
further, we measure the similarity between comments viewed and written during
the study, finding that similarity increases for the highest quality
contributors under the social feedback condition. This suggests that, in
addition to norms, some individuals may respond with increased relevance to
high-quality comments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the convergence and consistency properties of
an Invariant-Extended Kalman Filter (RI-EKF) based Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. Basic convergence properties of this algorithm
are proven. These proofs do not require the restrictive assumption that the
Jacobians of the motion and observation models need to be evaluated at the
ground truth. It is also shown that the output of RI-EKF is invariant under any
stochastic rigid body transformation in contrast to $\mathbb{SO}(3)$ based EKF
SLAM algorithm ($\mathbb{SO}(3)$-EKF) that is only invariant under
deterministic rigid body transformation. Implications of these invariance
properties on the consistency of the estimator are also discussed. Monte Carlo
simulation results demonstrate that RI-EKF outperforms $\mathbb{SO}(3)$-EKF,
Robocentric-EKF and the &quot;First Estimates Jacobian&quot; EKF, for 3D point feature
based SLAM.

 <dc:description>  The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the
American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that
measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation,
unemployment, and other demographic factors. Although a comprehensive source of
data, the lag between demographic changes and their appearance in the ACS can
exceed half a decade. As digital imagery becomes ubiquitous and machine vision
techniques improve, automated data analysis may provide a cheaper and faster
alternative. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends
from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by
Google Street View cars. Using deep learning-based computer vision techniques,
we determined the make, model, and year of all motor vehicles encountered in
particular neighborhoods. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which
enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used
to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with
single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately
1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful.
For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive
through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely
to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance);
otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%). Our results suggest that
automated systems for monitoring demographic trends may effectively complement
labor-intensive approaches, with the potential to detect trends with fine
spatial resolution, in close to real time.

 <dc:title>Faster Mutation Analysis via Equivalence Modulo States</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Mutation analysis has many applications, such as asserting the quality of
test suites and localizing faults. One important bottleneck of mutation
analysis is scalability. The latest work explores the possibility of reducing
the redundant execution via split-stream execution. However, split-stream
execution is only able to remove redundant execution before the first mutated
statement.
  In this paper we try to also reduce some of the redundant execution after the
execution of the first mutated statement. We observe that, although many
mutated statements are not equivalent, the execution result of those mutated
statements may still be equivalent to the result of the original statement. In
other words, the statements are equivalent modulo the current state.
  In this paper we propose a fast mutation analysis approach, AccMut. AccMut
automatically detects the equivalence modulo states among a statement and its
mutations, then groups the statements into equivalence classes modulo states,
and uses only one process to represent each class. In this way, we can
significantly reduce the number of split processes. Our experiments show that
our approach can further accelerate mutation analysis on top of split-stream
execution with a speedup of 2.56x on average.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive system model of a wireless-powered
sensor network (WPSN) based on experimental results on a real-life testbed. In
the WPSN, a sensor node is wirelessly powered by the RF energy transfer from a
dedicated RF power source. We define the behavior of each component comprising
the WPSN and analyze the interaction between these components to set up a
realistic WPSN model from the systematic point of view. Towards this, we
implement a real-life and full-fledged testbed for the WPSN and conduct
extensive experiments to obtain model parameters and to validate the proposed
model. Based on this WPSN model, we propose an energy management scheme for the
WPSN, which maximizes RF energy transfer efficiency while guaranteeing energy
neutral operation. We implement the proposed energy management scheme in a real
testbed and show its operation and performance.
