 <dc:description>  The mathematical distinction between prose and verse may be detected in
writings that are not apparently lineated, for example in T. S. Eliot's &quot;Burnt
Norton&quot;, and Jim Crace's &quot;Quarantine&quot;. In this paper we offer comments on
appropriate statistical methods for such work, and also on the nature of formal
innovation in these two texts. Additional remarks are made on the roots of
lineation as a metrical form, and on the prose-verse continuum.

 <dc:description>  We have recently built a database system called BODHI, intended to store
plant bio-diversity information. It is based on an object-oriented modeling
approach and is developed completely around public-domain software. The unique
feature of BODHI is that it seamlessly integrates diverse types of data,
including taxonomic characteristics, spatial distributions, and genetic
sequences, thereby spanning the entire range from molecular to organism-level
information. A variety of sophisticated indexing strategies are incorporated to
efficiently access the various types of data, and a rule-based query processor
is employed for optimizing query execution. In this paper, we report on our
experiences in building BODHI and on its performance characteristics for a
representative set of queries.

 <dc:title>Open Access beyond cable: The case of Interactive TV</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we analyze the development of interactive TV in the U.S. and
Western Europe. We argue that despite the nascent character of the market there
are important regulatory issues at stake, as exemplified by the AOL/TW merger
and the British Interactive Broadcasting case. Absent rules that provide for
non-discriminatory access to network components (including terminal equipment
specifications), dominant platform operators are likely to leverage ownership
of delivery infrastructure into market power over interactive TV services.
While integration between platform operator, service provider and terminal
vendor may facilitate the introduction of services in the short-term, the
lasting result will be a collection of fragmented &quot;walled gardens&quot; offering
limited content and applications. Would interactive TV develop under such
model, the exciting opportunities for broad-based innovation and extended
access to multiple information, entertainment and educational services opened
by the new generation of broadcasting technologies will be foregone

 <dc:description>  Alarm correlation plays an important role in improving the service and
reliability in modern telecommunications networks. Most previous research of
alarm correlation didn't consider the effect of noise data in Database. This
paper focuses on the method of discovering alarm correlation rules from
database containing noise data. We firstly define two parameters Win_freq and
Win_add as the measure of noise data and then present the Robust_search
algorithm to solve the problem. At different size of Win_freq and Win_add,
experiments with alarm data containing noise data show that the Robust_search
Algorithm can discover the more rules with the bigger size of Win_add. We also
experimentally compare two different interestingness measures of confidence and
correlation.

 <dc:title>PUC Autonomy and Policy Innovation: Local Telephone Competition in

 <dc:description>  In the pre-divestiture era, the regulatory environment in the U.S. was fairly
uniform and harmonious with the FCC setting the course and the accommodative
state PUCs making corresponding changes in their own policies. The divestiture
fractured this monolithic system as it forced the PUCs to respond to new forces
unleashed in their own backyards. Soon there was great diversity in the overall
regulatory landscape. Within this new environment, there is considerable
disparity among the PUCs in terms of their ability to implement new ideas. This
paper seeks to understand the structural factors that influence the latitude of
regulatory action by PUCs via a comparative study of local telephone
competition policy making in Arkansas and New York. The analysis suggests that
the presence or absence of countervailing forces determines the relative
autonomy the PUCs enjoy and thereby their ability to introduce new ideas into
their states.

 <dc:description>  ENUM creates many new market opportunities and raises several important
policy issues related to the implementation and administration of the ENUM
database and services. Recent World Telecommunications Policy Forum 2001 dealt
with the emergence of ENUM as an important numbering issue of IP telephony.
This paper prepares some important emerging issues of ENUM administration and
policy by taking an empirical research approach from the bottom up.
  We will identify potential key ENUM services, and estimating the size of the
service market opportunities created by the availability of PSTN-IP addressing
and mapping mechanisms, particularly in the context of IP telephony. Also, we
analyze the possible administrative models and relationship scenarios among
different ENUM players such as Registry(ies), Registrars, Telephone Service
Providers, ENUM Application Service Providers, etc. Then, we will assess the
effects of various administrative model architectures of ENUM service by
looking at the market opportunities and motivations of the players. From the
empirical findings, we will draw the implications on transactions among
different kinds of ENUM service providers. Finally, the results of the model
analysis will be used for the discussion of policy related issues around the
ENUM and IP telephony services.

 <dc:title>Product Cycle, Wintelism, and Cross-national Production Networks (CPN)

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.6.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Focusing on the telecom manufacturing industry in China, this paper contends
that the existing literature needs to be expanded in order to explain the
Chinese case. First, product cycle theory could be applied to explain
multinational corporations' strategies of importing and localizing their
products in China in order to take advantage of lower labor costs and often
more significantly to break barriers to the Chinese market. Second, there are
no significant indicators pointing to local multinational subsidiaries and
indigenous manufacturers serving as a substantial part of the cross-national
production networks in the global telecom industry yet, although there are some
signs of potential development. Third, the success of &quot;Wintelism&quot; and the
maturity of cross-national production networks in the global market have had
significant impacts on China's indigenous industry.

 <dc:description>  While traditional radio stations are subject to extensive government
regulations, Internet radio stations remain largely unregulated. As Internet
radio usage has increased certain stakeholders have begun to argue that these
Internet radio broadcasters are providing significant and diverse programming
to American audiences and that government regulation of spectrum-using radio
station ownership may be further relaxed.
  One of the primary justifications for regulation of ownership has been to
protect diversity in broadcasting. This study hypothesizes that Internet radio
broadcasting does add diversity to the radio broadcasting industry and that it
should be considered as relevant by regulators.
  This study evaluates the role of Internet radio broadcasters according to
five criteria intended to gauge the level of diversity being delivered to
listeners online. By measuring the levels of format, channel, ownership,
location and language diversity among Internet radio stations, it is possible
to draw benchmark lessons about the new medium's ability to provide Americans
with diverse broadcasting options.
  The study finds that Internet radio broadcasters are in fact adding
measurable diversity to the radio broadcasting industry. Internet broadcasters
are providing audiences with access to an increasing number of stations,
owners, formats, and language choices, and it is likely that technologies
aiding in the mobility of access as well as broadband evolution will reinforce
these findings.

 <dc:title>Between a rock and a hard place: assessing the application of domestic

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  South Africa adopted the GATS Basic Agreement on Telecommunications and the
regulatory principles in 1998. Obligations undertaken by South Africa mirrored
the framework for the gradual telecommunications reform process that was begun
in 1996. In the light of two threatened actions for anti-competitive practices
in violation of the Agreement, this paper reviews the nature of the commitments
undertaken by South Africa and assesses the country's compliance to date. This
paper also seeks to explore the tension that arises between domestic policy
reforms and international trade aspirations. It is argued that the dynamic
produced through this tension affords domestic governments a mechanism with
which to balance the seemingly opposing goals of competition and development.
It is further argued that the broad regulatory principles, adopted by all
signatories and often criticized for lack of precision, facilitate this fine
balancing and affords domestic governments an opportunity to advance sovereign
concerns while pursuing international trade ideals.

 <dc:title>Competition and Commons: The Post-Telecom Act Public Interest, in and

 <dc:creator>Aufderheide, Patricia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In asserting a competitive market environment as a justification for
regulatory forbearance, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 finally articulated
a clear standard for the FCC's public interest standard, one of the most
protean concepts in communications. This seeming clarity has not, however,
inhibited intense political conflict over the term. This paper examines public
and regulatory debate over the AOL Time Warner merger as an example of the way
in which the linkage between competitions and commons policy becomes relevant
to communications policy, particularly in relation to mass media, and discusses
interpretations of the public interest in the current FCC. The paper proposes
that the Telecom Act's goal of fostering economic competition among information
service providers, and the democratic ideal of nurturing public relationships
and behaviors can be linked. Competition policy that creates the opportunity
for untrammeled interactivity also provides a sine qua non to nurture the
social phenomenon of the commons. The linked concepts of competition and
commons could also provide useful ways to interpret the public interest in
policy arenas as spectrum allocation and intellectual property.

 <dc:title>Signing Initiative Petitions Online: Possibilities, Problems and

 <dc:description>  Many people expect the Internet to change American politics, most likely in
the direction of increasing direct citizen participation and forcing government
officials to respond more quickly to voter concerns. A recent California
initiative with these objectives would authorize use of encrypted digital
signatures over the Internet to qualify candidates, initiatives, and other
ballot measures. Proponents of Internet signature gathering say it will
significantly lower the cost of qualifying initiatives and thereby reduce the
influence of organized, well-financed interest groups. They also believe it
will increase both public participation in the political process and public
understanding about specific measures. However, opponents question whether
Internet security is adequate to prevent widespread abuse and argue that the
measure would create disadvantages for those who lack access to the Internet.
Beyond issues of security, cost, and access lie larger questions about the
effects of Internet signature gathering on direct democracy. Would it encourage
greater and more informed public participation in the political process? Or
would it flood voters with ballot measures and generally worsen current
problems with the initiative process itself? Because we lack good data on these
questions, answers to them today are largely conjectural. We can be fairly
sure, however, that Internet petition signing, like Internet voting, will have
unintended consequences.

 <dc:description>  A critical element of most national telecom policy objectives is advancing
universal service. In a multi-operator context, this is usually operationalized
through Universal Service Obligations (USO), by which various operators are
mandated to provide a part of their services to rural areas or to high cost to
serve customers at &quot;affordable&quot; prices.
  This paper highlights the various issues in USO from a developing country
perspective. The first part of this paper gives an overview of USO practices
and issues. The second part reviews the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's
recommendations on USO cost estimation. In the third part, the paper analyzes
characteristics of rural exchanges with a view to evolve a framework for
assessing USO. This framework is applicable to developing countries as the
study carried out in this paper is in the context of a developing country
characterized by low telecom penetration and non-availability of data with
regulators.

 <dc:description>  Internet technology should eventually provide important improvements over
established media not only in the efficiency of broadband delivery, and of
particularimportance, in the efficiency of business models that can be used to
collect money for that programming. I identify five economic characteristics of
Internet technology that should lead to these greater efficiencies: (1) lower
delivery costs and reduced capacity constraints, (2) more efficient
interactivity, (3) more efficient advertising and sponsorship, (4) more
efficient direct pricing and bundling, and (5) lower costs of copying and
sharing.
  The most successful Internet TV business models are likely to involve
syndication to or from other media, and also international distribution. In the
broader context, Internet TV is another syndication outlet by which program
suppliers can segment their overall markets and thus support higher production
investments. Many innovative and more sharply focused programs will surely
prosper on Internet TV, but the attractiveness to audiences of high production
value programming will tend to advantage broad appeal programming, such as
Hollywood movies. Historical evidence about the performance of cable television
and videocassettes is presented to support these points.

 <dc:title>Globalization and Governance in Cyberspace: Mapping the Processes of
  Emergent Regime Formation in Global Information and Communications Policy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cogburn, Derrick L.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper develops a theoretical perspective on globalization and the
Information Society and combines it with a critical usage of international
regime theory as a heuristic for understanding the current historical period of
transition from an international telecommunicaitons regime (Cowhey, 1990; 1994)
to a new and complex regime aimed at providing governance for the Global
Information Infrastructure and Global Information Society (GII/GIS). In
analyzing the principles, values, norms, rules, collective decision-making
prdocedures, and enforcement mechanisms of the emergent GII/GIS regime, this
paper differentiates between three regime levels: (1) Macro-Regime--global; (2)
Mezzo-Regime--regional and sub-regional; and (3) Micro-Regime--national. The
paper employs a case-study approach to explore some of the specific national
responses (i.e. South Africa) to this regime transition, with an analysis of
potential best practices and lessons learned for other emerging economies. Key
findings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic,
and technological factors are eroding the existing international
telecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate
restructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new
regime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is
being driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by
the more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related
to global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at
national, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition
in both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative
response, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime.

 <dc:description>  Consumers value keeping some information about them private from potential
marketers. E-commerce dramatically increases the potential for marketers to
accumulate otherwise private information about potential customers. Online
marketers claim that this information enables them to better market their
products. Policy makers are currently drafting rules to regulate the way in
which these marketers can collect, store, and share this information. However,
there is little evidence yet either of consumers' valuation of their privacy or
of the benefits they might reap through better target marketing. We provide a
framework for measuring a portion of the benefits from allowing marketers to
make better use of consumer information. Target marketing is likely to reduce
consumer search costs, improve consumer product selection decisions, and lower
the marketing costs of goods sold. Our model allows us to estimate the value to
consumers of only the latter, price reductions from more efficient marketing.

 <dc:title>Monopoly Power on the Web - A Preliminary Investigation of Search
  Engines</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  E-Commerce challenges traditional approaches to assessing monopolistic
practices due to the rapid rate of growth, rapid change in technology,
difficulty in assessing market share for information products like web sites,
and high degree of interconnectivity and alliance formation among corporations.
This paper has provided a fundamental framework that integrates a network and
economic perspective to the search engine market.
  The findings indicate that (1) despite an increasing number of search
engines, barriers to entry seem high, largely due to the exponential growth in
the number of web sites and the non-scalability of the current search
technology and collective switching costs; (2) older search engine sites tend
typically to have more features to lock in users. Using standard economic
indicators (CR4=58% and HHI=1163), the industry looks close to being plagued by
anticompetitive practices. But based on a network adjusted HHI constructed in
this paper, its value, 870, suggests that there is less cause for concern.
  Based on all indicators, it suggests that Yahoo would be a contender. Other
possible contenders are MSN and Netscape. On the basis of results to date, some
search engines keep increasing their audience reach while others don't. The
trend shows that some search engines may dominate the search engine market. We
suggest conducting research in the coverage performance of search engines and
investigate &quot;information search cost&quot; as a performance indicator of search
techniques. In addition, we suggest paying attention to any anticompetitive
conduct (e.g. product bundling) that may lesson competition and reduce consumer
welfare. The combination of network theory and economic theory to study the
search engine market is a particularly powerful approach for E-Commerce.

 <dc:description>  The issue of market-based versus mandated standards has been addressed in
many settings. In most settings in which network effects are present,
compatibility across platforms has been a key determinant of the success or
failure of a particular technology. In the case of wireless telecommunications,
however, interconnection and the availability of the relevant infrastructure
can be a substitute for compatibility.
  In this paper, we examine the tradeoff between mandated standards and
interconnection. We first provide institutional background; we then empirically
examine whether, other things being equal, penetration rates were lower (or
higher) for countries with multiple incompatible digital standards. We finally
discuss the implications of our results for the current debate about 3G
standards, in which CDMA2000, which is backed mainly by US firms, competes with
WCDMA, which is backed by the European Community.

 <dc:title>Ideological and Policy Origins of the Internet, 1957-1969</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Russell, Andrew L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper examines the ideological and policy consensus that shaped
computing research funded by the Information Processing Techniques Office
(IPTO) within the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA). This historical case study of the period between Sputnik and the
creation of the ARPANET shows how military, scientific, and academic values
shaped the institutions and relations of a foundational period in the creation
of the Internet.
  The paper probes three areas: the ideology of the science policy consensus,
the institutional philosophy of IPTO under J. C. R. Licklider, and the ways
that this consensus and philosophy shaped IPTO research in the period leading
to the creation of the ARPANET. By examining the intellectual, cultural, and
institutional details of the consensus that governed IPTO research between 1957
and 1969, we can understand the ways that these values defined the range of
possibilities for network computing.
  The influence of the social values expressed by these actors was decisive:
that government had an obligation to support a broad base of scientific
research to promote both the public good and the national defense; that
IPTO-sponsored computing research would accomplish both military and scientific
objectives; and that IPTO could leverage its power within this consensus to
create a network to share resources and unite researchers over geographical
distance. A greater awareness of the ways that &quot;consensus&quot; worked in this
period -- the &quot;pre-history&quot; of the Internet -- provides a richer context for
evaluating the unique features of the Internet, such as its open architecture,
collegial culture, and standards-based governance.

 <dc:title>Do Switching Costs Make Markets More or Less Competitive?: The Case of
  800-Number Portability</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Viard, V. Brian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Do switching costs reduce or intensify price competition in markets where
firms charge the same price to old and new consumers? Theoretically, the answer
could be either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no,&quot; due to two opposing incentives in firms' pricing
decisions. The firm would like to charge a higher price to previous purchasers
who are &quot;locked-in&quot; and a lower price to unattached consumers who offer higher
future profitability. I demonstrate this ambiguity in an infinite-horizon
theoretical model.
  800- (toll-free) number portability provides empirical evidence to answer
this question. Before portability, a customer had to change numbers to change
service providers. This imposed significant switching costs on users, who
generally invested heavily to publicize these numbers. In May 1993 a new
database made 800-numbers portable. This drop in switching costs and
regulations that precluded price discrimination between old and new consumers
provide an empirical test of switching costs' effect on price competition.
  I use contracts for virtual private network (VPN) services to test how AT&amp;T
adjusted its prices for toll-free services in response to portability.
Preliminarily (awaiting completion of data collection), I find that AT&amp;T
reduced margins for VPN contracts containing toll-free services relative to
those that did not as the portability date approached. This implies that the
switching costs due to non-portability made the market less competitive. These
results suggest that, despite toll-free services growing rapidly during this
time period, AT&amp;T's incentive to charge a higher price to &quot;locked-in&quot; consumers
exceeded its incentive to capture new consumers in the high switching costs era
of non-portability.

explaining Internet users' willingness to participate in social change agendas

 <dc:description>  The Internet is changing rapidly the way people around the world communicate,
learn, and work. Yet the tremendous benefits of the Internet are not shared
equally by all. One way to close the gap of the &quot;digital divide&quot; is to ensure
Internet access to all schools from an early age. While both the USA and EU
have embraced the promotion of Internet access to schools, the two have decided
to finance it differently. This paper shows that the main costs of Internet
access to schools are not communications-related (telecommunications and
Internet services) but rather non-communications-related (hardware, educational
training, software). This paper goes on to discuss whether the identified costs
should be financed in any way by the universal service obligations funded by
the telecommunications industry/sector/consumers (sector specific) or a general
governmental budget (educational budget).

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on the branching process for solving any constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP). A parametrised schema is proposed that (with
suitable instantiations of the parameters) can solve CSP's on both finite and
infinite domains. The paper presents a formal specification of the schema and a
statement of a number of interesting properties that, subject to certain
conditions, are satisfied by any instances of the schema.
  It is also shown that the operational procedures of many constraint systems
including cooperative systems) satisfy these conditions.
  Moreover, the schema is also used to solve the same CSP in different ways by
means of different instantiations of its parameters.

 <dc:description>  By combining persons around the world into a single market, the Internet may
serve as a substitute for urban agglomeration. That is, the Internet may level
the consumption playing field between large, variety-laden and small,
variety-starved markets. However, if local content on the Internet is more
prevalent in larger markets, then the Internet may be a complement for urban
agglomeration. Characterizing the nature of available content using Media
Metrix web page visits by about 13,500 households, we document that
substantially more online local content is available in larger markets.
Combining this with CPS Internet use data, we find statistically significant
direct evidence of both complementarity and substitutability: Individuals are
more likely to connect in markets with more local online content; and holding
local online content constant, are less likely to connect in larger markets. We
also find that individuals connect to overcome local isolation: Blacks are more
likely to connect, relative to whites, when they comprise a smaller fraction of
local population, making the Internet is a substitute for agglomeration of
preference minorities within cities, if not cities themselves. On balance we
find that the substitution and complementarity effects offset each other so
that the Internet does not promote or discourage agglomeration in larger
markets.

 <dc:description>  After the 1991 economic policy made a shift from a closed economic model to a
market-oriented model. The government invited private sector to participate in
reforming its telecom sector. However, the government took a half-hearted
approach in overhauling the legal and regulatory regime, suitable for
competitive regime or in framing the 1994 Telecom Policy.
  Competition was allowed in cellular and basis services. The ministry and the
incumbent (DOT) issued licenses to their competitors. Lack of transparency in
issuing licenses and unrealistic license fee derailed the reforms process and
led to wasteful litigation. The courts did not support the regulator and
virtually made its role redundant.

 <dc:title>Universal service, specific services on generic networks, some logic
  begins to emerge in the policy area</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It has proved to be difficult to translate the lessons from the literature on
universal service into the policy framework because of political interests and
regulatory capture. Neither the USA or Europe has made a very good job of
devising a clean framework and the WTO agreement is sparing in this area. A
number of pressures in the European context have enabled a more systematic
approach to emerge, that exploits the academic work. They include the need for
the European regulatory framework to encompass E. European countries where
network development and income levels are much lower, the desire to encompass
Internet within the universal service regulatory framework, a willingness to
design a framework that covers all communications networks and remove the
telecommunications bias, thereby forcing issues of economic neutrality to the
fore. The paper systematically goes through a number of key areas and
principles of regulation and how they are being designed to deal with a range
of national situations. They include, defining the scope of universal service
and the principles by which it might be modified in the light of technological
and economic developments; incorporating latitude for intervention outside this
defined scope, defining incentive and designation methods to encourage the
efficient supply of elements of universal service obligations, interpreting
affordability in the context of price and income levels that diverge
considerably, requiring both allocative efficiency and competitive neutrality,
formulating alternative financing methods including general government
financing and value added tax type methods which can co-exist and provide
comparative policy yardsticks.

 <dc:title>Commonalities: The R.E.A. and High-Speed Rural Internet Access</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Malone, Laurence J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper explores commonalities between the creation of the Rural
Electrification Administration and the similar dilemma of providing an
affordable infrastructure for high-speed Internet access in places where profit
incentives do not exist. In the case of the R.E.A., the necessity for an
aggressive federal initiative to wire rural America, where the market for
electricity had failed, is revisited as the missing incentives are identified
and explored. We then examine the incentive-poor similarities between rural
electrification and rural high-speed Internet access through how consumers
currently and prospectively gain access to broadband Internet service. The
regulatory environment created by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the
Federal Communications Commission is considered. Although the FCC is required
(Section 254.b.3) to take regulatory measures to ensure comparable and
affordable access to the Internet for all Americans, the historical
similarities and comparative analysis of rural electrification and high-speed
Internet access suggests the goal of universal service is unlikely to be met in
the near future. Regulatory disincentives to build such networks are present,
driven in part by market realities and in part by competitive restrictions in
the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Finally, we pose the question of whether a
federal effort equivalent to the R.E.A. is needed to ensure that residents of
sparsely populated areas, like their predecessors in the 1930s, are not
comparatively disadvantaged in the first decades of the 21st century. The paper
concludes with a proposal to accelerate the deployment of broadband
infrastructure in rural America.

 <dc:title>On the Use of Vickrey Auctions for Spectrum Allocation in Developing
  Countries</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Anandalingam, G.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we assess the applicability of auctions based on the Vickrey
second price model for allocating wireless spectrum in developing countries. We
first provide an overview of auction models for allocating resources. We then
examine the experience of auctioning spectrum in different countries. Based on
this examination, we posit some axioms that seem to have to be satisfied when
allocating spectrum in most developing countries. In light of these axioms, we
provide a critical evaluation of using Vickrey second- price auctions to
allocate spectrum in developing countries. We suggest the use of a new auction
mechanism, the Vickrey &quot;share auction&quot; which will satisfy many of these axioms.

 <dc:title>Voice over IP in the Local Exchange: A Case Study</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  There have been a small number of cost studies of Voice over IP (VoIP) in the
academic literature. Generally, they have been for abstract networks, have not
been focused on the public switched telephone network, or they have not
included the operating costs. This paper presents the operating cost portion of
our ongoing research project comparing circuit-switched and IP network costs
for an existing local exchange carrier.
  We have found that (1) The operating cost differential between IP and circuit
switching for this LEC will be small; and (2) A substantial majority of a
telco's operating cost lies in customer service and outside plant maintenance,
which will be incurred equally in both networks in a pure substitution
scenario. Thus, the operating cost difference lies in the actual cost
differences of the switching technologies. This appears to be less than 10%-15%
of the total operating cost of the network. Thus, even if the cost differences
for substitute services were large, the overall impact on the telco's financial
performance would be small. But IP has some hidden benefits on the operations
side. Most notably, data and voice services could be managed with the same
systems infrastructure, meaning that the incremental operations cost of rolling
out new services would likely be much lower, since it would all be IP.

 <dc:description>  Much of the existing approach to the digital divide suffers from an important
limitation. It is based on a binary classification of Internet use by only
considering whether someone is or is not an Internet user. To remedy this
shortcoming, this project looks at the differences in people's level of skill
with respect to finding information online. Findings suggest that people search
for content in a myriad of ways and there is a large variance in how long
people take to find various types of information online. Data are collected to
see how user demographics, users' social support networks, people's experience
with the medium, and their autonomy of use influence their level of user
sophistication.

 <dc:description>  Networks Unplugged: Towards A Model of Compatibility Regulation Between
Information Platforms This Article outlines a basic model for regulating
interoperability between rival information platforms. In so doing, it insists
that antitrust, intellectual property, and telecommunications regulation all
must follow the same set of principles to facilitate competition between rival
standards where possible, mandating or allowing cooperation only where
necessary to facilitate competition within a standard when network-level
competition is infeasible. To date, the antitrust regime best approximates the
type of model I have in mind, but sound competition policy requires that
telecommunications regulation and intellectual property law follow its basic
principles as well.

 <dc:description>  Rules are necessary to provide or shape the incentives of individuals and
organizations. This is particularly true when free markets lead to undesirable
outcomes. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 attempted to create incentives to
foster competition. Ambiguity as well as the timing of the Act has led to
delays in the clarification of rules and the rapid obsolescence of the
document. The paper presents the strategies that common carriers adopted to try
to tilt regulation in their favor, slow the entry of competitors, maintain
their market leadership, and expand into other segments. Some of the strategies
analyzed include lobbying efforts, court challenges, and lack of cooperation
with new entrants.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of complementing higher-order patterns without
repetitions of existential variables. Differently from the first-order case,
the complement of a pattern cannot, in general, be described by a pattern, or
even by a finite set of patterns. We therefore generalize the simply-typed
lambda-calculus to include an internal notion of strict function so that we can
directly express that a term must depend on a given variable. We show that, in
this more expressive calculus, finite sets of patterns without repeated
variables are closed under complement and intersection. Our principal
application is the transformational approach to negation in higher-order logic
programs.

 <dc:description>  The debate on the Information Society shows large agreement on the assumption
that the promised benefits will fully display only if the diffusion of ICTs and
the Internet will involve all the actors of the socio-economic system.
Accordingly, special emphasis is put on the participation of small and medium
enterprises (SMEs), but also on public administrations (PAs) as promoters and
catalysts of private initiatives. As for SMEs, public intervention concerns
both the promotion of fully competitive e-markets and the solution of market
failures. However, effective and efficient intervention requires specific
information on SMEs' approach to e-commerce, often depending upon specific
sector and local condition and in most cases still lacking. In order to
identify the need and the scope for public intervention, the paper focuses on a
peculiar SMEs-intensive productive environment: the manufacturing industrial
district, which traditionally constitutes an examples of winning SMEs' network,
characterised by common industrial culture and intense input-output
interactions. The paper presents empirical evidence from the Italian districts
of Como (textile industry) and Lumezzane (metalwork industry). The research
results show that pro-active entrepreneurs are creatively exploring the
opportunities offered by the Internet to promote their businesses. However, it
is also clear that the transition to the Internet economy still involves a
reduced percentage of potential participants, and that institutional actions
are needed in order to foster a larger participation.

 <dc:description>  Independent regulatory commissions such as the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) must produce policies that reflect technical expertise, legal
precedent, and stakeholder input. Given these situational imperatives, how does
the FCC implement independence in its decision-making? This research explicates
some of the underlying rules, resources, and relationships within the
environment in which the agency is embedded that influence agency work
practices to operationalize independence. Research such as this may be helpful
in the creation of new, or for assessment of existing, regulatory commissions,
but only if great attention is paid not only to institutional structure, but
also to the practice of staff in the agency.

 <dc:title>ICANN and Antitrust</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is a private
non-profit company which, pursuant to contracts with the US government, acts as
the de facto regulator for DNS policy. ICANN decides what TLDs will be made
available to users, and which registrars will be permitted to offer those TLDs
for sale. In this article we focus on a hitherto-neglected implication of
ICANN's assertion that it is a private rather than a public actor: its
potential liability under the U.S. antitrust laws, and the liability of those
who transact with it. ICANN argues that it is not as closely tied to the
government as NSI and IANA were in the days before ICANN was created. If this
is correct, it seems likely that ICANN will not benefit from the antitrust
immunity those actors enjoyed. Some of ICANN's regulatory actions may restrain
competition, e.g. its requirement that applicants for new gTLDs demonstrate
that their proposals would not enable competitive (alternate) roots and ICANN's
preventing certain types of non-price competition among registrars (requiring
the UDRP). ICANN's rule adoption process might be characterized as
anticompetitive collusion by existing registrars, who are likely not be subject
to the Noerr-Pennington lobbying exemption. Whether ICANN has in fact violated
the antitrust laws depends on whether it is an antitrust state actor, whether
the DNS is an essential facility, and on whether it can shelter under
precedents that protect standard-setting bodies. If (as seems likely) a private
ICANN and those who petition it are subject to antitrust law, everyone involved
in the process needs to review their conduct with an eye towards legal
liability. ICANN should act very differently with respect to both the UDRP and
the competitive roots if it is to avoid restraining trade.

 <dc:description>  Drawing on an ongoing longitudinal research study, we discuss problems in the
development of five next generation community networking projects in central
New York. The projects were funded under a state program to diffuse broadband
technologies in economically depressed areas of the state. The networks are
technologically complex and entail high costs for subscribers. The political
economy of the development process has biased the subscriber base toward the
resource rich and away from the resource poor, and toward tried-and-tested uses
like Internet and intra-organizational connectivity and away from
community-oriented uses. These trends raise troubling questions about network
ontology and function, and about the relation between the network and its
physical host community. The need for appropriate social policy, and new
planning practices, is argued to effect desired change.

 <dc:description>  The paper explains why open source software is an instance of a potentially
broader phenomenon. Specifically, I suggest that nonproprietary peer-production
of information and cultural materials will likely be a ubiquitous phenomenon in
a pervasively networked society. I describe a number of such enterprises, at
various stages of the information production value chain. These enterprises
suggest that incentives to engage in nonproprietary peer production are trivial
as long as enough contributors can be organized to contribute. This implies
that the limit on the reach of peer production efforts is the modularity,
granularity, and cost of integration of a good produced, not its total cost. I
also suggest reasons to think that peer-production can have systematic
advantages over both property-based markets and corporate managerial
hierarchies as a method of organizing information and cultural production in a
networked environment, because it is a better mechanism for clearing
information about human capital available to work on existing information
inputs to produce new outputs, and because it permits largers sets of agents to
use larger sets of resources where there are increasing returns to the scale of
both the set of agents and the set of resources available for work on projects.
As capital costs and communications costs decrease in importance as factors of
information production, the relative advantage of peer production in clearing
human capital becomes more salient.

 <dc:title>Internet Attacks: A Policy Framework for Rules of Engagement</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Information technology is redefining national security and the use of force
by state and nonstate actors. The use of force over the Internet warrants
analysis given recent terrorist attacks. At the same time that information
technology empowers states and their commercial enterprises, information
technology makes infrastructures supported by computer systems increasingly
accessible, interdependent, and more vulnerable to malicious attack. The
Computer Security Institute and the FBI jointly estimate that financial losses
attributed to malicious attack amounted to $378 million in 2000. International
Law clearly permits a state to respond in self-defense when attacked by another
state through the Internet, however, such attacks may not always rise to the
scope, duration, and intensity threshold of an armed attack that may justify a
use of force in self-defense.
  This paper presents a policy framework to analyze the rules of engagement for
Internet attacks. We describe the state of Internet security, incentives for
asymmetric warfare, and the development of international law for conflict
management and armed conflict. We focus on options for future rules of
engagement specific to Information Warfare.
  We conclude with four policy recommendations for Internet attack rules of
engagement: (1) the U.S. should pursue international definitions of &quot;force&quot; and
&quot;armed attack&quot; in the Information Warfare context; (2) the U.S. should pursue
international cooperation for the joint investigation and prosecution of
Internet attacks; (3) the U.S. must balance offensive opportunities against
defensive vulnerabilities; and (4) the U.S. should prepare strategic plans now
rather than making policy decisions in real-time during an Internet attack.

 <dc:title>National Information Infrastructure Development in Canada and the U.S.:
  Redefining Universal Service and Universal Access in the Age of

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This exploratory and descriptive research compares the policy-making
processes and policy recommendations regarding universal service and universal
access developed by the U.S. National Information Infrastructure Advisory
Council (NIIAC) and the Canadian Information Highway Advisory Council (IHAC) in
conjunction with related federal government agencies. Created in 1993 and 1994,
respectively, the Councils were charged with &quot;bringing forward&quot; the concepts of
universal service and universal access to adjust to the effects of
deregulation, new and converged Information and Communication Technologies
(ICTs), and neo-liberal economic competition and globalization that included
acknowledging the private sector as the primary creator of the Information
Highway.This qualitative study used as its methodology organizational, policy,
narrative, and discourse analyses to create a picture of what universal service
and universal access were and what they became in the hands of NIIAC, IHAC. The
U.S. had started with a more clearly defined universal service tradition than
Canada, and undertook a more complex policy-making process with more
experienced personnel. It was also clear that IHAC had in many ways followed
the U.S. model and arrived at many similar recommendations as NIIAC. Because of
the inevitability of technical, economic, and social change related to the
Information Highway, no definitive outcome to the Universal Service and
Universal Access &quot;story&quot; can be determined. Because the Canadian government did
not follow up on some of IHAC's most crucial recommendations, the Canadian
Information Highway &quot;story,&quot; in particular, has been left less complete than
that of the U.S.

 <dc:description>  Low search costs in Internet markets can be used by consumers to find low
prices, but can also be used by retailers to monitor competitors' prices. This
price monitoring can lead to price matching, resulting in dampened price
competition and higher prices in some cases. This paper analyzes price data for
316 bestselling, computer, and random book titles gathered from 32 retailers
between August 1999 and January 2000. In contrast to previous studies we find
no evidence of leader-follow behavior for the vast majority of retailers we
study. Further, the few cases of leader-follow behavior we observe seem to be
associated with managerial convenience as opposed to anti-competitive behavior.
We offer a methodology that can be used by future academic researchers or
government regulators to check for anti-competitive price matching behavior in
future time periods or in additional product categories.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the pricing of transit traffic in wireless peer-to-peer
networks using the concepts of direct and indirect network externalities. We
first establish that without any pricing mechanism, congestion externalities
overwhelm other network effects in a wireless data network. We show that
peering technology will mitigate the congestion and allow users to take
advantage of more the positive network externalities. However, without pricing,
the peering equilibrium breaks down just like a bucket brigade made up of
free-riding agents. With pricing and perfect competition, a peering equilibrium
is possible and allows many more users on the network at the same time.
However, the congestion externality is still a problem, so peering organized
through a club may be the best solution.

 <dc:title>Asymmetric Regulation on Steroids: U.S. Competition Policy and Fiber to

 <dc:description>  Fiber to the Home (FTTH) describes a set of emerging technologies with the
potential to affect competition in local access. On one hand, the high cost of
deploying fiber to the residence suggests limitations on facilities-based
competition among FTTH networks. On the other hand, FTTH opens up new
possibilities for service-level competition, defined as the sharing of a single
network infrastructure by multiple higher-layer service providers, whether of
the same or different services. Yet technology is hardly an exogenous factor
that independently shapes future local access competition; the regulatory
environment also plays a key role. By shaping expectations about future
competitive requirements, current regulations influence network operators'
deployment choices among competing FTTH technologies, as well as design choices
made by vendors and standards bodies for technologies still under
development.The current regulatory approach to FTTH is far from consistent.
Network operators likely to deploy FTTH include Incumbent Local Exchange
Carriers (ILECs), incumbent cable operators, competitive access providers
(including CLECs), independent telephone companies, and municipalities. This
paper reviews the rules related to service-level competition that apply to each
of these categories. In essence, the paper finds that if current regulatory
trends continue, asymmetries in the regulation of service-level competition
will be on steroids by the time FTTH starts being more commonly deployed.
Current regulatory requirements are either non-existent, or extremely detailed
and technology- and service- specific (e.g. UNEs). We argue that neither of
these approaches is likely to achieve the desired result for FTTH, given the
current state of flux in emerging FTTH technology.

 <dc:title>Electronic Access to Information and the Privacy Paradox: Rethinking

 <dc:description>  This article addresses the U.S. Supreme Court's central purpose formulation
in Reporters Committee v. Department of Justice under the federal Freedom of
Information Act. By examining all lower federal court opinions interpreting
Reporters Committee and by analyzing the effects of the Court's opinion on the
implementation of the FOIA, the paper finds that the Court's opinion has
greatly narrowed the scope of the FOIA and limited the power of EFOIA to
democratize electronic information. To assist in remedying the damage to the
public interest in freedom of information, the author urges judicial
consideration of a Privacy Act case, Tobey v. NRB, that more subtly treats
information collected by government about individuals. The paper concludes that
the Privacy Act demonstrates clearly that information, particularly
computerized databases, can not be treated categorically for purposes of
access.

 <dc:title>The Internet and Community Networks: Case Studies of Five U.S. Cities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Horrigan, John B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper looks at five U.S. cities (Austin, Cleveland, Nashville, Portland,
and Washington, DC) and explores strategies being employed by community
activists and local governments to create and sustain community networking
projects. In some cities, community networking initiatives are relatively
mature, while in others they are in early or intermediate stages. The paper
looks at several factors that help explain the evolution of community networks
in cities:
  1) Local government support; 2) Federal support 3) Degree of community
activism, often reflected by public-private partnerships that help support
community networks.
  In addition to these (more or less) measurable elements of local support, the
case studies enable description of the different objectives of community
networks in different cities. Several community networking projects aim to
improve the delivery of government services (e.g., Portland and Cleveland),
some have a job-training focus (e.g., Austin, Washington, DC), others are
oriented very explicitly toward community building (Nashville, DC), and others
toward neighborhood entrepreneurship (Portland and Cleveland).
  The paper ties the case studies together by asking whether community
technology initiatives contribute to social capital in the cities studied.

 <dc:title>Policy for access: Framing the question</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Allen, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Five years after the '96 Telecommunications Act, we still find precious
little local facilities-based competition. In response there are calls in
Congress and even from the FCC for new legislation to &quot;free the Bells.&quot;
However, the same ideology drove policy, not just five years ago, but also
almost twenty years back with the first modern push for &quot;freedom,&quot; namely
divestiture.
  How might we frame the question of policy for local access to engender a more
fruitful approach? The starting point for this analysis is the network--not
bits and bytes, but the human network. With the human network as starting
point, the unit of analysis is the community--specifically, the individual in a
tension with community. There are two core ideas.
  The first takes a behavioral approach to the economics--and the relative
share between beneficial chaos and order, in economic affairs, becomes
explicit.
  If the first main idea provides a conceptual base for open source, the second
core idea distinguishes open source from open design, ie at the information
'frontier' we push forward.
  The resulting policy frame for access is worked out in the detailed, concrete
steps of an extended thought experiment. A small town setting (Concord,
Massachusetts) grounds the discussion in the real world. The purpose overall is
to stimulate new thinking which may break out of the conundrum where periodic
rounds to legislate 'freedom' produce the opposite, recursively. The ultimate
aim is better fit between our analytically-driven expectations and economic
outcomes.

 <dc:title>Realspace Sovereigns in Cyberspace: The Case of Domain Names</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this piece, we take up the case of the domain name system as an example of
challenges and solutions for realspace sovereigns in cyberspace. First, we
analyze the 'in rem' provision of the US Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection
Act (ACPA), which purports to expand the scope of the ACPA to encompass
disputes with little direct connection with the United States. In reality,
there exist no cases of foreign cybersquatting as to which the 'in rem'
provision will be both applicable and constitutional. Instead the ACPA 'in rem'
provision is notable primarily for its aggressive assertion of jurisdiction,
leading us to consider the (often overlooked) role of realspace sovereigns in
the regulation of the domain names system. By mapping the logical control over
the domain names system-the distributed hierarchy that is the basis of the
system's design-onto realspace territory, the potential for sovereign
regulation of the system becomes apparent. We argue that the regulatory
significance of geography, and the essentially arbitrary nature of the present
territorial locations of the key components of the domain name system implies
the future segmentation of the domain name system, and the resulting dramatic
decrease in its value. Accordingly, we argue that realspace sovereigns (and
especially the United States) have strong interests in avoiding segmentation,
and thus must seek to coordinate the regulation of the system.

 <dc:description>  This paper brings evidence to bear on the question of the long-term effects
of Internet diffusion on civic engagement in geographic communities. It draws
on findings from survey data collected in four U.S. towns and cities in fall
2000 where community computer networking is established. The study shows that
early adopters of the Internet are more likely to engage in civic activities
and to have higher levels of community involvement than later adopters.
Further, early adopters are more likely to use the Internet to increase their
community involvement and political participation. Later adopters in all four
sites show less involvement in their local community and less interest in
political activity and information, online or offline. These findings reinforce
those of the Kohut (1999) study showing that later adopters are less civic
minded and more interested than early adopters in consumer and commercial
applications, such as shopping and entertainment. The evidence in these four
sites is consistent with earlier findings in Blacksburg, Virginia (Kavanaugh,
2000; Patterson and Kavanaugh, 2001; Kavanaugh and Patterson, 2001) and other
studies of early innovation adopters (Rogers, 1983; Kohut, 1999; Valente, 1995,
among others). The results reported in this paper lend weight to the argument
that increases in civic engagement and community involvement are due primarily
to the behavior of early adopters, making such increases a phase, not a trend.
As later adopters come on line, use of the Internet for community involvement
or civic engagement decreases. In the long term, we can expect that Internet
access may have only a modest effect on community involvement and civic
engagement in geographic communities.

 <dc:title>Value of Usage and Seller's Listing Behavior in Internet Auctions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Park, Sangin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we aim to empirically examine the value of website usage and
sellers' listing behavior in the two leading Internet auctions sites, eBay and
Yahoo!Auctions. The descriptive data analysis of the seller's equilibrium
listing behavior indicates that a seller's higher expected auction revenue from
eBay is correlated with a lager number of potential bidders measured by website
usage per listing. Our estimation results, based on the logarithm
specifications of sellers' expected auction revenues and potential bidders'
website usage, show that in a median case, (i) 1 percent increase of the unique
visitors (page views) per listed item induces 0.022 (0.007) percent increase of
a seller's expected auction revenue; and (ii) 1 percent increase of sellers'
listings induces 1.99 (4.74) percent increase of the unique visitors (page
views). Since increased expected auction revenues will induce more listings, we
can infer positive feedback effects between the number of listings and website
usage. Consequently, Yahoo!Auctions, which has substantially less listings, has
greater incentives to increase listings via these feedback effects which are
reflected in its fee schedules.

 <dc:description>  &quot;What Should be Hidden and Open in Computer Security: Lessons from Deception,
the Art of War, Law, and Economic Theory&quot; Peter P. Swire, George Washington
University.
  Imagine a military base. It is defended against possible attack. Do we expect
the base to reveal the location of booby traps and other defenses? No. But for
many computer applications,a software developer will need to reveal a great
deal about the code to get other system owners to trust the code and know how
to operate with it.
  This article examines these conflicting intuitions and develops a theory
about what should be open and hidden in computer security. Part I of the paper
shows how substantial openness is typical for major computer security topics,
such as firewalls, packaged software, and encryption. Part II shows what
factors will lead to openness or hiddenness in computer security.
  Part III presents an economic analysis of the issue of what should be open in
computer security. The owner who does not reveal the booby traps is like a
monopolist, while the open-source software supplier is in a competitive market.
This economic approach allows us to identify possible market failures in how
much openness occurs for computer security.
  Part IV examines the contrasting approaches of Sun Tzu and Clausewitz to the
role of hiddenness and deception in military strategy. The computer security,
economic, and military strategy approaches thus each show factors relevant to
what should be kept hidden in computer security. Part V then applies the theory
to a range of current legal and technical issues.

 <dc:description>  This research investigates the relationship between telecommunications
infrastructure, economic conditions, and federal and state policies and
initiatives. It presents a detailed look at the telecommunications environment
of the Appalachian region, particularly focusing on broadband technologies. A
strong, positive association exists between telecommunications infrastructure
and economic status. The effects of federal and state universal service
policies are examined, as well as some of the ways states have leveraged their
own infrastructure to improve telecommunications capabilities in their region.
Other state and local telecommunications-related programs are noted.

 <dc:description>  ENUM effectively bridges the telephone and Internet worlds by placing
telephone numbers from the ITU Rec. E.164 public telecommunication numbering
plan into the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) as domain names. ENUM
potentially presents significant public policy issues at both the domestic and
international levels. Ultimately, it should not matter whether ENUM is
approached as a telecommunications issue or an Internet issue because: (1) they
are becoming the same thing technically, and (2) they engage the same global
public interests. For the same reasons as apply to traditional
telecommunications, and even to the Internet itself, public oversight of ENUM
naming, numbering, and addressing resources is justified both by technical
necessity and the interests of consumer protection (particularly personal
privacy) and competition at higher service layers. A single, coordinated global
DNS domain for at least Tier 0 (the international level) of the ENUM names
hierarchy should be designated by public authorities. Many of the technical
characteristics and policy considerations relevant at the ENUM Tier 0 and 1
zones are also directly applicable to the Internet's IP address space and DNS
root (or Tier 0) zone - key shared elements of the Internet's logical
infrastructure. Despite the fundamentally international nature of the
Internet's logical infrastructure layer, and the purported privatization of
administration of its IP address space and the DNS, Internet governance is not
yet truly international. The ENUM policy debate illustrates the need for
authoritative international public oversight of public communications network
logical infrastructure, including that of traditional telecommunications, the
Internet, and ENUM.

 <dc:title>Is the Commercial Mass Media Necessary, or Even Desirable, for Liberal
  Democracy?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Netanel, Neil</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Is a commercial mass media, dependent on the market for its sustenance,
necessary, or even desirable, for liberal democracy? Yochai Benkler has argued
that a decentralized, peer-to-peer system of communications and information is
both possible with digital technology and preferable to a system based on
commercial mass media. He has contended in fact that the presence of
politically powerful, copyright-rich mass media imposes significant barriers to
the development of peer-to-peer information-sharing networks. In contrast, I
have argued that the commercial mass media play an important, and perhaps even
vital, role in liberal democracy by galvanizing public opinion, serving as a
watchdog against government and corporate wrongdoing, agenda-setting (which
enables public discourse), and serving as a relatively trustworthy source of
information. This paper seeks to push the ball forward on this issue. It first
isolates and enumerates the contributions that the commercial mass media are
said to make towards liberal democracy. It then briefly assesses the extent to
which the commercial mass media actually fulfills these constitutive functions.
It then asks whether alternative institutions might serve some or all of these
functions just as well or better. In so doing, it looks both to the past and
the future. First, it examines the political party-supported press that thrived
in the United States through much of the 19th century. Second, it examines
government-funded mass media. Third, it looks, skeptically, at possibilities
for peer-to-peer sharing of information and opinion in the digital network
environment. I conclude that, despite the weaknesses of commercial mass media,
an information policy suitable to liberal democracy should include a plurality
of types of voices, including commercial mass media.

 <dc:title>Open Access to Monopoly Cable Platforms Versus Direct Access To
  Competitive International Telecommunications Satellite Facilities: A Study In
  Contrasts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Katkin, Ken</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 1999, the FCC authorized direct access to INTELSAT, allowing INTELSAT's
U.S. customers and competitors to bypass INTELSAT's U.S. retail affiliate
(COMSAT), and to take satellite capacity at wholesale prices directly from
INTELSAT. This policy was modeled in many respects on the access and unbundling
requirements applicable to domestic incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs)
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. At the same time, incumbent domestic
cable TV system operators have not been required to provide wholesale open
access to competitive Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seeking to provide
residential broadband Internet service through existing proprietary cable
facilities. Yet the policy arguments favoring open access to incumbent domestic
cable systems appear to be stronger than those favoring direct access to
INTELSAT.
  For example, it may be fairly debated whether entrenched cable system
operators are now positioned to unfairly leverage their dominance in the
multichannel video programming distribution (MVPD) market to thwart competition
in the broadband ISP market, as some cable open access advocates assert. In
contrast, it is clear that no analogous issues of tying were implicated by
INTELSAT in 1999, when its position in the international telecommunications
market was substantially nondominant and, in any event, it had no new product
to tie to its established offerings. Similarly, while it may be debated whether
or not a cable plant is a bottleneck facility that gatekeeps broadband Internet
for many residential users, it is beyond cavil that INTELSAT in 1999 controlled
virtually no such bottleneck facilities.

 <dc:description>  The current pattern of competition in the Brazilian telecommunications market
was defined by a regulatory reform implemented in the second half of the
nineties. The telecommunications regulatory reform discussed in the paper
promoted the privatization of Telebras System and fostered competition in the
Brazilian market under the stricted supervision of the new regulator Anatel.
Notwithstanding, the regulatory Brazilian scheme is at a crossroads. From 2002
on an open market approach will be implemented in telecom arena. We analyse the
main aspects of those change, from the firms perspective and also in a broad
scenario under influence of the World Trade Organization system

 <dc:title>Assessing the Effectiveness of Section 271 Five Years After the
  Telecommunications Act of 1996</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A major goal of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to promote competition
in both the local exchange and long distance wireline markets. In section 271
Congress permitted the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to enter the long
distance market only if they demonstrate to the FCC that they have complied
with the market-opening requirements of section 251. This paper examines the
logic behind section 271, to determine if it is a reasonable means of achieving
increased competition in both the local and long distance markets, given the
technical characteristics of the industry and the legal and informational
constraints on regulators who must ensure compliance. It also provides an
update on the extent of competitive entry in the local exchange market five
years after enactment of the Act.
  In this paper we examine a variety of schemes for ensuring BOC compliance
that Congress could have used. Given the characteristics of the industry and
the limitations on regulators' ability to observe BOC's efforts, we determine
that the use of a prize such as BOC entry into long distance is a superior
incentive mechanism. We further determine that conditioning a BOC's long
distance entry on its demonstrating compliance with section 251 is a logical
method of protecting the long distance market against a BOC discriminating
against long distance competitors once it has gained entry. The statistical
evidence we look at, using data we have collected on ILEC lines sold to CLECs
for POTS services, appears to confirm that section 271 has thus far been
effective in ensuring compliance.

 <dc:description>  The early election call in the fall of 2000 provided the perfect opportunity
to study the impact the Internet has had on election campaigning in Canada.
With the explosion of use the Net has seen since the 1997 general election,
Canadian federal parties stood at the threshold of a new age in election
campaigning. Pundits such as Rheingold (1993) have argued that the Internet
will provide citizens with a way to bypass traditional media and gain
unmediated access to each parties political message as well as providing a
forum for citizens to engage the parties, and each other in deliberative
debate.
  Through a longitudinal analysis of party web pages and telephone interviews
with party staffers, we analyze the role the Internet played in the election
campaigns of Canada's federal parties. Our findings indicate that the parties
are still focusing on providing online features that talk at the voter instead
of engaging them in any type of meaningful discourse. Most of these sites were
exceptionally similar in their structure and in the type of content they
provided. Generally, these sites served as digital archives for campaign
material created with other media in mind and despite the multimedia
capabilities of the Internet, these sites tended to be overwhelmingly text
oriented. In line with Stromer-Galley's (2000) discussion of why candidates in
the U.S. avoid online interaction, we also argue that little incentive exists
to motivate parties to engage in any meaningful interaction with voters online.

 <dc:title>The Influence of Policy Regimes on the Development and Social
  Implications of Privacy Enhancing Technologies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Phillips, David J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  As privacy issues have gained social salience, entrepreneurs have begun to
offer privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) and the U.S. has begun to enact
privacy legislation.
  But &quot;privacy&quot; is an ambiguous notion. In the liberal tradition, it is an
individualistic value protecting citizens from intrusion into a realm of
autonomy. A feminist critique suggests that the social utility of privacy is to
exclude certain issues from the public realm. Sociologists suggest that privacy
is about identity management, while political economists suggest that the most
salient privacy issue is the use of personal information to normalize and
rationalize populations according to the needs of capital.
  While PETs have been developed for use by individual consumers, recently
developers are focusing on the business to business market, where demand is
stoked by the existence of new privacy regulations. These new laws tend to
operationalize privacy in terms of &quot;personally identifiable information.&quot; The
new generation of PETs reflect and reify that definition. This, in turn, has
implications for the everyday understandings of privacy and the constitution of
identity and social life.
  In particular, this socio-technical practice may strengthen the ability of
data holders to rationalize populations and create self-serving social
categories. At the same time, they may permit individuals to negotiate these
categories outside of panoptic vision. They may also encourage public
discussion and awareness of these created social categories.

 <dc:title>ICANN as Regulator</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper tells the story leading to ICANN's selection of seven new Internet
top level domains in November 2000. In implementing proposals to expand the
name space, ICANN adopted an approach far different from Jon Postel's
lightweight proposals. ICANN staff, in setting the ground rules for considering
new gTLDs, emphasized that only a few applicants would be allowed in, and
imposed strict threshold requirements. Staff determined that the Board should
pick TLDs by looking at all relevant aspects of every proposal, and deciding
which ones presented the best overall combination of a variety of
incommensurable factors. Aspects of the resulting process were predictable:
Anyone familiar with the FCC comparative hearing process for broadcast licenses
can attest that this sort of ad hoc comparison is necessarily subjective,
lending itself to arbitrariness and biased application. Yet the process had
advantages that appealed to ICANN decision-makers. The Board members would be
free to take their best shots, in a situationally sensitive manner, at
advancing the policies they thought important. The approach allowed ICANN to
maintain the greatest degree of control. The end result, though, was a process
stunning in its arbitrariness, a bad parody of fact-bound, situationally
sensitive (rather than rules-based) decision-making.

 <dc:title>Comparison of Wireless Standards-Setting --United States Versus Europe</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tan, Zixiang Alex</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When decisions about developing standards are left to individual firms, there
are many advantages including a flexible response to market evolution,
accommodation to rapid technology change, and avoidance of costly coordination.
However, the market process does not necessarily lead to compatible standards,
especially when there is no clear market dominator. Standards Institutions
generally facilitate better communication among market participants, which may
discourage early and/or primitive incompatible standards to emerge in the
market. However, expenditures on institutional standards-setting can lead to
diminishing returns, or even be counter-productive because institutional
standards usually take longer to produce and are slower to respond to
technology development. Government agencies can specify compulsory standards to
avoid incompatibility. In addition, governments can tie their policy on
standardization closely with their industrial, trade, and/or regulatory
policies. However, many exogenous factors handicap a government's effective
involvement. Government often fails to respond to the dynamics of technology
development and consumer demand, and to pick up the &quot;right technology&quot;. This
study first discusses why two different models have emerged in the two regions.
It then examines outcomes and implications of the two models, including impacts
on domestic service deployment, global trade competition, technology
innovations, and strategies of multinational corporations. The goal is to
conduct an empirical comparison between the two contrasting models.

 <dc:description>  This paper compares two models for delivering broadband wireless services:
best effort vs. QoS guaranteed services. The 'best effort' services we refer to
in this paper are more commonly known as unlicensed wireless services, while
the 'Quality of Service guaranteed' services are more commonly referred to as
traditional landline telephony, as well as cellular telephone services of
either the second or third generation.
  This paper highlights the differing 'market' versus 'engineering'
philosophies implicit in alternative wireless service architectures.

 <dc:description>  For wireless communications, the FCC has fostered competition rather than
openness. This has permitted the emergence of vertically integrated end-to-end
providers, creating problems of reduced hardware innovation, software
applications, user choice, and content access. To deal with these emerging
issues and create multi-level forms of competition, one policy is likely to
suffice: a Carterfone for wireless, coupled with more unlicensed spectrum.

 <dc:title>Leveraging Software, Advocating Ideology: Free Software and Open Source</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper uses the software program Linux and the discourse around it in
order to examine how software programs can be used to articulate and defend
social and economic positions. Although I do not use the term &quot;expression&quot; in a
strict legal sense, I claim that in order to make policy decisions involving
software, it is important to understand how the functionality of software is
expressive. Another way to state this is that software programs like Linux are
socially meaningful through functionality and talk about functionality.
  In section I, I review some recent legal scholarship about software and
explain why understanding how embedded technical expression works is important
given the increasingly large role of software in governance. In section II, I
explore software construction as a combination of social and technical
practices. In section III, I describe some examples of meaning-making around
the software program Linux. In section IV I conclude with a short description
of why such analyses are important.

 <dc:title>Universal Service in times of Reform: Affordability and accessibility of
  telecommunication services in Latin America</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fuentes-Bautista, Martha</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  By surveying the universal service policies in six Latin American countries,
this study explores the evolution of the concept during the rollout of the
telecommunication reform in the last decade. Country profiles and a set of
universal service indicators provide a frame for discussing issues of
accessibility and affordability of telephone service in the region. This study
found that the reconfiguration of national networks fostered by liberalization
policies offered risks and opportunities to achieve universal service goals.
The diversification of access points and services enhanced users choices but
price rebalancing and lack of Universal Service Obligations (USO) to target
groups with special needs depressed the demand and threatened to exclude
significant parts of the population. The situation requires the reformulation
of USO incorporating all technological solutions existing in the market, and
factors from the consumer-demand accounting for the urban-rural continuum, and
different social and economic strata. This study identifies the emergence of a
second generation of USO targeting some of these needs. However, more
competition and special tariff plans for the poor need to be incorporated to
the options available in the market.

 <dc:description>  When the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) selected a
radio access technology based on Wideband Code-Division Multiple Access
(WCDMA), sponsored by European telecommunications equipment manufactures
Ericsson and Nokia, for its third-generation wireless communications system, a
bitter dispute developed between ETSI and Qualcommm Inc. Qualcomm threatened to
withhold its intellectual property on the CDMA technology unless the Europeans
agreed to make the radio access technology backward compatible with cdmaOne,
Qualcomm's favored version of CDMA. A dispute over intellectual property rights
over key CDMA techniques also erupted between Ericsson and Qualcomm and both
filed patent infringement in US Court. The dispute halted the standards
activity and has troubled operators worldwide as well as the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU).

 <dc:description>  Peer to peer networks will become an increasingly important distribution
channel for consumer information goods and may play a role in the distribution
of information within corporations. Our research analyzes optimal membership
rules for these networks in light of positive and negative externalities
additional users impose on the network. Using a dataset gathered from the six
largest OpenNap-based networks, we find that users impose a positive network
externality based on the desirability of the content they provide and a
negative network externality based on demands they place on the network.
Further we find that the marginal value of additional users is declining and
the marginal cost is increasing in the number of current users. This suggests
that multiple small networks may serve user communities more efficiently than
single monolithic networks and that network operators may wish to specialize in
their content and restrict membership based on capacity constraints and user
content desirability.

 <dc:description>  Although patent law purports to cover all manner of technologies, we have
noticed recent divergence in the standards applied to biotechnology and to
software patents: the Federal Circuit has applied a very permissive standard of
obviousness in biotechnology, but a highly restrictive disclosure requirement.
The opposite holds true for software patents, which seems to us exactly
contrary to sound policy for either industry. These patent standards are
grounded in the legal fiction of the &quot;person having ordinary skill in the art&quot;
or PHOSITA. We discuss the appropriateness of the PHOSITA standard, concluding
that it properly lends flexibility to the patent system. We then discuss the
difficulty of applying this standard in different industries, offering
suggestions as to how it might be modified to avoid the problems seen in
biotechnology and software patents.

 <dc:title>Spectrum auctions, pricing and network expansion in wireless
  telecommunications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bauer, Johannes M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper examines the effects of licensing conditions, in particular of
spectrum fees, on the pricing and diffusion of mobile communications services.
Seemingly exorbitant sums paid for 3G licenses in the UK, Germany in 2000 and
similarly high fees paid by U.S. carriers in the re-auctioning of PCS licenses
early in 2001 raised concerns as to the impacts of the market entry regime on
the mobile communications market.
  The evidence from the GSM and PCS markets reviewed in this paper suggests
that market entry fees do indeed influence the subsequent development of the
market. We discuss three potential transmission channels by which license fees
can influence the price and quantity of service sold in a wireless market: an
increase in average cost, an increase in incremental costs, and impacts of sunk
costs on the emerging market structure.
  From this conceptual debate, an empirical model is developed and tested using
cross-sectional data for the residential mobile voice market. We utilize a
structural equation approach, modeling the supply and demand relationships
subject to the constraint that supply equals demand. The results confirm the
existence of a positive effect of license fees on the cost of supply. However,
we also find that higher market concentration has a positive effect on the
overall supply in the market, perhaps supporting a Schumpeterian view that a
certain degree of market concentration facilitates efficiency.

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Communication technologies contain embedded values that affect our society's
fundamental values, such as privacy, freedom of speech, and the protection of
intellectual property. Researchers have shown the design of technologies is not
autonomous but shaped by conflicting social groups. Consequently, communication
technologies contain different values when designed by different social groups.
Continuing in this vein, we show that the institutions where communication
technologies are designed and developed are an important source of the values
of communication technologies. We use the term code to collectively refer to
the hardware and software of communication technologies. Institutions differ in
their motivations, structure, and susceptibility to external influences. First,
we focus on the political, economic, social, and legal influences during the
development of code. The institutional reactions to these influences are
embodied in code. Second, we focus on the decision-making issues in the review
process for code. This process determines the code's content and affects the
dissemination of code through the decision whether to publicly release the
code. We found these factors vary by institution. As a result, institutions
differ in the values that they incorporate into code or communications
technologies.

 <dc:title>Efficient Choice, Inefficient Democracy? The Implications of Cable and
  Internet Access for Political Knowledge and Voter Turnout</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prior, Markus</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper explains why, despite a marked increase in available political
information on cable television and the Internet, citizens' levels of political
knowledge have, at best, remained stagnant (Delli Carpini &amp; Keeter, 1996).
Since the availability of entertainment content has increased too, the effect
of new media on knowledge and vote likelihood should be determined by people's
relative preferences for entertainment and information. Access to new media
should increase knowledge and vote likelihood among people who prefer news. At
the same time, it is hypothesized to have a negative effect on knowledge and
turnout for people who prefer entertainment content. Hypotheses are tested by
building a measure of Relative Entertainment Preference (REP) from existing NES
and Pew survey data. Results support the predicted interaction effect of media
environment (cable and/or Internet access) and motivation (REP) on political
knowledge and turnout. In particular, people who prefer entertainment to news
and have access to cable television and the Internet are less knowledgeable and
less likely to vote than any other group of people.

 <dc:description>  We propose a quality of service (QoS) monitoring program for broadband access
to measure the impact of proprietary network spaces. Our paper surveys other
QoS policy initiatives, including those in the airline, and wireless and
wireline telephone industries, to situate broadband in the context of other
markets undergoing regulatory devolution. We illustrate how network
architecture can create impediments to open communications, and how QoS
monitoring can detect such effects. We present data from a field test of
QoS-monitoring software now in development. We suggest QoS metrics to gauge
whether information &quot;walled gardens&quot; represent a real threat for dividing the
Internet into proprietary spaces.
  To demonstrate our proposal, we are placing our software on the computers of
a sample of broadband subscribers. The software periodically conducts a battery
of tests that assess the quality of connections from the subscriber's computer
to various content sites. Any systematic differences in connection quality
between affiliated and non-affiliated content sites would warrant research into
the behavioral implications of those differences.
  QoS monitoring is timely because the potential for the Internet to break into
a loose network of proprietary content domains appears stronger than ever.
Recent court rulings and policy statements suggest a growing trend towards
relaxed scrutiny of mergers and the easing or elimination of content ownership
rules. This policy environment could lead to a market with a small number of
large, vertically integrated network operators, each pushing its proprietary
content on subscribers.

 <dc:title>Elusive Threats: Security Weaknesses of Commercial Cellular Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Forbes, Scott C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Commercial cellular telecommunications networks are routinely used as key
means of voice and data transport by both businesses and the Public. Despite
advances in encryption and other security measures, these commercial cellular
networks remain extremely vulnerable to malicious attacks and the loss of user
and data privacy and integrity. Such losses can result not only in mere
inconvenience, but in serious corporate and national security breaches. Because
of the potentially catastrophic nature of such security breaches, it behooves
cellular network operators, distributors, and users to explore these network
risk areas and mitigate them to the extent that current resources allow.

 <dc:title>Digital Arroyos: An Examination of State Policy and Regulated Market
  Boundaries in Constructing Rural Internet Access</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nicholas, Kyle</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This focused study on state-level policy and access patterns contributes to a
fuller understanding of how these invisible barriers work to structure access
and define rural communities. Combining both quantitative and qualitative data,
this study examines the role of geo-policy barriers in one of the largest and
most rural states in the nation.
  Expanded Area Service policies are state policies wherein phone customers can
expand their local calling area. Because useful Internet access requires a
flat-price connection, EAS policies can play a crucial role in connecting
citizens to one another. EAS policies (including Texas') tend to vary along
five dimensions (community of interest, customer scope, directionality, pricing
mechanism and policy scope). EAS policies that rely on regulated market
boundaries for definition can generate gross inequities in rural Internet
access. Interviews with Internet Service Providers in a case study of 25 rural
communities reveals that LATA and exchange boundaries, along with
geographically restricted infrastructure investments, curtail service provision
in remote areas. A statistical analysis of 1300 telephone exchanges, including
208 rural telephone exchanges in Texas reveals that the farther a community
lies from a metropolitan area the less likely they are to have reliable
Internet access

 <dc:title>The Consumer Product Selection Process in an Internet Age: Obstacles to
  Maximum Effectiveness &amp; Policy Options</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Nadel, Mark S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Intermediaries, like real estate agents, Consumer Reports, and Zagats, have
long helped buyers to identify their most suitable options. Now, the
combination of databases and the Internet enables them to serve consumers
dramatically more effectively. This article begins by offering a three-part
framework for understanding the evolving forms of selection assistance. It then
focuses on numerous potential obstacles that could prevent shoppers from
enjoying the full benefits of these developing technologies. While concluding
that adjustments to business strategies and the enforcement of existing laws
can effectively overcome most of these impediments, the article identifies
several areas where proactive government action may be desirable, such as to
prevent the emergence of anticompetitive entry barriers.

 <dc:title>Prospects for Improving Competition in Mobile Roaming</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stumpf, Ulrich</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ability to make international roaming calls is of increasing importance
to customers in Europe. This contrasts with various complaints that retail
prices of roaming calls are rigid and excessive. The focus if the paper is on
wholesale roaming, which is the prime determinant of retail roaming prices. The
paper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have
impaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the
two leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new
entrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. The paper argues that a
number of developments are under way that are likely to modify this situation
in the future. With the introduction of SIM over-the-air programming, home
mobile operators will be able to direct customers to networks with the lowest
charges. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800
operators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear.
Given the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently
provide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for
preferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it
will be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a
pan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for
preferred roaming status. This could discriminate against mobile operators in
downstream retail markets that do not have a pan-European footprint and that
lack the bargaining power. However, arbitrage by roaming brokers, new entry and
wider geographical markets on the retail roaming level will work against this.

 <dc:description>  This paper focuses on a tension we discovered in the philosophical part of
our multidisciplinary project on values in web-browser security. Our project
draws on the methods and perspectives of empirical social science, computer
science, and philosophy to identify values embodied in existing web-browser
security and also to prescribe changes to existing systems (in particular,
Mozilla) so that values relevant to web-browser systems are better served than
presently they are. The tension, which we had not seen explicitly addressed in
any other work on computer security, emerged when we set out to extract from
the concept of security the set values that ought to guide the shape of
web-browser security. We found it impossible to construct an internally
consistent set of values until we realized that two robust -- and in places
competing -- conceptions of computer security were influencing our thinking. We
needed to pry these apart and make a primary commitment to one. One conception
of computer security invokes the ordinary meaning of security. According to it,
computer security should protect people -- computer users -- against dangers,
harms, and threats. Clearly this ordinary conception of security is already
informing much of the work and rhetoric surrounding computer security. But
another, substantively richer conception, also defines the aims and trajectory
of computer security -- computer security as an element of national security.
Although, like the ordinary conception, this one is also concerned with
protection against threats, its primary subject is the state, not the
individual. The two conceptions suggest divergent system-specifications, not
for all mechanisms but a significant few.

 <dc:title>Inventing E-Regulation in the US, EU and East Asia: Conflicting Social

 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper attempts to assess the international approach to Internet policy
in the context of distinctive socio-political frameworks evolving in the US,
the European Union (EU), and East Asia. The comparative review will develop a
set of underlying structural models of the Information Society particular to
each region, along with an analysis of their defining characteristics in
relation to one another. This examination demonstrates how each region, given
its regulatory legacy, has elected a different mix of good and bad
socio-political choices in public policy for the Internet. Despite the range
and diversity of paths to e-regulation suggested in these choices, none
adequately addresses the underlying issue of how to promote an innovative
society that is open to broad social participation. The paper evaluates
principal weaknesses in these regional models of Internet policy and argues the
need for re-conceptualizing the cultural, political and economic approach to
the new information space of the Internet.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of defining conditional objects (a|b), which would
allow one to regard the conditional probability Pr(a|b) as a probability of a
well-defined event rather than as a shorthand for Pr(ab)/Pr(b). The next issue
is to define boolean combinations of conditional objects, and possibly also the
operator of further conditioning. These questions have been investigated at
least since the times of George Boole, leading to a number of formalisms
proposed for conditional objects, mostly of syntactical, proof-theoretic vein.
  We propose a unifying, semantical approach, in which conditional events are
(projections of) Markov chains, definable in the three-valued extension of the
past tense fragment of propositional linear time logic, or, equivalently, by
three-valued counter-free Moore machines. Thus our conditional objects are
indeed stochastic processes, one of the central notions of modern probability
theory.
  Our model fulfills early ideas of Bruno de Finetti and, moreover, as we show
in a separate paper, all the previously proposed algebras of conditional events
can be isomorphically embedded in our model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we prove that all the existing conditional event algebras embed
into a three-valued extension of temporal logic of discrete past time, which
the authors of this paper have proposed in anothe paper as a general model of
conditional events.
  First of all, we discuss the descriptive incompleteness of the cea's. In this
direction, we show that some important notions, like independence of
conditional events, cannot be properly addressed in the framework of
conditional event algebras, while they can be precisely formulated and analyzed
in the temporal setting.
  We also demonstrate that the embeddings allow one to use Markov chain
algorithms (suitable for the temporal calculus) for computing probabilities of
complex conditional expressions of the embedded conditional event algebras, and
that these algorithms can outperform those previously known.

 <dc:description>  After the first treatments of quantum finite state automata by Moore and
Crutchfield and by Kondacs and Watrous, a number of papers study the power of
quantum finite state automata and their variants. This paper introduces a model
of two-way quantum one-counter automata (2Q1CAs), combining the model of
two-way quantum finite state automata (2QFAs) by Kondacs and Watrous and the
model of one-way quantum one-counter automata (1Q1CAs) by Kravtsev. We give the
definition of 2Q1CAs with well-formedness conditions. It is proved that 2Q1CAs
are at least as powerful as classical two-way deterministic one-counter
automata (2D1CAs), that is, every language L recognizable by 2D1CAs is
recognized by 2Q1CAs with no error. It is also shown that several
non-context-free languages including {a^n b^{n^2}} and {a^n b^{2^n}} are
recognizable by 2Q1CAs with bounded error.

 <dc:description>  This paper explains four things in a unified way. First, how e-commerce can
generate price equilibria where physical shops either compete with virtual
shops for consumers with Internet access, or alternatively, sell only to
consumers with no Internet access. Second, how these price equilibria might
involve price dispersion on-line. Third, why prices may be higher on-line.
Fourth, why established firms can, but need not, be more reluctant than newly
created firm to adopt e-commerce. For this purpose we develop a model where
e-commerce reduces consumers' search costs, involves trade-offs for consumers,
and reduces retailing costs.

heuristics play when solving a problem using a constraint-based approach. We
also show how constraint solving techniques allow to very efficiently solve
combinatorial optimization problems that are too hard for integer programming
techniques.

 <dc:description>  This paper uses clickstream data from Plurimus Corp. (formerly Foveon Corp.)
to analyze user choice of Internet portals. It will show that commonly used
econometric models for examining grocery scanner data can be applied to
clickstream data on advertising-based online markets. Developing a framework to
study consumer choices of free websites is an essential step to better
understanding user behavior on the Internet. The main data for this study is a
clickstream data set consisting of every website visited by 2654 users from
December 27 1999 to March 31 2000. Using this data, I construct several
variables including search success, time spent searching, and whether a website
is an individual's starting page. I also have advertising and media mentions
data. This study helps to increase understanding of user behavior on the
Internet. It explores some key determinants of website choice and simulates
market responses to changes in the online environment. By better understanding
website choice, we can better evaluate the implications of policy decisions.

 <dc:description>  The early promises of DNA computing to deliver a massively parallel
architecture well-suited to computationally hard problems have so far been
largely unkept. Indeed, it is probably fair to say that only toy problems have
been addressed experimentally. Recent experimental development on algorithmic
self-assembly using DNA tiles seem to offer the most promising path toward a
potentially useful application of the DNA computing concept. In this paper, we
explore new geometries for algorithmic self-assembly, departing from those
previously described in the literature. This enables us to carry out
mathematical operations like binary multiplication or cyclic convolution
product. We then show how to use the latter operation to implement an attack
against the well-known public-key crypto system NTRU.

 <dc:title>Pushdown Timed Automata: a Binary Reachability Characterization and

 <dc:description>  We consider pushdown timed automata (PTAs) that are timed automata (with
dense clocks) augmented with a pushdown stack. A configuration of a PTA
includes a control state, dense clock values and a stack word. By using the
pattern technique, we give a decidable characterization of the binary
reachability (i.e., the set of all pairs of configurations such that one can
reach the other) of a PTA. Since a timed automaton can be treated as a PTA
without the pushdown stack, we can show that the binary reachability of a timed
automaton is definable in the additive theory of reals and integers. The
results can be used to verify a class of properties containing linear relations
over both dense variables and unbounded discrete variables. The properties
previously could not be verified using the classic region technique nor
expressed by timed temporal logics for timed automata and CTL$^*$ for pushdown
systems. The results are also extended to other generalizations of timed
automata.

 <dc:description>  We define the min-min expectation selection problem (resp. max-min
expectation selection problem) to be that of selecting k out of n given
discrete probability distributions, to minimize (resp. maximize) the
expectation of the minimum value resulting when independent random variables
are drawn from the selected distributions. We assume each distribution has
finitely many atoms. Let d be the number of distinct values in the support of
the distributions. We show that if d is a constant greater than 2, the min-min
expectation problem is NP-complete but admits a fully polynomial time
approximation scheme. For d an arbitrary integer, it is NP-hard to approximate
the min-min expectation problem with any constant approximation factor. The
max-min expectation problem is polynomially solvable for constant d; we leave
open its complexity for variable d. We also show similar results for binary
selection problems in which we must choose one distribution from each of n
pairs of distributions.

 <dc:title>A Proposal for Dynamic Access Lists for TCP/IP Packet Filering</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The use of IP filtering to improve system security is well established, and
although limited in what it can achieve has proved to be efficient and
effective.
  In the design of a security policy there is always a trade-off between
usability and security. Restricting access means that legitimate use of the
network is prevented; allowing access means illegitimate use may be allowed.
Static access list make finding a balance particularly stark -- we pay the
price of decreased security 100% of the time even if the benefit of increased
usability is only gained 1% of the time.
  Dynamic access lists would allow the rules to change for short periods of
time, and to allow local changes by non-experts. The network administrator can
set basic security guide-lines which allow certain basic services only. All
other services are restricted, but users are able to request temporary
exceptions in order to allow additional access to the network. These exceptions
are granted depending on the privileges of the user.
  This paper covers the following topics: (1) basic introduction to TCP/IP
filtering; (2) semantics for dynamic access lists and; (3) a proposed protocol
for allowing dynamic access; and (4) a method for representing access lists so
that dynamic update and look-up can be done efficiently performed.

 <dc:description>  The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) is a new project to build a
worldwide system of federated language archives based on the Open Archives
Initiative and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. This paper aims to
disseminate the OLAC vision to the language resources community in Asia, and to
show language technologists and linguists how they can document their tools and
data in such a way that others can easily discover them. We describe OLAC and
the OLAC Metadata Set, then discuss two key issues in the Asian context:
language classification and multilingual resource classification.

 <dc:description>  The paper investigates the use of richer syntactic dependencies in the
structured language model (SLM). We present two simple methods of enriching the
dependencies in the syntactic parse trees used for intializing the SLM. We
evaluate the impact of both methods on the perplexity (PPL) and
word-error-rate(WER, N-best rescoring) performance of the SLM. We show that the
new model achieves an improvement in PPL and WER over the baseline results
reported using the SLM on the UPenn Treebank and Wall Street Journal (WSJ)
corpora, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Advanced services require more reliable bandwidth than currently provided by
the Internet Protocol, even with the reliability enhancements provided by TCP.
More reliable bandwidth will be provided through QoS (quality of service), as
currently discussed widely. Yet QoS has some implications beyond providing
ubiquitous access to advance Internet service, which are of interest from a
policy perspective. In particular, what are the implications for price of
Internet services? Further, how will these changes impact demand and universal
service for the Internet. This paper explores the relationship between
certainty of bandwidth and certainty of price for Internet services over a
statistically shared network and finds that these are mutually exclusive goals.

 <dc:title>The Increased Need For FCC Merger Review In A Networked World</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Feld, Harold</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, the FCC announced a new standard for review in mergers. Under the
new standard, mass media mergers that comply with existing rules will
automaticly receive approval, while those that do not will receive a more
searching review. Common carrier mergers, however, will continue to receive the
4=part test established in Bell Atlantic/Nynex. The new standard fails to take
into account the complexities of the emerging, converged networked world, and
is essentially obsolete on arrival. Looking to those areas where Congress has
required an additional public interest review of mergers, a pattern emerges.
The emergence of vast, vertically integrated networks of content and conduit
fit the historic pattern of areas requiring piublic interest review and
re-enforce the need for increased, rather than decreased merger review.

 <dc:title>ENUM: The Collision of Telephony and DNS Policy</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cannon, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - General Literature</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>K.4.m Miscellaneous</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  ENUM marks either the convergence or collision of the public telephone
network with the Internet. ENUM is an innovation in the domain name system
(DNS). It starts with numerical domain names that are used to query DNS name
servers. The servers respond with address information found in DNS records.
This can be telephone numbers, email addresses, fax numbers, SIP addresses, or
other information. The concept is to use a single number in order to obtain a
plethora of contact information.
  By convention, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) ENUM Working Group
determined that an ENUM number would be the same numerical string as a
telephone number. In addition, the assignee of an ENUM number would be the
assignee of that telephone number. But ENUM could work with any numerical
string or, in fact, any domain name. The IETF is already working on using E.212
numbers with ENUM. [Abridged]

 <dc:description>  The approach for a network behavior description in terms of numerical
time-dependant functions of the protocol parameters is suggested. This provides
a basis for application of methods of mathematical and theoretical physics for
information flow analysis on network and for extraction of patterns of typical
network behavior. The information traffic can be described as a trajectory in
multi-dimensional parameter-time space with dimension about 10-12. Based on
this study some algorithms for the proposed intrusion detection system are
discussed.

 <dc:title>Structuring Business Metadata in Data Warehouse Systems for Effective
  Business Support</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Large organizations today are being served by different types of data
processing and informations systems, ranging from the operational (OLTP)
systems, data warehouse systems, to data mining and business intelligence
applications. It is important to create an integrated repository of what these
systems contain and do in order to use them collectively and effectively. The
repository contains metadata of source systems, data warehouse, and also the
business metadata. Decision support and business analysis require extensive and
in-depth understanding of business entities, tasks, rules and the environment.
The purpose of business metadata is to provide this understanding. Realizing
the importance of metadata, many standardization efforts has been initiated to
define metadata models. In trying to define an integrated metadata and
information systems for a banking application, we discover some important
limitations or inadequacies of the business metadata proposals. They relate to
providing an integrated and flexible inter-operability and navigation between
metadata and data, and to the important issue of systematically handling
temporal characteristics and evolution of the metadata itself.
  In this paper, we study the issue of structuring business metadata so that it
can provide a context for business management and decision support when
integrated with data warehousing. We define temporal object-oriented business
metadata model, and relate it both to the technical metadata and the data
warehouse. We also define ways of accessing and navigating metadata in
conjunction with data.

 <dc:description>  The process of evolutionary emergence of purposeful adaptive behavior is
investigated by means of computer simulations. The model proposed implies that
there is an evolving population of simple agents, which have two natural needs:
energy and reproduction. Any need is characterized quantitatively by a
corresponding motivation. Motivations determine goal-directed behavior of
agents. The model demonstrates that purposeful behavior does emerge in the
simulated evolutionary processes. Emergence of purposefulness is accompanied by
origin of a simple hierarchy in the control system of agents.

 <dc:description>  We show that partial evaluation can be usefully viewed as a programming model
for realizing mixed-initiative functionality in interactive applications.
Mixed-initiative interaction between two participants is one where the parties
can take turns at any time to change and steer the flow of interaction. We
concentrate on the facet of mixed-initiative referred to as `unsolicited
reporting' and demonstrate how out-of-turn interactions by users can be modeled
by `jumping ahead' to nested dialogs (via partial evaluation). Our approach
permits the view of dialog management systems in terms of their native support
for staging and simplifying interactions; we characterize three different
voice-based interaction technologies using this viewpoint. In particular, we
show that the built-in form interpretation algorithm (FIA) in the VoiceXML
dialog management architecture is actually a (well disguised) combination of an
interpreter and a partial evaluator.

 <dc:description>  The unification problem in algebras capable of describing sets has been
tackled, directly or indirectly, by many researchers and it finds important
applications in various research areas--e.g., deductive databases, theorem
proving, static analysis, rapid software prototyping. The various solutions
proposed are spread across a large literature. In this paper we provide a
uniform presentation of unification of sets, formalizing it at the level of set
theory. We address the problem of deciding existence of solutions at an
abstract level. This provides also the ability to classify different types of
set unification problems. Unification algorithms are uniformly proposed to
solve the unification problem in each of such classes.
  The algorithms presented are partly drawn from the literature--and properly
revisited and analyzed--and partly novel proposals. In particular, we present a
new goal-driven algorithm for general ACI1 unification and a new simpler
algorithm for general (Ab)(Cl) unification.

 <dc:description>  We propose pretty simple password-authenticated key-exchange protocol which
is based on the difficulty of solving DDH problem. It has the following
advantages: (1) Both $y_1$ and $y_2$ in our protocol are independent and thus
they can be pre-computed and can be sent independently. This speeds up the
protocol. (2) Clients and servers can use almost the same algorithm. This
reduces the implementation costs without accepting replay attacks and abuse of
entities as oracles.

we study the problem of recognizing those graphs for which that heuristic can
approximate the size of a minimum vertex cover within a constant factor of r,
where r is a fixed rational number. Our main results are that these problems
are complete for the class of problems solvable via parallel access to NP. To
achieve these main results, we also show that the restriction of the vertex
cover problem to those graphs for which either of these heuristics can find an
optimal solution remains NP-hard.

 <dc:title>Part-of-Speech Tagging with Two Sequential Transducers</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a method of constructing and using a cascade consisting of a left-
and a right-sequential finite-state transducer (FST), T1 and T2, for
part-of-speech (POS) disambiguation. Compared to an HMM, this FST cascade has
the advantage of significantly higher processing speed, but at the cost of
slightly lower accuracy. Applications such as Information Retrieval, where the
speed can be more important than accuracy, could benefit from this approach.
  In the process of tagging, we first assign every word a unique ambiguity
class c_i that can be looked up in a lexicon encoded by a sequential FST. Every
c_i is denoted by a single symbol, e.g. [ADJ_NOUN], although it represents a
set of alternative tags that a given word can occur with. The sequence of the
c_i of all words of one sentence is the input to our FST cascade. It is mapped
by T1, from left to right, to a sequence of reduced ambiguity classes r_i.
Every r_i is denoted by a single symbol, although it represents a set of
alternative tags. Intuitively, T1 eliminates the less likely tags from c_i,
thus creating r_i. Finally, T2 maps the sequence of r_i, from right to left, to
a sequence of single POS tags t_i. Intuitively, T2 selects the most likely t_i
from every r_i.
  The probabilities of all t_i, r_i, and c_i are used only at compile time, not
at run time. They do not (directly) occur in the FSTs, but are &quot;implicitly
contained&quot; in their structure.

 <dc:title>On Equivalence and Canonical Forms in the LF Type Theory</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Decidability of definitional equality and conversion of terms into canonical
form play a central role in the meta-theory of a type-theoretic logical
framework. Most studies of definitional equality are based on a confluent,
strongly-normalizing notion of reduction. Coquand has considered a different
approach, directly proving the correctness of a practical equivalance algorithm
based on the shape of terms. Neither approach appears to scale well to richer
languages with unit types or subtyping, and neither directly addresses the
problem of conversion to canonical.
  In this paper we present a new, type-directed equivalence algorithm for the
LF type theory that overcomes the weaknesses of previous approaches. The
algorithm is practical, scales to richer languages, and yields a new notion of
canonical form sufficient for adequate encodings of logical systems. The
algorithm is proved complete by a Kripke-style logical relations argument
similar to that suggested by Coquand. Crucially, both the algorithm itself and
the logical relations rely only on the shapes of types, ignoring dependencies
on terms.

 <dc:description>  A study on future large accelerators [1] has considered a facility, which is
designed, built and operated by a worldwide collaboration of equal partner
institutions, and which is remote from most of these institutions. The full
range of operation was considered including commi-ssioning, machine
development, maintenance, trouble shooting and repair. Experience from existing
accele-rators confirms that most of these activities are already performed
'remotely'. The large high-energy physics ex-periments and astronomy projects,
already involve inter-national collaborations of distant institutions. Based on
this experience, the prospects for a machine operated remotely from far sites
are encouraging. Experts from each laboratory would remain at their home
institution but continue to participate in the operation of the machine after
construction. Experts are required to be on site only during initial
commissioning and for par-ticularly difficult problems. Repairs require an
on-site non-expert maintenance crew. Most of the interventions can be made
without an expert and many of the rest resolved with remote assistance. There
appears to be no technical obstacle to controlling an accelerator from a
distance. The major challenge is to solve the complex management and
communication problems.

 <dc:description>  The spread of a finite set of points is the ratio between the longest and
shortest pairwise distances. We prove that the Delaunay triangulation of any
set of n points in R^3 with spread D has complexity O(D^3). This bound is tight
in the worst case for all D = O(sqrt{n}). In particular, the Delaunay
triangulation of any dense point set has linear complexity. We also generalize
this upper bound to regular triangulations of k-ply systems of balls, unions of
several dense point sets, and uniform samples of smooth surfaces. On the other
hand, for any n and D=O(n), we construct a regular triangulation of complexity
Omega(nD) whose n vertices have spread D.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of computing the second elementary symmetric
polynomial S^2_n(X) using depth-three arithmetic circuits of the form &quot;sum of
products of linear forms&quot;. We consider this problem over several fields and
determine EXACTLY the number of multiplication gates required. The lower bounds
are proved for inhomogeneous circuits where the linear forms are allowed to
have constants; the upper bounds are proved in the homogeneous model. For reals
and rationals, the number of multiplication gates required is exactly n-1; in
most other cases, it is \ceil{n/2}. This problem is related to the
Graham-Pollack theorem in algebraic graph theory. In particular, our results
answer the following question of Babai and Frankl: what is the minimum number
of complete bipartite graphs required to cover each edge of a complete graph an
odd number of times? We show that for infinitely many n, the answer is
\ceil{n/2}.

 <dc:description>  An important aspect of data integration involves answering queries using
various resources rather than by accessing database relations. The process of
transforming a query from the database relations to the resources is often
referred to as query folding or answering queries using views, where the views
are the resources. We present a uniform approach that includes as special cases
much of the previous work on this subject. Our approach is logic-based using
resolution. We deal with integrity constraints, negation, and recursion also
within this framework.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach to termination analysis of numerical computations
in logic programs. Traditional approaches fail to analyse them due to non
well-foundedness of the integers. We present a technique that allows overcoming
these difficulties. Our approach is based on transforming a program in a way
that allows integrating and extending techniques originally developed for
analysis of numerical computations in the framework of query-mapping pairs with
the well-known framework of acceptability. Such an integration not only
contributes to the understanding of termination behaviour of numerical
computations, but also allows us to perform a correct analysis of such
computations automatically, by extending previous work on a constraint-based
approach to termination. Finally, we discuss possible extensions of the
technique, including incorporating general term orderings.

 <dc:description>  The term {\em meta-programming} refers to the ability of writing programs
that have other programs as data and exploit their semantics.
  The aim of this paper is presenting a methodology allowing us to perform a
correct termination analysis for a broad class of practical meta-interpreters,
including negation and performing different tasks during the execution. It is
based on combining the power of general orderings, used in proving termination
of term-rewrite systems and programs, and on the well-known acceptability
condition, used in proving termination of logic programs.
  The methodology establishes a relationship between the ordering needed to
prove termination of the interpreted program and the ordering needed to prove
termination of the meta-interpreter together with this interpreted program. If
such a relationship is established, termination of one of those implies
termination of the other one, i.e., the meta-interpreter preserves termination.
  Among the meta-interpreters that are analysed correctly are a proof trees
constructing meta-interpreter, different kinds of tracers and reasoners.

 <dc:description>  Cross-validation is a useful and generally applicable technique often
employed in machine learning, including decision tree induction. An important
disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its
computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the
computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by
integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction
process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to
this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield.
The analysis is supported by experimental results.

 <dc:description>  Compile-time garbage collection (CTGC) is still a very uncommon feature
within compilers. In previous work we have developed a compile-time structure
reuse system for Mercury, a logic programming language. This system indicates
which datastructures can safely be reused at run-time. As preliminary
experiments were promising, we have continued this work and have now a working
and well performing near-to-ship CTGC-system built into the Melbourne Mercury
Compiler (MMC).
  In this paper we present the multiple design decisions leading to this
system, we report the results of using CTGC for a set of benchmarks, including
a real-world program, and finally we discuss further possible improvements.
Benchmarks show substantial memory savings and a noticeable reduction in
execution time.

 <dc:description>  For any fixed $k$, a remarkably simple single-tape Turing machine can
simulate $k$ independent counters in real time. Informally, a counter is a
storage unit that maintains a single integer (initially 0), incrementing it,
decrementing it, or reporting its sign (positive, negative, or zero) on
command. Any automaton that responds to each successive command as a counter
would is said to simulate a counter. (Only for a sign inquiry is the response
of interest, of course. And zeroness is the only real issue, since a simulator
can readily use zero detection to keep track of positivity and negativity in
finite-state control. In this paper we describe a remarkably simple real-time
simulation, based on just five simple rewriting rules, of any fixed number $k$
of independent counters. On a Turing machine with a single, binary work tape,
the simulation runs in real time, handling an arbitrary counter command at each
step. The space used by the simulation can be held to $(k+\epsilon) \log_2 n$
bits for the first $n$ commands, for any specified $\epsilon &gt; 0$.

 <dc:description>  We show that a Turing machine with two single-head one-dimensional tapes

time, although it can do so with three tapes, two two-dimensional tapes, or one
two-head tape, or in linear time with just one tape. In particular, this
settles the longstanding conjecture that a two-head Turing machine can
recognize more languages in real time if its heads are on the same
one-dimensional tape than if they are on separate one-dimensional tapes.

 <dc:description>  We present a new approach to formal language theory using Kolmogorov
complexity. The main results presented here are an alternative for pumping
lemma(s), a new characterization for regular languages, and a new method to
separate deterministic context-free languages and nondeterministic context-free
languages. The use of the new `incompressibility arguments' is illustrated by
many examples. The approach is also successful at the high end of the Chomsky
hierarchy since one can quantify nonrecursiveness in terms of Kolmogorov
complexity. (This is a preliminary uncorrected version. The final version is
the one published in SIAM J. Comput., 24:2(1995), 398-410.)

 <dc:description>  This work aims to make it easier for a specialist in one field to find and
explore ideas from another field which may be useful in solving a new problem
arising in his practice. It presents a methodology which serves to represent
the relationships that exist between concepts, problems, and solution patterns
from different fields of human activity in the form of a graph. Our approach is
based upon generalization and specialization relationships and problem solving.
It is simple enough to be understood quite easily, and general enough to enable
coherent integration of concepts and problems from virtually any field. We have
built an implementation which uses the World Wide Web as a support to allow
navigation between graph nodes and collaborative development of the graph.

 <dc:description>  There is much discussion and debate about how to improve the security and
privacy of mobile communication systems, both voice and data. Most proposals
attempt to provide incremental improvements to systems that are deployed today.
Indeed, only incremental improvements are possible, given the regulatory,
technological, economic, and historical structure of the telecommunications
system. In this paper, we conduct a ``thought experiment'' to redesign the
mobile communications system to provide a high level of security and privacy
for the users of the system. We discuss the important requirements and how a
different architecture might successfully satisfy them. In doing so, we hope to
illuminate the possibilities for secure and private systems, as well as explore
their real limits.

computers are being used to store vital and sensitive information the need for
secure computer systems becomes more apparent. These systems can be achieved
only through systematic design; they cannot be achieved through haphazard
seat-of-the-pants methods.This paper introduces some known threats to the
computer security, categorizes the threats, and analyses protection mechanisms
and techniques for countering the threats. The threats have been classified
more so as definitions and then followed by the classifications of these
threats. Also mentioned are the protection mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  EquiX is a search language for XML that combines the power of querying with
the simplicity of searching. Requirements for such languages are discussed and
it is shown that EquiX meets the necessary criteria. Both a graph-based
abstract syntax and a formal concrete syntax are presented for EquiX queries.
In addition, the semantics is defined and an evaluation algorithm is presented.
The evaluation algorithm is polynomial under combined complexity.
  EquiX combines pattern matching, quantification and logical expressions to
query both the data and meta-data of XML documents. The result of a query in
EquiX is a set of XML documents. A DTD describing the result documents is
derived automatically from the query.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to examine the major factors surrouding and
contributing to the creation (and success) of Europe's 2nd generation 'GSM'
cellular system, and compare and contrast it to key events and recent
developments in 3rd generation 'IMT-2000' systems. The objective is to
ascertain whether lessons from the development of one system can be applied to
the other, and what implications 2G has for the development and assessment of
3G technologies. Among the major themes incorporated into this assessment is
the concept of cooperation, and its role in bringing about the collaboration
and integration necessary to support the success of an international cellular
standard.

 <dc:description>  Conception, design, and implementation of cDNA microarray experiments present
a variety of bioinformatics challenges for biologists and computational
scientists. The multiple stages of data acquisition and analysis have motivated
the design of Expresso, a system for microarray experiment management. Salient
aspects of Expresso include support for clone replication and randomized
placement; automatic gridding, extraction of expression data from each spot,
and quality monitoring; flexible methods of combining data from individual
spots into information about clones and functional categories; and the use of
inductive logic programming for higher-level data analysis and mining. The
development of Expresso is occurring in parallel with several generations of
microarray experiments aimed at elucidating genomic responses to drought stress
in loblolly pine seedlings. The current experimental design incorporates 384
pine cDNAs replicated and randomly placed in two specific microarray layouts.
We describe the design of Expresso as well as results of analysis with Expresso
that suggest the importance of molecular chaperones and membrane transport
proteins in mechanisms conferring successful adaptation to long-term drought
stress.

 <dc:description>  In branching simulation, a novel approach to simulation presented in this
paper, a multiplicity of plausible scenarios are concurrently developed and
implemented. In conventional simulations of complex systems, there arise from
time to time uncertainties as to which of two or more alternatives are more
likely to be pursued by the system being simulated. Under these conditions the
simulationist makes a judicious choice of one of these alternatives and embeds
this choice in the simulation model. By contrast, in the branching approach,
two or more of such alternatives (or branches) are included in the model and
implemented for concurrent computer solution. The theoretical foundations for
branching simulation as a computational process are in the domains of
alternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Branching
simulations constitute the development of diagrams of scenarios representing
significant, alternative flows of events. Logical means for interpretation and
investigation of the branching simulation and prediction are provided by the
logical theories of possible worlds, which have been formalized by the
construction of logical varieties. Under certain conditions, the branching
approach can considerably enhance the efficiency of computer simulations and
provide more complete insights into the interpretation of predictions based on
simulations. As an example, the concepts developed in this paper have been
applied to a simulation task that plays an important role in radiology - the
noninvasive treatment of brain aneurysms.

 <dc:description>  In the graph avoidance game two players alternatingly color edges of a graph
G in red and in blue respectively. The player who first creates a monochromatic
subgraph isomorphic to a forbidden graph F loses. A symmetric strategy of the
second player ensures that, independently of the first player's strategy, the
blue and the red subgraph are isomorphic after every round of the game. We
address the class of those graphs G that admit a symmetric strategy for all F
and discuss relevant graph-theoretic and complexity issues. We also show
examples when, though a symmetric strategy on G generally does not exist, it is
still available for a particular F.

 <dc:description>  We aim at finding the minimal set of fragments which achieves maximal parse
accuracy in Data Oriented Parsing. Experiments with the Penn Wall Street
Journal treebank show that counts of almost arbitrary fragments within parse
trees are important, leading to improved parse accuracy over previous models
tested on this treebank (a precision of 90.8% and a recall of 90.6%). We
isolate some dependency relations which previous models neglect but which
contribute to higher parse accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Structured language models for speech recognition have been shown to remedy
the weaknesses of n-gram models. All current structured language models are,
however, limited in that they do not take into account dependencies between
non-headwords. We show that non-headword dependencies contribute to
significantly improved word error rate, and that a data-oriented parsing model
trained on semantically and syntactically annotated data can exploit these
dependencies. This paper also contains the first DOP model trained by means of
a maximum likelihood reestimation procedure, which solves some of the
theoretical shortcomings of previous DOP models.

 <dc:description>  The web, through many search engine sites, has popularized the keyword-based
search paradigm, where a user can specify a string of keywords and expect to
retrieve relevant documents, possibly ranked by their relevance to the query.
Since a lot of information is stored in databases (and not as HTML documents),
it is important to provide a similar search paradigm for databases, where users
can query a database without knowing the database schema and database query
languages such as SQL. In this paper, we propose such a database search system,
which accepts a free-form query as a collection of keywords, translates it into
queries on the database using the database metadata, and presents query results
in a well-structured and browsable form. Th eysytem maps keywords onto the
database schema and uses inter-relationships (i.e., data semantics) among the
referred tables to generate meaningful query results. We also describe our
prototype for database search, called Mragyati. Th eapproach proposed here is
scalable, as it does not build an in-memory graph of the entire database for
searching for relationships among the objects selected by the user's query.

 <dc:description>  The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined
categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last ten years, due to the
increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to
organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem
is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process
automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified
documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this
approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual
definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness,
considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and straightforward
portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to
text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will
discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely
document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm to unfold any triangulated 2-manifold (in particular,
any simplicial polyhedron) into a non-overlapping, connected planar layout in
linear time. The manifold is cut only along its edges. The resulting layout is
connected, but it may have a disconnected interior; the triangles are connected
at vertices, but not necessarily joined along edges. We extend our algorithm to
establish a similar result for simplicial manifolds of arbitrary dimension.

 <dc:description>  This study applies the RBF wavelet series to the evaluation of analytical
solutions of linear time-dependent wave and diffusion problems of any
dimensionality and geometry. To the best of the author's knowledge, such
analytical solutions have never been achieved before. The RBF wavelets can be
understood an alternative for multidimensional problems to the standard Fourier
series via fundamental and general solutions of partial differential equation.
The present RBF wavelets are infinitely differential, compactly supported,
orthogonal over different scales and very simple. The rigorous mathematical
proof of completeness and convergence is still missing in this study. The
present work may open a new window to numerical solution and theoretical
analysis of many other high-dimensional time-dependent PDE problems under
arbitrary geometry.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the complexity of solving linear programming
problems with a set of differential equations that converge to a fixed point
that represents the optimal solution. Assuming a probabilistic model, where the
inputs are i.i.d. Gaussian variables, we compute the distribution of the
convergence rate to the attracting fixed point. Using the framework of Random
Matrix Theory, we derive a simple expression for this distribution in the
asymptotic limit of large problem size. In this limit, we find that the
distribution of the convergence rate is a scaling function, namely it is a
function of one variable that is a combination of three parameters: the number
of variables, the number of constraints and the convergence rate, rather than a
function of these parameters separately. We also estimate numerically the
distribution of computation times, namely the time required to reach a vicinity
of the attracting fixed point, and find that it is also a scaling function.
Using the problem size dependence of the distribution functions, we derive high
probability bounds on the convergence rates and on the computation times.

 <dc:description>  This paper provides an overall presentation of the M-PIRO project. M-PIRO is
developing technology that will allow museums to generate automatically textual
or spoken descriptions of exhibits for collections available over the Web or in
virtual reality environments. The descriptions are generated in several
languages from information in a language-independent database and small
fragments of text, and they can be tailored according to the backgrounds of the
users, their ages, and their previous interaction with the system. An authoring
tool allows museum curators to update the system's database and to control the
language and content of the resulting descriptions. Although the project is
still in progress, a Web-based demonstrator that supports English, Greek and
Italian is already available, and it is used throughout the paper to highlight
the capabilities of the emerging technology.

undergraduate and junior graduate classes in parallel programming. We briefly
introduce the OpenMP standard and discuss why we have chosen to use it in
parallel programming classes. Advantages of using OpenMP over message passing
methods are discussed. We also include a brief enumeration of some of the
drawbacks of using OpenMP and how these drawbacks are being addressed by
supplementing OpenMP with additional MPI codes and projects. Several projects
given in my class are also described in this paper.

 <dc:description>Comment: 19 pages, 20 figures. Revised version makes two corrections: The
  statement of the old Lemma 14 was incorrect. It has been corrected and merged
  with Lemma 13 now. Second, Figure 19 (a skew quadrilateral) was incorrect,
  and is now removed. It played no substantive role in the proofs</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  The paper is concerned with defining the electrical signals and their models.
The delays are discussed, the asynchronous automata - which are the models of
the asynchronous circuits - and the examples of the clock generator and of the
R-S latch are given. We write the equations of the asynchronous automata, which
combine the pure delay model and the inertial delay model; the simple gate
model and the complex gate model; the fixed, bounded and unbounded delay model.
We give the solutions of these equations, which are written on R-&gt;{0,1}
functions, where R is the time set. The connection between the real time and
the discrete time is discussed. The stability, the fundamental mode of
operation, the combinational automata, the semi-modularity are defined and
characterized. Some connections are suggested with the linear time and the
branching time temporal logic of the propositions.

 <dc:description>  The paper presents the differential equations that characterize an

are made on the connection between the continuous time and the discrete time of
the approach. The continuous and the discrete time, the linear and the
branching temporal logics have the semantics depending on x and their formulas
give the properties of the automaton.

 <dc:description>  We show that it is decidable whether a transitive mixed linear relation has
an $\omega$-chain. Using this result, we study a number of liveness
verification problems for generalized timed automata within a unified
framework. More precisely, we prove that (1) the mixed linear liveness problem
for a timed automaton with dense clocks, reversal-bounded counters, and a free
counter is decidable, and (2) the Presburger liveness problem for a timed
automaton with discrete clocks, reversal-bounded counters, and a pushdown stack
is decidable.

 <dc:description>  The Allen-Bradley ControlLogix line of pro-grammable logic controllers (PLCs)
offers several in-terfaces: Ethernet, ControlNet, DeviceNet, RS-232 and others.
The ControlLogix Ethernet interface module 1756-ENET uses EtherNet/IP, the
ControlNet protocol, encapsulated in Ethernet packages, with specific service
codes. A driver for the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System
(EPICS) has been developed that utilizes this EtherNet/IP protocol for
controllers running the vxWorks RTOS as well as a Win32 and Unix/Linux test
program. Features, per-formance and limitations of this interface are
presented.

environment to develop their logic. An ActiveX interface is presented that
allows integration into a plant-wide distributed environment based on the

 <dc:description>  The starting point of this paper is the introduction of a new measure of
inclusion of fuzzy set A in fuzzy set B. Previously used inclusion measures
take values in the interval [0,1]; the inclusion measure proposed here takes
values in a Boolean lattice. In other words, inclusion is viewed as an L-fuzzy
valued relation between fuzzy sets. This relation is re exive, antisymmetric
and transitive, i.e. it is a fuzzy order relation; in addition it possesess a
number of properties which various authors have postulated as axiomatically
appropriate for an inclusion measure. We also define an L-fuzzy valued measure
of similarity between fuzzy sets and and an L-fuzzy valued distance function
between fuzzy sets; these possess properties analogous to the ones of
real-valued similarity and distance functions.
  Keywords: Fuzzy Relations, inclusion measure, subsethood, L-fuzzy sets,
similarity, distance, transitivity.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of combining the outcomes of several different
classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some
constraints. In particular, we develop two general approaches for an important
subproblem-identifying phrase structure. The first is a Markovian approach that
extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observation structure and of
general classifiers to model state-observation dependencies. The second is an
extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms. We develop efficient
combination algorithms under both models and study them experimentally in the
context of shallow parsing.

 <dc:description>  The Relational Database Aspects of Argonnes ATLAS Control System Argonnes
ATLAS (Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System) control system comprises two
separate database concepts. The first is the distributed real-time database
structure provided by the commercial product Vsystem [1]. The second is a more
static relational database archiving system designed by ATLAS personnel using
Oracle Rdb [2] and Paradox [3] software. The configuration of the ATLAS
facility has presented a unique opportunity to construct a control system
relational database that is capable of storing and retrieving complete archived
tune-up configurations for the entire accelerator. This capability has been a
major factor in allowing the facility to adhere to a rigorous operating
schedule. Most recently, a Web-based operator interface to the control systems
Oracle Rdb database has been installed. This paper explains the history of the
ATLAS database systems, how they interact with each other, the design of the
new Web-based operator interface, and future plans.

 <dc:description>  Developing real-time automated test systems for embedded control systems has
been a real problem. Some engineers and scientists have used customized
software and hardware as a solution, which can be very expensive and time
consuming to develop. We have discovered how to integrate a suite of
commercially available off-the-shelf software tools and hardware to develop a
scalable test platform that is capable of performing complete black-box testing
for a dual-channel real-time Embedded-PLC-based control system
(www.aps.anl.gov). We will discuss how the Vali/Test Pro testing methodology
was implemented to structure testing for a personnel safety system with large
quantities of requirements and test cases.

 <dc:description>  Since Self-Describing Data Sets (SDDS) were first introduced, the source code
has been ported to many different operating systems and various languages. SDDS
is now available in C, Tcl, Java, Fortran, and Python. All of these versions
are supported on Solaris, Linux, and Windows. The C version of SDDS is also
supported on VxWorks. With the recent addition of the Java port, SDDS can now
be deployed on virtually any operating system. Due to this proliferation, SDDS
files serve to link not only a collection of C programs, but programs and
scripts in many languages on different operating systems. The platform
independent binary feature of SDDS also facilitates portability among operating
systems. This paper presents an overview of various benefits of SDDS platform
interoperability.

 <dc:description>  Personalization customizes information access. The PIPE (&quot;Personalization is
Partial Evaluation&quot;) modeling methodology represents interaction with an
information space as a program. The program is then specialized to a user's
known interests or information seeking activity by the technique of partial
evaluation. In this paper, we elaborate PIPE by considering requirements
analysis in the personalization lifecycle. We investigate the use of scenarios
as a means of identifying and analyzing personalization requirements. As our
first result, we show how designing a PIPE representation can be cast as a
search within a space of PIPE models, organized along a partial order. This
allows us to view the design of a personalization system, itself, as
specialized interpretation of an information space. We then exploit the
underlying equivalence of explanation-based generalization (EBG) and partial
evaluation to realize high-level goals and needs identified in scenarios; in
particular, we specialize (personalize) an information space based on the
explanation of a user scenario in that information space, just as EBG
specializes a theory based on the explanation of an example in that theory. In
this approach, personalization becomes the transformation of information spaces
to support the explanation of usage scenarios. An example application is
described.

 <dc:description>  The machines and beamlines controlled by VME industrial networks are very
popular in accelerator faculties. Recently new software technology, among of
which are Internet/Intranet application, Java language, and distributed
calculating environment, changes the control manner rapidly. A program based on
DCOM is composed to control of a variable included angle spherical grating
monochromator beamline at National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) in
China. The control computer with a residential DCOM program is connected to
Intranet by LAN, over which the user-end-operating program located in another
computer sends driving beamline units' commands to the control computer. And
also a web page coded in Java, published by the WWW service running in the
control computer, is simply illustrated how to use web browser to query the
states of or to control the beamline units.

 <dc:title>On the complexity of inducing categorical and quantitative association

 <dc:description>  Inducing association rules is one of the central tasks in data mining
applications. Quantitative association rules induced from databases describe
rich and hidden relationships holding within data that can prove useful for
various application purposes (e.g., market basket analysis, customer profiling,
and others). Even though such association rules are quite widely used in
practice, a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of inducing them
is missing. This paper intends to provide a contribution in this setting. To
this end, we first formally define quantitative association rule mining
problems, which entail boolean association rules as a special case, and then
analyze their computational complexities, by considering both the standard
cases, and a some special interesting case, that is, association rule induction
over databases with null values, fixed-size attribute set databases, sparse
databases, fixed threshold problems.

 <dc:description>  Abduction, first proposed in the setting of classical logics, has been
studied with growing interest in the logic programming area during the last
years.
  In this paper we study {\em abduction with penalization} in logic
programming. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously
analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant
problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal
model for abduction with penalization from logic programs, which extends the
abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We show the high
expressiveness of this formalism, by encoding a couple of relevant problems,
including the well-know Traveling Salesman Problem from optimization theory, in
this abductive framework. The resulting encodings are very simple and elegant.
We analyze the complexity of the main decisional problems arising in this
framework. An interesting result in this course is that ``negation comes for
free.'' Indeed, the addition of (even unstratified) negation does not cause any
further increase to the complexity of the abductive reasoning tasks (which
remains the same as for not-free programs).

(hereafter GSA for short). GSA integrates and enhances several search
techniques in order to achieve significant improvements in the user-perceived
quality of delivered information as compared to usual web search engines. GSA
features intelligent merging of relevant documents from different search
engines, anticipated selective exploration and evaluation of links from the
current result set, automated derivation of refined queries based on user
relevance feedback. System architecture as well as experimental accounts are
also illustrated.

 <dc:description>  The strategy used to develop the NIF Integrated Computer Control System
(ICCS) calls for incremental cycles of construction and formal test to deliver
a total of 1 million lines of code. Each incremental release takes four to six
months to implement specific functionality and culminates when offline tests
conducted in the ICCS Integration and Test Facility verify functional,
performance, and interface requirements. Tests are then repeated on line to
confirm integrated operation in dedicated laser laboratories or ultimately in
the NIF. Test incidents along with other change requests are recorded and
tracked to closure by the software change control board (SCCB). Annual
independent audits advise management on software process improvements.
Extensive experience has been gained by integrating controls in the prototype
laser preamplifier laboratory. The control system installed in the preamplifier
lab contains five of the ten planned supervisory subsystems and seven of
sixteen planned front-end processors (FEPs). Beam alignment, timing, diagnosis
and laser pulse amplification up to 20 joules was tested through an automated
series of shots. Other laboratories have provided integrated testing of six
additional FEPs. Process measurements including earned-value, product size, and
defect densities provide software project controls and generate confidence that
the control system will be successfully deployed.

 <dc:description>  Visual DCT is an EPICS configuration tool completely written in Java and
therefore supported in various systems. It was developed to provide features
missing in existing configuration tools as Capfast and GDCT. Visually Visual
DCT resembles GDCT - records can be created, moved and linked, fields and links
can be easily modified. But Visual DCT offers more: using groups, records can
be grouped together in a logical block, which allows a hierarchical design.
Additionally indication of data flow direction using arrows makes the design
easier to understand. Visual DCT has a powerful DB parser, which allows
importing existing DB and DBD files. Output file is also DB file, all comments
and record order is preserved and visual data saved as comment, which allows
DBs to be edited in other tools or manually. Great effort has been taken and
many tricks used to optimize the performance in order to compensate for the
fact that Java is an interpreted language.

 <dc:description>  The NIF Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) application software uses a
set of service frameworks that assures uniform behavior spanning the front-end
processors (FEPs) and supervisor programs. This uniformity is visible both in
the way each program employs shared services and in the flexibility it affords
for attaching graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Uniformity of structure across
applications is desired for the benefit of programmers who will be maintaining
the many programs that constitute the ICCS. In this paper, the framework
components that have the greatest impact on the application structure are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  First Experiences Integrating PC Distributed I/O Into Argonne's ATLAS Control
System The roots of ATLAS (Argonne Tandem-Linac Accelerator System) date back
to the early 1960s. Located at the Argonne National Laboratory, the accelerator
has been designated a National User Facility, which focuses primarily on
heavy-ion nuclear physics. Like the accelerator it services, the control system
has been in a constant state of evolution. The present real-time portion of the
control system is based on the commercial product Vsystem [1]. While Vsystem
has always been capable of distributed I/O processing, the latest offering of
this product provides for the use of relatively inexpensive PC hardware and
software. This paper reviews the status of the ATLAS control system, and
describes first experiences with PC distributed I/O.

workstation with PENTIUM-4 CPU is used for the database server. In this paper,
the current status of SSTF DAC system, the database management system and
recent test results are presented.

 <dc:description>  The Swiss Light Source (SLS) has in the order of 500 magnet power supplies
(PS) installed, ranging from from 3 A/20 V four-quadrant PS to a 950 A/1000 V
two-quadrant 3 Hz PS. All magnet PS have a local digital controller for a
digital regulation loop and a 5 MHz optical point-to-point link to the VME
level. The PS controller is running a pulse width/pulse repetition regulation
scheme, optional with multiple slave regulation loops. Many internal regulation
parameters and controller diagnostics are readable by the control system.
Industry Pack modules with standard VME carrier cards are used as VME hardware
interface with the high control density of eight links per VME card. The low
level EPICS interface is identical for all 500 magnet PS, including insertion
devices. The digital PS have proven to be very stable and reliable during
commissioning of the light source. All specifications were met for all PS. The
advanced diagnostic for the magnet PS turned out to be very useful not only for
the diagnostic of the PS but also to identify problems on the magnets.

 <dc:description>  The Gemini Observatory is planning to implement a Multi Conjugate Adaptive
Optics (MCAO) System as a facility instrument for the Gemini-South telescope.
The system will include 5 Laser Guide Stars, 3 Natural Guide Stars, and 3
Deformable mirrors optically conjugated at different altitudes to achieve
near-uniform atmospheric compensation over a 1 arc minute square field of view.
The control of such a system will be split into 3 main functions: the control
of the opto-mechanical assemblies of the whole system (including the Laser, the
Beam Transfer Optics and the Adaptive Optics bench), the control of the
Adaptive Optics System itself at a rate of 800FPS and the control of the safety
system. The control of the Adaptive Optics System is the most critical in terms
of real time performances. The control system will be an EPICS based system. In
this paper, we will describe the requirements for the whole MCAO control
system, preliminary designs for the control of the opto-mechanical devices and
architecture options for the control of the Adaptive Optics system and the
safety system.

 <dc:title>System Integration of High Level Applications during the Commissioning
  of the Swiss Light Source</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Luedeke, A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>J.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The commissioning of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) started in Feb. 2000 with
the Linac, continued in May 2000 with the booster synchrotron and by Dec. 2000
first light in the storage ring were produced. The first four beam lines had to
be operational by August 2001. The thorough integration of all subsystems to
the control system and a high level of automation was prerequisite to meet the
tight time schedule. A careful balanced distribution of functionality into high
level and low level applications allowed an optimization of short development
cycles and high reliability of the applications. High level applications were
implemented as CORBA based client/server applications (tcl/tk and Java based
clients, C++ based servers), IDL applications using EZCA, medm/dm2k screens and
tcl/tk applications using CDEV. Low level applications were mainly built as
EPICS process databases, SNL state machines and customized drivers.
Functionality of the high level application was encapsulated and pushed to
lower levels whenever it has proven to be adequate. That enabled to reduce
machine setups to a handful of physical parameters and allow the usage of
standard EPICS tools for display, archiving and processing of complex physical
values. High reliability and reproducibility were achieved with that approach.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to develop an approach to visualizations that
benefits from distributed computing. Three schemes of process distribution are
considered: parallel, pipeline, and expanding pipeline computations. Expanding
pipeline structure synthesizes the advantages and traits of both parallel and
pipeline computations. In expanding pipeline computing, a novel approach
presented in this paper, a multiplicity of processes are concurrently developed
in parallel and knotted processor pipelines. The theoretical foundations for
expanding pipeline computing as a computational process are in the domains of
alternating Turing machines, molecular computing, and E-machines. Expanding
pipeline computing constitutes the development of the conventional pipeline
architecture aimed at utilization of implicit parallel structures existing in
algorithms. Such structures appear in various kinds of visualization. Image
deriving and processing is a field that provides diverse opportunities for
utilization of the advantages of distributed computing. The most relevant to
the distributed architecture is stratified visualization with its two cases
based on data localization and layer separation. Visualization is treated here
as a special case of simulation. The conceptual approach to distributed
computing developed in this paper have been applied to visualization in a
computer support system, which is utilized in radiology and namely, for the
noninvasive treatment of brain aneurysms.

 <dc:description>  The control system (TICS) for the test interferometer being built to support
the development of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)will itself be a
prototype for the final ALMA array, providing a test for the distributed
control system under development. TICS will be based on the ALMA Common
Software (ACS) (developed at the European Southern Observatory), which provides
CORBA-based services and a device management framework for the control
software.
  Simple device controllers will run on single board computers, one of which
(known as an LCU) is located at each antenna; whereas complex, compound device
controllers may run on centrally located computers. In either circumstance,
client programs may obtain direct CORBA references to the devices and their
properties. Monitor and control requests are sent to devices or properties,
which then process and forward the commands to the appropriate hardware devices
as required. Timing requirements are met by tagging commands with (future)
timestamps synchronized to a timing pulse, which is regulated by a central
reference generator, and is distributed to all hardware devices in the array.
Monitoring is provided through a publish/subscribe CORBA-based service.

 <dc:description>  There has been a widespread emergence of computing devices in the past few
years that go beyond the capabilities of traditional desktop computers.
However, users want to use the same kinds of applications and access the same
data and information on these appliances that they can access on their desktop
computers. The user interfaces for these platforms go beyond the traditional
interaction metaphors. It is a challenge to build User Interfaces (UIs) for
these devices of differing capabilities that allow the end users to perform the
same kinds of tasks. The User Interface Markup Language (UIML) is an XML-based
language that allows the canonical description of UIs for different platforms.
We describe the language features of UIML that facilitate the development of
multi-platform UIs. We also describe the key aspects of our approach that makes
UIML succeed where previous approaches failed, namely the division in the
representation of a UI, the use of a generic vocabulary, and an integrated
development environment specifically designed for transformation-based UI
development. Finally we describe the initial details of a multi-step usability
engineering process for building multi-platform UI using UIML.

 <dc:description>  The set of externally visible properties associated with process variables in
the Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System (EPICS) is predefined in
the EPICS base distribution and is therefore not extensible by plug-compatible
applications. We believe that this approach, while practical for early versions
of the system with a smaller user base, is now severely limiting expansion of
the high-level application tool set for EPICS. To eliminate existing barriers,
we propose a new C++ based interface to abstract containerized data. This paper
describes the new interface, its application to message passing in distributed
systems, its application to direct communication between tightly coupled
programs co-resident in an address space, and its paramount position in an
emerging role for EPICS - the integration of dissimilar systems.

 <dc:description>  The beamline network system at SPring-8 consists of three LANs; a BL-LAN for
beamline component control, a BL-USER-LAN for beamline experimental users and
an OA-LAN for the information services. These LANs are interconnected by a
firewall system. Since the network traffic and the number of beamlines have
increased, we upgraded the backbone of BL-USER-LAN from Fast Ethernet to
Gigabit Ethernet. And then, to establish the independency of a beamline and to
raise flexibility of every beamline, we also introduced the IEEE802.1Q Virtual
LAN (VLAN) technology into the BL-USER-LAN. We discuss here a future plan to
build the firewall system with hardware load balancers.

 <dc:description>  Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have provided Thomas Jefferson
National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) with versatile VME-based data
acquisition and control interfaces with minimal development times. FPGA designs
have been used to interface to VME and provide control logic for numerous
systems. The building blocks of these logic designs can be tailored to the
individual needs of each system and provide system operators with read-backs
and controls via a VME interface to an EPICS based computer. This versatility
allows the system developer to choose components and define operating
parameters and options that are not readily available commercially. Jefferson
Lab has begun developing standard FPGA libraries that result in quick turn
around times and inexpensive designs.

 <dc:description>  A Dual Digital Signal Processing VME Board was developed for the Continuous
Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) Beam Current Monitor (BCM) system at
Jefferson Lab. It is a versatile general-purpose digital signal processing
board using an open architecture, which allows for adaptation to various
applications. The base design uses two independent Texas Instrument (TI)
TMS320C6711, which are 900 MFLOPS floating-point digital signal processors
(DSP). Applications that require a fixed point DSP can be implemented by
replacing the baseline DSP with the pin-for-pin compatible TMS320C6211. The
design can be manufactured with a reduced chip set without redesigning the
printed circuit board. For example it can be implemented as a single-channel
DSP with no analog I/O.

 <dc:description>  The Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) is based on a scalable software
framework that is distributed over some 325 computers throughout the NIF
facility. The framework provides templates and services at multiple levels of
abstraction for the construction of software applications that communicate via
CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture). Various forms of
object-oriented software design patterns are implemented as templates to be
extended by application software. Developers extend the framework base classes
to model the numerous physical control points, thereby sharing the
functionality defined by the base classes. About 56,000 software objects each
individually addressed through CORBA are to be created in the complete ICCS.
Most objects have a persistent state that is initialized at system start-up and
stored in a database. Additional framework services are provided by centralized
server programs that implement events, alerts, reservations, message logging,
database/file persistence, name services, and process management. The ICCS
software framework approach allows for efficient construction of a software
system that supports a large number of distributed control points representing
a complex control application.

 <dc:description>  he ESRF control system is in the process of being modernised. The present
contrsystem is based on VME, 10 MHz Ethernet, OS9, Solaris, HP-UX, NFS/RPC,
Motif and C. The new control system will be based on compact PCI, 100 MHz
Ethernet, Linux, Windows, Solaris, CORBA/IIOP, C++, Java and Python. The main
frontend operating system will be GNU/Linux running on Intel/x86 and
Motorola/68k. Linux will also be used on handheld devices for mobile control.
This poster describes how GNU/Linux is being used to modernise the control
system and what problems have been encountered so far

 <dc:description>  The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is successfully used in
many control systems (CS) for data transfer and device modeling. Communication
rates below 1 millisecond, high reliability, scalability, language independence
and other features make it very attractive. For common types of applications
like error logging, alarm messaging or slow monitoring, one can benefit from
standard CORBA services that are implemented by third parties and save
tremendous amount of developing time. We have started using few CORBA services
on our previous CORBA-based control system for the light source ANKA [1] and
use now several CORBA services for the ALMA Common Software (ACS) [2], the core
of the control system of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array. Our experiences
with the interface repository (IFR), the implementation repository, the naming
service, the property service, telecom log service and the notify service from
different vendors are presented. Performance and scalability benchmarks have
been performed.

 <dc:title>Open Source Real Time Operating Systems Overview</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Straumann, Till</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Operating Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>D.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modern control systems applications are often built on top of a real time
operating system (RTOS) which provides the necessary hardware abstraction as
well as scheduling, networking and other services. Several open source RTOS
solutions are publicly available, which is very attractive, both from an
economic (no licensing fees) as well as from a technical (control over the
source code) point of view. This contribution gives an overview of the RTLinux
and RTEMS systems (architecture, development environment, API etc.). Both
systems feature most popular CPUs, several APIs (including Posix), networking,
portability and optional commercial support. Some performance figures are
presented, focusing on interrupt latency and context switching delay.

 <dc:description>  Data Access will be the next generation data abstraction layer for EPICS. Its
implementation in C++ brought up a number of issues that are related to object
oriented technology's impact on CPU and memory usage.
  What is gained by the new abstract interface? What is the price that has to
be paid for these gains? What compromises seem applicable and affordable?
  This paper discusses tests that have been made about performance and memory
usage as well as the different measures that have been taken to optimize the
situation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a set of tools for providing user-friendly
explanations in an explanation-based constraint programming system. The idea is
to represent the constraints of a problem as an hierarchy (a tree). Users are
then represented as a set of understandable nodes in that tree (a cut).
Classical explanations (sets of system constraints) just need to get projected
on that representation in order to be understandable by any user. We present
here the main interests of this idea.

 <dc:title>Arc consistency for soft constraints</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The notion of arc consistency plays a central role in constraint
satisfaction. It is known that the notion of local consistency can be extended
to constraint optimisation problems defined by soft constraint frameworks based
on an idempotent cost combination operator. This excludes non idempotent
operators such as + which define problems which are very important in practical
applications such as Max-CSP, where the aim is to minimize the number of
violated constraints. In this paper, we show that using a weak additional axiom
satisfied by most existing soft constraints proposals, it is possible to define
a notion of soft arc consistency that extends the classical notion of arc
consistency and this even in the case of non idempotent cost combination
operators. A polynomial time algorithm for enforcing this soft arc consistency
exists and its space and time complexities are identical to that of enforcing
arc consistency in CSPs when the cost combination operator is strictly
monotonic (for example Max-CSP). A directional version of arc consistency is
potentially even stronger than the non-directional version, since it allows non
local propagation of penalties. We demonstrate the utility of directional arc
consistency by showing that it not only solves soft constraint problems on
trees, but that it also implies a form of local optimality, which we call arc
irreducibility.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present CIDER (Curry Integrated Development EnviRonment), an
analysis and programming environment for the declarative multi-paradigm
language Curry. CIDER is a graphical environment to support the development of
Curry programs by providing integrated tools for the analysis and visualization
of programs. CIDER is completely implemented in Curry using libraries for GUI
programming (based on Tcl/Tk) and meta-programming. An important aspect of our
environment is the possible adaptation of the development environment to other
declarative source languages (e.g., Prolog or Haskell) and the extensibility
w.r.t. new analysis methods. To support the latter feature, the lazy evaluation
strategy of the underlying implementation language Curry becomes quite useful.

 <dc:description>  Environments for systematic construction of logic programs are needed in the
academy as well as in the industry. Such environments should support well
defined construction methods and should be able to be extended and interact
with other programming tools like debuggers and compilers. We present a variant
of the Deville methodology for logic program development, and the design of a
tool for supporting the methodology. Our aim is to facilitate the learning of
logic programming and to set the basis of more sophisticated tools for program
development.

 <dc:description>  The Eleventh Workshop on Logic Programming Environments (WLPE'01) was one in
a series of international workshops in the topic area. It was held on December
1, 2001 in Paphos, Cyprus as a post-conference workshop at ICLP 2001. Eight
refereed papers were presented at the conference. A majority of the papers
involved, in some way, constraint logic programming and tools for software
development. Other topics areas addressed include execution visualization,
instructional aids (for learning users), software maintenance (including
debugging), and provisions for new paradigms.

 <dc:description>  Developing and maintaining CLP programs requires visualization and
explanation tools. However, existing tools are built in an ad hoc way.
Therefore porting tools from one platform to another is very difficult. We have
shown in previous work that, from a fine-grained execution trace, a number of
interesting views about logic program executions could be generated by trace
analysis.
  In this article, we propose a trace model for constraint solving by
narrowing. This trace model is the first one proposed for CLP(FD) and does not
pretend to be the ultimate one. We also propose an instrumented
meta-interpreter in order to experiment with the model. Furthermore, we show
that the proposed trace model contains the necessary information to build known
and useful execution views. This work sets the basis for generic execution
analysis of CLP(FD) programs.

 <dc:description>  The SNS has developed a standard power supply interface for the approximately
350 magnet power supplies in the SNS accumulator ring, Linac and transport
lines. Power supply manufacturers are providing supplies compatible with the
standard interface. The SNS standard consists of a VME based power supply
controller module (PSC) and a power supply interface unit (PSI) that mounts on
the power supply. Communication between the two is via a pair of multimode
fibers. This PSI/PSC system supports one 16-bit analog reference, four 16-bit
analog readbacks, fifteen digital commands and sixteen digital status bits in a
single fiber-isolated module. The system can send commands to the supplies and
read data from them synchronized to an external signal at up to a 10KHz rate.
The PSC time stamps and stores this data in a circular buffer so historical
data leading up to a fault event can be analyzed. The PSC contains a serial
port so that local testing of hardware can be accomplished with a laptop. This
paper concentrates on the software being provided to control the power supply.
It includes the EPICS driver; software to test hardware and power supplies via
the serial port and VME interface.

 <dc:description>  The Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) for the National Ignition
Facility (NIF) is a layered architecture of 300 front-end processors (FEP)
coordinated by supervisor subsystems including automatic beam alignment and
wavefront control, laser and target diagnostics, pulse power, and shot control
timed to 30 ps. FEP computers incorporate either VxWorks on PowerPC or Solaris
on UltraSPARC processors that interface to over 45,000 control points attached
to VME-bus or PCI-bus crates respectively. Typical devices are stepping motors,
transient digitizers, calorimeters, and photodiodes. The front-end layer is
divided into another segment comprised of an additional 14,000 control points
for industrial controls including vacuum, argon, synthetic air, and safety
interlocks implemented with Allen-Bradley programmable logic controllers
(PLCs). The computer network is augmented asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) that
delivers video streams from 500 sensor cameras monitoring the 192 laser beams
to operator workstations. Software is based on an object-oriented framework
using CORBA distribution that incorporates services for archiving, machine
configuration, graphical user interface, monitoring, event logging, scripting,
alert management, and access control. Software coding using a mixed language
environment of Ada95 and Java is one-third complete at over 300 thousand source
lines. Control system installation is currently under way for the first 8
beams, with project completion scheduled for 2008.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to present some functionalities of the HyperPro
System. HyperPro is a hypertext tool which allows to develop Constraint Logic
Programming (CLP) together with their documentation. The text editing part is
not new and is based on the free software Thot. A HyperPro program is a Thot
document written in a report style. The tool is designed for CLP but it can be
adapted to other programming paradigms as well. Thot offers navigation and
editing facilities and synchronized static document views. HyperPro has new
functionalities such as document exportations, dynamic views (projections),
indexes and version management. Projection is a mechanism for extracting and
exporting relevant pieces of code program or of document according to specific
criteria. Indexes are useful to find the references and occurrences of a
relation in a document, i.e., where its predicate definition is found and where
a relation is used in other programs or document versions and, to translate
hyper-texts links into paper references. It still lack importation facilities.

 <dc:description>  Computational Grids are emerging as a popular paradigm for solving
large-scale compute and data intensive problems in science, engineering, and
commerce. However, application composition, resource management and scheduling
in these environments is a complex undertaking. In this paper, we illustrate
the creation of a virtual laboratory environment by leveraging existing Grid
technologies to enable molecular modeling for drug design on distributed
resources. It involves screening millions of molecules of chemical compounds
against a protein target, chemical database (CDB) to identify those with
potential use for drug design. We have grid-enabled the molecular docking
process by composing it as a parameter sweep application using the Nimrod-G
tools. We then developed new tools for remote access to molecules in CDB small
molecule database. The Nimrod-G resource broker along with molecule CDB data
broker is used for scheduling and on-demand processing of jobs on distributed
grid resources. The results demonstrate the ease of use and suitability of the
Nimrod-G and virtual laboratory tools.

 <dc:description>  Computational Grids, coupling geographically distributed resources such as
PCs, workstations, clusters, and scientific instruments, have emerged as a next
generation computing platform for solving large-scale problems in science,
engineering, and commerce. However, application development, resource
management, and scheduling in these environments continue to be a complex
undertaking. In this article, we discuss our efforts in developing a resource
management system for scheduling computations on resources distributed across
the world with varying quality of service. Our service-oriented grid computing
system called Nimrod-G manages all operations associated with remote execution
including resource discovery, trading, scheduling based on economic principles
and a user defined quality of service requirement. The Nimrod-G resource broker
is implemented by leveraging existing technologies such as Globus, and provides
new services that are essential for constructing industrial-strength Grids. We
discuss results of preliminary experiments on scheduling some parametric
computations using the Nimrod-G resource broker on a world-wide grid testbed
that spans five continents.

 <dc:description>  Stable Model Semantics and Well Founded Semantics have been shown to be very
useful in several applications of non-monotonic reasoning. However, Stable
Models presents a high computational complexity, whereas Well Founded Semantics
is easy to compute and provides an approximation of Stable Models. Efficient
engines exist for both semantics of logic programs. This work presents a
computational integration of two of such systems, namely XSB and SMODELS. The
resulting system is called XNMR, and provides an interactive system for the
exploration of both semantics. Aspects such as modularity can be exploited in
order to ease debugging of large knowledge bases with the usual Prolog
debugging techniques and an interactive environment. Besides, the use of a full
Prolog system as a front-end to a Stable Models engine augments the language
usually accepted by such systems.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the smoothed analysis of algorithms, which is a hybrid of the
worst-case and average-case analysis of algorithms. In smoothed analysis, we
measure the maximum over inputs of the expected performance of an algorithm
under small random perturbations of that input. We measure this performance in
terms of both the input size and the magnitude of the perturbations. We show
that the simplex algorithm has polynomial smoothed complexity.

 <dc:description>  The paper investigates the computational problem of predicting RNA secondary
structures. The general belief is that allowing pseudoknots makes the problem
hard. Existing polynomial-time algorithms are heuristic algorithms with no
performance guarantee and can only handle limited types of pseudoknots. In this
paper we initiate the study of predicting RNA secondary structures with a
maximum number of stacking pairs while allowing arbitrary pseudoknots. We
obtain two approximation algorithms with worst-case approximation ratios of 1/2
and 1/3 for planar and general secondary structures,respectively. For an RNA
sequence of $n$ bases, the approximation algorithm for planar secondary
structures runs in $O(n^3)$ time while that for the general case runs in linear
time. Furthermore, we prove that allowing pseudoknots makes it NP-hard to
maximize the number of stacking pairs in a planar secondary structure. This
result is in contrast with the recent NP-hard results on psuedoknots which are
based on optimizing some general and complicated energy functions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the computational complexity of the following
problem. Let $f$ be a Boolean polynomial. What value of $f$, 0 or 1, is taken
more frequently? The problem is solved in polynomial time for polynomials of
degrees 1,2. The next case of degree 3 appears to be PP-complete under
polynomial reductions in the class of promise problems. The proof is based on
techniques of quantum computation.

 <dc:description>  The information in an individual finite object (like a binary string) is
commonly measured by its Kolmogorov complexity. One can divide that information
into two parts: the information accounting for the useful regularity present in
the object and the information accounting for the remaining accidental
information. There can be several ways (model classes) in which the regularity
is expressed. Kolmogorov has proposed the model class of finite sets,
generalized later to computable probability mass functions. The resulting
theory, known as Algorithmic Statistics, analyzes the algorithmic sufficient
statistic when the statistic is restricted to the given model class. However,
the most general way to proceed is perhaps to express the useful information as
a recursive function. The resulting measure has been called the
``sophistication'' of the object. We develop the theory of recursive functions
statistic, the maximum and minimum value, the existence of absolutely
nonstochastic objects (that have maximal sophistication--all the information in
them is meaningful and there is no residual randomness), determine its relation
with the more restricted model classes of finite sets, and computable
probability distributions, in particular with respect to the algorithmic
(Kolmogorov) minimal sufficient statistic, the relation to the halting problem
and further algorithmic properties.

 <dc:description>  A new class of distances appropriate for measuring similarity relations
between sequences, say one type of similarity per distance, is studied. We
propose a new ``normalized information distance'', based on the noncomputable
notion of Kolmogorov complexity, and show that it is in this class and it
minorizes every computable distance in the class (that is, it is universal in
that it discovers all computable similarities). We demonstrate that it is a
metric and call it the {\em similarity metric}. This theory forms the
foundation for a new practical tool. To evidence generality and robustness we
give two distinctive applications in widely divergent areas using standard
compression programs like gzip and GenCompress. First, we compare whole
mitochondrial genomes and infer their evolutionary history. This results in a
first completely automatic computed whole mitochondrial phylogeny tree.
Secondly, we fully automatically compute the language tree of 52 different
languages.

 <dc:description>  The National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) is an innovative magnetic
fusion device that was constructed by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory
(PPPL) in collaboration with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Columbia
University, and the University of Washington at Seattle. Since achieving first
plasma in 1999, the device has been used for fusion research through an
international collaboration of over twenty institutions. The NSTX is operated
through a collection of control systems that encompass a wide range of
technology, from hardwired relay controls to real-time control systems with
giga-FLOPS of capability. This paper presents a broad introduction to the
control systems used on NSTX, with an emphasis on the computing controls, data
acquisition, and synchronization systems.

 <dc:description>  In this tutorial, selected topics of cryptology and of computational
complexity theory are presented. We give a brief overview of the history and
the foundations of classical cryptography, and then move on to modern
public-key cryptography. Particular attention is paid to cryptographic
protocols and the problem of constructing the key components of such protocols
such as one-way functions. A function is one-way if it is easy to compute, but
hard to invert. We discuss the notion of one-way functions both in a
cryptographic and in a complexity-theoretic setting. We also consider
interactive proof systems and present some interesting zero-knowledge
protocols. In a zero-knowledge protocol one party can convince the other party
of knowing some secret information without disclosing any bit of this
information. Motivated by these protocols, we survey some complexity-theoretic
results on interactive proof systems and related complexity classes.

made up of the U-representations of the elements in X is a star-free regular
language. Answering a question of A. de Luca and A. Restivo, we obtain a
complete logical characterization of the U-star-free sets of integers for
suitable numeration systems related to a Pisot number and in particular for
integer base systems. For these latter systems, we study as well the problem of
the base dependence. Finally, the case of k-adic systems is also investigated.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian networks provide an elegant formalism for representing and reasoning
about uncertainty using probability theory. Theyare a probabilistic extension
of propositional logic and, hence, inherit some of the limitations of
propositional logic, such as the difficulties to represent objects and
relations. We introduce a generalization of Bayesian networks, called Bayesian
logic programs, to overcome these limitations. In order to represent objects
and relations it combines Bayesian networks with definite clause logic by
establishing a one-to-one mapping between ground atoms and random variables. We
show that Bayesian logic programs combine the advantages of both definite
clause logic and Bayesian networks. This includes the separation of
quantitative and qualitative aspects of the model. Furthermore, Bayesian logic
programs generalize both Bayesian networks as well as logic programs. So, many
ideas developed

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of integrating information coming from different
sources. The information consists of facts that a central server collects and
tries to combine using (a) a set of logical rules, i.e. a logic program, and
(b) a hypothesis representing the server's own estimates. In such a setting
incomplete information from a source or contradictory information from
different sources necessitate the use of many-valued logics in which programs
can be evaluated and hypotheses can be tested. To carry out such activities we
propose a formal framework based on bilattices such as Belnap's four-valued
logics. In this framework we work with the class of programs defined by Fitting
and we develop a theory for information integration.
  We also establish an intuitively appealing connection between our hypothesis
testing mechanism on the one hand, and the well-founded semantics and
Kripke-Kleene semantics of Datalog programs with negation, on the other hand.

backwards in time, GREP is a gradient-based method that plans ahead and
improves its policy before it actually acts in the environment. We derive
formulas for the exact policy gradient that maximizes the expected future
reward and confirm our ideas with numerical experiments.

 <dc:description>  For a given finite class of finite graphs H, a graph G is called a
realization of H if the neighbourhood of its any vertex induces the subgraph
isomorphic to a graph of H. We consider the following problem known as the
Generalized Neighbourhood Problem (GNP): given a finite class of finite graphs
H, does there exist a non-empty graph G that is a realization of H? In fact,
there are two modifications of that problem, namely the finite (the existence
of a finite realization is required) and infinite one (the realization is
required to be infinite). In this paper we show that GNP and its modifications
for all finite classes H of finite graphs are reduced to the same problems with
an additional restriction on H. Namely, the orders of any two graphs of H are
equal and every graph of H has exactly s dominating vertices.

 <dc:description>  In this paper the Neciporuk method for proving lower bounds on the size of
Boolean formulae is reformulated in terms of one-way communication complexity.
We investigate the scenarios of probabilistic formulae, nondeterministic
formulae, and quantum formulae. In all cases we can use results about one-way
communication complexity to prove lower bounds on formula size. In the latter
two cases we newly develop the employed communication complexity bounds. The
main results regarding formula size are as follows: A polynomial size gap
between probabilistic/quantum and deterministic formulae. A near-quadratic size
gap for nondeterministic formulae with limited access to nondeterministic bits.
A near quadratic lower bound on quantum formula size, as well as a polynomial
separation between the sizes of quantum formulae with and without multiple read
random inputs. The methods for quantum and probabilistic formulae employ a
variant of the Neciporuk bound in terms of the VC-dimension. Regarding
communication complexity we give optimal separations between one-way and
two-way protocols in the cases of limited nondeterministic and quantum
communication, and we show that zero-error quantum one-way communication
complexity asymptotically equals deterministic one-way communication complexity
for total functions.

 <dc:description>  A few novel radial basis function (RBF) discretization schemes for partial
differential equations are developed in this study. For boundary-type methods,
we derive the indirect and direct symmetric boundary knot methods. Based on the
multiple reciprocity principle, the boundary particle method is introduced for
general inhomogeneous problems without using inner nodes. For domain-type
schemes, by using the Green integral we develop a novel Hermite RBF scheme
called the modified Kansa method, which significantly reduces calculation
errors at close-to-boundary nodes. To avoid Gibbs phenomenon, we present the
least square RBF collocation scheme. Finally, five types of the kernel RBF are
also briefly presented.

 <dc:description>  NP-complete problems should be hard on some instances but those may be
extremely rare. On generic instances many such problems, especially related to
random graphs, have been proven easy. We show the intractability of random
instances of a graph coloring problem: this graph problem is hard on average
unless all NP problem under all samplable (i.e., generatable in polynomial
time) distributions are easy. Worst case reductions use special gadgets and
typically map instances into a negligible fraction of possible outputs. Ours
must output nearly random graphs and avoid any super-polynomial distortion of
probabilities.

 <dc:title>Program schemes with binary write-once arrays and the complexity classes

 <dc:description>  We study a class of program schemes, NPSB, in which, aside from basic
assignments, non-deterministic guessing and while loops, we have access to
arrays; but where these arrays are binary write-once in that they are
initialized to `zero' and can only ever be set to `one'. We show, amongst other
results, that: NPSB can be realized as a vectorized Lindstrom logic; there are
problems accepted by program schemes of NPSB that are not definable in the
bounded-variable infinitary logic ${\cal L}^\omega_{\infty\omega}$; all
problems accepted by the program schemes of NPSB have a zero-one law; and on
ordered structures, NPSB captures the complexity class $[ L]^[{\scriptsize
NP\normalsize}]$. The class of program schemes NPSB is actually the union of an
infinite hierarchy of classes of program schemes. When we amend the semantics
of our program schemes slightly, we find that the classes of the resulting
hierarchy capture the complexity classes $\Sigma^p_i$ (where $i\geq 1$) of the
Polynomial Hierarchy PH. Finally, we give logical equivalences of the
complexity-theoretic question `Does NP equal PSPACE?' where the logics (and
classes of program schemes) involved define only problems with zero-one laws
(and so do not define some computationally trivial problems).

 <dc:description>  The elastic-input neuro tagger and hybrid tagger, combined with a neural
network and Brill's error-driven learning, have already been proposed for the
purpose of constructing a practical tagger using as little training data as
possible. When a small Thai corpus is used for training, these taggers have
tagging accuracies of 94.4% and 95.5% (accounting only for the ambiguous words
in terms of the part of speech), respectively. In this study, in order to
construct more accurate taggers we developed new tagging methods using three
machine learning methods: the decision-list, maximum entropy, and support
vector machine methods. We then performed tagging experiments by using these
methods. Our results showed that the support vector machine method has the best
precision (96.1%), and that it is capable of improving the accuracy of tagging
in the Thai language. Finally, we theoretically examined all these methods and
discussed how the improvements were achived.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a universal model for paraphrasing that transforms
according to defined criteria. We showed that by using different criteria we
could construct different kinds of paraphrasing systems including one for
answering questions, one for compressing sentences, one for polishing up, and
one for transforming written language to spoken language.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new declarative planning language, called K, which is based on
principles and methods of logic programming. In this language, transitions
between states of knowledge can be described, rather than transitions between
completely described states of the world, which makes the language well-suited
for planning under incomplete knowledge. Furthermore, it enables the use of
default principles in the planning process by supporting negation as failure.
Nonetheless, K also supports the representation of transitions between states
of the world (i.e., states of complete knowledge) as a special case, which
shows that the language is very flexible. As we demonstrate on particular
examples, the use of knowledge states may allow for a natural and compact
problem representation. We then provide a thorough analysis of the
computational complexity of K, and consider different planning problems,
including standard planning and secure planning (also known as conformant
planning) problems. We show that these problems have different complexities
under various restrictions, ranging from NP to NEXPTIME in the propositional
case. Our results form the theoretical basis for the DLV^K system, which
implements the language K on top of the DLV logic programming system.

 <dc:description>  In the context of mining for frequent patterns using the standard levelwise
algorithm, the following question arises: given the current level and the
current set of frequent patterns, what is the maximal number of candidate
patterns that can be generated on the next level? We answer this question by
providing a tight upper bound, derived from a combinatorial result from the
sixties by Kruskal and Katona. Our result is useful to reduce the number of
database scans.

 <dc:description>  Many mathematical models utilize limit processes. Continuous functions and
the calculus, differential equations and topology, all are based on limits and
continuity. However, when we perform measurements and computations, we can
achieve only approximate results. In some cases, this discrepancy between
theoretical schemes and practical actions changes drastically outcomes of a
research and decision-making resulting in uncertainty of knowledge. In the
paper, a mathematical approach to such kind of uncertainty, which emerges in
computation and measurement, is suggested on the base of the concept of a fuzzy
limit. A mathematical technique is developed for differential models with
uncertainty. To take into account the intrinsic uncertainty of a model, it is
suggested to use fuzzy derivatives instead of conventional derivatives of
functions in this model.

3D nanostructures. This is the first work to combine studies in self-assembly
and nanotechnology in 3D, just as Rothemund and Winfree did in the 2D case. Our
model is a more precise superset of their Tile Assembly Model that facilitates
building scalable 3D molecules. Under our model, we present algorithms to build
a hollow cube, which is intuitively one of the simplest 3D structures to
construct. We also introduce five basic measures of complexity to analyze these
algorithms. Our model and algorithmic techniques are applicable to more complex
2D and 3D nanostructures.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a lexicon-based approach to the problem of
morphological processing. Full-form words, lemmas and grammatical tags are
interconnected in a DAWG. Thus, the process of analysis/synthesis is reduced to
a search in the graph, which is very fast and can be performed even if several
pieces of information are missing from the input. The contents of the DAWG are
updated using an on-line incremental process. The proposed approach is language
independent and it does not utilize any morphophonetic rules or any other
special linguistic information.

 <dc:description>  We investigate ways to support interactive mining sessions, in the setting of
association rule mining. In such sessions, users specify conditions (queries)
on the associations to be generated. Our approach is a combination of the
integration of querying conditions inside the mining phase, and the incremental
querying of already generated associations. We present several concrete
algorithms and compare their performance.

 <dc:description>  The {\em height} of a trace is the height of the corresponding heap of pieces
in Viennot's representation, or equivalently the number of factors in its
Cartier-Foata decomposition. Let $h(t)$ and $|t|$ stand respectively for the
height and the length of a trace $t$. Roughly speaking, $|t|$ is the
`sequential' execution time and $h(t)$ is the `parallel' execution time. We
prove that the bivariate commutative series $\sum_t x^{h(t)}y^{|t|}$ is
rational, and we give a finite representation of it. We use the rationality to
obtain precise information on the asymptotics of the number of traces of a
given height or length. Then, we study the average height of a trace for
various probability distributions on traces. For the uniform probability
distribution on traces of the same length (resp. of the same height), the
asymptotic average height (resp. length) exists and is an algebraic number. To
illustrate our results and methods, we consider a couple of examples: the free
commutative monoid and the trace monoid whose independence graph is the ladder
graph.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, data mining researchers have developed efficient association
rule algorithms for retail market basket analysis. Still, retailers often
complain about how to adopt association rules to optimize concrete retail
marketing-mix decisions. It is in this context that, in a previous paper, the
authors have introduced a product selection model called PROFSET. This model
selects the most interesting products from a product assortment based on their
cross-selling potential given some retailer defined constraints. However this
model suffered from an important deficiency: it could not deal effectively with
supermarket data, and no provisions were taken to include retail category
management principles. Therefore, in this paper, the authors present an
important generalization of the existing model in order to make it suitable for
supermarket data as well, and to enable retailers to add category restrictions
to the model. Experiments on real world data obtained from a Belgian
supermarket chain produce very promising results and demonstrate the
effectiveness of the generalized PROFSET model.

 <dc:description>  A major problem in using iterative number generators of the form
x_i=f(x_{i-1}) is that they can enter unexpectedly short cycles. This is hard
to analyze when the generator is designed, hard to detect in real time when the
generator is used, and can have devastating cryptanalytic implications. In this
paper we define a measure of security, called_sequence_diversity_, which
generalizes the notion of cycle-length for non-iterative generators. We then
introduce the class of counter assisted generators, and show how to turn any
iterative generator (even a bad one designed or seeded by an adversary) into a
counter assisted generator with a provably high diversity, without reducing the
quality of generators which are already cryptographically strong.

 <dc:title>Rational Competitive Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tennenholtz, Moshe</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.11</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Much work in computer science has adopted competitive analysis as a tool for
decision making under uncertainty. In this work we extend competitive analysis
to the context of multi-agent systems. Unlike classical competitive analysis
where the behavior of an agent's environment is taken to be arbitrary, we
consider the case where an agent's environment consists of other agents. These
agents will usually obey some (minimal) rationality constraints. This leads to
the definition of rational competitive analysis. We introduce the concept of
rational competitive analysis, and initiate the study of competitive analysis
for multi-agent systems. We also discuss the application of rational
competitive analysis to the context of bidding games, as well as to the
classical one-way trading problem.

 <dc:title>Using Structural Metadata to Localize Experience of Digital Content</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dushay, Naomi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>H.3.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the increasing technical sophistication of both information consumers
and providers, there is increasing demand for more meaningful experiences of
digital information. We present a framework that separates digital object
experience, or rendering, from digital object storage and manipulation, so the
rendering can be tailored to particular communities of users. Our framework
also accommodates extensible digital object behaviors and interoperability. The
two key components of our approach are 1) exposing structural metadata
associated with digital objects -- metadata about the labeled access points
within a digital object and 2) information intermediaries called context
brokers that match structural characteristics of digital objects with
mechanisms that produce behaviors. These context brokers allow for localized
rendering of digital information stored externally.

 <dc:title>Fast Context-Free Grammar Parsing Requires Fast Boolean Matrix
  Multiplication</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In 1975, Valiant showed that Boolean matrix multiplication can be used for
parsing context-free grammars (CFGs), yielding the asympotically fastest
(although not practical) CFG parsing algorithm known. We prove a dual result:
any CFG parser with time complexity $O(g n^{3 - \epsilson})$, where $g$ is the
size of the grammar and $n$ is the length of the input string, can be
efficiently converted into an algorithm to multiply $m \times m$ Boolean
matrices in time $O(m^{3 - \epsilon/3})$.
  Given that practical, substantially sub-cubic Boolean matrix multiplication
algorithms have been quite difficult to find, we thus explain why there has
been little progress in developing practical, substantially sub-cubic general
CFG parsers. In proving this result, we also develop a formalization of the
notion of parsing.

 <dc:description>  The mutual information of two random variables i and j with joint
probabilities t_ij is commonly used in learning Bayesian nets as well as in
many other fields. The chances t_ij are usually estimated by the empirical
sampling frequency n_ij/n leading to a point estimate I(n_ij/n) for the mutual
information. To answer questions like &quot;is I(n_ij/n) consistent with zero?&quot; or
&quot;what is the probability that the true mutual information is much larger than
the point estimate?&quot; one has to go beyond the point estimate. In the Bayesian
framework one can answer these questions by utilizing a (second order) prior
distribution p(t) comprising prior information about t. From the prior p(t) one
can compute the posterior p(t|n), from which the distribution p(I|n) of the
mutual information can be calculated. We derive reliable and quickly computable
approximations for p(I|n). We concentrate on the mean, variance, skewness, and
kurtosis, and non-informative priors. For the mean we also give an exact
expression. Numerical issues and the range of validity are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Concrete computing machines, either sequential or concurrent, rely on an
intimate relation between computation and time. We recall the general
characteristic properties of physical time and of present realizations of
computing systems. We emphasize the role of computing interferences, i.e. the
necessity to avoid them in order to give a causal implementation to logical
operations. We compare synchronous and asynchronous systems, and make a brief
survey of some methods used to deal with computing interferences. Using a
graphic representation, we show that synchronous and asynchronous circuits
reflect the same opposition as the Newtonian and relativistic causal structures
for physical space-time.

 <dc:description>  In 1977, Young proposed a voting scheme that extends the Condorcet Principle
based on the fewest possible number of voters whose removal yields a Condorcet
winner. We prove that both the winner and the ranking problem for Young
elections is complete for the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by
parallel access to NP. Analogous results for Lewis Carroll's 1876 voting scheme
were recently established by Hemaspaandra et al. In contrast, we prove that the
winner and ranking problems in Fishburn's homogeneous variant of Carroll's
voting scheme can be solved efficiently by linear programming.

 <dc:description>  In many applications, it is necessary to determine the string similarity.
Edit distance[WF74] approach is a classic method to determine Field Similarity.
A well known dynamic programming algorithm [GUS97] is used to calculate edit
distance with the time complexity O(nm). (for worst case, average case and even
best case) Instead of continuing with improving the edit distance approach,
[LL+99] adopted a brand new approach-token-based approach. Its new concept of
token-base-retain the original semantic information, good time complex-O(nm)
(for worst, average and best case) and good experimental performance make it a
milestone paper in this area. Further study indicates that there is still room
for improvement of its Field Similarity algorithm. Our paper is to introduce a
package of substring-based new algorithms to determine Field Similarity.
Combined together, our new algorithms not only achieve higher accuracy but also
gain the time complexity O(knm) (k&lt;0.75) for worst case, O(*n) where &lt;6 for
average case and O(1) for best case. Throughout the paper, we use the approach
of comparative examples to show higher accuracy of our algorithms compared to
the one proposed in [LL+99]. Theoretical analysis, concrete examples and
experimental result show that our algorithms can significantly improve the
accuracy and time complexity of the calculation of Field Similarity. [US97] D.

 <dc:description>  The widespread availability of networked multimedia potentials embedded in an
infrastructure of qualitative superior kind gives rise to new approaches in the
areas of teleteaching and internet presentation: The distribution of
professionally styled multimedia streams has fallen in the realm of
possibility. This paper presents a prototype - both model and runtime
environment - of a time directed media system treating any kind of
presentational contribution as reusable media object components. The plug-in
free runtime system is based on a database and allows for a flexible support of
static media types as well as for easy extensions by streaming media servers.
The prototypic implementation includes a preliminary Web Authoring platform.

+ \frac{1.5}{p^3 -1})n^2 -o(n^2)$.
  These results improve the former results of Bshouty '89 and Blaser '99 who
proved lower bounds of $2.5 n^2 - o(n^2)$.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents and analyzes an incremental algorithm for the
construction of Acyclic Non-deterministic Finite-state Automata (NFA). Automata
of this type are quite useful in computational linguistics, especially for
storing lexicons. The proposed algorithm produces compact NFAs, i.e. NFAs that
do not contain equivalent states. Unlike Deterministic Finite-state Automata
(DFA), this property is not sufficient to ensure minimality, but still the
resulting NFAs are considerably smaller than the minimal DFAs for the same
languages.

 <dc:description>  Random beacons-information sources that broadcast a stream of random digits
unknown by anyone beforehand-are useful for various cryptographic purposes. But
such beacons can be easily and undetectably sabotaged, so that their output is
known beforehand by a dishonest party, who can use this information to defeat
the cryptographic protocols supposedly protected by the beacon. We explore a
strategy to reduce this hazard by combining the outputs from several
noninteracting (eg spacelike-separated) beacons by XORing them together to
produce a single digit stream which is more trustworthy than any individual
beacon, being random and unpredictable if at least one of the contributing
beacons is honest. If the contributing beacons are not spacelike separated, so
that a dishonest beacon can overhear and adapt to earlier outputs of other
beacons, the beacons' trustworthiness can still be enhanced to a lesser extent
by a time sharing strategy. We point out some disadvantages of alternative
trust amplification methods based on one-way hash functions.

 <dc:description>  To study mechanisms that cause the non-Gaussian nature of network traffic, we
analyzed IP flow statistics. For greedy flows in particular, we investigated
the hop counts between source and destination nodes, and classified
applications by the port number. We found that the main flows contributing to
the non-Gaussian nature of network traffic were HTTP flows with relatively
small hop counts compared with the average hop counts of all flows.

 <dc:description>  We provide a new representation-independent formulation of Occam's razor
theorem, based on Kolmogorov complexity. This new formulation allows us to:
  (i) Obtain better sample complexity than both length-based and VC-based
versions of Occam's razor theorem, in many applications.
  (ii) Achieve a sharper reverse of Occam's razor theorem than previous work.
  Specifically, we weaken the assumptions made in an earlier publication, and
extend the reverse to superpolynomial running times.

 <dc:description>  Information, stored or transmitted in digital form, is often structured.
Individual data records are usually represented as hierarchies of their
elements. Together, records form larger structures. Information processing
applications have to take account of this structuring, which assigns different
semantics to different data elements or records. Big variety of structural
schemata in use today often requires much flexibility from applications--for
example, to process information coming from different sources. To ensure
application interoperability, translators are needed that can convert one
structure into another. This paper puts forward a formal data model aimed at
supporting hierarchical data processing in a simple and flexible way. The model
is based on and extends results of two classical theories, studying finite
string and tree automata. The concept of finite automata and regular languages
is applied to the case of arbitrarily structured tree-like hierarchical data
records, represented as &quot;structured strings.&quot; These automata are compared with
classical string and tree automata; the model is shown to be a superset of the
classical models. Regular grammars and expressions over structured strings are
introduced. Regular expression matching and substitution has been widely used
for efficient unstructured text processing; the model described here brings the
power of this proven technique to applications that deal with information
trees. A simple generic alternative is offered to replace today's specialised
ad-hoc approaches. The model unifies structural and content transformations,
providing applications with a single data type. An example scenario of how to
build applications based on this theory is discussed. Further research
directions are outlined.

 <dc:description>  We analyze completely the convergence speed of the \emph{batch learning
algorithm}, and compare its speed to that of the memoryless learning algorithm
and of learning with memory. We show that the batch learning algorithm is never
worse than the memoryless learning algorithm (at least asymptotically). Its
performance \emph{vis-a-vis} learning with full memory is less clearcut, and
depends on certain probabilistic assumptions.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes individually-rational ex post equilibrium in the VC
(Vickrey-Clarke) combinatorial auctions. If $\Sigma$ is a family of bundles of
goods, the organizer may restrict the participants by requiring them to submit
their bids only for bundles in $\Sigma$. The $\Sigma$-VC combinatorial auctions
(multi-good auctions) obtained in this way are known to be
individually-rational truth-telling mechanisms. In contrast, this paper deals
with non-restricted VC auctions, in which the buyers restrict themselves to
bids on bundles in $\Sigma$, because it is rational for them to do so. That is,
it may be that when the buyers report their valuation of the bundles in
$\Sigma$, they are in an equilibrium. We fully characterize those $\Sigma$ that
induce individually rational equilibrium in every VC auction, and we refer to
the associated equilibrium as a bundling equilibrium. The number of bundles in
$\Sigma$ represents the communication complexity of the equilibrium. A special
case of bundling equilibrium is partition-based equilibrium, in which $\Sigma$
is a field, that is, it is generated by a partition. We analyze the tradeoff
between communication complexity and economic efficiency of bundling
equilibrium, focusing in particular on partition-based equilibrium.

 <dc:description>  One recurring problem in program development is that of understanding how to
re-use code developed by a third party. In the context of (constraint) logic
programming, part of this problem reduces to figuring out how to query a
program. If the logic program does not come with any documentation, then the
programmer is forced to either experiment with queries in an ad hoc fashion or
trace the control-flow of the program (backward) to infer the modes in which a
predicate must be called so as to avoid an instantiation error. This paper
presents an abstract interpretation scheme that automates the latter technique.
The analysis presented in this paper can infer moding properties which if
satisfied by the initial query, come with the guarantee that the program and
query can never generate any moding or instantiation errors. Other applications
of the analysis are discussed. The paper explains how abstract domains with
certain computational properties (they condense) can be used to trace
control-flow backward (right-to-left) to infer useful properties of initial
queries. A correctness argument is presented and an implementation is reported.

 <dc:description>  Boolean functions can be used to express the groundness of, and trace
grounding dependencies between, program variables in (constraint) logic
programs. In this paper, a variety of issues pertaining to the efficient Prolog
implementation of groundness analysis are investigated, focusing on the domain
of definite Boolean functions, Def. The systematic design of the representation
of an abstract domain is discussed in relation to its impact on the algorithmic
complexity of the domain operations; the most frequently called operations
should be the most lightweight. This methodology is applied to Def, resulting
in a new representation, together with new algorithms for its domain operations
utilising previously unexploited properties of Def -- for instance,
quadratic-time entailment checking. The iteration strategy driving the analysis
is also discussed and a simple, but very effective, optimisation of induced
magic is described. The analysis can be implemented straightforwardly in Prolog
and the use of a non-ground representation results in an efficient, scalable
tool which does not require widening to be invoked, even on the largest
benchmarks. An extensive experimental evaluation is given

 <dc:description>  Most recently, Answer Set Programming (ASP) is attracting interest as a new
paradigm for problem solving. An important aspect which needs to be supported
is the handling of preferences between rules, for which several approaches have
been presented. In this paper, we consider the problem of implementing
preference handling approaches by means of meta-interpreters in Answer Set
Programming. In particular, we consider the preferred answer set approaches by
Brewka and Eiter, by Delgrande, Schaub and Tompits, and by Wang, Zhou and Lin.
We present suitable meta-interpreters for these semantics using DLV, which is
an efficient engine for ASP. Moreover, we also present a meta-interpreter for
the weakly preferred answer set approach by Brewka and Eiter, which uses the
weak constraint feature of DLV as a tool for expressing and solving an
underlying optimization problem. We also consider advanced meta-interpreters,
which make use of graph-based characterizations and often allow for more
efficient computations. Our approach shows the suitability of ASP in general
and of DLV in particular for fast prototyping. This can be fruitfully exploited

 <dc:description>  The dynamical evolution of weights in the Adaboost algorithm contains useful
information about the role that the associated data points play in the built of
the Adaboost model. In particular, the dynamics induces a bipartition of the
data set into two (easy/hard) classes. Easy points are ininfluential in the
making of the model, while the varying relevance of hard points can be gauged
in terms of an entropy value associated to their evolution. Smooth
approximations of entropy highlight regions where classification is most
uncertain. Promising results are obtained when methods proposed are applied in
the Optimal Sampling framework.

 <dc:title>On the Significance of Digits in Interval Notation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  To analyse the significance of the digits used for interval bounds, we
clarify the philosophical presuppositions of various interval notations. We use
information theory to determine the information content of the last digit of
the numeral used to denote the interval's bounds. This leads to the notion of
efficiency of a decimal digit: the actual value as percentage of the maximal
value of its information content. By taking this efficiency into account, many
presentations of intervals can be made more readable at the expense of
negligible loss of information.

 <dc:description>  We consider the question of whether collusion among bidders (a &quot;bidding
ring&quot;) can be supported in equilibrium of unrepeated first-price auctions.
Unlike previous work on the topic such as that by McAfee and McMillan [1992]
and Marshall and Marx [2007], we do not assume that non-colluding agents have
perfect knowledge about the number of colluding agents whose bids are
suppressed by the bidding ring, and indeed even allow for the existence of
multiple cartels. Furthermore, while we treat the association of bidders with
bidding rings as exogenous, we allow bidders to make strategic decisions about
whether to join bidding rings when invited. We identify a bidding ring protocol
that results in an efficient allocation in Bayes{Nash equilibrium, under which
non-colluding agents bid straightforwardly, and colluding agents join bidding
rings when invited and truthfully declare their valuations to the ring center.
We show that bidding rings benefit ring centers and all agents, both members
and non-members of bidding rings, at the auctioneer's expense. The techniques
we introduce in this paper may also be useful for reasoning about other
problems in which agents have asymmetric information about a setting.

 <dc:description>  It is widely accepted that (1) the natural or folded state of proteins is a
global energy minimum, and (2) in most cases proteins fold to a unique state
determined by their amino acid sequence. The H-P (hydrophobic-hydrophilic)
model is a simple combinatorial model designed to answer qualitative questions
about the protein folding process. In this paper we consider a problem
suggested by Brian Hayes in 1998: what proteins in the two-dimensional H-P
model have unique optimal (minimum energy) foldings? In particular, we prove
that there are closed chains of monomers (amino acids) with this property for
all (even) lengths; and that there are open monomer chains with this property
for all lengths divisible by four.

then use an algorithmic method based on moving frames &quot;a la Fels-Olver&quot; to
obtain a fundamental set of invariants of these groups actions. The invariants
are used to define a set of equations to be solved by the points of the 3D
object, providing a new technique for recovering 3D structure from motion.

 <dc:title>A Modal Logic Framework for Multi-agent Belief Fusion</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is aimed at providing a uniform framework for reasoning about
beliefs of multiple agents and their fusion. In the first part of the paper, we
develop logics for reasoning about cautiously merged beliefs of agents with
different degrees of reliability. The logics are obtained by combining the
multi-agent epistemic logic and multi-sources reasoning systems. Every ordering
for the reliability of the agents is represented by a modal operator, so we can
reason with the merged results under different situations. The fusion is
cautious in the sense that if an agent's belief is in conflict with those of
higher priorities, then his belief is completely discarded from the merged
result. We consider two strategies for the cautious merging of beliefs. In the
first one, if inconsistency occurs at some level, then all beliefs at the lower
levels are discarded simultaneously, so it is called level cutting strategy.
For the second one, only the level at which the inconsistency occurs is
skipped, so it is called level skipping strategy. The formal semantics and
axiomatic systems for these two strategies are presented. In the second part,
we extend the logics both syntactically and semantically to cover some more
sophisticated belief fusion and revision operators. While most existing
approaches treat belief fusion operators as meta-level constructs, these
operators are directly incorporated into our object logic language. Thus it is
possible to reason not only with the merged results but also about the fusion
process in our logics. The relationship of our extended logics with the
conditional logics of belief revision is also discussed.

 <dc:description>  A valuation for a player in a game in extensive form is an assignment of
numeric values to the players moves. The valuation reflects the desirability
moves. We assume a myopic player, who chooses a move with the highest
valuation. Valuations can also be revised, and hopefully improved, after each
play of the game. Here, a very simple valuation revision is considered, in
which the moves made in a play are assigned the payoff obtained in the play. We
show that by adopting such a learning process a player who has a winning
strategy in a win-lose game can almost surely guarantee a win in a repeated
game. When a player has more than two payoffs, a more elaborate learning
procedure is required. We consider one that associates with each move the
average payoff in the rounds in which this move was made. When all players
adopt this learning procedure, with some perturbations, then, with probability
1, strategies that are close to subgame perfect equilibrium are played after
some time. A single player who adopts this procedure can guarantee only her
individually rational payoff.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we outline a software development process for safety-critical
systems that aims at combining some of the specific strengths of model-based
development with those of programming language based development using
safety-critical subsets of Ada. Model-based software development and
model-based test case generation techniques are combined with code generation
techniques and tools providing a transition from model to code both for a
system itself and for its test cases. This allows developers to combine
domain-oriented, model-based techniques with source code based validation
techniques, as required for conformity with standards for the development of
safety-critical software, such as the avionics standard RTCA/DO-178B. We
introduce the AutoFocus and Validator modeling and validation toolset and
sketch its usage for modeling, test case generation, and code generation in a
combined approach, which is further illustrated by a simplified leading edge
aerospace model with built-in fault tolerance.

 <dc:description>  In general, we can not use algebraic or enumerative methods to optimize a
quality control (QC) procedure so as to detect the critical random and
systematic analytical errors with stated probabilities, while the probability
for false rejection is minimum. Genetic algorithms (GAs) offer an alternative,
as they do not require knowledge of the objective function to be optimized and
search through large parameter spaces quickly. To explore the application of
GAs in statistical QC, we have developed an interactive GAs based computer
program that designs a novel near optimal QC procedure, given an analytical
process. The program uses the deterministic crowding algorithm. An illustrative
application of the program suggests that it has the potential to design QC
procedures that are significantly better than 45 alternative ones that are used
in the clinical laboratories.

Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education Digital Library.
Over time the NSDL will include heterogeneous users, content, and services. To
accommodate this, a design for a technical and organization infrastructure has
been formulated based on the notion of a spectrum of interoperability. This
paper describes the first phase of the interoperability infrastructure
including the metadata repository, search and discovery services, rights
management services, and user interface portal facilities.

 <dc:description>  In a seminal paper in 1973, Black and Scholes argued how expected
distributions of stock prices can be used to price options. Their model assumed
a directed random motion for the returns and consequently a lognormal
distribution of asset prices after a finite time. We point out two problems
with their formulation. First, we show that the option valuation is not
uniquely determined; in particular, stratergies based on the delta-hedge and
CAMP (Capital Asset Pricing Model) are shown to provide different valuations of
an option. Second, asset returns are known not to be Gaussian distributed.
Empirically, distributions of returns are seen to be much better approximated
by an exponential distribution. This exponential distribution of asset prices
can be used to develop a new pricing model for options that is shown to provide
valuations that agree very well with those used by traders. We show how the
Fokker-Planck formulation of fluctuations (i.e., the dynamics of the
distribution) can be modified to provide an exponential distribution for
returns. We also show how a singular volatility can be used to go smoothly from
exponential to Gaussian returns and thereby illustrate why exponential returns
cannot be reached perturbatively starting from Gaussian ones, and explain how
the theory of 'stochastic volatility' can be obtained from our model by making
a bad approximation. Finally, we show how to calculate put and call prices for
a stretched exponential density.

 <dc:description>  The validation of modern software systems incorporates both functional and
quality requirements. This paper proposes a validation approach for software
quality requirement - its power consumption. This approach validates whether
the software produces the desired results with a minimum expenditure of energy.
We present energy requirements and an approach for their validation using a
power consumption model, test-case specification, software traces, and power
measurements. Three different approaches for power data gathering are
described. The power consumption of mobile phone applications is obtained and
matched against the power consumption model.

 <dc:title>The Witness Properties and the Semantics of the Prolog Cut</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The semantics of the Prolog ``cut'' construct is explored in the context of
some desirable properties of logic programming systems, referred to as the
witness properties. The witness properties concern the operational consistency
of responses to queries. A generalization of Prolog with negation as failure
and cut is described, and shown not to have the witness properties. A
restriction of the system is then described, which preserves the choice and
first-solution behaviour of cut but allows the system to have the witness
properties.
  The notion of cut in the restricted system is more restricted than the Prolog
hard cut, but retains the useful first-solution behaviour of hard cut, not
retained by other proposed cuts such as the ``soft cut''. It is argued that the
restricted system achieves a good compromise between the power and utility of
the Prolog cut and the need for internal consistency in logic programming
systems. The restricted system is given an abstract semantics, which depends on
the witness properties; this semantics suggests that the restricted system has
a deeper connection to logic than simply permitting some computations which are
logical.

Proceedings of the 1995 International Logic Programming Symposium.

language, while preserving its model-theoretic and fixpoint semantics. Then, we

 <dc:description>  Existing refinement calculi provide frameworks for the stepwise development
of imperative programs from specifications. This paper presents a refinement
calculus for deriving logic programs. The calculus contains a wide-spectrum
logic programming language, including executable constructs such as sequential
conjunction, disjunction, and existential quantification, as well as
specification constructs such as general predicates, assumptions and universal
quantification. A declarative semantics is defined for this wide-spectrum
language based on executions. Executions are partial functions from states to
states, where a state is represented as a set of bindings. The semantics is
used to define the meaning of programs and specifications, including parameters
and recursion. To complete the calculus, a notion of correctness-preserving
refinement over programs in the wide-spectrum language is defined and
refinement laws for developing programs are introduced. The refinement calculus
is illustrated using example derivations and prototype tool support is
discussed.

 <dc:description>  Multireader shared registers are basic objects used as communication medium
in asynchronous concurrent computation. We propose a surprisingly simple and
natural scheme to obtain several wait-free constructions of bounded 1-writer
multireader registers from atomic 1-writer 1-reader registers, that is easier
to prove correct than any previous construction. Our main construction is the
first symmetric pure timestamp one that is optimal with respect to the
worst-case local use of control bits; the other one is optimal with respect to
global use of control bits; both are optimal in time.

 <dc:description>  Capital accumulation has been a major issue in fisheries economics over the
last two decades, whereby the interaction of the fish and capital stocks were
of particular interest. Because bio-economic systems are intrinsically complex,
previous efforts in this field have relied on a variety of simplifying
assumptions. The model presented here relaxes some of these simplifications.
Problems of tractability are surmounted by using the methodology of qualitative
differential equations (QDE). The theory of QDEs takes into account that
scientific knowledge about particular fisheries is usually limited, and
facilitates an analysis of the global dynamics of systems with more than two
ordinary differential equations. The model is able to trace the evolution of
capital and fish stock in good agreement with observed patterns, and shows that
over-capitalization is unavoidable in unregulated fisheries.

 <dc:description>  A secure timeline is a tamper-evident historic record of the states through
which a system goes throughout its operational history. Secure timelines can
help us reason about the temporal ordering of system states in a provable
manner. We extend secure timelines to encompass multiple, mutually distrustful
services, using timeline entanglement. Timeline entanglement associates
disparate timelines maintained at independent systems, by linking undeniably
the past of one timeline to the future of another. Timeline entanglement is a
sound method to map a time step in the history of one service onto the timeline
of another, and helps clients of entangled services to get persistent temporal
proofs for services rendered that survive the demise or non-cooperation of the
originating service. In this paper we present the design and implementation of
Timeweave, our service development framework for timeline entanglement based on
two novel disk-based authenticated data structures. We evaluate Timeweave's
performance characteristics and show that it can be efficiently deployed in a
loosely-coupled distributed system of a few hundred services with overhead of
roughly 2-8% of the processing resources of a PC-grade system.

 <dc:description>  One of the most important problems in hybrid systems is the {\em reachability
problem}. The reachability problem has been shown to be undecidable even for a
subclass of {\em linear} hybrid systems. In view of this, the main focus in the
area of hybrid systems has been to find {\em effective} semi-decision
procedures for this problem. Such an algorithmic approach involves finding
methods of computation and representation of reach sets of the continuous
variables within a discrete state of a hybrid system. In this paper, after
presenting a brief introduction to hybrid systems and reachability problem, we
propose a computational method for obtaining the reach sets of continuous
variables in a hybrid system. In addition to this, we also describe a new
algorithm to over-approximate with polyhedra the reach sets of the continuous
variables with linear dynamics and polyhedral initial set. We illustrate these
algorithms with typical interesting examples.

 <dc:description>  This article presents the long-term behaviour analysis of Stochastic
Diffusion Search (SDS), a distributed agent-based system for best-fit pattern
matching. SDS operates by allocating simple agents into different regions of
the search space. Agents independently pose hypotheses about the presence of
the pattern in the search space and its potential distortion. Assuming a
compositional structure of hypotheses about pattern matching agents perform an
inference on the basis of partial evidence from the hypothesised solution.
Agents posing mutually consistent hypotheses about the pattern support each
other and inhibit agents with inconsistent hypotheses. This results in the
emergence of a stable agent population identifying the desired solution.
Positive feedback via diffusion of information between the agents significantly
contributes to the speed with which the solution population is formed. The
formulation of the SDS model in terms of interacting Markov Chains enables its
characterisation in terms of the allocation of agents, or computational
resources. The analysis characterises the stationary probability distribution
of the activity of agents, which leads to the characterisation of the solution
population in terms of its similarity to the target pattern.

 <dc:title>CUP: Controlled Update Propagation in Peer-to-Peer Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recently the problem of indexing and locating content in peer-to-peer
networks has received much attention. Previous work suggests caching index
entries at intermediate nodes that lie on the paths taken by search queries,
but until now there has been little focus on how to maintain these intermediate
caches. This paper proposes CUP, a new comprehensive architecture for
Controlled Update Propagation in peer-to-peer networks. CUP asynchronously
builds caches of index entries while answering search queries. It then
propagates updates of index entries to maintain these caches. Under unfavorable
conditions, when compared with standard caching based on expiration times, CUP
reduces the average miss latency by as much as a factor of three. Under
favorable conditions, CUP can reduce the average miss latency by more than a
factor of ten.
  CUP refreshes intermediate caches, reduces query latency, and reduces network
load by coalescing bursts of queries for the same item. CUP controls and
confines propagation to updates whose cost is likely to be recovered by
subsequent queries. CUP gives peer-to-peer nodes the flexibility to use their
own incentive-based policies to determine when to receive and when to propagate
updates. Finally, the small propagation overhead incurred by CUP is more than
compensated for by its savings in cache misses.

 <dc:description>  Non-negative sparse coding is a method for decomposing multivariate data into
non-negative sparse components. In this paper we briefly describe the
motivation behind this type of data representation and its relation to standard
sparse coding and non-negative matrix factorization. We then give a simple yet
efficient multiplicative algorithm for finding the optimal values of the hidden
components. In addition, we show how the basis vectors can be learned from the
observed data. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a framework of parametric descriptive directional types
for constraint logic programming (CLP). It proposes a method for locating type
errors in CLP programs and presents a prototype debugging tool. The main
technique used is checking correctness of programs w.r.t. type specifications.
The approach is based on a generalization of known methods for proving
correctness of logic programs to the case of parametric specifications.
Set-constraint techniques are used for formulating and checking verification
conditions for (parametric) polymorphic type specifications. The specifications
are expressed in a parametric extension of the formalism of term grammars. The
soundness of the method is proved and the prototype debugging tool supporting
the proposed approach is illustrated on examples.
  The paper is a substantial extension of the previous work by the same authors
concerning monomorphic directional types.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give upper and lower bounds on the number of Steiner points
required to construct a strictly convex quadrilateral mesh for a planar point
set. In particular, we show that $3{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}$ internal
Steiner points are always sufficient for a convex quadrilateral mesh of $n$
points in the plane. Furthermore, for any given $n\geq 4$, there are point sets
for which $\lceil\frac{n-3}{2}\rceil-1$ Steiner points are necessary for a
convex quadrilateral mesh.

 <dc:description>  Program specialisation aims at improving the overall performance of programs
by performing source to source transformations. A common approach within
functional and logic programming, known respectively as partial evaluation and
partial deduction, is to exploit partial knowledge about the input. It is
achieved through a well-automated application of parts of the
Burstall-Darlington unfold/fold transformation framework. The main challenge in
developing systems is to design automatic control that ensures correctness,
efficiency, and termination. This survey and tutorial presents the main
developments in controlling partial deduction over the past 10 years and
analyses their respective merits and shortcomings. It ends with an assessment
of current achievements and sketches some remaining research challenges.

Astronomy Archives: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey,&quot; ACM SIGMOD 2000) described
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's (SDSS) data management needs by defining twenty
database queries and twelve data visualization tasks that a good data
management system should support. We built a database and interfaces to support
both the query load and also a website for ad-hoc access. This paper reports on
the database design, describes the data loading pipeline, and reports on the
query implementation and performance. The queries typically translated to a
single SQL statement. Most queries run in less than 20 seconds, allowing
scientists to interactively explore the database. This paper is an in-depth
tour of those queries. Readers should first have studied the companion overview

 <dc:title>Combinatorial Auctions with Decreasing Marginal Utilities</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In most of microeconomic theory, consumers are assumed to exhibit decreasing
marginal utilities. This paper considers combinatorial auctions among such
submodular buyers. The valuations of such buyers are placed within a hierarchy
of valuations that exhibit no complementarities, a hierarchy that includes also
OR and XOR combinations of singleton valuations, and valuations satisfying the
gross substitutes property. Those last valuations are shown to form a
zero-measure subset of the submodular valuations that have positive measure.
While we show that the allocation problem among submodular valuations is
NP-hard, we present an efficient greedy 2-approximation algorithm for this case
and generalize it to the case of limited complementarities. No such
approximation algorithm exists in a setting allowing for arbitrary
complementarities. Some results about strategic aspects of combinatorial
auctions among players with decreasing marginal utilities are also presented.

 <dc:title>Linear Programming helps solving large multi-unit combinatorial auctions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Previous works suggested the use of Branch and Bound techniques for finding
the optimal allocation in (multi-unit) combinatorial auctions. They remarked
that Linear Programming could provide a good upper-bound to the optimal
allocation, but they went on using lighter and less tight upper-bound
heuristics, on the ground that LP was too time-consuming to be used
repetitively to solve large combinatorial auctions. We present the results of
extensive experiments solving large (multi-unit) combinatorial auctions
generated according to distributions proposed by different researchers. Our
surprising conclusion is that Linear Programming is worth using. Investing
almost all of one's computing time in using LP to bound from above the value of
the optimal solution in order to prune aggressively pays off. We present a way
to save on the number of calls to the LP routine and experimental results
comparing different heuristics for choosing the bid to be considered next.
Those results show that the ordering based on the square root of the size of
the bids that was shown to be theoretically optimal in a previous paper by the
authors performs surprisingly better than others in practice. Choosing to deal
first with the bid with largest coefficient (typically 1) in the optimal
solution of the relaxed LP problem, is also a good choice. The gap between the
lower bound provided by greedy heuristics and the upper bound provided by LP is
typically small and pruning is therefore extensive. For most distributions,
auctions of a few hundred goods among a few thousand bids can be solved in
practice. All experiments were run on a PC under Matlab.

 <dc:description>  Some important classical mechanisms considered in Microeconomics and Game
Theory require the solution of a difficult optimization problem. This is true
of mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which have in recent years assumed
practical importance, and in particular of the gold standard for combinatorial
auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). Traditional analysis of these
mechanisms - in particular, their truth revelation properties - assumes that
the optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these optimization
problems can usually be solved only in an approximate fashion. We investigate
the impact on such mechanisms of replacing exact solutions by approximate ones.
Specifically, we look at a particular greedy optimization method. We show that
the GVA payment scheme does not provide for a truth revealing mechanism. We
introduce another scheme that does guarantee truthfulness for a restricted
class of players. We demonstrate the latter property by identifying natural
properties for combinatorial auctions and showing that, for our restricted
class of players, they imply that truthful strategies are dominant. Those
properties have applicability beyond the specific auction studied.

 <dc:description>  Tarski gave a general semantics for deductive reasoning: a formula a may be
deduced from a set A of formulas iff a holds in all models in which each of the
elements of A holds. A more liberal semantics has been considered: a formula a
may be deduced from a set A of formulas iff a holds in all of the &quot;preferred&quot;
models in which all the elements of A hold. Shoham proposed that the notion of
&quot;preferred&quot; models be defined by a partial ordering on the models of the
underlying language. A more general semantics is described in this paper, based
on a set of natural properties of choice functions. This semantics is here
shown to be equivalent to a semantics based on comparing the relative
&quot;importance&quot; of sets of models, by what amounts to a qualitative probability
measure. The consequence operations defined by the equivalent semantics are
then characterized by a weakening of Tarski's properties in which the
monotonicity requirement is replaced by three weaker conditions. Classical
propositional connectives are characterized by natural introduction-elimination
rules in a nonmonotonic setting. Even in the nonmonotonic setting, one obtains
classical propositional logic, thus showing that monotonicity is not required
to justify classical propositional connectives.

 <dc:description>  Criticism of Gnutella network scalability has rested on the bandwidth
attributes of the original interconnection topology: a Cayley tree. Trees, in
general, are known to have lower aggregate bandwidth than higher dimensional
topologies e.g., hypercubes, meshes and tori. Gnutella was intended to support
thousands to millions of peers. Studies of interconnection topologies in the
literature, however, have focused on hardware implementations which are limited
by cost to a few thousand nodes. Since the Gnutella network is virtual,
hyper-topologies are relatively unfettered by such constraints. We present
performance models for several plausible hyper-topologies and compare their
query throughput up to millions of peers. The virtual hypercube and the virtual
hypertorus are shown to offer near linear scalability subject to the number of
peer TCP/IP connections that can be simultaneously kept open.

 <dc:description>  Bayes Classifiers are widely used currently for recognition, identification
and knowledge discovery. The fields of application are, for example, image
processing, medicine, chemistry (QSAR). But by mysterious way the Naive Bayes
Classifier usually gives a very nice and good presentation of a recognition. It
can not be improved considerably by more complex models of Bayes Classifier. We
demonstrate here a very nice and simple proof of the Naive Bayes Classifier
optimality, that can explain this interesting fact.The derivation in the
current paper is based on arXiv:cs/0202020v1

 <dc:description>  Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and
studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic
reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the
property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns
of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map
the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We
concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations,
defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of
view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D.
Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families
are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two
points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential
relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The &quot;preferential&quot;
models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic
semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional
logic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the
study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in
this paper will be treated in another paper.

 <dc:title>What does a conditional knowledge base entail?</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a logical approach to nonmonotonic reasoning based on the
notion of a nonmonotonic consequence relation. A conditional knowledge base,
consisting of a set of conditional assertions of the type &quot;if ... then ...&quot;,
represents the explicit defeasible knowledge an agent has about the way the
world generally behaves. We look for a plausible definition of the set of all
conditional assertions entailed by a conditional knowledge base. In a previous
paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied &quot;preferential&quot; consequence
relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered
as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class
of consequence relations, &quot;rational&quot; relations. It is argued that any
reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation.
It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be
represented by a &quot;ranked&quot; preferential model, or by a (non-standard)
probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is
defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title.
Global properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative
operation. It is also computationally tractable. This paper assumes the
underlying language is propositional.

 <dc:description>  A model for decision making that generalizes Expected Utility Maximization is
presented. This model, Expected Qualitative Utility Maximization, encompasses
the Maximin criterion. It relaxes both the Independence and the Continuity
postulates. Its main ingredient is the definition of a qualitative order on
nonstandard models of the real numbers and the consideration of nonstandard
utilities. Expected Qualitative Utility Maximization is characterized by an
original weakening of von Neumann-Morgenstern's postulates. Subjective
probabilities may be defined from those weakened postulates, as Anscombe and
Aumann did from the original postulates. Subjective probabilities are numbers,
not matrices as in the Subjective Expected Lexicographic Utility approach. JEL

 <dc:description>  A vast and interesting family of natural semantics for belief revision is
defined. Suppose one is given a distance d between any two models. One may then
define the revision of a theory K by a formula a as the theory defined by the
set of all those models of a that are closest, by d, to the set of models of K.
This family is characterized by a set of rationality postulates that extends
the AGM postulates. The new postulates describe properties of iterated
revisions.

 <dc:description>  We give a semantics to iterated update by a preference relation on possible
developments. An iterated update is a sequence of formulas, giving (incomplete)
information about successive states of the world. A development is a sequence
of models, describing a possible trajectory through time. We assume a principle
of inertia and prefer those developments, which are compatible with the
information, and avoid unnecessary changes. The logical properties of the
updates defined in this way are considered, and a representation result is
proved.

 <dc:description>  We describe a binding schema markup language (BSML) for describing data
interchange between scientific codes. Such a facility is an important
constituent of scientific problem solving environments (PSEs). BSML is designed
to integrate with a PSE or application composition system that views model
specification and execution as a problem of managing semistructured data. The
data interchange problem is addressed by three techniques for processing
semistructured data: validation, binding, and conversion. We present BSML and
describe its application to a PSE for wireless communications system design.

 <dc:title>Classes of service under perfect competition and technological change: a

 <dc:creator>Lehmann, Daniel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>J.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Certain services may be provided in a continuous, one-dimensional, ordered
range of different qualities and a customer requiring a service of quality q
can only be offered a quality superior or equal to q. Only a discrete set of
different qualities will be offered, and a service provider will provide the
same service (of fixed quality b) to all customers requesting qualities of
service inferior or equal to b. Assuming all services (of quality b) are priced
identically, a monopolist will choose the qualities of service and the prices
that maximize profit but, under perfect competition, a service provider will
choose the (inferior) quality of service that can be priced at the lowest
price. Assuming significant economies of scale, two fundamentally different
regimes are possible: either a number of different classes of service are
offered (DC regime), or a unique class of service offers an unbounded quality
of service (UC regime). The DC regime appears in one of two sub-regimes: one,
BDC, in which a finite number of classes is offered, the qualities of service
offered are bounded and requests for high-quality services are not met, or UDC
in which an infinite number of classes of service are offered and every request
is met. The types of the demand curve and of the economies of scale, not the
pace of technological change, determine the regime and the class boundaries.
The price structure in the DC regime obeys very general laws.

 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The consideration of nonstandard models of the real numbers and the
definition of a qualitative ordering on those models provides a generalization
of the principle of maximization of expected utility. It enables the decider to
assign probabilities of different orders of magnitude to different events or to
assign utilities of different orders of magnitude to different outcomes. The
properties of this generalized notion of rationality are studied in the
frameworks proposed by von Neumann and Morgenstern and later by Anscombe and
Aumann. It is characterized by an original weakening of their postulates in two
different situations: nonstandard probabilities and standard utilities on one
hand and standard probabilities and nonstandard utilities on the other hand.
This weakening concerns both Independence and Continuity. It is orthogonal with
the weakening proposed by lexicographic orderings.

 <dc:description>  Preferences among acts are analyzed in the style of L. Savage, but as

Savage's on three counts. The Sure Thing Principle is derived in this setting.
The postulates are shown to lead to a characterization of generalized
qualitative probability that includes and blends both traditional qualitative
probability and the ranked structures used in logical approaches.

 <dc:description>  A. Tarski proposed the study of infinitary consequence operations as the
central topic of mathematical logic. He considered monotonicity to be a
property of all such operations. In this paper, we weaken the monotonicity
requirement and consider more general operations, inference operations. These
operations describe the nonmonotonic logics both humans and machines seem to be
using when infering defeasible information from incomplete knowledge. We single
out a number of interesting families of inference operations. This study of
infinitary inference operations is inspired by the results of Kraus, Lehmann
and Magidor on finitary nonmonotonic operations, but this paper is
self-contained.

 <dc:description>  Finding optimal solutions for multi-unit combinatorial auctions is a hard
problem and finding approximations to the optimal solution is also hard. We
investigate the use of Branch-and-Bound techniques: they require both a way to
bound from above the value of the best allocation and a good criterion to
decide which bids are to be tried first. Different methods for efficiently
bounding from above the value of the best allocation are considered.
Theoretical original results characterize the best approximation ratio and the
ordering criterion that provides it. We suggest to use this criterion.

 <dc:description>  The Expansion property considered by researchers in Social Choice is shown to
correspond to a logical property of nonmonotonic consequence relations that is
the {\em pure}, i.e., not involving connectives, version of a previously known
weak rationality condition. The assumption that the union of two definable sets
of models is definable is needed for the soundness part of the result.

 <dc:description>  We propose that a regulation mechanism based on Hebbian covariance plasticity
may cause the brain to operate near criticality. We analyze the effect of such
a regulation on the dynamics of a network with excitatory and inhibitory
neurons and uniform connectivity within and across the two populations. We show
that, under broad conditions, the system converges to a critical state lying at
the common boundary of three regions in parameter space; these correspond to
three modes of behavior: high activity, low activity, oscillation.

 <dc:description>  In optimizing queries, solutions based on AND/OR DAG can generate all
possible join orderings and select placements before searching for optimal
query execution strategy. But as the number of joins and selection conditions
increase, the space and time complexity to generate optimal query plan
increases exponentially. In this paper, we use join graph for a relational
database schema to either pre-compute all possible join orderings that can be
executed and store it as a join DAG or, extract joins in the queries to
incrementally build a history join DAG as and when the queries are executed.
The select conditions in the queries are appropriately placed in the retrieved
join DAG (or, history join DAG) to generate optimal query execution strategy.
We experimentally evaluate our query optimization technique on TPC-D/H query
sets to show their effectiveness over AND/OR DAG query optimization strategy.
Finally, we illustrate how our technique can be used for efficient multiple
query optimization and selection of materialized views in data warehousing
environments.

 <dc:description>  A Boolean constraint satisfaction instance is a conjunction of constraint
applications, where the allowed constraints are drawn from a fixed set B of
Boolean functions. We consider the problem of determining whether two given
constraint satisfaction instances are equivalent and prove a Dichotomy Theorem
by showing that for all sets C of allowed constraints, this problem is either
polynomial-time solvable or coNP-complete, and we give a simple criterion to
determine which case holds.
  A more general problem addressed in this paper is the isomorphism problem,
the problem of determining whether there exists a renaming of the variables
that makes two given constraint satisfaction instances equivalent in the above
sense. We prove that this problem is coNP-hard if the corresponding equivalence
problem is coNP-hard, and polynomial-time many-one reducible to the graph
isomorphism problem in all other cases.

 <dc:description>  We describe a meta-querying system for databases containing queries in
addition to ordinary data. In the context of such databases, a meta-query is a
query about queries. Representing stored queries in XML, and using the standard
XML manipulation language XSLT as a sublanguage, we show that just a few
features need to be added to SQL to turn it into a fully-fledged meta-query
language. The good news is that these features can be directly supported by
extensible database technology.

 <dc:description>  Cores are, besides connectivity components, one among few concepts that
provides us with efficient decompositions of large graphs and networks.
  In the paper a generalization of the notion of core of a graph based on
vertex property function is presented. It is shown that for the local monotone
vertex property functions the corresponding cores can be determined in $O(m
\max (\Delta, \log n))$ time.

 <dc:description>  We study program refactoring while considering the language or even the
programming paradigm as a parameter. We use typed functional programs, namely
Haskell programs, as the specification medium for a corresponding refactoring
framework. In order to detach ourselves from language syntax, our
specifications adhere to the following style. (I) As for primitive algorithms
for program analysis and transformation, we employ generic function combinators
supporting generic traversal and polymorphic functions refined by ad-hoc cases.
(II) As for the language abstractions involved in refactorings, we design a
dedicated multi-parameter class. This class can be instantiated for
abstractions as present in various languages, e.g., Java, Prolog or Haskell.

 <dc:description>  The lexicographic closure of any given finite set D of normal defaults is
defined. A conditional assertion &quot;if a then b&quot; is in this lexicographic closure
if, given the defaults D and the fact a, one would conclude b. The
lexicographic closure is essentially a rational extension of D, and of its
rational closure, defined in a previous paper. It provides a logic of normal
defaults that is different from the one proposed by R. Reiter and that is rich
enough not to require the consideration of non-normal defaults. A large number
of examples are provided to show that the lexicographic closure corresponds to
the basic intuitions behind Reiter's logic of defaults.

 <dc:description>  We provide a characterization of those nonmonotonic inference operations C
for which C(X) may be described as the set of all logical consequences of X
together with some set of additional assumptions S(X) that depends
anti-monotonically on X (i.e., X is a subset of Y implies that S(Y) is a subset
of S(X)). The operations represented are exactly characterized in terms of
properties most of which have been studied in Freund-Lehmann(cs.AI/0202031).
Similar characterizations of right-absorbing and cumulative operations are also
provided. For cumulative operations, our results fit in closely with those of
Freund. We then discuss extending finitary operations to infinitary operations
in a canonical way and discuss co-compactness properties. Our results provide a
satisfactory notion of pseudo-compactness, generalizing to deductive
nonmonotonic operations the notion of compactness for monotonic operations.
They also provide an alternative, more elegant and more general, proof of the
existence of an infinitary deductive extension for any finitary deductive
operation (Theorem 7.9 of Freund-Lehmann).

 <dc:title>A Framework for Compiling Preferences in Logic Programs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference
information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered
logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique
terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form
s &lt; t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a
second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected,
in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the
preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the
specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily
within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a
logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we
develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the
preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We
then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing
how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured
within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an
extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as
dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler
as a front-end for these programming systems.

 <dc:description>  Constructor-Based Conditional Rewriting Logic is a general framework for
integrating first-order functional and logic programming which gives an
algebraic semantics for non-deterministic functional-logic programs. In the
context of this formalism, we introduce a simple notion of program module as an
open program which can be extended together with several mechanisms to combine
them. These mechanisms are based on a reduced set of operations. However, the
high expressiveness of these operations enable us to model typical constructs
for program modularization like hiding, export/import,
genericity/instantiation, and inheritance in a simple way. We also deal with
the semantic aspects of the proposal by introducing an immediate consequence
operator, and studying several alternative semantics for a program module,
based on this operator, in the line of logic programming: the operator itself,
its least fixpoint (the least model of the module), the set of its
pre-fixpoints (term models of the module), and some other variations in order
to find a compositional and fully abstract semantics wrt the set of operations
and a natural notion of observability.

 <dc:description>  Prioritized default reasoning has illustrated its rich expressiveness and
flexibility in knowledge representation and reasoning. However, many important
aspects of prioritized default reasoning have yet to be thoroughly explored. In
this paper, we investigate two properties of prioritized logic programs in the
context of answer set semantics. Specifically, we reveal a close relationship
between mutual defeasibility and uniqueness of the answer set for a prioritized
logic program. We then explore how the splitting technique for extended logic
programs can be extended to prioritized logic programs. We prove splitting

 <dc:description>  We describe our experiences in using SPIN to verify parts of the Multi
Purpose Daemon (MPD) parallel process management system. MPD is a distributed
collection of processes connected by Unix network sockets. MPD is dynamic:
processes and connections among them are created and destroyed as MPD is
initialized, runs user processes, recovers from faults, and terminates. This
dynamic nature is easily expressible in the SPIN/PROMELA framework but poses
performance and scalability challenges. We present here the results of
expressing some of the parallel algorithms of MPD and executing both simulation
and verification runs with SPIN.

 <dc:description>  One of the main questions concerning learning in Multi-Agent Systems is:
(How) can agents benefit from mutual interaction during the learning process?.
This paper describes the study of an interactive advice-exchange mechanism as a
possible way to improve agents' learning performance. The advice-exchange
technique, discussed here, uses supervised learning (backpropagation), where
reinforcement is not directly coming from the environment but is based on
advice given by peers with better performance score (higher confidence), to
enhance the performance of a heterogeneous group of Learning Agents (LAs). The
LAs are facing similar problems, in an environment where only reinforcement
information is available. Each LA applies a different, well known, learning
technique: Random Walk (hill-climbing), Simulated Annealing, Evolutionary
Algorithms and Q-Learning. The problem used for evaluation is a simplified
traffic-control simulation. Initial results indicate that advice-exchange can
improve learning speed, although bad advice and/or blind reliance can disturb
the learning performance.

 <dc:description>  Tools for filtering the World Wide Web exist, but they are hampered by the
difficulty of capturing user preferences in such a dynamic environment. We
explore the acquisition of user profiles by unobtrusive monitoring of browsing
behaviour and application of supervised machine-learning techniques coupled
with an ontological representation to extract user preferences. A multi-class
approach to paper classification is used, allowing the paper topic taxonomy to
be utilised during profile construction. The Quickstep recommender system is
presented and two empirical studies evaluate it in a real work setting,
measuring the effectiveness of using a hierarchical topic ontology compared
with an extendable flat list.

 <dc:description>  We consider the two-fold problem of representing collective beliefs and
aggregating these beliefs. We propose modular, transitive relations for
collective beliefs. They allow us to represent conflicting opinions and they
have a clear semantics. We compare them with the quasi-transitive relations
often used in Social Choice. Then, we describe a way to construct the belief
state of an agent informed by a set of sources of varying degrees of
reliability. This construction circumvents Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in a
satisfactory manner. Finally, we give a simple set-theory-based operator for
combining the information of multiple agents. We show that this operator
satisfies the desirable invariants of idempotence, commutativity, and
associativity, and, thus, is well-behaved when iterated, and we describe a
computationally effective way of computing the resulting belief state.

 <dc:description>  Research into active networking has provided the incentive to re-visit what
has traditionally been classified as distinct properties and characteristics of
information transfer such as protocol versus service; at a more fundamental
level this paper considers the blending of computation and communication by
means of complexity. The specific service examined in this paper is network
self-prediction enabled by Active Virtual Network Management Prediction.
Computation/communication is analyzed via Kolmogorov Complexity. The result is
a mechanism to understand and improve the performance of active networking and
Active Virtual Network Management Prediction in particular. The Active Virtual
Network Management Prediction mechanism allows information, in various states
of algorithmic and static form, to be transported in the service of prediction
for network management. The results are generally applicable to algorithmic
transmission of information. Kolmogorov Complexity is used and experimentally
validated as a theory describing the relationship among algorithmic
compression, complexity, and prediction accuracy within an active network.
Finally, the paper concludes with a complexity-based framework for Information
Assurance that attempts to take a holistic view of vulnerability analysis.

 <dc:description>  Music composition using digital audio sequence editors is increasingly
performed in a visual workspace where sound complexes are built from discrete
sound objects, called gestures that are arranged in time and space to generate
a continuous composition. The visual workspace, common to most industry
standard audio loop sequencing software, is premised on the arrangement of
gestures defined with geometric shape properties. Here, one aspect of fractal
set theory was validated using audio-frequency sets to evaluate self-affine
scaling behavior when new sound complexes are built through union and
intersection operations on discrete musical gestures. Results showed that
intersection of two sets revealed lower complexity compared with the union
operator, meaning that the intersection of two sound gestures is an almost
disjoint set, and in accord with formal logic. These results are also discussed
with reference to fuzzy sets, cellular automata, nanotechnology and
self-organization to further explore the link between sequenced notation and
complexity.

 <dc:title>Dimension in Complexity Classes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lutz, Jack H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A theory of resource-bounded dimension is developed using gales, which are
natural generalizations of martingales. When the resource bound \Delta (a
parameter of the theory) is unrestricted, the resulting dimension is precisely
the classical Hausdorff dimension (sometimes called fractal dimension). Other
choices of the parameter \Delta yield internal dimension theories in E, E2,
ESPACE, and other complexity classes, and in the class of all decidable
problems. In general, if C is such a class, then every set X of languages has a
dimension in C, which is a real number dim(X|C) in [0,1]. Along with the
elements of this theory, two preliminary applications are presented:
  1. For every real number \alpha in (0,1/2), the set FREQ(&lt;=\alpha),
consisting of all languages that asymptotically contain at most \alpha of all
strings, has dimension H(\alpha) -- the binary entropy of \alpha -- in E and in
E2.
  2. For every real number \alpha in (0,1), the set SIZE(\alpha* (2^n)/n),
consisting of all languages decidable by Boolean circuits of at most
\alpha*(2^n)/n gates, has dimension \alpha in ESPACE.

 <dc:title>The Dimensions of Individual Strings and Sequences</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lutz, Jack H.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A constructive version of Hausdorff dimension is developed using constructive
supergales, which are betting strategies that generalize the constructive
supermartingales used in the theory of individual random sequences. This
constructive dimension is used to assign every individual (infinite, binary)
sequence S a dimension, which is a real number dim(S) in the interval [0,1].
Sequences that are random (in the sense of Martin-Lof) have dimension 1, while
sequences that are decidable, \Sigma^0_1, or \Pi^0_1 have dimension 0. It is
shown that for every \Delta^0_2-computable real number \alpha in [0,1] there is
a \Delta^0_2 sequence S such that \dim(S) = \alpha.
  A discrete version of constructive dimension is also developed using
termgales, which are supergale-like functions that bet on the terminations of
(finite, binary) strings as well as on their successive bits. This discrete
dimension is used to assign each individual string w a dimension, which is a
nonnegative real number dim(w). The dimension of a sequence is shown to be the
limit infimum of the dimensions of its prefixes.
  The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is proven to be the product of its
length and its dimension. This gives a new characterization of algorithmic
information and a new proof of Mayordomo's recent theorem stating that the
dimension of a sequence is the limit infimum of the average Kolmogorov
complexity of its first n bits.
  Every sequence that is random relative to any computable sequence of
coin-toss biases that converge to a real number \beta in (0,1) is shown to have
dimension \H(\beta), the binary entropy of \beta.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of compressing massive tables within the
partition-training paradigm introduced by Buchsbaum et al. [SODA'00], in which
a table is partitioned by an off-line training procedure into disjoint
intervals of columns, each of which is compressed separately by a standard,
on-line compressor like gzip. We provide a new theory that unifies previous
experimental observations on partitioning and heuristic observations on column
permutation, all of which are used to improve compression rates. Based on the
theory, we devise the first on-line training algorithms for table compression,
which can be applied to individual files, not just continuously operating
sources; and also a new, off-line training algorithm, based on a link to the
asymmetric traveling salesman problem, which improves on prior work by
rearranging columns prior to partitioning. We demonstrate these results
experimentally. On various test files, the on-line algorithms provide 35-55%
improvement over gzip with negligible slowdown; the off-line reordering
provides up to 20% further improvement over partitioning alone. We also show
that a variation of the table compression problem is MAX-SNP hard.

 <dc:description>  Clusters, grids, and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have emerged as popular
paradigms for next generation parallel and distributed computing. The
management of resources and scheduling of applications in such large-scale
distributed systems is a complex undertaking. In order to prove the
effectiveness of resource brokers and associated scheduling algorithms, their
performance needs to be evaluated under different scenarios such as varying
number of resources and users with different requirements. In a grid
environment, it is hard and even impossible to perform scheduler performance
evaluation in a repeatable and controllable manner as resources and users are
distributed across multiple organizations with their own policies. To overcome
this limitation, we have developed a Java-based discrete-event grid simulation
toolkit called GridSim. The toolkit supports modeling and simulation of
heterogeneous grid resources (both time- and space-shared), users and
application models. It provides primitives for creation of application tasks,
mapping of tasks to resources, and their management. To demonstrate suitability
of the GridSim toolkit, we have simulated a Nimrod-G like grid resource broker
and evaluated the performance of deadline and budget constrained cost- and

 <dc:title>A Deadline and Budget Constrained Cost-Time Optimisation Algorithm for
  Scheduling Task Farming Applications on Global Grids</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Computational Grids and peer-to-peer (P2P) networks enable the sharing,
selection, and aggregation of geographically distributed resources for solving
large-scale problems in science, engineering, and commerce. The management and
composition of resources and services for scheduling applications, however,
becomes a complex undertaking. We have proposed a computational economy
framework for regulating the supply and demand for resources and allocating
them for applications based on the users quality of services requirements. The
framework requires economy driven deadline and budget constrained (DBC)
scheduling algorithms for allocating resources to application jobs in such a
way that the users requirements are met. In this paper, we propose a new
scheduling algorithm, called DBC cost-time optimisation, which extends the DBC
cost-optimisation algorithm to optimise for time, keeping the cost of
computation at the minimum. The superiority of this new scheduling algorithm,
in achieving lower job completion time, is demonstrated by simulating the
World-Wide Grid and scheduling task-farming applications for different deadline
and budget scenarios using both this new and the cost optimisation scheduling
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The system presented here shows the feasibility of modeling the knowledge
involved in a complex musical activity by integrating sub-symbolic and symbolic
processes. This research focuses on the question of whether there is any
advantage in integrating a neural network together with a distributed
artificial intelligence approach within the music domain. The primary purpose
of our work is to design a model that describes the different aspects a user
might be interested in considering when involved in a musical activity. The
approach we suggest in this work enables the musician to encode his knowledge,
intuitions, and aesthetic taste into different modules. The system captures
these aspects by computing and applying three distinct functions: rules, fuzzy
concepts, and learning.
  As a case study, we began experimenting with first species two-part
counterpoint melodies. We have developed a hybrid system composed of a
connectionist module and an agent-based module to combine the sub-symbolic and
symbolic levels to achieve this task. The technique presented here to represent
musical knowledge constitutes a new approach for composing polyphonic music.

 <dc:description>  In order to improve precision and efficiency sharing analysis should track
both freeness and linearity. The abstract unification algorithms for these
combined domains are suboptimal, hence there is scope for improving precision.
This paper proposes three optimisations for tracing sharing in combination with
freeness and linearity. A novel connection between equations and sharing
abstractions is used to establish correctness of these optimisations even in
the presence of rational trees. A method for pruning intermediate sharing
abstractions to improve efficiency is also proposed. The optimisations are
lightweight and therefore some, if not all, of these optimisations will be of
interest to the implementor.

 <dc:description>  New services based on the best-effort paradigm could complement the current
deterministic services of an electronic financial exchange. Four crucial
aspects of such systems would benefit from a hybrid stance: proper use of
processing resources, bandwidth management, fault tolerance, and exception
handling. We argue that a more refined view on Quality-of-Service control for
exchange systems, in which the principal ambition of upholding a fair and
orderly marketplace is left uncompromised, would benefit all interested
parties.

 <dc:description>  The Web graph is a giant social network whose properties have been measured
and modeled extensively in recent years. Most such studies concentrate on the
graph structure alone, and do not consider textual properties of the nodes.
Consequently, Web communities have been characterized purely in terms of graph
structure and not on page content. We propose that a topic taxonomy such as
Yahoo! or the Open Directory provides a useful framework for understanding the
structure of content-based clusters and communities. In particular, using a
topic taxonomy and an automatic classifier, we can measure the background
distribution of broad topics on the Web, and analyze the capability of recent
random walk algorithms to draw samples which follow such distributions. In
addition, we can measure the probability that a page about one broad topic will
link to another broad topic. Extending this experiment, we can measure how
quickly topic context is lost while walking randomly on the Web graph.
Estimates of this topic mixing distance may explain why a global PageRank is
still meaningful in the context of broad queries. In general, our measurements
may prove valuable in the design of community-specific crawlers and link-based
ranking systems.

where the object is manufactured by gluing together two identical faces of
parts cast with a single piece mold. In this model we show that the class of
convex polyhedra which can be enclosed between two concentric spheres of the
ratio of their radii less than 1.07 cannot be manufactured using only two cast
parts.

 <dc:description>  Projective geometry provides the preferred framework for most implementations
of Euclidean space in graphics applications. Translations and rotations are
both linear transformations in projective geometry, which helps when it comes
to programming complicated geometrical operations. But there is a fundamental
weakness in this approach - the Euclidean distance between points is not
handled in a straightforward manner. Here we discuss a solution to this
problem, based on conformal geometry. The language of geometric algebra is best
suited to exploiting this geometry, as it handles the interior and exterior
products in a single, unified framework. A number of applications are
discussed, including a compact formula for reflecting a line off a general
spherical surface.

 <dc:description>  Because the data being mined in the temporal database will evolve with time,
many researchers have focused on the incremental mining of frequent sequences
in temporal database. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called IUS, using
the frequent and negative border sequences in the original database for
incremental sequence mining. To deal with the case where some data need to be
updated from the original database, we present an algorithm called DUS to
maintain sequential patterns in the updated database. We also define the
negative border sequence threshold: Min_nbd_supp to control the number of
sequences in the negative border.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we first define a difference measure between the old and new
sequential patterns of stream data, which is proved to be a distance. Then we
propose an experimental method, called TPD (Tradeoff between Performance and
Difference), to decide when to update the sequential patterns of stream data by
making a tradeoff between the performance of increasingly updating algorithms
and the difference of sequential patterns. The experiments for the incremental
updating algorithm IUS on two data sets show that generally, as the size of
incremental windows grows, the values of the speedup and the values of the
difference will decrease and increase respectively. It is also shown
experimentally that the incremental ratio determined by the TPD method does not
monotonically increase or decrease but changes in a range between 20 and 30
percentage for the IUS algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Goedel Incompleteness Theorem leaves open a way around it, vaguely perceived
for a long time but not clearly identified. (Thus, Goedel believed informal
arguments can answer any math question.) Closing this loophole does not seem
obvious and involves Kolmogorov complexity. (This is unrelated to, well studied
before, complexity quantifications of the usual Goedel effects.) I consider
extensions U of the universal partial recursive predicate (or, say, Peano
Arithmetic). I prove that any U either leaves an n-bit input (statement)
unresolved or contains nearly all information about the n-bit prefix of any
r.e. real r (which is n bits for some r). I argue that creating significant
information about a SPECIFIC math sequence is impossible regardless of the
methods used. Similar problems and answers apply to other unsolvability results
for tasks allowing multiple solutions, e.g. non-recursive tilings.

 <dc:description>  We study {\em routing} and {\em scheduling} in packet-switched networks. We
assume an adversary that controls the injection time, source, and destination
for each packet injected. A set of paths for these packets is {\em admissible}
if no link in the network is overloaded. We present the first on-line routing
algorithm that finds a set of admissible paths whenever this is feasible. Our
algorithm calculates a path for each packet as soon as it is injected at its
source using a simple shortest path computation. The length of a link reflects
its current congestion. We also show how our algorithm can be implemented under
today's Internet routing paradigms.
  When the paths are known (either given by the adversary or computed as above)
our goal is to schedule the packets along the given paths so that the packets
experience small end-to-end delays. The best previous delay bounds for
deterministic and distributed scheduling protocols were exponential in the path
length. In this paper we present the first deterministic and distributed
scheduling protocol that guarantees a polynomial end-to-end delay for every
packet.
  Finally, we discuss the effects of combining routing with scheduling. We
first show that some unstable scheduling protocols remain unstable no matter
how the paths are chosen. However, the freedom to choose paths can make a
difference. For example, we show that a ring with parallel links is stable for
all greedy scheduling protocols if paths are chosen intelligently, whereas this
is not the case if the adversary specifies the paths.

 <dc:description>  Power law distribution seems to be an important characteristic of web graphs.
Several existing web graph models generate power law graphs by adding new
vertices and non-uniform edge connectivities to existing graphs. Researchers
have conjectured that preferential connectivity and incremental growth are both
required for the power law distribution. In this paper, we propose a different
web graph model with power law distribution that does not require incremental
growth. We also provide a comparison of our model with several others in their
ability to predict web graph clustering behavior.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new family of one-player games, involving the movement of
coins from one configuration to another. Moves are restricted so that a coin
can be placed only in a position that is adjacent to at least two other coins.
The goal of this paper is to specify exactly which of these games are solvable.
By introducing the notion of a constant number of extra coins, we give tight
theorems characterizing solvable puzzles on the square grid and
equilateral-triangle grid. These existence results are supplemented by
polynomial-time algorithms for finding a solution.

 <dc:title>Blind Normalization of Speech From Different Channels and Speakers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levin, David N.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes representations of time-dependent signals that are
invariant under any invertible time-independent transformation of the signal
time series. Such a representation is created by rescaling the signal in a
non-linear dynamic manner that is determined by recently encountered signal
levels. This technique may make it possible to normalize signals that are
related by channel-dependent and speaker-dependent transformations, without
having to characterize the form of the signal transformations, which remain
unknown. The technique is illustrated by applying it to the time-dependent
spectra of speech that has been filtered to simulate the effects of different
channels. The experimental results show that the rescaled speech
representations are largely normalized (i.e., channel-independent), despite the
channel-dependence of the raw (unrescaled) speech.

 <dc:description>  The Annotation Graph Toolkit (AGTK) is a collection of software which
facilitates development of linguistic annotation tools. AGTK provides a
database interface which allows applications to use a database server for
persistent storage. This paper discusses various modes of collaborative
annotation and how they can be supported with tools built using AGTK and its
database interface. We describe the relational database schema and API, and
describe a version of the TableTrans tool which supports collaborative
annotation. The remainder of the paper discusses a high-level query language
for annotation graphs, along with optimizations, in support of expressive and
efficient access to the annotations held on a large central server. The paper
demonstrates that it is straightforward to support a variety of different
levels of collaborative annotation with existing AGTK-based tools, with a
minimum of additional programming effort.

 <dc:description>  The Annotation Graph Toolkit is a collection of software supporting the
development of annotation tools based on the annotation graph model. The
toolkit includes application programming interfaces for manipulating annotation
graph data and for importing data from other formats. There are interfaces for
the scripting languages Tcl and Python, a database interface, specialized
graphical user interfaces for a variety of annotation tasks, and several sample
applications. This paper describes all the toolkit components for the benefit
of would-be application developers.

 <dc:description>  Four diverse tools built on the Annotation Graph Toolkit are described. Each
tool associates linguistic codes and structures with time-series data. All are
based on the same software library and tool architecture. TableTrans is for
observational coding, using a spreadsheet whose rows are aligned to a signal.
MultiTrans is for transcribing multi-party communicative interactions recorded
using multi-channel signals. InterTrans is for creating interlinear text
aligned to audio. TreeTrans is for creating and manipulating syntactic trees.
This work demonstrates that the development of diverse tools and re-use of
software components is greatly facilitated by a common high-level application
programming interface for representing the data and managing input/output,
together with a common architecture for managing the interaction of multiple
components.

 <dc:description>  Treebank formats and associated software tools are proliferating rapidly,

possibilities for managing and exploiting multilayer annotations.

 <dc:description>  On the base of recently proposed three-stage quantitative neural network
model of the tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomenon a possibility to occur of TOT
states coursed by neural network interneuron links' disruption has been
studied. Using a numerical example it was found that TOTs coursed by interneron
links' disruption are in (1.5 + - 0.3)x1000 times less probable then those
coursed by irrelevant (incomplete) neural network localization. It was shown
that delayed TOT states' etiology cannot be related to neural network
interneuron links' disruption.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of dualizing a monotone CNF (equivalently, computing
all minimal transversals of a hypergraph), whose associated decision problem is
a prominent open problem in NP-completeness. We present a number of new
polynomial time resp. output-polynomial time results for significant cases,
which largely advance the tractability frontier and improve on previous
results. Furthermore, we show that duality of two monotone CNFs can be
disproved with limited nondeterminism. More precisely, this is feasible in
polynomial time with O(chi(n) * log n) suitably guessed bits, where chi(n) is
given by \chi(n)^chi(n) = n; note that chi(n) = o(log n). This result sheds new
light on the complexity of this important problem.

 <dc:description>  We consider here the problem of obtaining reliable, consistent information
from inconsistent databases -- databases that do not have to satisfy given
integrity constraints. We use the notion of consistent query answer -- a query
answer which is true in every (minimal) repair of the database. We provide a
complete classification of the computational complexity of consistent answers
to first-order queries w.r.t. functional dependencies and denial constraints.
We show how the complexity depends on the {\em type} of the constraints
considered, their {\em number}, and the {\em size} of the query. We obtain
several new PTIME cases, using new algorithms.

 <dc:title>Fair Stateless Aggregate Traffic Marking using Active Queue Management

 <dc:description>  In heterogeneous networks such as today's Internet, the differentiated
services architecture promises to provide QoS guarantees through scalable
service differentiation. Traffic marking is an important component of this
framework. In this paper, we propose two new aggregate markers that are
stateless, scalable and fair. We leverage stateless Active Queue Management
(AQM) algorithms to enable fair and efficient token distribution among
individual flows of an aggregate. The first marker, Probabilistic Aggregate
Marker (PAM), uses the Token Bucket burst size to probabilistically mark
incoming packets to ensure TCP-friendly and proportionally fair marking. The
second marker, Stateless Aggregate Fair Marker (F-SAM) approximates fair
queueing techniques to isolate flows while marking packets of the aggregate. It
distributes tokens evenly among the flows without maintaining per-flow state.
Our simulation results show that our marking strategies show upto 30%
improvement over other commonly used markers while marking flow aggregates.
These improvements are in terms of better average throughput and fairness
indices, in scenarios containing heterogeneous traffic consisting of TCP (both
long lived elephants and short lived mice) and misbehaving UDP flows. As a
bonus, F-SAM helps the mice to win the war against elephants.

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems learn about user preferences over time, automatically
finding things of similar interest. This reduces the burden of creating
explicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start
problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base
recommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide
valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such
knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests
are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the
synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology
containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases
available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems
cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology's
interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is
conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.

 <dc:description>  In previous work, we have introduced functional strategies, that is,
first-class generic functions that can traverse into terms of any type while
mixing uniform and type-specific behaviour. In the present paper, we give a
detailed description of one particular Haskell-based model of functional
strategies. This model is characterised as follows. Firstly, we employ
first-class polymorphism as a form of second-order polymorphism as for the mere
types of functional strategies. Secondly, we use an encoding scheme of run-time
type case for mixing uniform and type-specific behaviour. Thirdly, we base all
traversal on a fundamental combinator for folding over constructor
applications.
  Using this model, we capture common strategic traversal schemes in a highly
parameterised style. We study two original forms of parameterisation. Firstly,
we design parameters for the specific control-flow, data-flow and traversal
characteristics of more concrete traversal schemes. Secondly, we use
overloading to postpone commitment to a specific type scheme of traversal. The
resulting portfolio of traversal schemes can be regarded as a challenging
benchmark for setups for typed generic programming.
  The way we develop the model and the suite of traversal schemes, it becomes
clear that parameterised + typed strategic programming is best viewed as a
potent combination of certain bits of parametric, intensional, polytypic, and
ad-hoc polymorphism.

 <dc:description>  Consistency, defined as the requirement that a series of measurements of the
same project carried out by different raters using the same method should
produce similar results, is one of the most important aspects to be taken into
account in the measurement methods of the software. In spite of this, there is
a widespread view that many measurement methods introduce an undesirable amount
of subjectivity in the measurement process. This perception has made several
organizations develop revisions of the standard methods whose main aim is to
improve their consistency by introducing some suitable modifications of those
aspects which are believed to introduce a greater degree of subjectivity.Each
revision of a method must be empirically evaluated to determine to what extent
is the aim of improving its consistency achieved. In this article we will
define an homogeneous statistic intended to describe the consistency level of a
method, and we will develop the statistical analysis which should be carried
out in order to conclude whether or not a measurement method is more consistent
than other one.

 <dc:title>Design Patterns for Functional Strategic Programming</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In previous work, we introduced the fundamentals and a supporting combinator
library for \emph{strategic programming}. This an idiom for generic programming
based on the notion of a \emph{functional strategy}: a first-class generic
function that cannot only be applied to terms of any type, but which also
allows generic traversal into subterms and can be customized with type-specific
behaviour.
  This paper seeks to provide practicing functional programmers with pragmatic
guidance in crafting their own strategic programs. We present the fundamentals
and the support from a user's perspective, and we initiate a catalogue of
\emph{strategy design patterns}. These design patterns aim at consolidating
strategic programming expertise in accessible form.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we show that reversible analysis of logic languages by abstract
interpretation can be performed without loss of precision by systematically
refining abstract domains. The idea is to include semantic structures into
abstract domains in such a way that the refined abstract domain becomes rich
enough to allow approximate bottom-up and top-down semantics to agree. These
domains are known as condensing abstract domains. Substantially, an abstract
domain is condensing if goal-driven and goal-independent analyses agree, namely
no loss of precision is introduced by approximating queries in a
goal-independent analysis. We prove that condensation is an abstract domain
property and that the problem of making an abstract domain condensing boils
down to the problem of making the domain complete with respect to unification.
In a general abstract interpretation setting we show that when concrete domains
and operations give rise to quantales, i.e. models of propositional linear
logic, objects in a complete refined abstract domain can be explicitly
characterized by linear logic-based formulations. This is the case for abstract
domains for logic program analysis approximating computed answer substitutions
where unification plays the role of multiplicative conjunction in a quantale of
idempotent substitutions. Condensing abstract domains can therefore be
systematically derived by minimally extending any, generally non-condensing
domain, by a simple domain refinement operator.

 <dc:description>  Clobber is a new two-player board game. In this paper, we introduce the
one-player variant Solitaire Clobber where the goal is to remove as many stones
as possible from the board by alternating white and black moves. We show that a
checkerboard configuration on a single row (or single column) can be reduced to
about n/4 stones. For boards with at least two rows and two columns, we show
that a checkerboard configuration can be reduced to a single stone if and only
if the number of stones is not a multiple of three, and otherwise it can be
reduced to two stones. We also show that in general it is NP-complete to decide
whether an arbitrary Clobber configuration can be reduced to a single stone.

 <dc:description>  A universalization of a parameterized investment strategy is an online
algorithm whose average daily performance approaches that of the strategy
operating with the optimal parameters determined offline in hindsight. We
present a general framework for universalizing investment strategies and
discuss conditions under which investment strategies are universalizable. We
present examples of common investment strategies that fit into our framework.
The examples include both trading strategies that decide positions in
individual stocks, and portfolio strategies that allocate wealth among multiple
stocks. This work extends Cover's universal portfolio work. We also discuss the
runtime efficiency of universalization algorithms. While a straightforward
implementation of our algorithms runs in time exponential in the number of
parameters, we show that the efficient universal portfolio computation
technique of Kalai and Vempala involving the sampling of log-concave functions
can be generalized to other classes of investment strategies.

 <dc:description>  The process of documenting and describing the world's languages is undergoing
radical transformation with the rapid uptake of new digital technologies for
capture, storage, annotation and dissemination. However, uncritical adoption of
new tools and technologies is leading to resources that are difficult to reuse
and which are less portable than the conventional printed resources they
replace. We begin by reviewing current uses of software tools and digital
technologies for language documentation and description. This sheds light on
how digital language documentation and description are created and managed,
leading to an analysis of seven portability problems under the following
headings: content, format, discovery, access, citation, preservation and
rights. After characterizing each problem we provide a series of value
statements, and this provides the framework for a broad range of best practice
recommendations.

flaws. This paper describes this flaws, surveys wireless networks in the
Cologne/Bonn area to get an assessment of the security configurations of
fielded networks and analizes the legal protections provided to wireless
ethernet operators by german law. We conclude that wireless ethernets without
additional security measures are not usable for any transmissions which are not
meant for a public audience.

 <dc:description>  Phonology, as it is practiced, is deeply computational. Phonological analysis
is data-intensive and the resulting models are nothing other than specialized
data structures and algorithms. In the past, phonological computation -
managing data and developing analyses - was done manually with pencil and
paper. Increasingly, with the proliferation of affordable computers, IPA fonts
and drawing software, phonologists are seeking to move their computation work
online. Computational Phonology provides the theoretical and technological
framework for this migration, building on methodologies and tools from
computational linguistics. This piece consists of an apology for computational
phonology, a history, and an overview of current research.

 <dc:description>  We consider the traveling salesman problem when the cities are points in R^d
for some fixed d and distances are computed according to geometric distances,
determined by some norm. We show that for any polyhedral norm, the problem of
finding a tour of maximum length can be solved in polynomial time. If
arithmetic operations are assumed to take unit time, our algorithms run in time
O(n^{f-2} log n), where f is the number of facets of the polyhedron determining
the polyhedral norm. Thus for example we have O(n^2 log n) algorithms for the
cases of points in the plane under the Rectilinear and Sup norms. This is in
contrast to the fact that finding a minimum length tour in each case is
NP-hard. Our approach can be extended to the more general case of quasi-norms
with not necessarily symmetric unit ball, where we get a complexity of
O(n^{2f-2} log n).
  For the special case of two-dimensional metrics with f=4 (which includes the
Rectilinear and Sup norms), we present a simple algorithm with O(n) running
time. The algorithm does not use any indirect addressing, so its running time
remains valid even in comparison based models in which sorting requires Omega(n
\log n) time. The basic mechanism of the algorithm provides some intuition on
why polyhedral norms allow fast algorithms.
  Complementing the results on simplicity for polyhedral norms, we prove that
for the case of Euclidean distances in R^d for d&gt;2, the Maximum TSP is NP-hard.
This sheds new light on the well-studied difficulties of Euclidean distances.

 <dc:description>  Annotated speech corpora are databases consisting of signal data along with
time-aligned symbolic `transcriptions'. Such databases are typically
multidimensional, heterogeneous and dynamic. These properties present a number
of tough challenges for representation and query. The temporal nature of the
data adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents and harmonises
two independent efforts to model annotated speech databases, one at Macquarie
University and one at the University of Pennsylvania. Various query languages

problems. The research reported here forms a part of several ongoing projects
to develop platform-independent open-source tools for creating, browsing,
searching, querying and transforming linguistic databases, and to disseminate

 <dc:title>Integrating selectional preferences in WordNet</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Selectional preference learning methods have usually focused on word-to-class
relations, e.g., a verb selects as its subject a given nominal class. This
paper extends previous statistical models to class-to-class preferences, and
presents a model that learns selectional preferences for classes of verbs,
together with an algorithm to integrate the learned preferences in WordNet. The
theoretical motivation is twofold: different senses of a verb may have
different preferences, and classes of verbs may share preferences. On the
practical side, class-to-class selectional preferences can be learned from
untagged corpora (the same as word-to-class), they provide selectional
preferences for less frequent word senses via inheritance, and more important,
they allow for easy integration in WordNet. The model is trained on
subject-verb and object-verb relationships extracted from a small corpus
disambiguated with WordNet senses. Examples are provided illustrating that the
theoretical motivations are well founded, and showing that the approach is
feasible. Experimental results on a word sense disambiguation task are also
provided.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe the systems we developed for the English (lexical
and all-words) and Basque tasks. They were all supervised systems based on
Yarowsky's Decision Lists. We used Semcor for training in the English all-words
task. We defined different feature sets for each language. For Basque, in order
to extract all the information from the text, we defined features that have not
been used before in the literature, using a morphological analyzer. We also
implemented systems that selected automatically good features and were able to
obtain a prefixed precision (85%) at the cost of coverage. The systems that
used all the features were identified as BCU-ehu-dlist-all and the systems that
selected some features as BCU-ehu-dlist-best.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe the Senseval 2 Basque lexical-sample task. The task
comprised 40 words (15 nouns, 15 verbs and 10 adjectives) selected from Euskal
Hiztegia, the main Basque dictionary. Most examples were taken from the
Egunkaria newspaper. The method used to hand-tag the examples produced low
inter-tagger agreement (75%) before arbitration. The four competing systems
attained results well above the most frequent baseline and the best system
scored 75% precision at 100% coverage. The paper includes an analysis of the
tagging procedure used, as well as the performance of the competing systems. In
particular, we argue that inter-tagger agreement is not a real upperbound for
the Basque WSD task.

 <dc:description>  We present a new characterization of termination of general logic programs.
Most existing termination analysis approaches rely on some static information
about the structure of the source code of a logic program, such as modes/types,
norms/level mappings, models/interargument relations, and the like. We propose
a dynamic approach which employs some key dynamic features of an infinite
(generalized) SLDNF-derivation, such as repetition of selected subgoals and
recursive increase in term size. We also introduce a new formulation of
SLDNF-trees, called generalized SLDNF-trees. Generalized SLDNF-trees deal with
negative subgoals in the same way as Prolog and exist for any general logic
programs.

 <dc:description>  The (extended) AGM postulates for belief revision seem to deal with the
revision of a given theory K by an arbitrary formula, but not to constrain the
revisions of two different theories by the same formula. A new postulate is
proposed and compared with other similar postulates that have been proposed in
the literature. The AGM revisions that satisfy this new postulate stand in
one-to-one correspondence with the rational, consistency-preserving relations.
This correspondence is described explicitly. Two viewpoints on iterative
revisions are distinguished and discussed.

 <dc:description>  We show that several versions of Floyd and Rivest's algorithm Select for
finding the $k$th smallest of $n$ elements require at most
$n+\min\{k,n-k\}+o(n)$ comparisons on average and with high probability. This
rectifies the analysis of Floyd and Rivest, and extends it to the case of
nondistinct elements. Our computational results confirm that Select may be the
best algorithm in practice.

 <dc:description>  A major part of debugging, testing, and analyzing a complex software system
is understanding what is happening within the system at run-time. Some
developers advocate running within a debugger to better understand the system
at this level. Others embed logging statements, even in the form of hard-coded
calls to print functions, throughout the code. These techniques are all
general, rough forms of what we call system monitoring, and, while they have
limited usefulness in simple, sequential systems, they are nearly useless in
complex, concurrent ones. We propose a set of new mechanisms, collectively
known as a monitoring system, for understanding such complex systems, and we
describe an example implementation of such a system, called IDebug, for the
Java programming language.

 <dc:description>  Semantic properties are domain-specific specification constructs used to
augment an existing language with richer semantics. These properties are taken
advantage of in system analysis, design, implementation, testing, and
maintenance through the use of documentation and source-code transformation
tools. Semantic properties are themselves specified at two levels: loosely with
precise natural language, and formally within the problem domain. The
refinement relationships between these specification levels, as well as between
a semantic property's use and its realization in program code via tools, is
specified with a new formal method for reuse called kind theory.

 <dc:description>  Building complex software systems necessitates the use of component-based
architectures. In theory, of the set of components needed for a design, only
some small portion of them are &quot;custom&quot;; the rest are reused or refactored
existing pieces of software. Unfortunately, this is an idealized situation.
Just because two components should work together does not mean that they will
work together.
  The &quot;glue&quot; that holds components together is not just technology. The
contracts that bind complex systems together implicitly define more than their
explicit type. These &quot;conceptual contracts&quot; describe essential aspects of
extra-system semantics: e.g., object models, type systems, data representation,
interface action semantics, legal and contractual obligations, and more.
  Designers and developers spend inordinate amounts of time technologically
duct-taping systems to fulfill these conceptual contracts because system-wide
semantics have not been rigorously characterized or codified. This paper
describes a formal characterization of the problem and discusses an initial
implementation of the resulting theoretical system.

 <dc:description>  In 1974 Kolmogorov proposed a non-probabilistic approach to statistics and
model selection. Let data be finite binary strings and models be finite sets of
binary strings. Consider model classes consisting of models of given maximal
(Kolmogorov) complexity. The ``structure function'' of the given data expresses
the relation between the complexity level constraint on a model class and the
least log-cardinality of a model in the class containing the data. We show that
the structure function determines all stochastic properties of the data: for
every constrained model class it determines the individual best-fitting model
in the class irrespective of whether the ``true'' model is in the model class
considered or not. In this setting, this happens {\em with certainty}, rather
than with high probability as is in the classical case. We precisely quantify
the goodness-of-fit of an individual model with respect to individual data. We
show that--within the obvious constraints--every graph is realized by the
structure function of some data. We determine the (un)computability properties
of the various functions contemplated and of the ``algorithmic minimal
sufficient statistic.''

 <dc:description>  The theoretical foundations of a new model and paradigm (called TIE) for data
storage and access are introduced. Associations between data elements are
stored in a single Matrix table, which is usually kept entirely in RAM for
quick access. The model ties together a very intuitive &quot;guided&quot; GUI to the
Matrix structure, allowing extremely easy complex searches through the data.
Although it is an &quot;Associative Model&quot; in that it stores the data associations
separately from the data itself, in contrast to other implementations of that
model TIE guides the user to only the available information ensuring that every
search is always fruitful. Very many diverse applications of the technology are
reviewed.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the connection between semantic equivalences and
preorders for concrete sequential processes, represented by means of labelled
transition systems, and formats of transition system specifications using
Plotkin's structural approach. For several preorders in the linear time -
branching time spectrum a format is given, as general as possible, such that
this preorder is a precongruence for all operators specifiable in that format.
The formats are derived using the modal characterizations of the corresponding
preorders.

 <dc:title>Self-Optimizing and Pareto-Optimal Policies in General Environments

 <dc:description>  The problem of making sequential decisions in unknown probabilistic
environments is studied. In cycle $t$ action $y_t$ results in perception $x_t$
and reward $r_t$, where all quantities in general may depend on the complete
history. The perception $x_t$ and reward $r_t$ are sampled from the (reactive)
environmental probability distribution $\mu$. This very general setting
includes, but is not limited to, (partial observable, k-th order) Markov
decision processes. Sequential decision theory tells us how to act in order to
maximize the total expected reward, called value, if $\mu$ is known.
Reinforcement learning is usually used if $\mu$ is unknown. In the Bayesian
approach one defines a mixture distribution $\xi$ as a weighted sum of
distributions $\nu\in\M$, where $\M$ is any class of distributions including
the true environment $\mu$. We show that the Bayes-optimal policy $p^\xi$ based
on the mixture $\xi$ is self-optimizing in the sense that the average value
converges asymptotically for all $\mu\in\M$ to the optimal value achieved by
the (infeasible) Bayes-optimal policy $p^\mu$ which knows $\mu$ in advance. We
show that the necessary condition that $\M$ admits self-optimizing policies at
all, is also sufficient. No other structural assumptions are made on $\M$. As
an example application, we discuss ergodic Markov decision processes, which
allow for self-optimizing policies. Furthermore, we show that $p^\xi$ is
Pareto-optimal in the sense that there is no other policy yielding higher or
equal value in {\em all} environments $\nu\in\M$ and a strictly higher value in
at least one.

 <dc:description>  This thesis addresses the problem of providing trusted individuals with
confidential information about other individuals, in particular, granting
access to databases of personal records using the World-Wide Web. It proposes
an access rights management system for distributed databases which aims to
create and implement organisation structures based on the wishes of the owners
and of demands of the users of the databases. The dissertation describes how
current software components could be used to implement this system; it
re-examines the theory of collective choice to develop mechanisms for
generating hierarchies of authorities; it analyses organisational processes for
stability and develops a means of measuring the similarity of their
hierarchies.

 <dc:title>Preprocessing Chains for Fast Dihedral Rotations Is Hard or Even

 <dc:description>  We examine a computational geometric problem concerning the structure of
polymers. We model a polymer as a polygonal chain in three dimensions. Each
edge splits the polymer into two subchains, and a dihedral rotation rotates one
of these chains rigidly about this edge. The problem is to determine, given a
chain, an edge, and an angle of rotation, if the motion can be performed
without causing the chain to self-intersect. An Omega(n log n) lower bound on
the time complexity of this problem is known.
  We prove that preprocessing a chain of n edges and answering n dihedral
rotation queries is 3SUM-hard, giving strong evidence that solving n queries
requires Omega(n^2) time in the worst case. For dynamic queries, which also
modify the chain if the requested dihedral rotation is feasible, we show that
answering n queries is by itself 3SUM-hard, suggesting that sublinear query
time is impossible after any amount of preprocessing.

 <dc:description>  Searching the space of policies directly for the optimal policy has been one
popular method for solving partially observable reinforcement learning
problems. Typically, with each change of the target policy, its value is
estimated from the results of following that very policy. This requires a large
number of interactions with the environment as different polices are
considered. We present a family of algorithms based on likelihood ratio
estimation that use data gathered when executing one policy (or collection of
policies) to estimate the value of a different policy. The algorithms combine
estimation and optimization stages. The former utilizes experience to build a
non-parametric representation of an optimized function. The latter performs
optimization on this estimate. We show positive empirical results and provide
the sample complexity bound.

 <dc:description>  Global mobile robot localization is the problem of determining a robot's pose
in an environment, using sensor data, when the starting position is unknown. A
family of probabilistic algorithms known as Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) is
currently among the most popular methods for solving this problem. MCL
algorithms represent a robot's belief by a set of weighted samples, which
approximate the posterior probability of where the robot is located by using a
Bayesian formulation of the localization problem. This article presents an
extension to the MCL algorithm, which addresses its problems when localizing in
highly symmetrical environments; a situation where MCL is often unable to
correctly track equally probable poses for the robot. The problem arises from
the fact that sample sets in MCL often become impoverished, when samples are
generated according to their posterior likelihood. Our approach incorporates
the idea of clusters of samples and modifies the proposal distribution
considering the probability mass of those clusters. Experimental results are
presented that show that this new extension to the MCL algorithm successfully
localizes in symmetric environments where ordinary MCL often fails.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we demonstrate that the class of basic feasible functionals has
recursion theoretic properties which naturally generalize the corresponding
properties of the class of feasible functions. We also improve the Kapron -
Cook result on mashine representation of basic feasible functionals. Our proofs
are based on essential applications of logic. We introduce a weak fragment of
second order arithmetic with second order variables ranging over functions from
N into N which suitably characterizes basic feasible functionals, and show that
it is a useful tool for investigating the properties of basic feasible
functionals. In particular, we provide an example how one can extract feasible
&quot;programs&quot; from mathematical proofs which use non-feasible functionals (like
second order polynomials).

 <dc:description>  Let D be a database of N objects where each object has m fields. The objects
are given in m sorted lists (where the ith list is sorted according to the ith
field). Our goal is to find the top k objects according to a monotone
aggregation function t, while minimizing access to the lists. The problem
arises in several contexts. In particular Fagin (JCSS 1999) considered it for
the purpose of aggregating information in a multimedia database system.
  We are interested in instance optimality, i.e. that our algorithm will be as
good as any other (correct) algorithm on any instance. We provide and analyze
several instance optimal algorithms for the task, with various access costs and
models.

 <dc:description>  Data mining has traditionally focused on the task of drawing inferences from
large datasets. However, many scientific and engineering domains, such as fluid
dynamics and aircraft design, are characterized by scarce data, due to the
expense and complexity of associated experiments and simulations. In such
data-scarce domains, it is advantageous to focus the data collection effort on
only those regions deemed most important to support a particular data mining
objective. This paper describes a mechanism that interleaves bottom-up data
mining, to uncover multi-level structures in spatial data, with top-down
sampling, to clarify difficult decisions in the mining process. The mechanism
exploits relevant physical properties, such as continuity, correspondence, and
locality, in a unified framework. This leads to effective mining and sampling
decisions that are explainable in terms of domain knowledge and data
characteristics. This approach is demonstrated in two diverse applications --
mining pockets in spatial data, and qualitative determination of Jordan forms
of matrices.

 <dc:title>Economic-based Distributed Resource Management and Scheduling for Grid
  Computing</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Computational Grids, emerging as an infrastructure for next generation
computing, enable the sharing, selection, and aggregation of geographically
distributed resources for solving large-scale problems in science, engineering,
and commerce. As the resources in the Grid are heterogeneous and geographically
distributed with varying availability and a variety of usage and cost policies
for diverse users at different times and, priorities as well as goals that vary
with time. The management of resources and application scheduling in such a
large and distributed environment is a complex task. This thesis proposes a
distributed computational economy as an effective metaphor for the management
of resources and application scheduling. It proposes an architectural framework
that supports resource trading and quality of services based scheduling. It
enables the regulation of supply and demand for resources and provides an
incentive for resource owners for participating in the Grid and motives the
users to trade-off between the deadline, budget, and the required level of
quality of service. The thesis demonstrates the capability of economic-based
systems for peer-to-peer distributed computing by developing users'
quality-of-service requirements driven scheduling strategies and algorithms. It
demonstrates their effectiveness by performing scheduling experiments on the
World-Wide Grid for solving parameter sweep applications.

 <dc:description>  We present memory-based learning approaches to shallow parsing and apply
these to five tasks: base noun phrase identification, arbitrary base phrase
recognition, clause detection, noun phrase parsing and full parsing. We use
feature selection techniques and system combination methods for improving the
performance of the memory-based learner. Our approach is evaluated on standard
data sets and the results are compared with that of other systems. This reveals
that our approach works well for base phrase identification while its
application towards recognizing embedded structures leaves some room for
improvement.

 <dc:description>  On markets with receding prices, artificial noise traders may consider
alternatives to buy-and-hold. By simulating variations of the Parrondo
strategy, using real data from the Swedish stock market, we produce first
indications of a buy-low-sell-random Parrondo variation outperforming
buy-and-hold. Subject to our assumptions, buy-low-sell-random also outperforms
the traditional value and trend investor strategies. We measure the success of
the Parrondo variations not only through their performance compared to other
kinds of strategies, but also relative to varying levels of perfect

 <dc:description>  Learning joint probability distributions on n random variables requires
exponential sample size in the generic case. Here we consider the case that a
temporal (or causal) order of the variables is known and that the (unknown)
graph of causal dependencies has bounded in-degree Delta. Then the joint
measure is uniquely determined by the probabilities of all (2 Delta+1)-tuples.
Upper bounds on the sample size required for estimating their probabilities can
be given in terms of the VC-dimension of the set of corresponding cylinder
sets. The sample size grows less than linearly with n.

 <dc:description>  Correspondence identifies relationships among objects via similarities among
their components; it is ubiquitous in the analysis of spatial datasets,
including images, weather maps, and computational simulations. This paper
develops a novel multi-level mechanism for qualitative analysis of
correspondence. Operators leverage domain knowledge to establish
correspondence, evaluate implications for model selection, and leverage
identified weaknesses to focus additional data collection. The utility of the
mechanism is demonstrated in two applications from experimental algorithmics --
matrix spectral portrait analysis and graphical assessment of Jordan forms of
matrices. Results show that the mechanism efficiently samples computational
experiments and successfully uncovers high-level problem properties. It
overcomes noise and data sparsity by leveraging domain knowledge to detect
mutually reinforcing interpretations of spatial data.

 <dc:description>  Can a Web crawler efficiently locate an unknown relevant page? While this
question is receiving much empirical attention due to its considerable
commercial value in the search engine community
[Cho98,Chakrabarti99,Menczer00,Menczer01], theoretical efforts to bound the
performance of focused navigation have only exploited the link structure of the
Web graph, neglecting other features [Kleinberg01,Adamic01,Kim02]. Here I
investigate the connection between linkage and a content-induced topology of
Web pages, suggesting that efficient paths can be discovered by decentralized
navigation algorithms based on textual cues.

 <dc:description>  In order to control the process of data mining and focus on the things of
interest to us, many kinds of constraints have been added into the algorithms
of data mining. However, discovering the correlated alarms in the alarm
database needs deep domain constraints. Because the correlated alarms greatly
depend on the logical and physical architecture of networks. Thus we use the
network model as the constraints of algorithms, including Scope constraint,
Inter-correlated constraint and Intra-correlated constraint, in our proposed
algorithm called SMC (Search with Model-based Constraints). The experiments
show that the SMC algorithm with Inter-correlated or Intra-correlated
constraint is about two times faster than the algorithm with no constraints.

 <dc:description>  The deterministic network calculus offers an elegant framework for
determining delays and backlog in a network with deterministic service
guarantees to individual traffic flows. This paper addresses the problem of
extending the network calculus to a probabilistic framework with statistical
service guarantees. Here, the key difficulty relates to expressing, in a
statistical setting, an end-to-end (network) service curve as a concatenation
of per-node service curves. The notion of an effective service curve is
developed as a probabilistic bound on the service received by an individual
flow. It is shown that per-node effective service curves can be concatenated to
yield a network effective service curve.

 <dc:description>  Scientific codes are increasingly being used in compositional settings,
especially problem solving environments (PSEs). Typical compositional modeling
frameworks require significant buy-in, in the form of commitment to a
particular style of programming (e.g., distributed object components). While
this solution is feasible for newer generations of component-based scientific
codes, large legacy code bases present a veritable software engineering
nightmare. We introduce Weaves a novel framework that enables modeling,
composition, direct code execution, performance characterization, adaptation,
and control of unmodified high performance scientific codes. Weaves is an
efficient generalized framework for parallel compositional modeling that is a
proper superset of the threads and processes models of programming. In this
paper, our focus is on the transparent code execution interface enabled by
Weaves. We identify design constraints, their impact on implementation
alternatives, configuration scenarios, and present results from a prototype
implementation on Intel x86 architectures.

 <dc:description>  We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge
directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on
vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order
to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be PSPACE-complete by
a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety
of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex
configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic.
Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the ``Generalized
Rush Hour Logic'' developed by Flake and Baum.
  We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple
reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are PSPACE-hard. Our
main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block
puzzles are PSPACE-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes
(1x2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior
complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a
strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush Hour puzzles are
PSPACE-complete, of which we also give a simpler proof. Finally, we strengthen
the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is PSPACE-complete,
by showing that it is PSPACE-complete even if no barriers are allowed.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm that takes an unannotated corpus as its input, and
returns a ranked list of probable morphologically related pairs as its output.
The algorithm tries to discover morphologically related pairs by looking for
pairs that are both orthographically and semantically similar, where
orthographic similarity is measured in terms of minimum edit distance, and
semantic similarity is measured in terms of mutual information. The procedure
does not rely on a morpheme concatenation model, nor on distributional
properties of word substrings (such as affix frequency). Experiments with
German and English input give encouraging results, both in terms of precision
(proportion of good pairs found at various cutoff points of the ranked list),
and in terms of a qualitative analysis of the types of morphological patterns
discovered by the algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In evaluating an algorithm, worst-case analysis can be overly pessimistic.
Average-case analysis can be overly optimistic. An intermediate approach is to
show that an algorithm does well on a broad class of input distributions.
Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou recently analyzed the least-recently-used (LRU)
paging strategy in this manner, analyzing its performance on an input sequence
generated by a so-called diffuse adversary -- one that must choose each request
probabilitistically so that no page is chosen with probability more than some
fixed epsilon&gt;0. They showed that LRU achieves the optimal competitive ratio
(for deterministic on-line algorithms), but they didn't determine the actual
ratio.
  In this paper we estimate the optimal ratios within roughly a factor of two
for both deterministic strategies (e.g. least-recently-used and
first-in-first-out) and randomized strategies. Around the threshold epsilon ~
1/k (where k is the cache size), the optimal ratios are both Theta(ln k). Below
the threshold the ratios tend rapidly to O(1). Above the threshold the ratio is
unchanged for randomized strategies but tends rapidly to Theta(k) for
deterministic ones.
  We also give an alternate proof of the optimality of LRU.

length, and the average completion time. This short note gives improved bounds
on the existence of schedules that simultaneously optimize both criteria. In
particular, for any rho&gt; 0, there exists a schedule of makespan at most 1+rho
times the minimum, with average completion time at most (1-e)^rho times the
minimum. The proof uses an infininite-dimensional linear program to generalize
and strengthen a previous analysis by Cliff Stein and Joel Wein (1997).

 <dc:description>  Given the lack of word delimiters in written Japanese, word segmentation is
generally considered a crucial first step in processing Japanese texts. Typical
Japanese segmentation algorithms rely either on a lexicon and syntactic
analysis or on pre-segmented data; but these are labor-intensive, and the
lexico-syntactic techniques are vulnerable to the unknown word problem. In
contrast, we introduce a novel, more robust statistical method utilizing
unsegmented training data. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm yields
performance on long kanji sequences comparable to and sometimes surpassing that
of state-of-the-art morphological analyzers over a variety of error metrics.
The algorithm also outperforms another mostly-unsupervised statistical
algorithm previously proposed for Chinese.
  Additionally, we present a two-level annotation scheme for Japanese to
incorporate multiple segmentation granularities, and introduce two novel
evaluation metrics, both based on the notion of a compatible bracket, that can
account for multiple granularities simultaneously.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the notion of approximate data structures, which return
approximately correct answers to queries, but run faster than their exact
counterparts. The paper describes approximate variants of the van Emde Boas
data structure, which support the same dynamic operations as the standard van
Emde Boas data structure (min, max, successor, predecessor, and existence
queries, as well as insertion and deletion), except that answers to queries are
approximate. The variants support all operations in constant time provided the
performance guarantee is 1+1/polylog(n), and in O(loglogn) time provided the
performance guarantee is 1+1/polynomial(n), for n elements in the data
structure.
  Applications described include Prim's minimum-spanning-tree algorithm,
Dijkstra's single-source shortest paths algorithm, and an on-line variant of
Graham's convex hull algorithm. To obtain output which approximates the desired
output with the performance guarantee tending to 1, Prim's algorithm requires
only linear time, Dijkstra's algorithm requires O(mloglogn) time, and the
on-line variant of Graham's algorithm requires constant amortized time per
operation.

 <dc:description>  The MEG (minimum equivalent graph) problem is, given a directed graph, to
find a small subset of the edges that maintains all reachability relations
between nodes. The problem is NP-hard. This paper gives a proof that, for
graphs where each directed cycle has at most three edges, the MEG problem is
equivalent to maximum bipartite matching, and therefore solvable in polynomial
time. This leads to an improvement in the performance guarantee of the
previously best approximation algorithm for the general problem in
``Approximating the Minimum Equivalent Digraph'' (1995).

 <dc:description>  The data broadcast problem is to find a schedule for broadcasting a given set
of messages over multiple channels. The goal is to minimize the cost of the
broadcast plus the expected response time to clients who periodically and
probabilistically tune in to wait for particular messages.
  The problem models disseminating data to clients in asymmetric communication
environments, where there is a much larger capacity from the information source
to the clients than in the reverse direction. Examples include satellites,
cable TV, internet broadcast, and mobile phones. Such environments favor the
``push-based'' model where the server broadcasts (pushes) its information on
the communication medium and multiple clients simultaneously retrieve the
specific information of individual interest.
  This paper presents the first polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for
data broadcast with O(1) channels and when each message has arbitrary
probability, unit length and bounded cost. The best previous polynomial-time
approximation algorithm for this case has a performance ratio of 9/8.

 <dc:description>  We study algorithms for computing stable models of propositional logic
programs and derive estimates on their worst-case performance that are
asymptotically better than the trivial bound of O(m 2^n), where m is the size
of an input program and n is the number of its atoms. For instance, for
programs, whose clauses consist of at most two literals (counting the head) we
design an algorithm to compute stable models that works in time O(m\times
1.44225^n). We present similar results for several broader classes of programs,
as well.

 <dc:description>  We study fixpoints of operators on lattices. To this end we introduce the
notion of an approximation of an operator. We order approximations by means of
a precision ordering. We show that each lattice operator O has a unique most
precise or ultimate approximation. We demonstrate that fixpoints of this
ultimate approximation provide useful insights into fixpoints of the operator
O.
  We apply our theory to logic programming and introduce the ultimate
Kripke-Kleene, well-founded and stable semantics. We show that the ultimate
Kripke-Kleene and well-founded semantics are more precise then their standard
counterparts We argue that ultimate semantics for logic programming have
attractive epistemological properties and that, while in general they are
computationally more complex than the standard semantics, for many classes of
theories, their complexity is no worse.

 <dc:description>  Instabilities of robot motion are caused by topological reasons. In this
paper we find a relation between the topological properties of a configuration
space (the structure of its cohomology algebra) and the character of
instabilities, which are unavoidable in any motion planning algorithm. More
specifically, let $X$ denote the space of all admissible configurations of a
mechanical system. A {\it motion planner} is given by a splitting $X\times X =
F_1\cup F_2\cup ... \cup F_k$ (where $F_1, ..., F_k$ are pairwise disjoint
ENRs, see below) and by continuous maps $s_j: F_j \to PX,$ such that $E\circ
s_j =1_{F_j}$. Here $PX$ denotes the space of all continuous paths in $X$
(admissible motions of the system) and $E: PX\to X\times X$ denotes the map
which assigns to a path the pair of its initial -- end points. Any motion
planner determines an algorithm of motion planning for the system. In this
paper we apply methods of algebraic topology to study the minimal number of
sets $F_j$ in any motion planner in $X$. We also introduce a new notion of {\it
order of instability} of a motion planner; it describes the number of
essentially distinct motions which may occur as a result of small perturbations
of the input data. We find the minimal order of instability, which may have
motion planners on a given configuration space $X$. We study a number of
specific problems: motion of a rigid body in $\R^3$, a robot arm, motion in
$\R^3$ in the presence of obstacles, and others.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new approach to solving N-queen problems, which
involves a model of distributed autonomous agents with artificial life (ALife)
and a method of representing N-queen constraints in an agent environment. The
distributed agents locally interact with their living environment, i.e., a
chessboard, and execute their reactive behaviors by applying their behavioral
rules for randomized motion, least-conflict position searching, and cooperating
with other agents etc. The agent-based N-queen problem solving system evolves
through selection and contest according to the rule of Survival of the Fittest,
in which some agents will die or be eaten if their moving strategies are less
efficient than others. The experimental results have shown that this system is
capable of solving large-scale N-queen problems. This paper also provides a
model of ALife agents for solving general CSPs.

 <dc:description>  A typed model of strategic term rewriting is developed. The key innovation is
that generic traversal is covered. To this end, we define a typed rewriting
calculus S'_{gamma}. The calculus employs a many-sorted type system extended by
designated generic strategy types gamma. We consider two generic strategy
types, namely the types of type-preserving and type-unifying strategies.
S'_{gamma} offers traversal combinators to construct traversals or schemes
thereof from many-sorted and generic strategies. The traversal combinators
model different forms of one-step traversal, that is, they process the
immediate subterms of a given term without anticipating any scheme of recursion
into terms. To inhabit generic types, we need to add a fundamental combinator
to lift a many-sorted strategy $s$ to a generic type gamma. This step is called
strategy extension. The semantics of the corresponding combinator states that s
is only applied if the type of the term at hand fits, otherwise the extended
strategy fails. This approach dictates that the semantics of strategy
application must be type-dependent to a certain extent. Typed strategic term
rewriting with coverage of generic term traversal is a simple but expressive
model of generic programming. It has applications in program transformation and
program analysis.

 <dc:description>  This report aims to present my research updates on distance function wavelets
(DFW) based on the fundamental solutions and the general solutions of the
Helmholtz, modified Helmholtz, and convection-diffusion equations, which
include the isotropic Helmholtz-Fourier (HF) transform and series, the
Helmholtz-Laplace (HL) transform, and the anisotropic convection-diffusion
wavelets and ridgelets. The latter is set to handle discontinuous and track
data problems. The edge effect of the HF series is addressed. Alternative
existence conditions for the DFW transforms are proposed and discussed. To
simplify and streamline the expression of the HF and HL transforms, a new
dimension-dependent function notation is introduced. The HF series is also used
to evaluate the analytical solutions of linear diffusion problems of arbitrary
dimensionality and geometry. The weakness of this report is lacking of rigorous
mathematical analysis due to the author's limited mathematical knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Atkinson developed a strategy which splits solution of a PDE system into
homogeneous and particular solutions, where the former have to satisfy the
boundary and governing equation, while the latter only need to satisfy the
governing equation without concerning geometry. Since the particular solution
can be solved irrespective of boundary shape, we can use a readily available
fast Fourier or orthogonal polynomial technique O(NlogN) to evaluate it in a
regular box or sphere surrounding physical domain. The distinction of this
study is that we approximate homogeneous solution with nonsingular general
solution RBF as in the boundary knot method. The collocation method using
general solution RBF has very high accuracy and spectral convergent speed and
is a simple, truly meshfree approach for any complicated geometry. More
importantly, the use of nonsingular general solution avoids the controversial
artificial boundary in the method of fundamental solution due to the
singularity of fundamental solution.

 <dc:description>  This document gives an overview of a Grid testbed architecture proposal for
the NorduGrid project. The aim of the project is to establish an inter-Nordic
testbed facility for implementation of wide area computing and data handling.
The architecture is supposed to define a Grid system suitable for solving data
intensive problems at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. We present the various
architecture components needed for such a system. After that we go on to give a
description of the dynamics by showing the task flow.

 <dc:description>  Information personalization is fertile ground for application of AI
techniques. In this article I relate personalization to the ability to capture
partial information in an information-seeking interaction. The specific focus
is on personalizing interactions at web sites. Using ideas from partial
evaluation and explanation-based generalization, I present a modeling
methodology for reasoning about personalization. This approach helps identify
seven tiers of `personable traits' in web sites.

 <dc:title>Bootstrapping Structure into Language: Alignment-Based Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This thesis introduces a new unsupervised learning framework, called
Alignment-Based Learning, which is based on the alignment of sentences and
Harris's (1951) notion of substitutability. Instances of the framework can be
applied to an untagged, unstructured corpus of natural language sentences,
resulting in a labelled, bracketed version of that corpus.
  Firstly, the framework aligns all sentences in the corpus in pairs, resulting
in a partition of the sentences consisting of parts of the sentences that are
equal in both sentences and parts that are unequal. Unequal parts of sentences
can be seen as being substitutable for each other, since substituting one
unequal part for the other results in another valid sentence. The unequal parts
of the sentences are thus considered to be possible (possibly overlapping)
constituents, called hypotheses.
  Secondly, the selection learning phase considers all hypotheses found by the
alignment learning phase and selects the best of these. The hypotheses are
selected based on the order in which they were found, or based on a
probabilistic function.
  The framework can be extended with a grammar extraction phase. This extended
framework is called parseABL. Instead of returning a structured version of the
unstructured input corpus, like the ABL system, this system also returns a
stochastic context-free or tree substitution grammar.
  Different instances of the framework have been tested on the English ATIS
corpus, the Dutch OVIS corpus and the Wall Street Journal corpus. One of the
interesting results, apart from the encouraging numerical results, is that all
instances can (and do) learn recursive structures.

 <dc:description>  Accounts of semantic phenomena often involve extending types of meanings and
revising composition rules at the same time. The concept of monads allows many
such accounts -- for intensionality, variable binding, quantification and focus
-- to be stated uniformly and compositionally.

 <dc:title>A variable-free dynamic semantics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shan, Chung-chieh</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  I propose a variable-free treatment of dynamic semantics. By &quot;dynamic
semantics&quot; I mean analyses of donkey sentences (&quot;Every farmer who owns a donkey
beats it&quot;) and other binding and anaphora phenomena in natural language where
meanings of constituents are updates to information states, for instance as
proposed by Groenendijk and Stokhof. By &quot;variable-free&quot; I mean denotational
semantics in which functional combinators replace variable indices and
assignment functions, for instance as advocated by Jacobson.
  The new theory presented here achieves a compositional treatment of dynamic
anaphora that does not involve assignment functions, and separates the
combinatorics of variable-free semantics from the particular linguistic
phenomena it treats. Integrating variable-free semantics and dynamic semantics
gives rise to interactions that make new empirical predictions, for example
&quot;donkey weak crossover&quot; effects.

 <dc:description>  Pattern-matching-based document-compression systems (e.g. for faxing) rely on
finding a small set of patterns that can be used to represent all of the ink in
the document. Finding an optimal set of patterns is NP-hard; previous
compression schemes have resorted to heuristics. This paper describes an
extension of the cross-entropy approach, used previously for measuring pattern
similarity, to this problem. This approach reduces the problem to a k-medians
problem, for which the paper gives a new algorithm with a provably good
performance guarantee. In comparison to previous heuristics (First Fit, with
and without generalized Lloyd's/k-means postprocessing steps), the new
algorithm generates a better codebook, resulting in an overall improvement in
compression performance of almost 17%.

 <dc:description>  Given matrices A and B and vectors a, b, c and d, all with non-negative
entries, we consider the problem of computing min {c.x: x in Z^n_+, Ax &gt; a, Bx
&lt; b, x &lt; d}. We give a bicriteria-approximation algorithm that, given epsilon
in (0, 1], finds a solution of cost O(ln(m)/epsilon^2) times optimal, meeting
the covering constraints (Ax &gt; a) and multiplicity constraints (x &lt; d), and
satisfying Bx &lt; (1 + epsilon)b + beta, where beta is the vector of row sums
beta_i = sum_j B_ij. Here m denotes the number of rows of A.
  This gives an O(ln m)-approximation algorithm for CIP -- minimum-cost
covering integer programs with multiplicity constraints, i.e., the special case
when there are no packing constraints Bx &lt; b. The previous best approximation
ratio has been O(ln(max_j sum_i A_ij)) since 1982. CIP contains the set cover
problem as a special case, so O(ln m)-approximation is the best possible unless
P=NP.

 <dc:description>  This report presents notes from the first eight lectures of the class Many
Models of Complexity taught by Laszlo Lovasz at Princeton University in the
fall of 1990. The topic is evasiveness of graph properties: given a graph
property, how many edges of the graph an algorithm must check in the worst case
before it knows whether the property holds.

 <dc:description>  Congestion control in the current Internet is accomplished mainly by TCP/IP.
To understand the macroscopic network behavior that results from TCP/IP and
similar end-to-end protocols, one main analytic technique is to show that the
the protocol maximizes some global objective function of the network traffic.
Here we analyze a particular end-to-end, MIMD (multiplicative-increase,
multiplicative-decrease) protocol. We show that if all users of the network use
the protocol, and all connections last for at least logarithmically many
rounds, then the total weighted throughput (value of all packets received) is
near the maximum possible. Our analysis includes round-trip-times, and (in
contrast to most previous analyses) gives explicit convergence rates, allows
connections to start and stop, and allows capacities to change.

 <dc:description>  In the on-line file-caching problem problem, the input is a sequence of
requests for files, given on-line (one at a time). Each file has a non-negative
size and a non-negative retrieval cost. The problem is to decide which files to
keep in a fixed-size cache so as to minimize the sum of the retrieval costs for
files that are not in the cache when requested. The problem arises in web
caching by browsers and by proxies. This paper describes a natural
generalization of LRU called Landlord and gives an analysis showing that it has
an optimal performance guarantee (among deterministic on-line algorithms).
  The paper also gives an analysis of the algorithm in a so-called ``loosely''
competitive model, showing that on a ``typical'' cache size, either the
performance guarantee is O(1) or the total retrieval cost is insignificant.

 <dc:description>  The goal of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey is ``to map in detail one-quarter of
the entire sky, determining the positions and absolute brightnesses of more
than 100 million celestial objects''. The survey will be performed by taking
``snapshots'' through a large telescope. Each snapshot can capture up to 600
objects from a small circle of the sky. This paper describes the design and
implementation of the algorithm that is being used to determine the snapshots
so as to minimize their number. The problem is NP-hard in general; the
algorithm described is a heuristic, based on Lagriangian-relaxation and
min-cost network flow. It gets within 5-15% of a naive lower bound, whereas
using a ``uniform'' cover only gets within 25-35%.

 <dc:description>  Von Neumann's Min-Max Theorem guarantees that each player of a zero-sum
matrix game has an optimal mixed strategy. This paper gives an elementary proof
that each player has a near-optimal mixed strategy that chooses uniformly at
random from a multiset of pure strategies of size logarithmic in the number of
pure strategies available to the opponent.
  For exponentially large games, for which even representing an optimal mixed
strategy can require exponential space, it follows that there are near-optimal,
linear-size strategies. These strategies are easy to play and serve as small
witnesses to the approximate value of the game.
  As a corollary, it follows that every language has small ``hard'' multisets
of inputs certifying that small circuits can't decide the language. For
example, if SAT does not have polynomial-size circuits, then, for each n and c,
there is a set of n^(O(c)) Boolean formulae of size n such that no circuit of
size n^c (or algorithm running in time n^c) classifies more than two-thirds of
the formulae succesfully.

 <dc:description>  Randomized rounding is a standard method, based on the probabilistic method,
for designing combinatorial approximation algorithms. In Raghavan's seminal
paper introducing the method (1988), he writes: &quot;The time taken to solve the
linear program relaxations of the integer programs dominates the net running
time theoretically (and, most likely, in practice as well).&quot;
  This paper explores how this bottleneck can be avoided for randomized
rounding algorithms for packing and covering problems (linear programs, or
mixed integer linear programs, having no negative coefficients). The resulting
algorithms are greedy algorithms, and are faster and simpler to implement than
standard randomized-rounding algorithms.
  This approach can also be used to understand Lagrangian-relaxation algorithms
for packing/covering linear programs: such algorithms can be viewed as as
(derandomized) randomized-rounding schemes.

 <dc:description>  The paging problem is that of deciding which pages to keep in a memory of k
pages in order to minimize the number of page faults. This paper introduces the
marking algorithm, a simple randomized on-line algorithm for the paging
problem, and gives a proof that its performance guarantee (competitive ratio)
is O(log k). In contrast, no deterministic on-line algorithm can have a
performance guarantee better than k.

 <dc:title>Sequential and Parallel Algorithms for Mixed Packing and Covering</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Mixed packing and covering problems are problems that can be formulated as
linear programs using only non-negative coefficients. Examples include
multicommodity network flow, the Held-Karp lower bound on TSP, fractional
relaxations of set cover, bin-packing, knapsack, scheduling problems,
minimum-weight triangulation, etc. This paper gives approximation algorithms
for the general class of problems. The sequential algorithm is a simple greedy
algorithm that can be implemented to find an epsilon-approximate solution in
O(epsilon^-2 log m) linear-time iterations. The parallel algorithm does
comparable work but finishes in polylogarithmic time.
  The results generalize previous work on pure packing and covering (the
special case when the constraints are all &quot;less-than&quot; or all &quot;greater-than&quot;) by
Michael Luby and Noam Nisan (1993) and Naveen Garg and Jochen Konemann (1998).

 <dc:description>  The MEG (minimum equivalent graph) problem is, given a directed graph, to
find a small subset of the edges that maintains all reachability relations
between nodes. The problem is NP-hard. This paper gives an approximation
algorithm with performance guarantee of pi^2/6 ~ 1.64. The algorithm and its
analysis are based on the simple idea of contracting long cycles. (This result
is strengthened slightly in ``On strongly connected digraphs with bounded cycle
length'' (1996).) The analysis applies directly to 2-Exchange, a simple ``local
improvement'' algorithm, showing that its performance guarantee is 1.75.

 <dc:description>  The parametric shortest path problem is to find the shortest paths in graph
where the edge costs are of the form w_ij+lambda where each w_ij is constant
and lambda is a parameter that varies. The problem is to find shortest path
trees for every possible value of lambda.
  The minimum-balance problem is to find a ``weighting'' of the vertices so
that adjusting the edge costs by the vertex weights yields a graph in which,
for every cut, the minimum weight of any edge crossing the cut in one direction
equals the minimum weight of any edge crossing the cut in the other direction.
  The paper presents fast algorithms for both problems. The algorithms run in
O(nm+n^2 log n) time. The paper also describes empirical studies of the
algorithms on random graphs, suggesting that the expected time for finding a
minimum-mean cycle (an important special case of both problems) is O(n log(n) +
m).

such that there is a directed path from x to y, and (ii) how to orient the

 <dc:description>  The degree-d spanning tree problem asks for a minimum-weight spanning tree in
which the degree of each vertex is at most d. When d=2 the problem is TSP, and
in this case, the well-known Christofides algorithm provides a
1.5-approximation algorithm (assuming the edge weights satisfy the triangle
inequality).
  In 1984, Christos Papadimitriou and Umesh Vazirani posed the challenge of
finding an algorithm with performance guarantee less than 2 for Euclidean
graphs (points in R^n) and d &gt; 2. This paper gives the first answer to that
challenge, presenting an algorithm to compute a degree-3 spanning tree of cost
at most 5/3 times the MST. For points in the plane, the ratio improves to 3/2
and the algorithm can also find a degree-4 spanning tree of cost at most 5/4
times the MST.

 <dc:description>  This paper has two results. The first is based on the surprising observation
that the well-known ``least-recently-used'' paging algorithm and the
``balance'' algorithm for weighted caching are linear-programming primal-dual
algorithms. This observation leads to a strategy (called ``Greedy-Dual'') that
generalizes them both and has an optimal performance guarantee for weighted
caching.
  For the second result, the paper presents empirical studies of paging
algorithms, documenting that in practice, on ``typical'' cache sizes and
sequences, the performance of paging strategies are much better than their
worst-case analyses in the standard model suggest. The paper then presents
theoretical results that support and explain this. For example: on any input
sequence, with almost all cache sizes, either the performance guarantee of
least-recently-used is O(log k) or the fault rate (in an absolute sense) is
insignificant.
  Both of these results are strengthened and generalized in``On-line File
Caching'' (1998).

 <dc:description>  This paper give a simple linear-time algorithm that, given a weighted
digraph, finds a spanning tree that simultaneously approximates a shortest-path
tree and a minimum spanning tree. The algorithm provides a continuous
trade-off: given the two trees and epsilon &gt; 0, the algorithm returns a
spanning tree in which the distance between any vertex and the root of the
shortest-path tree is at most 1+epsilon times the shortest-path distance, and
yet the total weight of the tree is at most 1+2/epsilon times the weight of a
minimum spanning tree. This is the best tradeoff possible. The paper also
describes a fast parallel implementation.

 <dc:title>On the Number of Iterations for Dantzig-Wolfe Optimization and

 <dc:description>  We give a lower bound on the iteration complexity of a natural class of
Lagrangean-relaxation algorithms for approximately solving packing/covering
linear programs. We show that, given an input with $m$ random 0/1-constraints
on $n$ variables, with high probability, any such algorithm requires
$\Omega(\rho \log(m)/\epsilon^2)$ iterations to compute a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution, where $\rho$ is the width of the input.
The bound is tight for a range of the parameters $(m,n,\rho,\epsilon)$.
  The algorithms in the class include Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, Benders'
decomposition, Lagrangean relaxation as developed by Held and Karp [1971] for
lower-bounding TSP, and many others (e.g. by Plotkin, Shmoys, and Tardos [1988]
and Grigoriadis and Khachiyan [1996]). To prove the bound, we use a discrepancy
argument to show an analogous lower bound on the support size of
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate mixed strategies for random two-player zero-sum
0/1-matrix games.

 <dc:description>  The paper gives approximation algorithms for the k-medians and
facility-location problems (both NP-hard). For k-medians, the algorithm returns
a solution using at most ln(n+n/epsilon)k medians and having cost at most
(1+epsilon) times the cost of the best solution that uses at most k medians.
Here epsilon &gt; 0 is an input to the algorithm. In comparison, the best previous
algorithm (Jyh-Han Lin and Jeff Vitter, 1992) had a (1+1/epsilon)ln(n) term
instead of the ln(n+n/epsilon) term in the performance guarantee. For facility
location, the algorithm returns a solution of cost at most d+ln(n) k, provided
there exists a solution of cost d+k where d is the assignment cost and k is the
facility cost. In comparison, the best previous algorithm (Dorit Hochbaum,
1982) returned a solution of cost at most ln(n)(d+k). For both problems, the
algorithms currently provide the best performance guarantee known for the
general (non-metric) problems.
  The paper also introduces a new probabilistic bound (called &quot;Chernoff-Wald
bound&quot;) for bounding the expectation of the maximum of a collection of sums of
random variables, when each sum contains a random number of terms. The bound is
used to analyze the randomized rounding scheme that underlies the algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The problem considered is the following. Given a graph with edge weights
satisfying the triangle inequality, and a degree bound for each vertex, compute
a low-weight spanning tree such that the degree of each vertex is at most its
specified bound. The problem is NP-hard (it generalizes Traveling Salesman
(TSP)). This paper describes a network-flow heuristic for modifying a given
tree T to meet the constraints. Choosing T to be a minimum spanning tree (MST)
yields approximation algorithms with performance guarantee less than 2 for the
problem on geometric graphs with L_p-norms. The paper also describes a
Euclidean graph whose minimum TSP costs twice the MST, disproving a conjecture
made in ``Low-Degree Spanning Trees of Small Weight'' (1996).

 <dc:description>  The multiway-cut problem is, given a weighted graph and k &gt;= 2 terminal
nodes, to find a minimum-weight set of edges whose removal separates all the
terminals. The problem is NP-hard, and even NP-hard to approximate within
1+delta for some small delta &gt; 0.
  Calinescu, Karloff, and Rabani (1998) gave an algorithm with performance
guarantee 3/2-1/k, based on a geometric relaxation of the problem. In this
paper, we give improved randomized rounding schemes for their relaxation,
yielding a 12/11-approximation algorithm for k=3 and a 1.3438-approximation
algorithm in general.
  Our approach hinges on the observation that the problem of designing a
randomized rounding scheme for a geometric relaxation is itself a linear
programming problem. The paper explores computational solutions to this
problem, and gives a proof that for a general class of geometric relaxations,
there are always randomized rounding schemes that match the integrality gap.

 <dc:description>  A three-tiered specification approach is developed to formally specify
collections of collaborating objects, say micro-architectures. (i) The
structural properties to be maintained in the collaboration are specified in
the lowest tier. (ii) The behaviour of the object methods in the classes is
specified in the middle tier. (iii) The interaction of the objects in the
micro-architecture is specified in the third tier. The specification approach
is based on Larch and accompanying notations and tools. The approach enables
the unambiguous and complete specification of reusable collections of
collaborating objects. The layered, formal approach is compared to other
approaches including the mainstream UML approach.

 <dc:description>  In addition to providing information to individual visitors, electronic
guidebooks have the potential to facilitate social interaction between visitors
and their companions. However, many systems impede visitor interaction. By
contrast, our electronic guidebook, Sotto Voce, has social interaction as a
primary design goal. The system enables visitors to share audio information -
specifically, they can hear each other's guidebook activity using a
technologically mediated audio eavesdropping mechanism. We conducted a study of
visitors using Sotto Voce while touring a historic house. The results indicate
that visitors are able to use the system effectively, both as a conversational
resource and as an information appliance. More surprisingly, our results
suggest that the technologically mediated audio often cohered the visitors'
conversation and activity to a far greater degree than audio delivered through
the open air.

 <dc:description>  We describe an electronic guidebook, Sotto Voce, that enables visitors to
share audio information by eavesdropping on each other's guidebook activity. We
have conducted three studies of visitors using electronic guidebooks in a
historic house: one study with open air audio played through speakers and two
studies with eavesdropped audio. An analysis of visitor interaction in these
studies suggests that eavesdropped audio provides more social and interactive
learning resources than open air audio played through speakers.

 <dc:description>  We present a case study of an iterative design process that includes a
conversation analyst. We discuss potential benefits of conversation analysis
for design, and we describe our strategies for integrating the conversation
analyst in the design process. Since the analyst on our team had no previous
exposure to design or engineering, and none of the other members of our team
had any experience with conversation analysis, we needed to build a foundation
for our interaction. One of our key strategies was to pair the conversation
analyst with a designer in a highly interactive collaboration. Our tactics have
been effective on our project, leading to valuable results that we believe we
could not have obtained using another method. We hope that this paper can serve
as a practical guide to those interested in establishing a productive and
efficient working relationship between a conversation analyst and the other
members of a design team.

 <dc:description>  We show that Closest Substring, one of the most important problems in the
field of biological sequence analysis, is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the
number k of input strings (and remains so, even over a binary alphabet). This
problem is therefore unlikely to be solvable in time O(f(k)\cdot n^{c}) for any
function f of k and constant c independent of k. The problem can therefore be
expected to be intractable, in any practical sense, for k&gt;=3. Our result
supports the intuition that Closest Substring is computationally much harder
than the special case of Closest String, although both problems are
NP-complete. We also prove W[1]-hardness for other parameterizations in the
case of unbounded alphabet size. Our W[1]-hardness result for Closest Substring
generalizes to Consensus Patterns, a problem of similar significance in
computational biology.

 <dc:description>  We present two methods for unsupervised segmentation of words into
morpheme-like units. The model utilized is especially suited for languages with
a rich morphology, such as Finnish. The first method is based on the Minimum
Description Length (MDL) principle and works online. In the second method,
Maximum Likelihood (ML) optimization is used. The quality of the segmentations
is measured using an evaluation method that compares the segmentations produced
to an existing morphological analysis. Experiments on both Finnish and English
corpora show that the presented methods perform well compared to a current
state-of-the-art system.

 <dc:description>  Recommender systems attempt to reduce information overload and retain
customers by selecting a subset of items from a universal set based on user
preferences. While research in recommender systems grew out of information
retrieval and filtering, the topic has steadily advanced into a legitimate and
challenging research area of its own. Recommender systems have traditionally
been studied from a content-based filtering vs. collaborative design
perspective. Recommendations, however, are not delivered within a vacuum, but
rather cast within an informal community of users and social context.
Therefore, ultimately all recommender systems make connections among people and
thus should be surveyed from such a perspective. This viewpoint is
under-emphasized in the recommender systems literature. We therefore take a
connection-oriented viewpoint toward recommender systems research. We posit
that recommendation has an inherently social element and is ultimately intended
to connect people either directly as a result of explicit user modeling or
indirectly through the discovery of relationships implicit in extant data.
Thus, recommender systems are characterized by how they model users to bring
people together: explicitly or implicitly. Finally, user modeling and the
connection-centric viewpoint raise broadening and social issues--such as
evaluation, targeting, and privacy and trust--which we also briefly address.

  completely to recommender system research rather than recommendation and
  personalization and subsequently changed the title to &quot;A Connection-Centric

 <dc:title>Optimizing Queries Using a Meta-level Database</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>H.2.1, H.2.3, D.1.5, D.3.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Graph simulation (using graph schemata or data guides) has been successfully
proposed as a technique for adding structure to semistructured data. Design
patterns for description (such as meta-classes and homomorphisms between schema
layers), which are prominent in the object-oriented programming community,
constitute a generalization of this graph simulation approach.
  In this paper, we show description applicable to a wide range of data models
that have some notion of object (-identity), and propose to turn it into a data
model primitive much like, say, inheritance. We argue that such an extension
fills a practical need in contemporary data management. Then, we present
algebraic techniques for query optimization (using the notions of described and
description queries). Finally, in the semistructured setting, we discuss the
pruning of regular path queries (with nested conditions) using description
meta-data. In this context, our notion of meta-data extends graph schemata and
data guides by meta-level values, allowing to boost query performance and to
reduce the redundancy of data.

 <dc:description>  Over a quarter of century after the invention of genetic algorithms and
miriads of their modifications, as well as successful implementations, we are
still lacking many essential details of thorough analysis of it's inner
working. One of such fundamental questions is: how many generations do we need
to solve the optimization problem? This paper tries to answer this question,
albeit in a fuzzy way, making use of the double helix concept. As a byproduct
we gain better understanding of the ways, in which the genetic algorithm may be
fine tuned.

 <dc:title>Minimizing Cache Misses in Scientific Computing Using Isoperimetric

 <dc:description>  A number of known techniques for improving cache performance in scientific
computations involve the reordering of the iteration space. Some of these
reorderings can be considered coverings of the iteration space with sets having
small surface-to-volume ratios. Use of such sets may reduce the number of cache
misses in computations of local operators having the iteration space as their
domain. First, we derive lower bounds on cache misses that any algorithm must
suffer while computing a local operator on a grid. Then, we explore coverings
of iteration spaces of structured and unstructured discretization grid
operators which allow us to approach these lower bounds. For structured grids
we introduce a covering by successive minima tiles based on the interference
lattice of the grid. We show that the covering has a small surface-to-volume
ratio and present a computer experiment showing actual reduction of the cache
misses achieved by using these tiles. For planar unstructured grids we show
existence of a covering which reduces the number of cache misses to the level
of that of structured grids. Next, we introduce a class of multidimensional
grids, called starry grids in this paper. These grids represent an abstraction
of unstructured grids used in, for example, molecular simulations and the
solution of partial differential equations. We show that starry grids can be
covered by sets having a low surface-to-volume ratio and, hence have the same
cache efficiency as structured grids. Finally, we present a triangulation of a
three-dimensional cube that has the property that any local operator on the
corresponding grid must incur a significantly larger number of cache misses
than a similar operator on a structured grid of the same size.

 <dc:description>  Report II is concerned with the extended results of distance function
wavelets (DFW). The fractional DFW transforms are first addressed relating to
the fractal geometry and fractional derivative, and then, the discrete
Helmholtz-Fourier transform is briefly presented. The Green second identity may
be an alternative devise in developing the theoretical framework of the DFW
transform and series. The kernel solutions of the Winkler plate equation and
the Burger's equation are used to create the DFW transforms and series. Most
interestingly, it is found that the translation invariant monomial solutions of
the high-order Laplace equations can be used to make very simple harmonic
polynomial DFW series. In most cases of this study, solid mathematical analysis
is missing and results are obtained intuitively in the conjecture status.

 <dc:description>  An important component of any generation system is the mapping dictionary, a
lexicon of elementary semantic expressions and corresponding natural language
realizations. Typically, labor-intensive knowledge-based methods are used to
construct the dictionary. We instead propose to acquire it automatically via a
novel multiple-pass algorithm employing multiple-sequence alignment, a
technique commonly used in bioinformatics. Crucially, our method leverages
latent information contained in multi-parallel corpora -- datasets that supply
several verbalizations of the corresponding semantics rather than just one.
  We used our techniques to generate natural language versions of
computer-generated mathematical proofs, with good results on both a
per-component and overall-output basis. For example, in evaluations involving a
dozen human judges, our system produced output whose readability and
faithfulness to the semantic input rivaled that of a traditional generation
system.

 <dc:title>Effectiveness of Preference Elicitation in Combinatorial Auctions</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Combinatorial auctions where agents can bid on bundles of items are desirable
because they allow the agents to express complementarity and substitutability
between the items. However, expressing one's preferences can require bidding on
all bundles. Selective incremental preference elicitation by the auctioneer was
recently proposed to address this problem (Conen &amp; Sandholm 2001), but the idea
was not evaluated. In this paper we show, experimentally and theoretically,
that automated elicitation provides a drastic benefit. In all of the
elicitation schemes under study, as the number of items for sale increases, the
amount of information elicited is a vanishing fraction of the information
collected in traditional ``direct revelation mechanisms'' where bidders reveal
all their valuation information. Most of the elicitation schemes also maintain
the benefit as the number of agents increases. We develop more effective
elicitation policies for existing query types. We also present a new query type
that takes the incremental nature of elicitation to a new level by allowing
agents to give approximate answers that are refined only on an as-needed basis.
In the process, we present methods for evaluating different types of
elicitation policies.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a comparative evaluation among the systems that
participated in the Spanish and English lexical sample tasks of Senseval-2. The
focus is on pairwise comparisons among systems to assess the degree to which
they agree, and on measuring the difficulty of the test instances included in
these tasks.

 <dc:title>Machine Learning with Lexical Features: The Duluth Approach to

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the sixteen Duluth entries in the Senseval-2 comparative
exercise among word sense disambiguation systems. There were eight pairs of
Duluth systems entered in the Spanish and English lexical sample tasks. These
are all based on standard machine learning algorithms that induce classifiers
from sense-tagged training text where the context in which ambiguous words
occur are represented by simple lexical features. These are highly portable,
robust methods that can serve as a foundation for more tailored approaches.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of classifying documents not by topic, but by overall
sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using
movie reviews as data, we find that standard machine learning techniques
definitively outperform human-produced baselines. However, the three machine
learning methods we employed (Naive Bayes, maximum entropy classification, and
support vector machines) do not perform as well on sentiment classification as
on traditional topic-based categorization. We conclude by examining factors
that make the sentiment classification problem more challenging.

based on the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) and emphasizes the need for a
common infrastructure to support them. Inspired by HTTP proxy, cache, gateway
and web service concepts, a design for a scalable and reliable infrastructure
that aims at satisfying these requirements is presented. Moreover it is shown
how various applications can exploit the services included in the proposed
infrastructure. The paper concludes by discussing the current status of several

 <dc:description>  The first morphological learner based upon the theory of Whole Word
Morphology Ford et al. (1997) is outlined, and preliminary evaluation results
are presented. The program, Whole Word Morphologizer, takes a POS-tagged
lexicon as input, induces morphological relationships without attempting to
discover or identify morphemes, and is then able to generate new words beyond
the learning sample. The accuracy (precision) of the generated new words is as
high as 80% using the pure Whole Word theory, and 92% after a post-hoc
adjustment is added to the routine.

 <dc:description>  Preference elicitation is a central problem in AI, and has received
significant attention in single-agent settings. It is also a key problem in
multiagent systems, but has received little attention here so far. In this
setting, the agents may have different preferences that often must be
aggregated using voting. This leads to interesting issues because what, if any,
information should be elicited from an agent depends on what other agents have
revealed about their preferences so far.
  In this paper we study effective elicitation, and its impediments, for the
most common voting protocols. It turns out that in the Single Transferable Vote
protocol, even knowing when to terminate elicitation is mathcal NP-complete,
while this is easy for all the other protocols under study. Even for these
protocols, determining how to elicit effectively is NP-complete, even with
perfect suspicions about how the agents will vote. The exception is the
Plurality protocol where such effective elicitation is easy.
  We also show that elicitation introduces additional opportunities for
strategic manipulation by the voters. We demonstrate how to curtail the space
of elicitation schemes so that no such additional strategic issues arise.

 <dc:description>  Noncooperative game theory provides a normative framework for analyzing
strategic interactions. However, for the toolbox to be operational, the
solutions it defines will have to be computed. In this paper, we provide a
single reduction that 1) demonstrates NP-hardness of determining whether Nash
equilibria with certain natural properties exist, and 2) demonstrates the
#P-hardness of counting Nash equilibria (or connected sets of Nash equilibria).
We also show that 3) determining whether a pure-strategy Bayes-Nash equilibrium
exists is NP-hard, and that 4) determining whether a pure-strategy Nash
equilibrium exists in a stochastic (Markov) game is PSPACE-hard even if the
game is invisible (this remains NP-hard if the game is finite). All of our
hardness results hold even if there are only two players and the game is
symmetric.

 <dc:description>  The aggregation of conflicting preferences is a central problem in multiagent
systems. The key difficulty is that the agents may report their preferences
insincerely. Mechanism design is the art of designing the rules of the game so
that the agents are motivated to report their preferences truthfully and a
(socially) desirable outcome is chosen. We propose an approach where a
mechanism is automatically created for the preference aggregation setting at
hand. This has several advantages, but the downside is that the mechanism
design optimization problem needs to be solved anew each time. Focusing on
settings where side payments are not possible, we show that the mechanism
design problem is NP-complete for deterministic mechanisms. This holds both for
dominant-strategy implementation and for Bayes-Nash implementation. We then
show that if we allow randomized mechanisms, the mechanism design problem
becomes tractable. In other words, the coordinator can tackle the computational
complexity introduced by its uncertainty about the agents' preferences by
making the agents face additional uncertainty. This comes at no loss, and in
some cases at a gain, in the (social) objective.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Manipulating Elections with Few Candidates</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In multiagent settings where the agents have different preferences,
preference aggregation is a central issue. Voting is a general method for
preference aggregation, but seminal results have shown that all general voting
protocols are manipulable. One could try to avoid manipulation by using voting
protocols where determining a beneficial manipulation is hard. Especially among
computational agents, it is reasonable to measure this hardness by
computational complexity. Some earlier work has been done in this area, but it
was assumed that the number of voters and candidates is unbounded. We derive
hardness results for practical multiagent settings where the number of
candidates is small but the number of voters can be large. We show that with
complete information about the others' votes, individual manipulation is easy,
and coalitional manipulation is easy with unweighted voters. However,
constructive coalitional manipulation with weighted voters is intractable for
all of the voting protocols under study, except for the nonrandomized Cup.
Destructive manipulation tends to be easier. Randomizing over instantiations of
the protocols (such as schedules of the Cup protocol) can be used to make
manipulation hard. Finally, we show that under weak assumptions, if weighted
coalitional manipulation with complete information about the others' votes is
hard in some voting protocol, then individual and unweighted manipulation is
hard when there is uncertainty about the others' votes.

 <dc:description>  The traditional multi-commodity flow problem assumes a given flow network in
which multiple commodities are to be maximally routed in response to given
demands. This paper considers the multi-commodity flow network-design problem:
given a set of multi-commodity flow demands, find a network subject to certain
constraints such that the commodities can be maximally routed.
  This paper focuses on the case when the network is required to be a tree. The
main result is an approximation algorithm for the case when the tree is
required to be of constant degree. The algorithm reduces the problem to the
minimum-weight balanced-separator problem; the performance guarantee of the
algorithm is within a factor of 4 of the performance guarantee of the
balanced-separator procedure. If Leighton and Rao's balanced-separator
procedure is used, the performance guarantee is O(log n). This improves the
O(log^2 n) approximation factor that is trivial to obtain by a direct
application of the balanced-separator method.

 <dc:description>  The likelihood of an automated reasoning program being of substantial
assistance for a wide spectrum of applications rests with the nature of the
options and parameters it offers on which to base needed strategies and
methodologies. This article focuses on such a spectrum, featuring W. McCune's
program OTTER, discussing widely varied successes in answering open questions,
and touching on some of the strategies and methodologies that played a key
role. The applications include finding a first proof, discovering single
axioms, locating improved axiom systems, and simplifying existing proofs. The
last application is directly pertinent to the recently found (by R. Thiele)
Hilbert's twenty-fourth problem--which is extremely amenable to attack with the
appropriate automated reasoning program--a problem concerned with proof
simplification. The methodologies include those for seeking shorter proofs and
for finding proofs that avoid unwanted lemmas or classes of term, a specific
option for seeking proofs with smaller equational or formula complexity, and a
different option to address the variable richness of a proof. The type of proof
one obtains with the use of OTTER is Hilbert-style axiomatic, including details
that permit one sometimes to gain new insights. We include questions still open
and challenges that merit consideration.

 <dc:description>  Cumulative logics are studied in an abstract setting, i.e., without
connectives, very much in the spirit of Makinson's early work. A powerful
representation theorem characterizes those logics by choice functions that
satisfy a weakening of Sen's property alpha, in the spirit of the author's
&quot;Nonmonotonic Logics and Semantics&quot; (JLC). The representation results obtained
are surprisingly smooth: in the completeness part the choice function may be
defined on any set of worlds, not only definable sets and no
definability-preservation property is required in the soundness part. For
abstract cumulative logics, proper conjunction and negation may be defined.
Contrary to the situation studied in &quot;Nonmonotonic Logics and Semantics&quot; no
proper disjunction seems to be definable in general. The cumulative relations
of KLM that satisfy some weakening of the consistency preservation property all
define cumulative logics with a proper negation. Quantum Logics, as defined by
Engesser and Gabbay are such cumulative logics but the negation defined by
orthogonal complement does not provide a proper negation.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is to introduce the idea of the Semantic Web to the
Complexity community and set a basic ground for a project resulting in creation
of Internet-based semantic network of Complexity-related information providers.
Implementation of the Semantic Web technology would be of mutual benefit to
both the participants and users and will confirm self-referencing power of the
community to apply the products of its own research to itself. We first explain
the logic of the transition and discuss important notions associated with the
Semantic Web technology. We then present a brief outline of the project
milestones.

 <dc:description>  Search engines perform the task of retrieving information related to the
user-supplied query words. This task has two parts; one is finding &quot;featured
words&quot; which describe an article best and the other is finding a match among
these words to user-defined search terms. There are two main independent
approaches to achieve this task. The first one, using the concepts of
semantics, has been implemented partially. For more details see another paper
of Marko et al., 2002. The second approach is reported in this paper. It is a
theoretical model based on using Neural Network (NN). Instead of using keywords
or reading from the first few lines from papers/articles, the present model
gives emphasis on extracting &quot;featured words&quot; from an article. Obviously we
propose to exclude prepositions, articles and so on, that is, English words
like &quot;of, the, are, so, therefore, &quot; etc. from such a list. A neural model is
taken with its nodes pre-assigned energies. Whenever a match is found with
featured words and userdefined search words, the node is fired and jumps to a
higher energy. This firing continues until the model attains a steady energy
level and total energy is now calculated. Clearly, higher match will generate
higher energy; so on the basis of total energy, a ranking is done to the
article indicating degree of relevance to the user's interest. Another
important feature of the proposed model is incorporating a semantic module to
refine the search words; like finding association among search words, etc. In
this manner, information retrieval can be improved markedly.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm to construct meshes suitable for space-time
discontinuous Galerkin finite-element methods. Our method generalizes and
improves the `Tent Pitcher' algorithm of \&quot;Ung\&quot;or and Sheffer. Given an
arbitrary simplicially meshed domain M of any dimension and a time interval
[0,T], our algorithm builds a simplicial mesh of the space-time domain Mx[0,T],
in constant time per element. Our algorithm avoids the limitations of previous
methods by carefully adapting the durations of space-time elements to the local
quality and feature size of the underlying space mesh.

 <dc:title>Handling Defeasibilities in Action Domains</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Yan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning.
In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because
domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general
inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also
interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a
prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning
about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\cal AT}^{0},
{\cal AT}^{1} and {\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in
action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and
actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a
higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower
superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\cal A}
language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where
transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By
illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a
powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and
postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action
languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more
desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action
languages.

 <dc:title>Mining All Non-Derivable Frequent Itemsets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recent studies on frequent itemset mining algorithms resulted in significant
performance improvements. However, if the minimal support threshold is set too
low, or the data is highly correlated, the number of frequent itemsets itself
can be prohibitively large. To overcome this problem, recently several
proposals have been made to construct a concise representation of the frequent
itemsets, instead of mining all frequent itemsets. The main goal of this paper
is to identify redundancies in the set of all frequent itemsets and to exploit
these redundancies in order to reduce the result of a mining operation. We
present deduction rules to derive tight bounds on the support of candidate
itemsets. We show how the deduction rules allow for constructing a minimal
representation for all frequent itemsets. We also present connections between
our proposal and recent proposals for concise representations and we give the
results of experiments on real-life datasets that show the effectiveness of the
deduction rules. In fact, the experiments even show that in many cases, first
mining the concise representation, and then creating the frequent itemsets from
this representation outperforms existing frequent set mining algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The non-classical, nonmonotonic inference relation associated with the answer
set semantics for logic programs gives rise to a relationship of 'strong
equivalence' between logical programs that can be verified in 3-valued Goedel
logic, G3, the strongest non-classical intermediate propositional logic
(Lifschitz, Pearce and Valverde, 2001). In this paper we will show that KC (the
logic obtained by adding axiom ~A v ~~A to intuitionistic logic), is the
weakest intermediate logic for which strongly equivalent logic programs, in a
language allowing negations, are logically equivalent.

 <dc:description>  Mutual information is widely used in artificial intelligence, in a
descriptive way, to measure the stochastic dependence of discrete random
variables. In order to address questions such as the reliability of the
empirical value, one must consider sample-to-population inferential approaches.
This paper deals with the distribution of mutual information, as obtained in a
Bayesian framework by a second-order Dirichlet prior distribution. The exact
analytical expression for the mean and an analytical approximation of the
variance are reported. Asymptotic approximations of the distribution are
proposed. The results are applied to the problem of selecting features for
incremental learning and classification of the naive Bayes classifier. A fast,
newly defined method is shown to outperform the traditional approach based on
empirical mutual information on a number of real data sets. Finally, a
theoretical development is reported that allows one to efficiently extend the
above methods to incomplete samples in an easy and effective way.

 <dc:description>  We report on a language resource consisting of 2000 annotated bibliography
entries, which is being analyzed as part of our research on indicative document
summarization. We show how annotated bibliographies cover certain aspects of
summarization that have not been well-covered by other summary corpora, and
motivate why they constitute an important form to study for information
retrieval. We detail our methodology for collecting the corpus, and overview
our document feature markup that we introduced to facilitate summary analysis.
We present the characteristics of the corpus, methods of collection, and show
its use in finding the distribution of types of information included in
indicative summaries and their relative ordering within the summaries.

 <dc:description>  The watershed algorithm belongs to classical algorithms in mathematical
morphology. Lotufo et al. published a principle of the watershed computation by
means of an Image Foresting Transform (IFT), which computes a shortest path
forest from given markers. The algorithm itself was described for a 2D case
(image) without a detailed discussion of its computation and memory demands for
real datasets. As IFT cleverly solves the problem of plateaus and as it gives
precise results when thin objects have to be segmented, it is obvious to use
this algorithm for 3D datasets taking in mind the minimizing of a higher memory
consumption for the 3D case without loosing low asymptotical time complexity of
O(m+C) (and also the real computation speed). The main goal of this paper is an
implementation of the IFT algorithm with a priority queue with buckets and
careful tuning of this implementation to reach as minimal memory consumption as
possible.
  The paper presents five possible modifications and methods of implementation
of the IFT algorithm. All presented implementations keep the time complexity of
the standard priority queue with buckets but the best one minimizes the costly
memory allocation and needs only 19-45% of memory for typical 3D medical
imaging datasets. Memory saving was reached by an IFT algorithm simplification,
which stores more elements in temporary structures but these elements are
simpler and thus need less memory.
  The best presented modification allows segmentation of large 3D medical
datasets (up to 512x512x680 voxels) with 12-or 16-bits per voxel on currently
available PC based workstations.

function evaluation methods: black-box functions, binary trees, $n$-ary trees
and string parsing. The test consists in evaluating 8 different functions of
two variables $x,y$ over 5000 floating point values of the pair $(x,y)$. The
outcome of the test indicates that the $n$-ary tree representation of algebraic
expressions is the fastest method, closely followed by black-box function
method, then by binary trees and lastly by string parsing.

 <dc:description>  Approaches from statistical physics are applied to investigate the structure
of network models whose growth rules mimic aspects of the evolution of the
world-wide web. We first determine the degree distribution of a growing network
in which nodes are introduced one at a time and attach to an earlier node of
degree k with rate A_ksim k^gamma. Very different behaviors arise for gamma&lt;1,
gamma=1, and gamma&gt;1. We also analyze the degree distribution of a
heterogeneous network, the joint age-degree distribution, the correlation
between degrees of neighboring nodes, as well as global network properties. An
extension to directed networks is then presented. By tuning model parameters to
reasonable values, we obtain distinct power-law forms for the in-degree and
out-degree distributions with exponents that are in good agreement with current
data for the web. Finally, a general growth process with independent
introduction of nodes and links is investigated. This leads to independently
growing sub-networks that may coalesce with other sub-networks. General results
for both the size distribution of sub-networks and the degree distribution are
obtained.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that the consensus problem cannot be solved
deterministically in an asynchronous environment, but that randomized solutions
are possible. We propose a new model, called noisy scheduling, in which an
adversarial schedule is perturbed randomly, and show that in this model
randomness in the environment can substitute for randomness in the algorithm.
In particular, we show that a simplified, deterministic version of Chandra's
wait-free shared-memory consensus algorithm (PODC, 1996, pp. 166-175) solves
consensus in time at most logarithmic in the number of active processes. The
proof of termination is based on showing that a race between independent
delayed renewal processes produces a winner quickly. In addition, we show that
the protocol finishes in constant time using quantum and priority-based
scheduling on a uniprocessor, suggesting that it is robust against the choice
of model over a wide range.

 <dc:description>  In this study, we presented the high-order fundamental solutions and general
solutions of convection-diffusion equation. To demonstrate their efficacy, we
applied the high-order general solutions to the boundary particle method (BPM)
for the solution of some inhomogeneous convection-diffusion problems, where the
BPM is a new truly boundary-only meshfree collocation method based on multiple
reciprocity principle. For the sake of completeness, the BPM is also briefly
described here.

 <dc:description>  While recent retrieval techniques do not limit the number of index terms,
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words are crucial in speech recognition. Aiming at
retrieving information with spoken queries, we fill the gap between speech
recognition and text retrieval in terms of the vocabulary size. Given a spoken
query, we generate a transcription and detect OOV words through speech
recognition. We then correspond detected OOV words to terms indexed in a target
collection to complete the transcription, and search the collection for
documents relevant to the completed transcription. We show the effectiveness of
our method by way of experiments.

 <dc:title>Japanese/English Cross-Language Information Retrieval: Exploration of
  Query Translation and Transliteration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), where queries and documents are
in different languages, has of late become one of the major topics within the
information retrieval community. This paper proposes a Japanese/English CLIR
system, where we combine a query translation and retrieval modules. We
currently target the retrieval of technical documents, and therefore the
performance of our system is highly dependent on the quality of the translation
of technical terms. However, the technical term translation is still
problematic in that technical terms are often compound words, and thus new
terms are progressively created by combining existing base words. In addition,
Japanese often represents loanwords based on its special phonogram.
Consequently, existing dictionaries find it difficult to achieve sufficient
coverage. To counter the first problem, we produce a Japanese/English
dictionary for base words, and translate compound words on a word-by-word
basis. We also use a probabilistic method to resolve translation ambiguity. For
the second problem, we use a transliteration method, which corresponds words
unlisted in the base word dictionary to their phonetic equivalents in the
target language. We evaluate our system using a test collection for CLIR, and
show that both the compound word translation and transliteration methods
improve the system performance.

 <dc:title>Distance function wavelets - Part III: &quot;Exotic&quot; transforms and series</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Part III of the reports consists of various unconventional distance function
wavelets (DFW). The dimension and the order of partial differential equation
(PDE) are first used as a substitute of the scale parameter in the DFW
transforms and series, especially with the space and time-space potential
problems. It is noted that the recursive multiple reciprocity formulation is
the DFW series. The Green second identity is used to avoid the singularity of
the zero-order fundamental solution in creating the DFW series. The fundamental
solutions of various composite PDEs are found very flexible and efficient to
handle a borad range of problems. We also discuss the underlying connections
between the crucial concepts of dimension, scale and the order of PDE through
the analysis of dissipative acoustic wave propagation. The shape parameter of
the potential problems is also employed as the &quot;scale parameter&quot; to create the
non-orthogonal DFW. This paper also briefly discusses and conjectures the DFW
correspondences of a variety of coordinate variable transforms and series.
Practically important, the anisotropic and inhomogeneous DFW's are developed by
using the geodesic distance variable. The DFW and the related basis functions
are also used in making the kernel distance sigmoidal functions, which are
potentially useful in the artificial neural network and machine learning. As or
even worse than the preceding two reports, this study scarifies mathematical
rigor and in turn unfetter imagination. Most results are intuitively obtained
without rigorous analysis. Follow-up research is still under way. The paper is
intended to inspire more research into this promising area.

 <dc:description>  The limit behavior of inductive logic programs has not been explored, but
when considering incremental or online inductive learning algorithms which
usually run ongoingly, such behavior of the programs should be taken into
account. An example is given to show that some inductive learning algorithm may
not be correct in the long run if the limit behavior is not considered. An
inductive logic program is convergent if given an increasing sequence of
example sets, the program produces a corresponding sequence of the Horn logic
programs which has the set-theoretic limit, and is limit-correct if the limit
of the produced sequence of the Horn logic programs is correct with respect to
the limit of the sequence of the example sets. It is shown that the GOLEM
system is not limit-correct. Finally, a limit-correct inductive logic system,
called the prioritized GOLEM system, is proposed as a solution.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of simultaneous embedding of planar graphs. There are
two variants of this problem, one in which the mapping between the vertices of
the two graphs is given and another where the mapping is not given. In
particular, we show that without mapping, any number of outerplanar graphs can
be embedded simultaneously on an $O(n)\times O(n)$ grid, and an outerplanar and
general planar graph can be embedded simultaneously on an $O(n^2)\times O(n^3)$
grid. If the mapping is given, we show how to embed two paths on an $n \times
n$ grid, a caterpillar and a path on an $n \times 2n$ grid, or two caterpillar
graphs on an $O(n^2)\times O(n^3)$ grid. We also show that 5 paths, or 3
caterpillars, or two general planar graphs cannot be simultaneously embedded
given the mapping.

 <dc:description>  Traditional representations of graphs and their duals suggest the requirement
that the dual vertices be placed inside their corresponding primal faces, and
the edges of the dual graph cross only their corresponding primal edges. We
consider the problem of simultaneously embedding a planar graph and its dual
into a small integer grid such that the edges are drawn as straight-line
segments and the only crossings are between primal-dual pairs of edges. We
provide a linear-time algorithm that simultaneously embeds a 3-connected planar
graph and its dual on a (2n-2) by (2n-2) integer grid, where n is the total
number of vertices in the graph and its dual. Furthermore our embedding
algorithm satisfies the two natural requirements mentioned above.

 <dc:description>  An approach for real-time network monitoring in terms of numerical
time-dependant functions of protocol parameters is suggested. Applying complex
systems theory for information f{l}ow analysis of networks, the information
traffic is described as a trajectory in multi-dimensional parameter-time space
with about 10-12 dimensions. The network traffic description is synthesized by
applying methods of theoretical physics and complex systems theory, to provide
a robust approach for network monitoring that detects known intrusions, and
supports developing real systems for detection of unknown intrusions. The
methods of data analysis and pattern recognition presented are the basis of a
technology study for an automatic intrusion detection system that detects the
attack in the reconnaissance stage.

 <dc:description>  J. Albrecht`s Function Point Analysis (FPA) is a method to determine the
functional size of software products. An organization called International
Function Point Users Group (IPFUG), considers the FPA as a standard in the
software functional size measurement. The Albrechts method is followed by IPFUG
method which includes some modifications in order to improve it. A limitation
of the method refers to the fact that FPA is not sensitive enough to
differentiate the functional size in small enhancements. That affects the
productivity analysis, where the software product functional size is required.
To provide more power to the functional size measurement, A. Abran, M. Maya and
H. Nguyeckim have proposed some modifications to improve it. The IPFUG v 4.1
method which includes these modifications is named IFPUG v 4.1 extended. In
this work we set the conditions to delimiting granular from non granular
functions and we calculate the static calibration and sensitivity graphs for
the measurements of a set of projects with a high percentage of granular
functions, all of then measured with the IFPUG v 4.1 method and the IFPUG v 4.1
extended. Finally, we introduce a statistic analysis in order to determine
whether significant differences exist between both methods or not.

 <dc:description>  An algorithm $M$ is described that solves any well-defined problem $p$ as
quickly as the fastest algorithm computing a solution to $p$, save for a factor
of 5 and low-order additive terms. $M$ optimally distributes resources between
the execution of provably correct $p$-solving programs and an enumeration of
all proofs, including relevant proofs of program correctness and of time bounds
on program runtimes. $M$ avoids Blum's speed-up theorem by ignoring programs
without correctness proof. $M$ has broader applicability and can be faster than
Levin's universal search, the fastest method for inverting functions save for a
large multiplicative constant. An extension of Kolmogorov complexity and two
novel natural measures of function complexity are used to show that the most
efficient program computing some function $f$ is also among the shortest
programs provably computing $f$.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, the problem of association rule mining in transactional data
has been well studied. We propose to extend the discovery of classical
association rules to the discovery of association rules of conjunctive queries
in arbitrary relational data, inspired by the WARMR algorithm, developed by
Dehaspe and Toivonen, that discovers association rules over a limited set of
conjunctive queries. Conjunctive query evaluation in relational databases is
well understood, but still poses some great challenges when approached from a
discovery viewpoint in which patterns are generated and evaluated with respect
to some well defined search space and pruning operators.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new approach to represent logic functions in the form
of Sierpinski Gaskets. The structure of the gasket allows to manipulate with
the corresponding logic expression using recursive essence of fractals. Thus,
the Sierpinski gasket's pattern has myriad useful properties which can enhance
practical features of other graphic representations like decision diagrams. We
have covered possible applications of Sierpinski gaskets in logic design and
justified our assumptions in logic function minimization (both Boolean and
multiple-valued cases). The experimental results on benchmarks with advances in
the novel structure are considered as well.

 <dc:description>  Given a reference lattice, we define fuzzy intervals to be the fuzzy sets
such that their p-cuts are crisp closed intervals. We show that: given a
complete reference lattice, the collection of its fuzzy intervals is a complete
lattice. Furthermore we show that: if the reference lattice is completely
distributive then the lattice of its fuzzy intervals is distributive.

 <dc:description>  This paper extends a polynomial-time parsing algorithm that resolves
structural ambiguity in input to a speech-based user interface by calculating
and comparing the denotations of rival constituents, given some model of the
interfaced application environment (Schuler 2001). The algorithm is extended to
incorporate a full set of logical operators, including quantifiers and
conjunctions, into this calculation without increasing the complexity of the
overall algorithm beyond polynomial time, both in terms of the length of the
input and the number of entities in the environment model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we expose the theoretical background underlying our current
research. This consists in the development of behaviour-based knowledge
systems, for closing the gaps between behaviour-based and knowledge-based
systems, and also between the understandings of the phenomena they model. We
expose the requirements and stages for developing behaviour-based knowledge
systems and discuss their limits. We believe that these are necessary
conditions for the development of higher order cognitive capacities, in
artificial and natural cognitive systems.

 <dc:description>  Although knowledge is one of the most valuable resource of enterprises and an
important production and competition factor, this intellectual potential is
often used (or maintained) only inadequate by the enterprises. Therefore, in a
globalised and growing market the optimal usage of existing knowledge
represents a key factor for enterprises of the future. Here, knowledge
management systems should engage facilitating. Because geographically far
distributed establishments cause, however, a distributed system, this paper
should uncover the spectrum connected with it and present a possible basic
approach which is based on ontologies and modern, platform independent
technologies. Last but not least this attempt, as well as general questions of
the knowledge management, are discussed.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an efficient method for generating and rendering
photorealistic hair in two dimensional pictures. The method consists of three
major steps. Simulating an artist drawing is used to design the rough hair
shape. A convolution based filter is then used to generate photorealistic hair
patches. A refine procedure is finally used to blend the boundaries of the
patches with surrounding areas. This method can be used to create all types of
photorealistic human hair (head hair, facial hair and body hair). It is also
suitable for fur and grass generation. Applications of this method include:
hairstyle designing/editing, damaged hair image restoration, human hair
animation, virtual makeover of a human, and landscape creation.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a method to analyze Japanese anaphora, in which zero
pronouns (omitted obligatory cases) are used to refer to preceding entities
(antecedents). Unlike the case of general coreference resolution, zero pronouns
have to be detected prior to resolution because they are not expressed in
discourse. Our method integrates two probability parameters to perform zero
pronoun detection and resolution in a single framework. The first parameter
quantifies the degree to which a given case is a zero pronoun. The second
parameter quantifies the degree to which a given entity is the antecedent for a
detected zero pronoun. To compute these parameters efficiently, we use corpora
with/without annotations of anaphoric relations. We show the effectiveness of
our method by way of experiments.

 <dc:description>  This paper applies an existing query translation method to cross-language
patent retrieval. In our method, multiple dictionaries are used to derive all
possible translations for an input query, and collocational statistics are used
to resolve translation ambiguity. We used Japanese/English parallel patent
abstracts to perform comparative experiments, where our method outperformed a
simple dictionary-based query translation method, and achieved 76% of
monolingual retrieval in terms of average precision.

 <dc:description>  Given the growing number of patents filed in multiple countries, users are
interested in retrieving patents across languages. We propose a multi-lingual
patent retrieval system, which translates a user query into the target
language, searches a multilingual database for patents relevant to the query,
and improves the browsing efficiency by way of machine translation and
clustering. Our system also extracts new translations from patent families
consisting of comparable patents, to enhance the translation dictionary.

 <dc:description>  The efficient implementation of collective communiction operations has
received much attention. Initial efforts produced &quot;optimal&quot; trees based on
network communication models that assumed equal point-to-point latencies
between any two processes. This assumption is violated in most practical
settings, however, particularly in heterogeneous systems such as clusters of
SMPs and wide-area &quot;computational Grids,&quot; with the result that collective
operations perform suboptimally. In response, more recent work has focused on
creating topology-aware trees for collective operations that minimize
communication across slower channels (e.g., a wide-area network). While these
efforts have significant communication benefits, they all limit their view of
the network to only two layers. We present a strategy based upon a multilayer
view of the network. By creating multilevel topology-aware trees we take
advantage of communication cost differences at every level in the network. We
used this strategy to implement topology-aware versions of several MPI
collective operations in MPICH-G2, the Globus Toolkit[tm]-enabled version of
the popular MPICH implementation of the MPI standard. Using information about
topology provided by MPICH-G2, we construct these multilevel topology-aware
trees automatically during execution. We present results demonstrating the
advantages of our multilevel approach by comparing it to the default
(topology-unaware) implementation provided by MPICH and a topology-aware
two-layer implementation.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by Hubert's segmentation procedure we discuss the application of
hidden Markov models (HMM) to the segmentation of hydrological and enviromental
time series. We use a HMM algorithm which segments time series of several
hundred terms in a few seconds and is computationally feasible for even longer
time series. The segmentation algorithm computes the Maximum Likelihood
segmentation by use of an expectation / maximization iteration. We rigorously
prove algorithm convergence and use numerical experiments, involving
temperature and river discharge time series, to show that the algorithm usually
converges to the globally optimal segmentation. The relation of the proposed
algorithm to Hubert's segmentation procedure is also discussed.

 <dc:description>  Application development for distributed computing &quot;Grids&quot; can benefit from
tools that variously hide or enable application-level management of critical
aspects of the heterogeneous environment. As part of an investigation of these
issues, we have developed MPICH-G2, a Grid-enabled implementation of the
Message Passing Interface (MPI) that allows a user to run MPI programs across
multiple computers, at the same or different sites, using the same commands
that would be used on a parallel computer. This library extends the Argonne
MPICH implementation of MPI to use services provided by the Globus Toolkit for
authentication, authorization, resource allocation, executable staging, and
I/O, as well as for process creation, monitoring, and control. Various
performance-critical operations, including startup and collective operations,
are configured to exploit network topology information. The library also
exploits MPI constructs for performance management; for example, the MPI
communicator construct is used for application-level discovery of, and
adaptation to, both network topology and network quality-of-service mechanisms.
We describe the MPICH-G2 design and implementation, present performance
results, and review application experiences, including record-setting
distributed simulations.

 <dc:description>  An anticipatory system for guiding plot development in interactive narratives
is described. The executable model is a finite automaton that provides the
implemented system with a look-ahead. The identification of undesirable future
states in the model is used to guide the player, in a transparent manner. In
this way, too radical twists of the plot can be avoided. Since the player
participates in the development of the plot, such guidance can have many forms,
depending on the environment of the player, on the behavior of the other
players, and on the means of player interaction. We present a design method for
interactive narratives which produces designs suitable for the implementation
of anticipatory mechanisms. Use of the method is illustrated by application to
our interactive computer game Kaktus.

 <dc:description>  In modern society, the flow of information has become the lifeblood of
commerce and social interaction. This movement of data supports most aspects of
the United States economy in particular, as well as, serving as the vehicle
upon which governmental agencies react to social conditions. In addition, it is
understood that the continuance of efficient and reliable data communications
during times of national or regional disaster remains a priority in the United
States. The coordination of emergency response and area revitalization /
rehabilitation efforts between local, state, and federal emergency response is
increasingly necessary as agencies strive to work more seamlessly between the
affected organizations. Additionally, international support is often made
available to react to such adverse conditions as wildfire suppression scenarios
and therefore require the efficient management of workforce and associated
logistics support.
  It is through the examination of the issues related to un-tethered data
transmission during infrastructure contingencies that responders may best
tailor a unified approach to the rapid recovery after disasters occur.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the results of some experiments exploring statistical
methods to infer syntactic behavior of words and morphemes from a raw corpus in
an unsupervised fashion. It shares certain points in common with Brown et al
(1992) and work that has grown out of that: it employs statistical techniques
to analyze syntactic behavior based on what words occur adjacent to a given
word. However, we use an eigenvector decomposition of a nearest-neighbor graph
to produce a two-dimensional rendering of the words of a corpus in which words
of the same syntactic category tend to form neighborhoods. We exploit this
technique for extending the value of automatic learning of morphology. In
particular, we look at the suffixes derived from a corpus by unsupervised
learning of morphology, and we ask which of these suffixes have a consistent
syntactic function (e.g., in English, -tion is primarily a mark of nouns, but
-s marks both noun plurals and 3rd person present on verbs), and we determine
that this method works well for this task.

 <dc:description>  The title of a document has two roles, to give a compact summary and to lead
the reader to read the document. Conventional title generation focuses on
finding key expressions from the author's wording in the document to give a
compact summary and pays little attention to the reader's interest. To make the
title play its second role properly, it is indispensable to clarify the content
(``what to say'') and wording (``how to say'') of titles that are effective to
attract the target reader's interest. In this article, we first identify
typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers in a comparative
study between titles of technical papers and headlines rewritten for
newspapers. Next, we describe the results of a questionnaire survey on the
effects of the content and wording of titles on the reader's interest. The
survey of general and knowledgeable readers shows both common and different
tendencies in interest.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of cutting a set of edges on a polyhedral manifold
surface, possibly with boundary, to obtain a single topological disk,
minimizing either the total number of cut edges or their total length. We show
that this problem is NP-hard, even for manifolds without boundary and for
punctured spheres. We also describe an algorithm with running time n^{O(g+k)},
where n is the combinatorial complexity, g is the genus, and k is the number of
boundary components of the input surface. Finally, we describe a greedy
algorithm that outputs a O(log^2 g)-approximation of the minimum cut graph in
O(g^2 n log n) time.

 <dc:description>  This paper developed a systematic strategy establishing RBF on the wavelet
analysis, which includes continuous and discrete RBF orthonormal wavelet
transforms respectively in terms of singular fundamental solutions and
nonsingular general solutions of differential operators. In particular, the
harmonic Bessel RBF transforms were presented for high-dimensional data
processing. It was also found that the kernel functions of convection-diffusion
operator are feasible to construct some stable ridgelet-like RBF transforms. We
presented time-space RBF transforms based on non-singular solution and
fundamental solution of time-dependent differential operators. The present
methodology was further extended to analysis of some known RBFs such as the MQ,
Gaussian and pre-wavelet kernel RBFs.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents case-study results on the application of information
theoretic approach to gate-level evolutionary circuit design. We introduce
information measures to provide better estimates of synthesis criteria of
digital circuits. For example, the analysis of signal propagation during
evolving gate-level synthesis can be improved by using information theoretic
measures that will make it possible to find the most effective geometry and
therefore predict the cost of the final design solution. The problem is
considered from the information engine point of view. That is, the process of
evolutionary gate-level circuit design is presented via such measures as
entropy, logical work and information vitality. Some examples of geometry
driven synthesis are provided to prove the above idea.

 <dc:description>  A long and lasting problem in agent research has been to close the gap
between agent logics and agent programming frameworks. The main reason for this
problem of establishing a link between agent logics and agent programming
frameworks is identified and explained by the fact that agent programming
frameworks have not incorporated the concept of a `declarative goal'. Instead,
such frameworks have focused mainly on plans or `goals-to-do' instead of the
end goals to be realised which are also called `goals-to-be'. In this paper, a
new programming language called GOAL is introduced which incorporates such
declarative goals. The notion of a `commitment strategy' - one of the main
theoretical insights due to agent logics, which explains the relation between
beliefs and goals - is used to construct a computational semantics for GOAL.
Finally, a proof theory for proving properties of GOAL agents is introduced.
Thus, we offer a complete theory of agent programming in the sense that our
theory provides both for a programming framework and a programming logic for
such agents. An example program is proven correct by using this programming
logic.

 <dc:description>  Elementary symmetric polynomials $S_n^k$ are used as a benchmark for the
bounded-depth arithmetic circuit model of computation. In this work we prove
that $S_n^k$ modulo composite numbers $m=p_1p_2$ can be computed with much
fewer multiplications than over any field, if the coefficients of monomials
$x_{i_1}x_{i_2}... x_{i_k}$ are allowed to be 1 either mod $p_1$ or mod $p_2$
but not necessarily both. More exactly, we prove that for any constant $k$ such
a representation of $S_n^k$ can be computed modulo $p_1p_2$ using only
$\exp(O(\sqrt{\log n}\log\log n))$ multiplications on the most restricted
depth-3 arithmetic circuits, for $\min({p_1,p_2})&gt;k!$. Moreover, the number of
multiplications remain sublinear while $k=O(\log\log n).$ In contrast, the
well-known Graham-Pollack bound yields an $n-1$ lower bound for the number of
multiplications even for the exact computation (not the representation) of
$S_n^2$. Our results generalize for other non-prime power composite moduli as
well. The proof uses the famous BBR-polynomial of Barrington, Beigel and
Rudich.

 <dc:title>Symmetric boundary knot method</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The boundary knot method (BKM) is a recent boundary-type radial basis
function (RBF) collocation scheme for general PDEs. Like the method of
fundamental solution (MFS), the RBF is employed to approximate the
inhomogeneous terms via the dual reciprocity principle. Unlike the MFS, the
method uses a nonsingular general solution instead of a singular fundamental
solution to evaluate the homogeneous solution so as to circumvent the
controversial artificial boundary outside the physical domain. The BKM is
meshfree, superconvergent, integration free, very easy to learn and program.
The original BKM, however, loses symmetricity in the presense of mixed

developed a symmetric BKM scheme. The accuracy and efficiency of the symmetric
BKM are also numerically validated in some 2D and 3D Helmholtz and diffusion
reaction problems under complicated geometries.

 <dc:description>  In some areas of management and commerce, especially in Electronic commerce
(E-commerce), that are accelerated by advances in Web technologies, it is
essential to support the decision making process using formal methods. Among
the problems of E-commerce applications: reducing the time of data access so
that huge databases can be searched quickly; decreasing the cost of database
design ... etc. We present the application of Decision Diagrams design using
Information Theory approach to improve database access speeds. We show that
such utilization provides systematic and visual ways of applying Decision
Making methods to simplify complex Web engineering problems.

 <dc:title>Synthesis of Low-Power Digital Circuits Derived from Binary Decision

 <dc:creator>Popel, Denis V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>B.6.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel method for synthesizing digital circuits
derived from Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) that can yield to reduction in
power dissipation. The power reduction is achieved by decreasing the switching
activity in a circuit while paying close attention to information measures as
an optimization criterion. We first present the technique of efficient
BDD-based computation of information measures which are used to guide the power
optimization procedures. Using this technique, we have developed an algorithm
of BDD reordering which leads to reducing the power consumption of the circuits
derived from BDDs. Results produced by the synthesis on the ISCAS benchmark
circuits are very encouraging.

 <dc:description>  A novel algorithm for creating a mathematical model of curved shapes is
introduced. The core of the algorithm is based on building a graph
representation of the contoured image, which occupies less storage space than
produced by raster compression techniques. Different advanced applications of
the mathematical model are discussed: recognition of handwritten characters and
verification of handwritten text and signatures for authentification purposes.
Reducing the storage requirements due to the efficient mathematical model
results in faster retrieval and processing times. The experimental outcomes in
compression of contoured images and recognition of handwritten numerals are

 <dc:description>  This paper made some significant advances in the dual reciprocity and
boundary-only RBF techniques. The proposed boundary knot method (BKM) is
different from the standard boundary element method in a number of important
aspects. Namely, it is truly meshless, exponential convergence,
integration-free (of course, no singular integration), boundary-only for
general problems, and leads to symmetric matrix under certain conditions (able
to be extended to general cases after further modified). The BKM also avoids
the artificial boundary in the method of fundamental solution. An amazing
finding is that the BKM can formulate linear modeling equations for nonlinear
partial differential systems with linear boundary conditions. This merit makes
it circumvent all perplexing issues in the iteration solution of nonlinear
equations. On the other hand, by analogy with Green's second identity, this
paper also presents a general solution RBF (GSR) methodology to construct
efficient RBFs in the dual reciprocity and domain-type RBF collocation methods.
The GSR approach first establishes an explicit relationship between the BEM and
RBF itself on the ground of the weighted residual principle. This paper also
discusses the RBF convergence and stability problems within the framework of
integral equation theory.

 <dc:title>Relationship between boundary integral equation and radial basis

 <dc:subject>G1.8, G1.9</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper aims to survey our recent work relating to the radial basis
function (RBF) from some new views of points. In the first part, we established
the RBF on numerical integration analysis based on an intrinsic relationship
between the Green's boundary integral representation and RBF. It is found that
the kernel function of integral equation is important to create efficient RBF.
The fundamental solution RBF (FS-RBF) was presented as a novel strategy
constructing operator-dependent RBF. We proposed a conjecture formula featuring
the dimension affect on error bound to show the independent-dimension merit of
the RBF techniques. We also discussed wavelet RBF, localized RBF schemes, and
the influence of node placement on the RBF solution accuracy. The
centrosymmetric matrix structure of the RBF interpolation matrix under
symmetric node placing is proved.
  The second part of this paper is concerned with the boundary knot method
(BKM), a new boundary-only, meshless, spectral convergent, integration-free RBF
collocation technique. The BKM was tested to the Helmholtz, Laplace, linear and
nonlinear convection-diffusion problems. In particular, we introduced the
response knot-dependent nonsingular general solution to calculate
varying-parameter and nonlinear steady convection-diffusion problems very
efficiently. By comparing with the multiple dual reciprocity method, we
discussed the completeness issue of the BKM.
  Finally, the nonsingular solutions for some known differential operators were
given in appendix. Also we expanded the RBF concepts by introducing time-space
RBF for transient problems.

 <dc:description>  Very few studies involve how to construct the efficient RBFs by means of
problem features. Recently the present author presented general solution RBF
(GS-RBF) methodology to create operator-dependent RBFs successfully [1]. On the
other hand, the normal radial basis function (RBF) is defined via Euclidean
space distance function or the geodesic distance [2]. This purpose of this note
is to redefine distance function in conjunction with problem features, which
include problem-dependent and time-space distance function.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces new technique for efficient calculation of different
Shannon information measures which operates Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). We
offer an algorithm of BDD reordering which demonstrates the improvement of the
obtaining outcomes over the existing reordering approaches. The technique and
the reordering algorithm have been implemented, and the results on circuits'

algorithm is very fast, and it is easy to implement. Finally, we show that our
approach to BDD reordering can yield to reduction in the power dissipation for
the circuits derived from BDDs.

 <dc:description>  Open logic programs and open entailment have been recently proposed as an
abstract framework for the verification of incomplete specifications based upon
normal logic programs and the stable model semantics. There are obvious
analogies between open predicates and abducible predicates. However, despite
superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no
immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly,
open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming
(ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships
between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs
generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests
interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model
semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction
and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the
aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and
ASP.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider three different kinds of domain-dependent control
knowledge (temporal, procedural and HTN-based) that are useful in planning. Our
approach is declarative and relies on the language of logic programming with
answer set semantics (AnsProlog*). AnsProlog* is designed to plan without
control knowledge. We show how temporal, procedural and HTN-based control
knowledge can be incorporated into AnsProlog* by the modular addition of a
small number of domain-dependent rules, without the need to modify the planner.
We formally prove the correctness of our planner, both in the absence and
presence of the control knowledge. Finally, we perform some initial
experimentation that demonstrates the potential reduction in planning time that
can be achieved when procedural domain knowledge is used to solve planning
problems with large plan length.

 <dc:description>  Much work on argument systems has focussed on preferred extensions which
define the maximal collectively defensible subsets. Identification and
enumeration of these subsets is (under the usual assumptions) computationally
demanding. We consider approaches to deciding if a subset S is a preferred
extension which query a representations encoding all such extensions, so that
the computational effort is invested once only (for the initial enumeration)
rather than for each separate query.

 <dc:description>  Dung's abstract framework for argumentation enables a study of the
interactions between arguments based solely on an ``attack'' binary relation on
the set of arguments. Various ways to solve conflicts between contradictory
pieces of information have been proposed in the context of argumentation,
nonmonotonic reasoning or logic programming, and can be captured by appropriate
semantics within Dung's framework. A common feature of these semantics is that
one can always maximize in some sense the set of acceptable arguments. We
propose in this paper to extend Dung's framework in order to allow for the
representation of what we call ``restricted'' arguments: these arguments should
only be used if absolutely necessary, that is, in order to support other
arguments that would otherwise be defeated. We modify Dung's preferred
semantics accordingly: a set of arguments becomes acceptable only if it
contains a minimum of restricted arguments, for a maximum of unrestricted
arguments.

 <dc:description>  We study an abstract optimization problem arising from biomolecular sequence
analysis. For a sequence A of pairs (a_i,w_i) for i = 1,..,n and w_i&gt;0, a
segment A(i,j) is a consecutive subsequence of A starting with index i and
ending with index j. The width of A(i,j) is w(i,j) = sum_{i &lt;= k &lt;= j} w_k, and
the density is (sum_{i&lt;= k &lt;= j} a_k)/ w(i,j). The maximum-density segment
problem takes A and two values L and U as input and asks for a segment of A
with the largest possible density among those of width at least L and at most
U. When U is unbounded, we provide a relatively simple, O(n)-time algorithm,
improving upon the O(n \log L)-time algorithm by Lin, Jiang and Chao. When both
L and U are specified, there are no previous nontrivial results. We solve the
problem in O(n) time if w_i=1 for all i, and more generally in
O(n+n\log(U-L+1)) time when w_i&gt;=1 for all i.

 <dc:description>  A permutation P on {1,..,N} is a_fast_forward_permutation_ if for each m the
computational complexity of evaluating P^m(x)$ is small independently of m and
x. Naor and Reingold constructed fast forward pseudorandom cycluses and
involutions. By studying the evolution of permutation graphs, we prove that the
number of queries needed to distinguish a random cyclus from a random
permutation on {1,..,N} is Theta(N) if one does not use queries of the form
P^m(x), but is only Theta(1) if one is allowed to make such queries.
  We construct fast forward permutations which are indistinguishable from
random permutations even when queries of the form P^m(x) are allowed. This is
done by introducing an efficient method to sample the cycle structure of a
random permutation, which in turn solves an open problem of Naor and Reingold.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we will formalize the method of dual fitting and the idea of
factor-revealing LP. This combination is used to design and analyze two greedy
algorithms for the metric uncapacitated facility location problem. Their
approximation factors are 1.861 and 1.61, with running times of O(mlog m) and
O(n^3), respectively, where n is the total number of vertices and m is the
number of edges in the underlying complete bipartite graph between cities and
facilities. The algorithms are used to improve recent results for several
variants of the problem.

 <dc:description>  An extension of an abstract argumentation framework, called collective
argumentation, is introduced in which the attack relation is defined directly
among sets of arguments. The extension turns out to be suitable, in particular,
for representing semantics of disjunctive logic programs. Two special kinds of
collective argumentation are considered in which the opponents can share their
arguments.

 <dc:description>  The purpose of this paper is to address some criticisms recently raised by
John Horty in two articles against the validity of two commonly accepted
defeasible reasoning patterns, viz. reinstatement and floating conclusions. I
shall argue that Horty's counterexamples, although they significantly raise our
understanding of these reasoning patterns, do not show their invalidity. Some
of them reflect patterns which, if made explicit in the formalisation, avoid
the unwanted inference without having to give up the criticised inference
principles. Other examples seem to involve hidden assumptions about the
specific problem which, if made explicit, are nothing but extra information
that defeat the defeasible inference. These considerations will be put in a
wider perspective by reflecting on the nature of defeasible reasoning
principles as principles of justified acceptance rather than `real' logical
inference.

 <dc:description>  In this work we present additional results related to the property of strong
equivalence of logic programs. This property asserts that two programs share
the same set of stable models, even under the addition of new rules. As shown
in a recent work by Lifschitz, Pearce and Valverde, strong equivalence can be
simply reduced to equivalence in the logic of Here-and-There (HT). In this
paper we provide two alternatives respectively based on classical logic and
3-valued logic. The former is applicable to general rules, but not for nested
expressions, whereas the latter is applicable for nested expressions but, when
moving to an unrestricted syntax, it generally yields different results from
HT.

 <dc:description>  This paper shows that the weighting coefficient matrices of the differential
quadrature method (DQM) are centrosymmetric or skew-centrosymmetric if the grid
spacings are symmetric irrespective of whether they are equal or unequal. A new
skew centrosymmetric matrix is also discussed. The application of the
properties of centrosymmetric and skew centrosymmetric matrix can reduce the
computational effort of the DQM for calculations of the inverse, determinant,
eigenvectors and eigenvalues by 75%. This computational advantage are also
demonstrated via several numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  Recently, Bert, Wang and Striz [1, 2] applied the differential quadrature
(DQ) and harmonic differential quadrature (HDQ) methods to analyze static and
dynamic behaviors of anisotropic plates. Their studies showed that the methods
were conceptually simple and computationally efficient in comparison to other
numerical techniques. Based on some recent work by the present author [3, 4],
the purpose of this note is to further simplify the formulation effort and
improve computing efficiency in applying the DQ and HDQ methods for these
cases.

 <dc:description>  Civan and Sliepcevich [1, 2] suggested that special matrix solver should be
developed to further reduce the computing effort in applying the differential
quadrature (DQ) method for the Poisson and convection-diffusion equations.
Therefore, the purpose of the present communication is to introduce and apply
the Lyapunov formulation which can be solved much more efficiently than the
Gaussian elimination method. Civan and Sliepcevich [2] first presented DQ
approximate formulas in polynomial form for partial derivatives in
tow-dimensional variable domain. For simplifying formulation effort, Chen et
al. [3] proposed the compact matrix form of these DQ approximate formulas. In
this study, by using these matrix approximate formulas, the DQ formulations for
the Poisson and convection-diffusion equations can be expressed as the Lyapunov
algebraic matrix equation. The formulation effort is simplified, and a simple
and explicit matrix formulation is obtained. A variety of fast algorithms in
the solution of the Lyapunov equation [4-6] can be successfully applied in the
DQ analysis of these two-dimensional problems, and, thus, the computing effort
can be greatly reduced. Finally, we also point out that the present reduction
technique can be easily extended to the three-dimensional cases.

machines and allows for flexibility in the choice of local collector and
distributed acyclic garbage collector to use with it. We have emphasized
reducing the number and size of network messages without sacrificing the
promptness of collection throughout the algorithm. Our proposed collector is a
variant of back tracing to avoid extensive synchronization between machines. We
have added an explicit forward tracing stage to the standard back tracing stage
and designed a tuned heuristic to reduce the total amount of work done by the
collector. Of particular note is the development of fault-tolerant cooperation
between traces and a heuristic that aggressively reduces the set of suspect
objects.

 <dc:description>  The introduction of explicit notions of rejection, or disbelief, into logics
for knowledge representation can be justified in a number of ways. Motivations
range from the need for versions of negation weaker than classical negation, to
the explicit recording of classic belief contraction operations in the area of
belief change, and the additional levels of expressivity obtained from an
extended version of belief change which includes disbelief contraction. In this
paper we present four logics of disbelief which address some or all of these
intuitions. Soundness and completeness results are supplied and the logics are
compared with respect to applicability and utility.

 <dc:description>  The axiom of recovery, while capturing a central intuition regarding belief
change, has been the source of much controversy. We argue briefly against
putative counterexamples to the axiom--while agreeing that some of their
insight deserves to be preserved--and present additional recovery-like axioms
in a framework that uses epistemic states, which encode preferences, as the
object of revisions. This provides a framework in which iterated revision
becomes possible and makes explicit the connection between iterated belief
change and the axiom of recovery. We provide a representation theorem that
connects the semantic conditions that we impose on iterated revision and the
additional syntactical properties mentioned. We also show some interesting
similarities between our framework and that of Darwiche-Pearl. In particular,
we show that the intuitions underlying the controversial (C2) postulate are
captured by the recovery axiom and our recovery-like postulates (the latter can
be seen as weakenings of (C2).

 <dc:title>Dual reciprocity BEM and dynamic programming filter for inverse

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first coupling application of the dual reciprocity
BEM (DRBEM) and dynamic programming filter to inverse elastodynamic problem.
The DRBEM is the only BEM method, which does not require domain discretization
for general linear and nonlinear dynamic problems. Since the size of numerical
discretization system has a great effect on the computing effort of recursive
or iterative calculations of inverse analysis, the intrinsic boundary-only
merit of the DRBEM causes a considerable computational saving. On the other
hand, the strengths of the dynamic programming filter lie in its mathematical
simplicity, easy to program and great flexibility in the type, number and
locations of measurements and unknown inputs. The combination of these two
techniques is therefore very attractive for the solution of practical inverse
problems. In this study, the spatial and temporal partial derivatives of the
governing equation are respectively discretized first by the DRBEM and the
precise integration method, and then, by using dynamic programming with
regularization, dynamic load is estimated based on noisy measurements of
velocity and displacement at very few locations. Numerical experiments involved
with the periodic and Heaviside impact load are conducted to demonstrate the
applicability, efficiency and simplicity of this strategy. The affect of noise
level, regularization parameter, and measurement types on the estimation is
also investigated.

We set up a general framework in which we extensively compare this semantics to
other argumentation semantics, including those of Dung, and Prakken and Sartor.
We present a general dialectical proof theory for these argumentation

 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the two new boundary-type radial basis function
collocation schemes, boundary knot method (BKM) and boundary particle method
(BPM). The BKM is developed based on the dual reciprocity theorem, while the
BPM employs the multiple reciprocity technique. Unlike the method of
fundamental solution, the wto methods use the nonsingular general solutions
instead of singular fundamental solution to circumvent the controversial
artificial boundary outside physical domain. Compared with the boundary element
method, both the BKM and BPM are meshfree, superconvergent, meshfree,
integration free, symmetric, and mathematically simple collocation techniques
for general PDEs. In particular, the BPM does not require any inner nodes for
inhomogeneous problems. In this study, the accuracy and efficiency of the two
methods are numerically demonstrated to some 2D, 3D Helmholtz and
convection-diffusion problems under complicated geometries.

 <dc:title>Logic Programming with Ordered Disjunction</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>I.2.4</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Logic programs with ordered disjunction (LPODs) combine ideas underlying
Qualitative Choice Logic (Brewka et al. KR 2002) and answer set programming.
Logic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective
called ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent
alternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A
\times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at
least B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a
preference relation on answer sets. LPODs are useful for applications in design
and configuration and can serve as a basis for qualitative decision making.

 <dc:title>A meshless, integration-free, and boundary-only RBF technique</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Based on the radial basis function (RBF), non-singular general solution and
dual reciprocity method (DRM), this paper presents an inherently meshless,
integration-free, boundary-only RBF collocation techniques for numerical
solution of various partial differential equation systems. The basic ideas
behind this methodology are very mathematically simple. In this study, the RBFs
are employed to approximate the inhomogeneous terms via the DRM, while
non-singular general solution leads to a boundary-only RBF formulation for
homogenous solution. The present scheme is named as the boundary knot method
(BKM) to differentiate it from the other numerical techniques. In particular,
due to the use of nonsingular general solutions rather than singular
fundamental solutions, the BKM is different from the method of fundamental
solution in that the former does no require the artificial boundary and results
in the symmetric system equations under certain conditions. The efficiency and
utility of this new technique are validated through a number of typical
numerical examples. Completeness concern of the BKM due to the only use of
non-singular part of complete fundamental solution is also discussed.

courses. It seamlessly guides and supports students during all phases of
program development, covering specification, implementation, and program
debugging. GUPU features several innovations in this area. The specification
phase is supported by reference implementations augmented with diagnostic
facilities. During implementation, immediate feedback from test cases and from
visualization tools helps the programmer's program understanding. A set of
slicing techniques narrows down programming errors. The whole process is guided
by a marking system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can
be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a
general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any
equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive
results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified,
showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as
difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or
renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the
inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and
clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred
models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time
polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used
in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a
system.

additional important aspects. We incorporate explanations in the trace
structure, i.e. reasons for why certain solver actions occur. Furthermore, we
come up with a format for describing the execution of the filtering algorithms
of global constraints. Some new ideas about the design of the trace are also
presented. For example, we have modeled our trace as a nested block structure
in order to achieve a hierarchical view. Also, new ways about how to represent
and identify different entities such as constraints and domain variables are
presented.

 <dc:description>  CLPGUI is a graphical user interface for visualizing and interacting with
constraint logic programs over finite domains. In CLPGUI, the user can control
the execution of a CLP program through several views of constraints, of finite
domain variables and of the search tree. CLPGUI is intended to be used both for
teaching purposes, and for debugging and improving complex programs of
realworld scale. It is based on a client-server architecture for connecting the
CLP process to a Java-based GUI process. Communication by message passing
provides an open architecture which facilitates the reuse of graphical
components and the porting to different constraint programming systems.
Arbitrary constraints and goals can be posted incrementally from the GUI. We
propose several dynamic 2D and 3D visualizations of the search tree and of the
evolution of finite domain variables. We argue that the 3D representation of
search trees proposed in this paper provides the most appropriate visualization
of large search trees. We describe the current implementation of the
annotations and of the interactive execution model in GNU-Prolog, and report
some evaluation results.

 <dc:description>  Type analyses of logic programs which aim at inferring the types of the
program being analyzed are presented in a unified abstract interpretation-based
framework. This covers most classical abstract interpretation-based type
analyzers for logic programs, built on either top-down or bottom-up
interpretation of the program. In this setting, we discuss the widening
operator, arguably a crucial one. We present a new widening which is more
precise than those previously proposed. Practical results with our analysis
domain are also presented, showing that it also allows for efficient analysis.

 <dc:title>Value withdrawal explanations: a theoretical tool for programming

 <dc:description>  Constraint logic programming combines declarativity and efficiency thanks to
constraint solvers implemented for specific domains. Value withdrawal
explanations have been efficiently used in several constraints programming
environments but there does not exist any formalization of them. This paper is
an attempt to fill this lack. Furthermore, we hope that this theoretical tool
could help to validate some programming environments. A value withdrawal
explanation is a tree describing the withdrawal of a value during a domain
reduction by local consistency notions and labeling. Domain reduction is
formalized by a search tree using two kinds of operators: operators for local
consistency notions and operators for labeling. These operators are defined by
sets of rules. Proof trees are built with respect to these rules. For each
removed value, there exists such a proof tree which is the withdrawal
explanation of this value.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a simple source code configuration tool. ExLibris
operates on libraries and can be used to extract from local libraries all code
relevant to a particular project. Our approach is not designed to address
problems arising in code production lines, but rather, to support the needs of
individual or small teams of researchers who wish to communicate their Prolog
programs. In the process, we also wish to accommodate and encourage the writing
of reusable code. Moreover, we support and propose ways of dealing with issues
arising in the development of code that can be run on a variety of like-minded
Prolog systems. With consideration to these aims we have made the following
decisions: (i) support file-based source development, (ii) require minimal
program transformation, (iii) target simplicity of usage, and (iv) introduce
minimum number of new primitives.

 <dc:description>  The twelfth Workshop on Logic Programming Environments, WLPE 2002, is one in
a series of international workshops held in the topic area. The workshops
facilitate the exchange ideas and results among researchers and system
developers on all aspects of environments for logic programming. Relevant
topics for these workshops include user interfaces, human engineering,
execution visualization, development tools, providing for new paradigms, and
interfacing to language system tools and external systems. This twelfth
workshop held in Copenhaguen. It follows the successful eleventh Workshop on
Logic Programming Environments held in Cyprus in December, 2001.
  WLPE 2002 features ten presentations. The presentations involve, in some way,
constraint logic programming, object-oriented programming and abstract
interpretation. Topics areas addressed include tools for software development,
execution visualization, software maintenance, instructional aids.
  This workshop was a post-conference workshop at ICLP 2002.

 <dc:description>  It is next to impossible to develop real-life applications in just pure
Prolog. With XPCE we realised a mechanism for integrating Prolog with an
external object-oriented system that turns this OO system into a natural
extension to Prolog. We describe the design and how it can be applied to other
external OO systems.

 <dc:description>  The Gisela framework for declarative programming was developed with the
specific aim of providing a tool that would be useful for knowledge
representation and reasoning within real-world applications. To achieve this, a
complete integration into an object-oriented application development
environment was used. The framework and methodology developed provide two
alternative application programming interfaces (APIs): Programming using
objects or programming using a traditional equational declarative style. In
addition to providing complete integration, Gisela also allows extensions and
modifications due to the general computation model and well-defined APIs. We
give a brief overview of the declarative model underlying Gisela and we present
the methodology proposed for building applications together with some real
examples.

theory of algorithms and computations evaluates the contemporary situation with
computers and global networks. In the second part, it is demonstrated what new
perspectives this theory opens through its new direction that is called theory
of super-recursive algorithms. These algorithms have much higher computing
power than conventional algorithmic schemes. In the third part, we explicate
how realization of what this theory suggests might influence life of people in
future. It is demonstrated that now the theory is far ahead computing practice
and practice has to catch up with the theory. We conclude with a comparison of
different approaches to the development of information technology.

 <dc:title>Modeling Complex Domains of Actions and Change</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of modeling complex domains of actions and
change within high-level action description languages. We investigate two main
issues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together
different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of
actions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem
domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its
computational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this
representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out
through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational
performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare
different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology
of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through
domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of
computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological
guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried
out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the
results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are
independent of the specific modeling language.

 <dc:description>  Within the Geometry of Interaction (GoI) paradigm, we present a setting that
enables qualitative differences between classical and quantum processes to be
explored. The key construction is the physical interpretation/realization of
the traced monoidal categories of finite-dimensional vector spaces with tensor
product as monoidal structure and of finite sets and relations with Cartesian
product as monoidal structure, both of them providing a so-called wave-style
GoI. The developments in this paper reveal that envisioning state update due to
quantum measurement as a process provides a powerful tool for developing
high-level approaches to quantum information processing.

 <dc:description>  Information needs are naturally represented as questions. Automatic
Natural-Language Question Answering (NLQA) has only recently become a practical
task on a larger scale and without domain constraints.
  This paper gives a brief introduction to the field, its history and the
impact of systematic evaluation competitions.
  It is then demonstrated that an NLQA system for English can be built and
evaluated in a very short time using off-the-shelf parsers and thesauri. The
system is based on Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (RMRS) and is portable
with respect to the parser used as a frontend. It applies atomic term
unification supported by question classification and WordNet lookup for
semantic similarity matching of parsed question representation and free text.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the problem of defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic
programs within a general framework based on alternating fixpoint theory. We
start by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to
preference are too weak in the setting of well-founded semantics. We then
specify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework
for preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded
semantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is
convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our
semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to
various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the
weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we
indicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured
within our semantical framework.

 <dc:description>  We present algorithms that run in linear time on pointer machines for a
collection of problems, each of which either directly or indirectly requires
the evaluation of a function defined on paths in a tree. These problems
previously had linear-time algorithms but only for random-access machines
(RAMs); the best pointer-machine algorithms were super-linear by an
inverse-Ackermann-function factor. Our algorithms are also simpler, in some
cases substantially, than the previous linear-time RAM algorithms. Our
improvements come primarily from three new ideas: a refined analysis of path
compression that gives a linear bound if the compressions favor certain nodes,
a pointer-based radix sort as a replacement for table-based methods, and a more
careful partitioning of a tree into easily managed parts. Our algorithms
compute nearest common ancestors off-line, verify and construct minimum
spanning trees, do interval analysis on a flowgraph, find the dominators of a
flowgraph, and build the component tree of a weighted tree.

 <dc:description>  This report will add some supplements to the recently finished report series
on the distance function wavelets (DFW). First, we define the general distance
in terms of the Riesz potential, and then, the distance function Abel wavelets
are derived via the fractional integral and Laplacian. Second, the DFW Weyl
transform is found to be a shifted Laplace potential DFW. The DFW Radon
transform is also presented. Third, we present a conjecture on truncation error
formula of the multiple reciprocity Laplace DFW series and discuss its error
distributions in terms of node density distributions. Forth, we point out that
the Hermite distance function interpolation can be used to replace overlapping
in the domain decomposition in order to produce sparse matrix. Fifth, the shape
parameter is explained as a virtual extra axis contribution in terms of the
MQ-type Possion kernel. The report is concluded with some remarks on a range of
other issues.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze the complexity of natural parallelizations of
Delaunay refinement methods for mesh generation. The parallelizations employ a
simple strategy: at each iteration, they choose a set of ``independent'' points
to insert into the domain, and then update the Delaunay triangulation. We show
that such a set of independent points can be constructed efficiently in
parallel and that the number of iterations needed is $O(\log^2(L/s))$, where
$L$ is the diameter of the domain, and $s$ is the smallest edge in the output
mesh. In addition, we show that the insertion of each independent set of points
can be realized sequentially by Ruppert's method in two dimensions and
Shewchuk's in three dimensions. Therefore, our parallel Delaunay refinement
methods provide the same element quality and mesh size guarantees as the
sequential algorithms in both two and three dimensions. For quasi-uniform
meshes, such as those produced by Chew's method, we show that the number of
iterations can be reduced to $O(\log(L/s))$. To the best of our knowledge,
these are the first provably polylog$(L/s)$ parallel time Delaunay meshing
algorithms that generate well-shaped meshes of size optimal to within a
constant.

 <dc:description>  Craig's interpolation theorem (Craig 1957) is an important theorem known for
propositional logic and first-order logic. It says that if a logical formula
$\beta$ logically follows from a formula $\alpha$, then there is a formula
$\gamma$, including only symbols that appear in both $\alpha,\beta$, such that
$\beta$ logically follows from $\gamma$ and $\gamma$ logically follows from
$\alpha$. Such theorems are important and useful for understanding those logics
in which they hold as well as for speeding up reasoning with theories in those
logics. In this paper we present interpolation theorems in this spirit for
three nonmonotonic systems: circumscription, default logic and logic programs
with the stable models semantics (a.k.a. answer set semantics). These results
give us better understanding of those logics, especially in contrast to their
nonmonotonic characteristics. They suggest that some \emph{monotonicity}
principle holds despite the failure of classic monotonicity for these logics.
Also, they sometimes allow us to use methods for the decomposition of reasoning
for these systems, possibly increasing their applicability and tractability.
Finally, they allow us to build structured representations that use those
logics.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a transformation of finite propositional default
theories into so-called propositional argumentation systems. This
transformation allows to characterize all notions of Reiter's default logic in
the framework of argumentation systems. As a consequence, computing extensions,
or determining wether a given formula belongs to one extension or all
extensions can be answered without leaving the field of classical propositional
logic. The transformation proposed is linear in the number of defaults.

 <dc:description>  Dealing with the NP-complete Dominating Set problem on undirected graphs, we
demonstrate the power of data reduction by preprocessing from a theoretical as
well as a practical side. In particular, we prove that Dominating Set
restricted to planar graphs has a so-called problem kernel of linear size,
achieved by two simple and easy to implement reduction rules. Moreover, having
implemented our reduction rules, first experiments indicate the impressive
practical potential of these rules. Thus, this work seems to open up a new and
prospective way how to cope with one of the most important problems in graph
theory and combinatorial optimization.

 <dc:description>  In the present paper, the existence and multiplicity problems of extensions
are addressed. The focus is on extension of the stable type. The main result of
the paper is an elegant characterization of the existence and multiplicity of
extensions in terms of the notion of dialectical justification, a close cousin
of the notion of admissibility. The characterization is given in the context of
the particular logic for dialectical argumentation DEFLOG. The results are of
direct relevance for several well-established models of defeasible reasoning
(like default logic, logic programming and argumentation frameworks), since
elsewhere dialectical argumentation has been shown to have close formal
connections with these models.

 <dc:description>  In this study, the concept of small worlds is investigated in the context of
large-scale wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. Wireless networks are spatial
graphs that are usually much more clustered than random networks and have much
higher path length characteristics. We observe that by adding only few random
links, path length of wireless networks can be reduced drastically without
affecting clustering. What is even more interesting is that such links need not
be formed randomly but may be confined to a limited number of hops between the
connected nodes. This has an important practical implication, as now we can
introduce a distributed algorithm in large-scale wireless networks, based on
what we call contacts, to improve the performance of resource discovery in such
networks, without resorting to global flooding. We propose new contact-based
protocols for adding logical short cuts in wireless networks efficiently. The
new protocols take advantage of mobility in order to increase reachability of
the search. We study the performance of our proposed contact-based
architecture, and clarify the context in which large-scale wireless networks
can be turned into small world networks.

 <dc:description>  Wh-phrases in English can appear both raised and in-situ. However, only
in-situ wh-phrases can take semantic scope beyond the immediately enclosing
clause. I present a denotational semantics of interrogatives that naturally
accounts for these two properties. It neither invokes movement or economy, nor
posits lexical ambiguity between raised and in-situ occurrences of the same
wh-phrase. My analysis is based on the concept of continuations. It uses a
novel type system for higher-order continuations to handle wide-scope
wh-phrases while remaining strictly compositional. This treatment sheds light
on the combinatorics of interrogatives as well as other kinds of so-called
A'-movement.

 <dc:description>  Nested logic programs have recently been introduced in order to allow for
arbitrarily nested formulas in the heads and the bodies of logic program rules
under the answer sets semantics. Nested expressions can be formed using
conjunction, disjunction, as well as the negation as failure operator in an
unrestricted fashion. This provides a very flexible and compact framework for
knowledge representation and reasoning. Previous results show that nested logic
programs can be transformed into standard (unnested) disjunctive logic programs
in an elementary way, applying the negation as failure operator to body
literals only. This is of great practical relevance since it allows us to
evaluate nested logic programs by means of off-the-shelf disjunctive logic
programming systems, like DLV. However, it turns out that this straightforward
transformation results in an exponential blow-up in the worst-case, despite the
fact that complexity results indicate that there is a polynomial translation
among both formalisms. In this paper, we take up this challenge and provide a
polynomial translation of logic programs with nested expressions into
disjunctive logic programs. Moreover, we show that this translation is modular
and (strongly) faithful. We have implemented both the straightforward as well
as our advanced transformation; the resulting compiler serves as a front-end to
DLV and is publicly available on the Web.

 <dc:description>  The need for a circumscriptive formalism that allows for simple yet elegant
modular problem representation has led Lifschitz (AIJ, 1995) to introduce
nested abnormality theories (NATs) as a tool for modular knowledge
representation, tailored for applying circumscription to minimize exceptional
circumstances. Abstracting from this particular objective, we propose L_{CIRC},
which is an extension of generic propositional circumscription by allowing
propositional combinations and nesting of circumscriptive theories. As shown,
NATs are naturally embedded into this language, and are in fact of equal
expressive capability. We then analyze the complexity of L_{CIRC} and NATs, and
in particular the effect of nesting. The latter is found to be a source of
complexity, which climbs the Polynomial Hierarchy as the nesting depth
increases and reaches PSPACE-completeness in the general case. We also identify
meaningful syntactic fragments of NATs which have lower complexity. In
particular, we show that the generalization of Horn circumscription in the NAT
framework remains CONP-complete, and that Horn NATs without fixed letters can
be efficiently transformed into an equivalent Horn CNF, which implies
polynomial solvability of principal reasoning tasks. Finally, we also study
extensions of NATs and briefly address the complexity in the first-order case.
Our results give insight into the ``cost'' of using L_{CIRC} (resp. NATs) as a
host language for expressing other formalisms such as action theories,
narratives, or spatial theories.

sender and a receiver. Reachability routing is becoming relevant with the
changing dynamics of the Internet and the emergence of low-bandwidth
wireless/ad-hoc networks. We make the case for reinforcement learning as the
framework of choice to realize reachability routing, within the confines of the
current Internet infrastructure. The setting of the reinforcement learning
problem offers several advantages, including loop resolution, multi-path
forwarding capability, cost-sensitive routing, and minimizing state overhead,
while maintaining the incremental spirit of current backbone routing
algorithms. We identify research issues in reinforcement learning applied to
the reachability routing problem to achieve a fluid and robust backbone routing
framework. The paper is targeted toward practitioners seeking to implement a
reachability routing algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The goal of computational logic is to allow us to model computation as well
as to reason about it. We argue that a computational logic must be able to
model interactive computation. We show that first-order logic cannot model
interactive computation due to the incompleteness of interaction. We show that
interactive computation is necessarily paraconsistent, able to model both a
fact and its negation, due to the role of the world (environment) in
determining the course of the computation. We conclude that paraconsistency is
a necessary property for a logic that can model interactive computation.

 <dc:description>  Recently, it has been shown that probabilistic entailment under coherence is
weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment. Moreover, probabilistic
entailment under coherence is a generalization of default entailment in System
P. In this paper, we continue this line of research by presenting probabilistic
generalizations of more sophisticated notions of classical default entailment
that lie between model-theoretic probabilistic entailment and probabilistic
entailment under coherence. That is, the new formalisms properly generalize
their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than
model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than
probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful
especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning
on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision.
More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper
sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the
well-known standard ones.

 <dc:description>  The problem of integrating knowledge from multiple and heterogeneous sources
is a fundamental issue in current information systems. In order to cope with
this problem, the concept of mediator has been introduced as a software
component providing intermediate services, linking data resources and
application programs, and making transparent the heterogeneity of the
underlying systems. In designing a mediator architecture, we believe that an
important aspect is the definition of a formal framework by which one is able
to model integration according to a declarative style. To this purpose, the use
of a logical approach seems very promising. Another important aspect is the
ability to model both static integration aspects, concerning query execution,
and dynamic ones, concerning data updates and their propagation among the
various data sources. Unfortunately, as far as we know, no formal proposals for
logically modeling mediator architectures both from a static and dynamic point
of view have already been developed. In this paper, we extend the framework for
amalgamated knowledge bases, presented by Subrahmanian, to deal with dynamic
aspects. The language we propose is based on the Active U-Datalog language, and
extends it with annotated logic and amalgamation concepts. We model the sources
of information and the mediator (also called supervisor) as Active U-Datalog
deductive databases, thus modeling queries, transactions, and active rules,
interpreted according to the PARK semantics. By using active rules, the system
can efficiently perform update propagation among different databases. The
result is a logical environment, integrating active and deductive rules, to
perform queries and update propagation in an heterogeneous mediated framework.

 <dc:description>  Clusters of computers have emerged as mainstream parallel and distributed
platforms for high-performance, high-throughput and high-availability
computing. To enable effective resource management on clusters, numerous
cluster managements systems and schedulers have been designed. However, their
focus has essentially been on maximizing CPU performance, but not on improving
the value of utility delivered to the user and quality of services. This paper
presents a new computational economy driven scheduling system called Libra,
which has been designed to support allocation of resources based on the users?
quality of service (QoS) requirements. It is intended to work as an add-on to
the existing queuing and resource management system. The first version has been
implemented as a plugin scheduler to the PBS (Portable Batch System) system.
The scheduler offers market-based economy driven service for managing batch
jobs on clusters by scheduling CPU time according to user utility as determined
by their budget and deadline rather than system performance considerations. The
Libra scheduler ensures that both these constraints are met within an O(n)
run-time. The Libra scheduler has been simulated using the GridSim toolkit to
carry out a detailed performance analysis. Results show that the deadline and
budget based proportional resource allocation strategy improves the utility of
the system and user satisfaction as compared to system-centric scheduling
strategies.

 <dc:description>  We improve on random sampling techniques for approximately solving problems
that involve cuts and flows in graphs. We give a near-linear-time construction
that transforms any graph on n vertices into an O(n\log n)-edge graph on the
same vertices whose cuts have approximately the same value as the original
graph's. In this new graph, for example, we can run the O(m^{3/2})-time maximum
flow algorithm of Goldberg and Rao to find an s--t minimum cut in O(n^{3/2})
time. This corresponds to a (1+epsilon)-times minimum s--t cut in the original
graph. In a similar way, we can approximate a sparsest cut to within O(log n)
in O(n^2) time using a previous O(mn)-time algorithm. A related approach leads
to a randomized divide and conquer algorithm producing an approximately maximum
flow in O(m sqrt{n}) time.

 <dc:description>  An important problem of modern cryptography concerns secret public-key
computations in algebraic structures. We construct homomorphic cryptosystems
being (secret) epimorphisms f:G --&gt; H, where G, H are (publically known) groups
and H is finite. A letter of a message to be encrypted is an element h element
of H, while its encryption g element of G is such that f(g)=h. A homomorphic
cryptosystem allows one to perform computations (operating in a group G) with
encrypted information (without knowing the original message over H).
  In this paper certain homomorphic cryptosystems are constructed for the first
time for non-abelian groups H (earlier, homomorphic cryptosystems were known
only in the Abelian case). In fact, we present such a system for any solvable
(fixed) group H.

 <dc:description>  We provide a data structure for maintaining an embedding of a graph on a

amortized time O(log n + log g(log log g)^3) per update on a surface of genus

the minimum and maximum spanning tree of the graph in time O(log n + log^4 g)
per update. Our data structure allows edge insertion and deletion as well as
the dual operations; these operations may implicitly change the genus of the
embedding surface. We apply similar ideas to improve the constant factor in a
separator theorem for low-genus graphs, and to find in linear time a
tree-decomposition of low-genus low-diameter graphs.

 <dc:description>  We seek to find normative criteria of adequacy for nonmonotonic logic similar
to the criterion of validity for deductive logic. Rather than stipulating that
the conclusion of an inference be true in all models in which the premises are
true, we require that the conclusion of a nonmonotonic inference be true in
``almost all'' models of a certain sort in which the premises are true. This
``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the
inference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and
previous inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect
known frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default
inference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an
extension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise
result from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when
construed in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default
rules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics.

 <dc:description>  Signed systems were introduced as a general, syntax-independent framework for
paraconsistent reasoning, that is, non-trivialised reasoning from inconsistent
information. In this paper, we show how the family of corresponding
paraconsistent consequence relations can be axiomatised by means of quantified
Boolean formulas. This approach has several benefits. First, it furnishes an
axiomatic specification of paraconsistent reasoning within the framework of
signed systems. Second, this axiomatisation allows us to identify upper bounds
for the complexity of the different signed consequence relations. We strengthen
these upper bounds by providing strict complexity results for the considered
reasoning tasks. Finally, we obtain an implementation of different forms of
paraconsistent reasoning by appeal to the existing system QUIP.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider two points of views to the problem of coherent
integration of distributed data. First we give a pure model-theoretic analysis
of the possible ways to `repair' a database. We do so by characterizing the
possibilities to `recover' consistent data from an inconsistent database in
terms of those models of the database that exhibit as minimal inconsistent
information as reasonably possible. Then we introduce an abductive application
to restore the consistency of a given database. This application is based on an
abductive solver (A-system) that implements an SLDNFA-resolution procedure, and
computes a list of data-facts that should be inserted to the database or
retracted from it in order to keep the database consistent. The two approaches
for coherent data integration are related by soundness and completeness
results.

 <dc:description>  Defeasible logic is an efficient logic for defeasible reasoning. It is
defined through a proof theory and, until now, has had no model theory. In this
paper a model-theoretic semantics is given for defeasible logic. The logic is
sound and complete with respect to the semantics. We also briefly outline how
this approach extends to a wide range of defeasible logics.

 <dc:title>Axiomatic Aspects of Default Inference</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper studies axioms for nonmonotonic consequences from a
semantics-based point of view, focusing on a class of mathematical structures
for reasoning about partial information without a predefined syntax/logic. This
structure is called a default structure. We study axioms for the nonmonotonic
consequence relation derived from extensions as in Reiter's default logic,
using skeptical reasoning, but extensions are now used for the construction of
possible worlds in a default information structure.
  In previous work we showed that skeptical reasoning arising from
default-extensions obeys a well-behaved set of axioms including the axiom of
cautious cut. We show here that, remarkably, the converse is also true: any
consequence relation obeying this set of axioms can be represented as one
constructed from skeptical reasoning. We provide representation theorems to
relate axioms for nonmonotonic consequence relation and properties about
extensions, and provide one-to-one correspondence between nonmonotonic systems
which satisfies the law of cautious monotony and default structures with unique
extensions. Our results give a theoretical justification for a set of basic
rules governing the update of nonmonotonic knowledge bases, demonstrating the
derivation of them from the more concrete and primitive construction of
extensions. It is also striking to note that proofs of the representation
theorems show that only shallow extensions are necessary, in the sense that the
number of iterations needed to achieve an extension is at most three. All of
these developments are made possible by taking a more liberal view of
consistency: consistency is a user defined predicate, satisfying some basic
properties.

 <dc:description>  Classical logic predicts that everything (thus nothing useful at all) follows
from inconsistency. A paraconsistent logic is a logic where an inconsistency
does not lead to such an explosion, and since in practice consistency is
difficult to achieve there are many potential applications of paraconsistent
logics in knowledge-based systems, logical semantics of natural language, etc.
Higher order logics have the advantages of being expressive and with several
automated theorem provers available. Also the type system can be helpful. We
present a concise description of a paraconsistent higher order logic with
countable infinite indeterminacy, where each basic formula can get its own
indeterminate truth value (or as we prefer: truth code). The meaning of the
logical operators is new and rather different from traditional many-valued
logics as well as from logics based on bilattices. The adequacy of the logic is
examined by a case study in the domain of medicine. Thus we try to build a
bridge between the HOL and MVL communities. A sequent calculus is proposed
based on recent work by Muskens.

reasoning with rough sets. Moreover, a rough-set-specific query language is
presented and an answering algorithm is outlined. Thus, we not only show a
possible application of a paraconsistent logic to the field of rough sets as we
also establish a link between rough set theory and logic programming, making
possible transfer of expertise between both fields.

 <dc:description>  This paper concerns a goal directed proof procedure for the propositional
fragment of the adaptive logic ACLuN1. At the propositional level, it forms an
algorithm for final derivability. If extended to the predicative level, it
provides a criterion for final derivability. This is essential in view of the
absence of a positive test. The procedure may be generalized to all flat
adaptive logics.

 <dc:description>  The model theory of a first-order logic called N^4 is introduced. N^4 does
not eliminate double negations, as classical logic does, but instead reduces
fourfold negations. N^4 is very close to classical logic: N^4 has two truth
values; implications in N^4 are material, like in classical logic; and negation
distributes over compound formulas in N^4 as it does in classical logic.
Results suggest that the semantics of normal logic programs is conveniently
formalized in N^4: Classical logic Herbrand interpretations generalize
straightforwardly to N^4; the classical minimal Herbrand model of a positive
logic program coincides with its unique minimal N^4 Herbrand model; the stable
models of a normal logic program and its so-called complete minimal N^4
Herbrand models coincide.

 <dc:description>  The handling of user preferences is becoming an increasingly important issue
in present-day information systems. Among others, preferences are used for
information filtering and extraction to reduce the volume of data presented to
the user. They are also used to keep track of user profiles and formulate
policies to improve and automate decision making.
  We propose here a simple, logical framework for formulating preferences as
preference formulas. The framework does not impose any restrictions on the
preference relations and allows arbitrary operation and predicate signatures in
preference formulas. It also makes the composition of preference relations
straightforward. We propose a simple, natural embedding of preference formulas
into relational algebra (and SQL) through a single winnow operator
parameterized by a preference formula. The embedding makes possible the
formulation of complex preference queries, e.g., involving aggregation, by
piggybacking on existing SQL constructs. It also leads in a natural way to the
definition of further, preference-related concepts like ranking. Finally, we
present general algebraic laws governing the winnow operator and its
interaction with other relational algebra operators. The preconditions on the
applicability of the laws are captured by logical formulas. The laws provide a
formal foundation for the algebraic optimization of preference queries. We
demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through numerous examples.

 <dc:description>  A relational database is inconsistent if it does not satisfy a given set of
integrity constraints. Nevertheless, it is likely that most of the data in it
is consistent with the constraints. In this paper we apply logic programming
based on answer sets to the problem of retrieving consistent information from a
possibly inconsistent database. Since consistent information persists from the
original database to every of its minimal repairs, the approach is based on a
specification of database repairs using disjunctive logic programs with
exceptions, whose answer set semantics can be represented and computed by
systems that implement stable model semantics. These programs allow us to
declare persistence by defaults and repairing changes by exceptions. We
concentrate mainly on logic programs for binary integrity constraints, among
which we find most of the integrity constraints found in practice.

 <dc:description>  Simulations of specifications are introduced as a unification and
generalization of refinement mappings, history variables, forward simulations,
prophecy variables, and backward simulations. A specification implements
another specification if and only if there is a simulation from the first one
to the second one that satisfies a certain condition. By adding stutterings,
the formalism allows that the concrete behaviours take more (or possibly less)
steps than the abstract ones.
  Eternity variables are introduced as a more powerful alternative for prophecy
variables and backward simulations. This formalism is semantically complete:
every simulation that preserves quiescence is a composition of a forward
simulation, an extension with eternity variables, and a refinement mapping.
This result does not need finite invisible nondeterminism and machine closure
as in the Abadi-Lamport Theorem. Internal continuity is weakened to
preservation of quiescence.

 <dc:description>  With the tremendous advances in processor and memory technology, I/O has
risen to become the bottleneck in high-performance computing for many
applications. The development of parallel file systems has helped to ease the
performance gap, but I/O still remains an area needing significant performance
improvement. Research has found that noncontiguous I/O access patterns in
scientific applications combined with current file system methods to perform
these accesses lead to unacceptable performance for large data sets. To enhance
performance of noncontiguous I/O we have created list I/O, a native version of
noncontiguous I/O. We have used the Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) to
implement our ideas. Our research and experimentation shows that list I/O
outperforms current noncontiguous I/O access methods in most I/O situations and
can substantially enhance the performance of real-world scientific
applications.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel, general, optimally fast, incremental way of searching for
a universal algorithm that solves each task in a sequence of tasks. The Optimal
Ordered Problem Solver (OOPS) continually organizes and exploits previously
found solutions to earlier tasks, efficiently searching not only the space of
domain-specific algorithms, but also the space of search algorithms.
Essentially we extend the principles of optimal nonincremental universal search
to build an incremental universal learner that is able to improve itself
through experience. In illustrative experiments, our self-improver becomes the
first general system that learns to solve all n disk Towers of Hanoi tasks
(solution size 2^n-1) for n up to 30, profiting from previously solved, simpler
tasks involving samples of a simple context free language.

 <dc:description>  We provide the first classification of different types of Random Boolean
Networks (RBNs). We study the differences of RBNs depending on the degree of
synchronicity and determinism of their updating scheme. For doing so, we first
define three new types of RBNs. We note some similarities and differences
between different types of RBNs with the aid of a public software laboratory we
developed. Particularly, we find that the point attractors are independent of
the updating scheme, and that RBNs are more different depending on their
determinism or non-determinism rather than depending on their synchronicity or
asynchronicity. We also show a way of mapping non-synchronous deterministic
RBNs into synchronous RBNs. Our results are important for justifying the use of
specific types of RBNs for modelling natural phenomena.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of detecting race conditions in programs that use
semaphores for synchronization. Netzer and Miller showed that it is NP-complete
to detect race conditions in programs that use many semaphores. We show in this
paper that it remains NP-complete even if only two semaphores are used in the
parallel programs.
  For the tractable case, i.e., using only one semaphore, we give two
algorithms for detecting race conditions from the trace of executing a parallel
program on p processors, where n semaphore operations are executed. The first
algorithm determines in O(n) time whether a race condition exists between any
two given operations. The second algorithm runs in O(np log n) time and outputs
a compact representation from which one can determine in O(1) time whether a
race condition exists between any two given operations. The second algorithm is
near-optimal in that the running time is only O(log n) times the time required
simply to write down the output.

 <dc:description>  The problem of searching for a model-based scene interpretation is analyzed
within a probabilistic framework. Object models are formulated as generative
models for range data of the scene. A new statistical criterion, the truncated
object probability, is introduced to infer an optimal sequence of object
hypotheses to be evaluated for their match to the data. The truncated
probability is partly determined by prior knowledge of the objects and partly
learned from data. Some experiments on sequence quality and object segmentation
and recognition from stereo data are presented. The article recovers classic
concepts from object recognition (grouping, geometric hashing, alignment) from
the probabilistic perspective and adds insight into the optimal ordering of
object hypotheses for evaluation. Moreover, it introduces point-relation
densities, a key component of the truncated probability, as statistical models
of local surface shape.

 <dc:title>Rectangle Size Bounds and Threshold Covers in Communication Complexity</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate the power of the most important lower bound technique in
randomized communication complexity, which is based on an evaluation of the
maximal size of approximately monochromatic rectangles, minimized over all
distributions on the inputs. While it is known that the 0-error version of this
bound is polynomially tight for deterministic communication, nothing in this
direction is known for constant error and randomized communication complexity.
We first study a one-sided version of this bound and obtain that its value lies
between the MA- and AM-complexities of the considered function. Hence the lower
bound actually works for a (communication complexity) class between MA cap
co-MA and AM cap co-AM. We also show that the MA-complexity of the disjointness
problem is Omega(sqrt(n)). Following this we consider the conjecture that the
lower bound method is polynomially tight for randomized communication
complexity. First we disprove a distributional version of this conjecture. Then
we give a combinatorial characterization of the value of the lower bound
method, in which the optimization over all distributions is absent. This
characterization is done by what we call a uniform threshold cover. We also
study relaxations of this notion, namely approximate majority covers and
majority covers, and compare these three notions in power, exhibiting
exponential separations. Each of these covers captures a lower bound method
previously used for randomized communication complexity.

 <dc:description>  In the paper we apply graph vertex coloring for verification of secret
shares. We start from showing how to convert any graph into the number and vice
versa. Next, theoretical result concerning properties of n-colorable graphs is
stated and proven. From this result we derive graph coloring check-digit
scheme. Feasibility of proposed scheme increases with the size of the number,
which digits are checked and overall probability of errors. The check-digit
scheme is used to build shares verification method that does not require
cooperation of the third party. It allows implementing verification structure
different from the access structure. It does not depend on particular secret
sharing method. It can be used as long as the secret shares can be represented
by numbers or graphs.

 <dc:description>  Soft constraints extend classical constraints to represent multiple
consistency levels, and thus provide a way to express preferences, fuzziness,
and uncertainty. While there are many soft constraint solving formalisms, even
distributed ones, by now there seems to be no concurrent programming framework
where soft constraints can be handled. In this paper we show how the classical
concurrent constraint (cc) programming framework can work with soft
constraints, and we also propose an extension of cc languages which can use
soft constraints to prune and direct the search for a solution. We believe that
this new programming paradigm, called soft cc (scc), can be also very useful in
many web-related scenarios. In fact, the language level allows web agents to
express their interaction and negotiation protocols, and also to post their
requests in terms of preferences, and the underlying soft constraint solver can
find an agreement among the agents even if their requests are incompatible.

 <dc:description>  The so called ``cogen approach'' to program specialisation, writing a
compiler generator instead of a specialiser, has been used with considerable
success in partial evaluation of both functional and imperative languages. This
paper demonstrates that the cogen approach is also applicable to the
specialisation of logic programs (also called partial deduction) and leads to
effective specialisers. Moreover, using good binding-time annotations, the
speed-ups of the specialised programs are comparable to the speed-ups obtained
with online specialisers. The paper first develops a generic approach to
offline partial deduction and then a specific offline partial deduction method,
leading to the offline system LIX for pure logic programs. While this is a
usable specialiser by itself, it is used to develop the cogen system LOGEN.
Given a program, a specification of what inputs will be static, and an
annotation specifying which calls should be unfolded, LOGEN generates a
specialised specialiser for the program at hand. Running this specialiser with
particular values for the static inputs results in the specialised program.
While this requires two steps instead of one, the efficiency of the
specialisation process is improved in situations where the same program is
specialised multiple times. The paper also presents and evaluates an automatic
binding-time analysis that is able to derive the annotations. While the derived
annotations are still suboptimal compared to hand-crafted ones, they enable
non-expert users to use the LOGEN system in a fully automated way. Finally,
LOGEN is extended so as to directly support a large part of Prolog's
declarative and non-declarative features and so as to be able to perform so
called mixline specialisations.

 <dc:description>  This article explores the design and construction of a geo-spatial Internet
web service application from the host web site perspective and from the
perspective of an application using the web service. The TerraService.NET web
service was added to the popular TerraServer database and web site with no
major structural changes to the database. The article discusses web service
design, implementation, and deployment concepts and design guidelines. Web
services enable applications that aggregate and interact with information and
resources from Internet-scale distributed servers. The article presents the
design of two USDA applications that interoperate with database and web service
resources in Fort Collins Colorado and the TerraService web service located in
Tukwila Washington.

 <dc:description>  Science projects are data publishers. The scale and complexity of current and
future science data changes the nature of the publication process. Publication
is becoming a major project component. At a minimum, a project must preserve
the ephemeral data it gathers. Derived data can be reconstructed from metadata,
but metadata is ephemeral. Longer term, a project should expect some archive to
preserve the data. We observe that pub-lished scientific data needs to be
available forever ? this gives rise to the data pyramid of versions and to data
inflation where the derived data volumes explode. As an example, this article
describes the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) strategies for data publication,
data access, curation, and preservation.

 <dc:description>  Science is becoming very data intensive1. Today's astronomy datasets with
tens of millions of galaxies already present substantial challenges for data
mining. In less than 10 years the catalogs are expected to grow to billions of
objects, and image archives will reach Petabytes. Imagine having a 100GB
database in 1996, when disk scanning speeds were 30MB/s, and database tools
were immature. Such a task today is trivial, almost manageable with a laptop.
We think that the issue of a PB database will be very similar in six years. In
this paper we scale our current experiments in data archiving and analysis on
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey2,3 data six years into the future. We analyze
these projections and look at the requirements of performing data mining on
such data sets. We conclude that the task scales rather well: we could do the
job today, although it would be expensive. There do not seem to be any
show-stoppers that would prevent us from storing and using a Petabyte dataset
six years from today.

 <dc:description>  Web Services form a new, emerging paradigm to handle distributed access to
resources over the Internet. There are platform independent standards (SOAP,
WSDL), which make the developers? task considerably easier. This article
discusses how web services could be used in the context of the Virtual
Observatory. We envisage a multi-layer architecture, with interoperating
services. A well-designed lower layer consisting of simple, standard services
implemented by most data providers will go a long way towards establishing a
modular architecture. More complex applications can be built upon this core
layer. We present two prototype applications, the SdssCutout and the SkyQuery
as examples of this layered architecture.

 <dc:description>  Datasets with tens of millions of galaxies present new challenges for the
analysis of spatial clustering. We have built a framework that integrates a
database of object catalogs, tools for creating masks of bad regions, and a
fast (NlogN) correlation code. This system has enabled unprecedented efficiency
in carrying out the analysis of galaxy clustering in the SDSS catalog. A
similar approach is used to compute the three-dimensional spatial clustering of
galaxies on very large scales. We describe our strategy to estimate the effect
of photometric errors using a database. We discuss our efforts as an early
example of data-intensive science. While it would have been possible to get
these results without the framework we describe, it will be infeasible to
perform these computations on the future huge datasets without using this
framework.

 <dc:title>Linking Makinson and Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor preferential entailments</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  About ten years ago, various notions of preferential entailment have been
introduced. The main reference is a paper by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (KLM),
one of the main competitor being a more general version defined by Makinson
(MAK). These two versions have already been compared, but it is time to revisit
these comparisons. Here are our three main results: (1) These two notions are
equivalent, provided that we restrict our attention, as done in KLM, to the
cases where the entailment respects logical equivalence (on the left and on the
right). (2) A serious simplification of the description of the fundamental
cases in which MAK is equivalent to KLM, including a natural passage in both
ways. (3) The two previous results are given for preferential entailments more
general than considered in some of the original texts, but they apply also to
the original definitions and, for this particular case also, the models can be
simplified.

 <dc:description>  Diff is a software program that detects differences between two data sets and
is useful in natural language processing. This paper shows several examples of
the application of diff. They include the detection of differences between two
different datasets, extraction of rewriting rules, merging of two different
datasets, and the optimal matching of two different data sets. Since diff comes
with any standard UNIX system, it is readily available and very easy to use.
Our studies showed that diff is a practical tool for research into natural
language processing.

 <dc:description>  A novel algorithm for performing parallel, distributed computer simulations

carefully constructed ICMP packets which enable the required computations to be
completed as part of the standard IP communication protocol. After providing a
detailed description of the algorithm, experimental applications in the areas
of stochastic neural networks and deterministic cellular automata are
discussed. As an example of the algorithms potential power, a simulation of a
deterministic cellular automaton involving 10^5 Internet connected devices was
performed.

 <dc:description>  Currently statistical and artificial neural network methods dominate in
financial data mining. Alternative relational (symbolic) data mining methods
have shown their effectiveness in robotics, drug design and other applications.
Traditionally symbolic methods prevail in the areas with significant
non-numeric (symbolic) knowledge, such as relative location in robot
navigation. At first glance, stock market forecast looks as a pure numeric area
irrelevant to symbolic methods. One of our major goals is to show that
financial time series can benefit significantly from relational data mining
based on symbolic methods. The paper overviews relational data mining
methodology and develops this techniques for financial data mining.

 <dc:description>  Evaluation of Internet protocols usually uses random scenarios or scenarios
based on designers' intuition. Such approach may be useful for average-case
analysis but does not cover boundary-point (worst or best-case) scenarios. To
synthesize boundary-point scenarios a more systematic approach is needed.In
this paper, we present a method for automatic synthesis of worst and best case
scenarios for protocol boundary-point evaluation.
  Our method uses a fault-oriented test generation (FOTG) algorithm for
searching the protocol and system state space to synthesize these scenarios.
The algorithm is based on a global finite state machine (FSM) model. We extend
the algorithm with timing semantics to handle end-to-end delays and address
performance criteria. We introduce the notion of a virtual LAN to represent
delays of the underlying multicast distribution tree. The algorithms used in
our method utilize implicit backward search using branch and bound techniques
and start from given target events. This aims to reduce the search complexity
drastically. As a case study, we use our method to evaluate variants of the
timer suppression mechanism, used in various multicast protocols, with respect
to two performance criteria: overhead of response messages and response time.
Simulation results for reliable multicast protocols show that our method
provides a scalable way for synthesizing worst-case scenarios automatically.
Results obtained using stress scenarios differ dramatically from those obtained
through average-case analyses. We hope for our method to serve as a model for
applying systematic scenario generation to other multicast protocols.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a novel architecture, CARD, for resource discovery
in large scale Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANets) which, may scale up to thousands
of nodes and may span wide geographical regions. Unlike previously proposed
schemes, our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding
as well as complex coordination between nodes to form a hierarchy. CARD is also
independent of any external source of information such as GPS. In our
architecture nodes within a limited number of hops from each node form the
neighborhood of that node. Resources within the neighborhood can be readily
accessed with the help of a proactive scheme within the neighborhood. For
accessing resources beyond the neighborhood, each node also maintains a few
distant nodes called contacts. Contacts help in creating a small world in the
network and provide an efficient way to query for resources beyond the
neighborhood. As the number of contacts of a node increases, the network view
(reachability) of the node increases. Paths to contacts are validated
periodically to adapt to mobility. We present mechanisms for contact selection
and maintenance that attempt to increase reachability while minimizing
overhead. Our simulation results show a clear trade-off between increase in
reachability on one hand, and contact selection and maintenance overhead on the
other. Our results suggest that CARD can be configured to provide a desirable
reachability distribution for different network sizes. Comparisons with other
schemes for resource discovery, such as flooding and bordercasting, show our
architecture to be much more efficient and scalable.

 <dc:description>  One of the most important metrics in the design of IP mobility protocols is
the handover performance. The current Mobile IP (MIP) standard has been shown
to exhibit poor handover performance. Most other work attempts to modify MIP to
slightly improve its efficiency, while others propose complex techniques to
replace MIP. Rather than taking these approaches, we instead propose a new
architecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to
co-exist and inter-operate with other technologies. Specifically, we propose an
intra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is
assigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain. Efficient
handover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms. Two
approaches are proposed and contrasted. The first introduces the concept
proxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the
multicast address of visiting mobiles. We show that the algorithmic mapping
approach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms
to support it. Network simulation (using NS-2) is used to evaluate our scheme
and compare it to other routing-based micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII.
The proactive handover results show that both M&amp;M and CIP shows low handoff
delay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII. The reason for M&amp;M's
comparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover.
The M&amp;M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails.
We also provide a handover algorithm leveraging the proactive path setup
capability of M&amp;M, which is expected to outperform CIP in case of reactive
handover.

 <dc:description>  Memory consistency models have been developed to specify what values may be
returned by a read given that, in a distributed system, memory operations may
only be partially ordered. Before this work, consistency models were defined
independently. Each model followed a set of rules which was separate from the
rules of every other model. In our work we have defined a set of four
consistency properties. Any subset of the four properties yields a set of rules
which constitute a consistency model. Every consistency model previously
described in the literature can be defined based on our four properties.
Therefore, we present these properties as a unfied theory of shared memory
consistency.

 <dc:description>  SPKI/SDSI is a proposed public key infrastructure standard that incorporates
the SDSI public key infrastructure. SDSI's key innovation was the use of local
names. We previously introduced a Logic of Local Name Containment that has a
clear semantics and was shown to completely characterize SDSI name resolution.
Here we show how our earlier approach can be extended to deal with a number of
key features of SPKI, including revocation, expiry dates, and tuple reduction.
We show that these extensions add relatively little complexity to the logic. In
particular, we do not need a nonmonotonic logic to capture revocation. We then
use our semantics to examine SPKI's tuple reduction rules. Our analysis
highlights places where SPKI's informal description of tuple reduction is
somewhat vague, and shows that extra reduction rules are necessary in order to
capture general information about binding and authorization.

 <dc:description>  Oz is a multiparadigm language that supports logic programming as one of its
major paradigms. A multiparadigm language is designed to support different
programming paradigms (logic, functional, constraint, object-oriented,
sequential, concurrent, etc.) with equal ease. This article has two goals: to
give a tutorial of logic programming in Oz and to show how logic programming
fits naturally into the wider context of multiparadigm programming. Our
experience shows that there are two classes of problems, which we call
algorithmic and search problems, for which logic programming can help formulate
practical solutions. Algorithmic problems have known efficient algorithms.
Search problems do not have known efficient algorithms but can be solved with
search. The Oz support for logic programming targets these two problem classes
specifically, using the concepts needed for each. This is in contrast to the
Prolog approach, which targets both classes with one set of concepts, which
results in less than optimal support for each class. To explain the essential
difference between algorithmic and search programs, we define the Oz execution
model. This model subsumes both concurrent logic programming
(committed-choice-style) and search-based logic programming (Prolog-style).
Instead of Horn clause syntax, Oz has a simple, fully compositional,
higher-order syntax that accommodates the abilities of the language. We
conclude with lessons learned from this work, a brief history of Oz, and many
entry points into the Oz literature.

 <dc:title>A direct time-domain FEM modeling of broadband frequency-dependent

 <dc:description>  The frequency-dependent attenuation of broadband acoustics is often
confronted in many different areas. However, the related time domain simulation
is rarely found in literature due to enormous technical difficulty. The
currently popular relaxation models with the presence of convolution operation
require some material parameters which are not readily available. In this
study, three reports are contributed to address broadband ultrasound
frequency-dependent absorptions using the readily available empirical
parameters. This report is the first in series concerned with developing a
direct time domain FEM formulation. The next two reports are about the
frequency decomposition model and the fractional derivative model.

 <dc:title>Parameterized Type Definitions in Mathematica: Methods and Advantages</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Andreica, Alina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.1.4, I.1.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The theme of symbolic computation in algebraic categories has become of
utmost importance in the last decade since it enables the automatic modeling of
modern algebra theories. On this theoretical background, the present paper
reveals the utility of the parameterized categorical approach by deriving a
multivariate polynomial category (over various coefficient domains), which is
used by our Mathematica implementation of Buchberger's algorithms for
determining the Groebner basis. These implementations are designed according to
domain and category parameterization principles underlining their advantages:
operation protection, inheritance, generality, easy extendibility. In
particular, such an extension of Mathematica, a widely used symbolic
computation system, with a new type system has a certain practical importance.
The approach we propose for Mathematica is inspired from D. Gruntz and M.
Monagan's work in Gauss, for Maple.

 <dc:description>  We provide a denotational semantics for first-order logic that captures the
two-level view of the computation process typical for constraint programming.
At one level we have the usual program execution. At the other level an
automatic maintenance of the constraint store takes place. We prove that the
resulting semantics is sound with respect to the truth definition. By
instantiating it by specific forms of constraint management policies we obtain
several sound evaluation policies of first-order formulas. This semantics can
also be used a basis for sound implementation of constraint maintenance in
presence of block declarations and conditionals.

 <dc:description>  Sound and complete axiomatizations are provided for a number of different
logics involving modalities for knowledge and time. These logics arise from
different choices for various parameters. All the logics considered involve the
discrete time linear temporal logic operators `next' and `until' and an
operator for the knowledge of each of a number of agents. Both the single agent
and multiple agent cases are studied: in some instances of the latter there is
also an operator for the common knowledge of the group of all agents. Four
different semantic properties of agents are considered: whether they have a
unique initial state, whether they operate synchronously, whether they have
perfect recall, and whether they learn. The property of no learning is
essentially dual to perfect recall. Not all settings of these parameters lead
to recursively axiomatizable logics, but sound and complete axiomatizations are
presented for all the ones that do.

 <dc:description>  We propose new definitions of (causal) explanation, using structural

actual cause, as defined and motivated in a companion paper. Essentially, an
explanation is a fact that is not known for certain but, if found to be true,
would constitute an actual cause of the fact to be explained, regardless of the
agent's initial uncertainty. We show that the definition handles well a number
of problematic examples from the literature.

 <dc:description>  This article studies the problem of assessing relevance to each of the rules
of a reference resolution system. The reference solver described here stems
from a formal model of reference and is integrated in a reference processing
workbench. Evaluation of the reference resolution is essential, as it enables
differential evaluation of individual rules. Numerical values of these measures
are given, and discussed, for simple selection rules and other processing
rules; such measures are then studied for numerical parameters.

 <dc:description>  Reference resolution on extended texts (several thousand references) cannot
be evaluated manually. An evaluation algorithm has been proposed for the MUC
tests, using equivalence classes for the coreference relation. However, we show
here that this algorithm is too indulgent, yielding good scores even for poor
resolution strategies. We elaborate on the same formalism to propose two new
evaluation algorithms, comparing them first with the MUC algorithm and giving
then results on a variety of examples. A third algorithm using only
distributional comparison of equivalence classes is finally described; it
assesses the relative importance of the recall vs. precision errors.

 <dc:description>  Anaphora resolution is envisaged in this paper as part of the reference
resolution process. A general open architecture is proposed, which can be
particularized and configured in order to simulate some classic anaphora
resolution methods. With the aim of improving pronoun resolution, the system
takes advantage of elementary cues about characters of the text, which are
represented through a particular data structure. In its most robust
configuration, the system uses only a general lexicon, a local morpho-syntactic
parser and a dictionary of synonyms. A short comparative corpus analysis shows
that narrative texts are the most suitable for testing such a system.

 <dc:description>  A model for reference use in communication is proposed, from a
representationist point of view. Both the sender and the receiver of a message
handle representations of their common environment, including mental
representations of objects. Reference resolution by a computer is viewed as the
construction of object representations using referring expressions from the
discourse, whereas often only coreference links between such expressions are
looked for. Differences between these two approaches are discussed. The model
has been implemented with elementary rules, and tested on complex narrative
texts (hundreds to thousands of referring expressions). The results support the
mental representations paradigm.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a statistical framework for assessing wireless systems
performance using hierarchical data mining techniques. We consider WCDMA
(wideband code division multiple access) systems with two-branch STTD (space
time transmit diversity) and 1/2 rate convolutional coding (forward error
correction codes). Monte Carlo simulation estimates the bit error probability
(BEP) of the system across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). A
performance database of simulation runs is collected over a targeted space of
system configurations. This database is then mined to obtain regions of the
configuration space that exhibit acceptable average performance. The shape of
the mined regions illustrates the joint influence of configuration parameters
on system performance. The role of data mining in this application is to
provide explainable and statistically valid design conclusions. The research
issue is to define statistically meaningful aggregation of data in a manner
that permits efficient and effective data mining algorithms. We achieve a good
compromise between these goals and help establish the applicability of data
mining for characterizing wireless systems performance.

 <dc:description>  Achieving secure communications in networks has been one of the most
important problems in information technology. Dolev, Dwork, Waarts, and Yung
have studied secure message transmission in one-way or two-way channels. They
only consider the case when all channels are two-way or all channels are
one-way. Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Linial, Franklin and Yung, Franklin and
Wright, and Wang and Desmedt have studied secure communication and secure
computation in multi-recipient (multicast) models. In a ``multicast channel''
(such as Ethernet), one processor can send the same message--simultaneously and
privately--to a fixed subset of processors. In this paper, we shall study
necessary and sufficient conditions for achieving secure communications against
active adversaries in mixed one-way and two-way channels. We also discuss
multicast channels and neighbor network channels.

concurrent constraint programs. The logic is based on modalities which allow
one to specify what a process produces as a reaction to what its environment
inputs. These modalities provide an assumption/commitment style of
specification which allows a sound and complete compositional axiomatization of
the reactive behavior of timed concurrent constraint programs.

 <dc:description>  Supergales, generalizations of supermartingales, have been used by Lutz
(2002) to define the constructive dimensions of individual binary sequences.
Here it is shown that gales, the corresponding generalizations of martingales,
can be equivalently used to define constructive dimension.

The data are routine test such as urine test, hematology, chemistries etc.
Though those tests have been done for people who check in medical institutes,
how each item of the data interacts each other and which combination of them
cause a disease are neither understood nor studied well. Here we attack the
practically important problem by putting the data into mathematical setup and
applying support vector machine. Finally we present simulation results for
fatty liver, gastritis etc and discuss about their implications.

 <dc:title>A Chart-Parsing Algorithm for Efficient Semantic Analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In some contexts, well-formed natural language cannot be expected as input to
information or communication systems. In these contexts, the use of
grammar-independent input (sequences of uninflected semantic units like e.g.
language-independent icons) can be an answer to the users' needs. A semantic
analysis can be performed, based on lexical semantic knowledge: it is
equivalent to a dependency analysis with no syntactic or morphological clues.
However, this requires that an intelligent system should be able to interpret
this input with reasonable accuracy and in reasonable time. Here we propose a
method allowing a purely semantic-based analysis of sequences of semantic
units. It uses an algorithm inspired by the idea of ``chart parsing'' known in
Natural Language Processing, which stores intermediate parsing results in order
to bring the calculation time down. In comparison with using declarative logic
programming - where the calculation time, left to a prolog engine, is
hyperexponential -, this method brings the calculation time down to a
polynomial time, where the order depends on the valency of the predicates.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we discuss the utility and deficiencies of existing ontology
resources for a number of language processing applications. We describe a
technique for increasing the semantic type coverage of a specific ontology, the
National Library of Medicine's UMLS, with the use of robust finite state
methods used in conjunction with large-scale corpus analytics of the domain
corpus. We call this technique &quot;semantic rerendering&quot; of the ontology. This
research has been done in the context of Medstract, a joint Brandeis-Tufts
effort aimed at developing tools for analyzing biomedical language (i.e.,
Medline), as well as creating targeted databases of bio-entities, biological
relations, and pathway data for biological researchers. Motivating the current
research is the need to have robust and reliable semantic typing of syntactic
elements in the Medline corpus, in order to improve the overall performance of
the information extraction applications mentioned above.

 <dc:description>  We analyzed the non-Gaussian nature of network traffic using some Internet
traffic data. We found that (1) the non-Gaussian nature degrades network
performance, (2) it is caused by `greedy flows' that exist with non-negligible
probability, and (3) a large majority of `greedy flows' are TCP flows having
relatively small hop counts, which correspond to small round-trip times. We
conclude that in a network hat has greedy flows with non-negligible
probability, a traffic controlling scheme or bandwidth design that considers
non-Gaussian nature is essential.

 <dc:description>  Conventional optical networks are based on SONET rings, but since rings are
known to use bandwidth inefficiently, there has been much research into shared
mesh protection, which promises significant bandwidth savings. Unfortunately,
most shared mesh protection schemes cannot guarantee that failed traffic will
be restored within the 50 ms timeframe that SONET standards specify. A notable
exception is the p-cycle scheme of Grover and Stamatelakis. We argue, however,
that p-cycles have certain limitations, e.g., there is no easy way to adapt
p-cycles to a path-based protection scheme, and p-cycles seem more suited to
static traffic than to dynamic traffic. In this paper we show that the key to
fast restoration times is not a ring-like topology per se, but rather the
ability to pre-cross-connect protection paths. This leads to the concept of a
pre-cross-connected trail or PXT, which is a structure that is more flexible
than rings and that adapts readily to both path-based and link-based schemes
and to both static and dynamic traffic. The PXT protection scheme achieves fast
restoration speeds, and our simulations, which have been carefully chosen using
ideas from experimental design theory, show that the bandwidth efficiency of
the PXT protection scheme is comparable to that of conventional shared mesh
protection schemes.

 <dc:description>  Groenendijk and Stokhof (1984, 1996; Groenendijk 1999) provide a logically
attractive theory of the semantics of natural language questions, commonly
referred to as the partition theory. Two central notions in this theory are
entailment between questions and answerhood. For example, the question &quot;Who is
going to the party?&quot; entails the question &quot;Is John going to the party?&quot;, and
&quot;John is going to the party&quot; counts as an answer to both. Groenendijk and
Stokhof define these two notions in terms of partitions of a set of possible
worlds.
  We provide a syntactic characterization of entailment between questions and
answerhood . We show that answers are, in some sense, exactly those formulas
that are built up from instances of the question. This result lets us compare
the partition theory with other approaches to interrogation -- both linguistic
analyses, such as Hamblin's and Karttunen's semantics, and computational
systems, such as Prolog. Our comparison separates a notion of answerhood into
three aspects: equivalence (when two questions or answers are interchangeable),
atomic answers (what instances of a question count as answers), and compound
answers (how answers compose).

 <dc:description>  We implement Groenendijk and Stokhof's partition semantics of questions in a
simple question answering algorithm. The algorithm is sound, complete, and
based on tableau theorem proving. The algorithm relies on a syntactic
characterization of answerhood: Any answer to a question is equivalent to some
formula built up only from instances of the question. We prove this
characterization by translating the logic of interrogation to classical
predicate logic and applying Craig's interpolation theorem.

 <dc:description>  Many ad hoc routing protocols are based on some variant of flooding. Despite
various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We
propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with
some probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols. Gossiping
exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions,
the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the
remaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message. The
fraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the
gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have
considered, using gossiping probability between 0.6 and 0.8 suffices to ensure
that almost every node gets the message in almost every execution. For large
networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than
flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with
various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show
that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement,
even in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should
be even more significant in larger networks.

 <dc:description>  The topology of a wireless multi-hop network can be controlled by varying the
transmission power at each node. In this paper, we give a detailed analysis of
a cone-based distributed topology control algorithm. This algorithm, introduced
in [16], does not assume that nodes have GPS information available; rather it
depends only on directional information. Roughly speaking, the basic idea of
the algorithm is that a node $u$ transmits with the minimum power
$p_{u,\alpha}$ required to ensure that in every cone of degree $\alpha$ around
$u$, there is some node that $u$ can reach with power $p_{u,\alpha}$. We show
that taking $\alpha = 5\pi/6$ is a necessary and sufficient condition to
guarantee that network connectivity is preserved. More precisely, if there is a
path from $s$ to $t$ when every node communicates at maximum power, then, if
$\alpha &lt;= 5\pi/6$, there is still a path in the smallest symmetric graph
$G_\alpha$ containing all edges $(u,v)$ such that $u$ can communicate with $v$
using power $p_{u,\alpha}$. On the other hand, if $\alpha &gt; 5\pi/6$,
connectivity is not necessarily preserved. We also propose a set of
optimizations that further reduce power consumption and prove that they retain
network connectivity. Dynamic reconfiguration in the presence of failures and
mobility is also discussed. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm and the optimizations.

 <dc:title>Minimum-Energy Mobile Wireless Networks Revisited</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a protocol that, given a communication network, computes a
subnetwork such that, for every pair $(u,v)$ of nodes connected in the original
network, there is a minimum-energy path between $u$ and $v$ in the subnetwork
(where a minimum-energy path is one that allows messages to be transmitted with
a minimum use of energy). The network computed by our protocol is in general a
subnetwork of the one computed by the protocol given in [13]. Moreover, our
protocol is computationally simpler. We demonstrate the performance
improvements obtained by using the subnetwork computed by our protocol through
simulation.

 <dc:description>  The famous Fischer, Lynch, and Paterson impossibility proof shows that it is
impossible to solve the consensus problem in a natural model of an asynchronous
distributed system if even a single process can fail. Since its publication,
two decades of work on fault-tolerant asynchronous consensus algorithms have
evaded this impossibility result by using extended models that provide (a)
randomization, (b) additional timing assumptions, (c) failure detectors, or (d)
stronger synchronization mechanisms than are available in the basic model.
Concentrating on the first of these approaches, we illustrate the history and
structure of randomized asynchronous consensus protocols by giving detailed
descriptions of several such protocols.

 <dc:description>  Stephen Cook posited SAT is NP-Complete in 1971. If SAT is NP-Complete then,
as is generally accepted, any polynomial solution of it must also present a
polynomial solution of all NP decision problems. It is here argued, however,
that NP is not of necessity equivalent to P where it is shown that SAT is
contained in P. This due to a paradox, of nature addressed by both Godel and
Russell, in regards to the P-NP system in total.

 <dc:description>  A fork stack is a generalised stack which allows pushes and pops of several
items at a time. We consider the problem of determining which input streams can
be sorted using a single forkstack, or dually, which permutations of a fixed
input stream can be produced using a single forkstack. An algorithm is given to
solve the sorting problem and the minimal unsortable sequences are found. The
results are extended to fork stacks where there are bounds on how many items
can be pushed and popped at one time. In this context we also establish how to
enumerate the collection of sortable sequences.

 <dc:description>  Recently, several approaches to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended
logic programs have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate
(sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods
which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. In
this paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge
bases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an
update policy. We first describe a formal model which captures various update
approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of
evolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational
properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states
with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds
on a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary
characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances,
which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. In more detail, we
characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of
evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space
complexity.

 <dc:description>  It is noted that the standard definition of the fractional Laplacian leads to
a hyper-singular convolution integral and is also obscure about how to
implement the boundary conditions. This purpose of this note is to introduce a
new definition of the fractional Laplacian to overcome these major drawbacks.

 <dc:description>  Context and context-awareness provides computing environments with the
ability to usefully adapt the services or information they provide. It is the
ability to implicitly sense and automatically derive the user needs that
separates context-aware applications from traditionally designed applications,
and this makes them more attentive, responsive, and aware of their user's
identity, and their user's environment. This paper argues that context-aware
applications capable of supporting complex, cognitive activities can be built
from a model of context called Activity-Centric Context. A conceptual model of
Activity-Centric context is presented. The model is illustrated via a detailed
example.

 <dc:title>A Comparison of Different Cognitive Paradigms Using Simple Animats in a
  Virtual Laboratory, with Implications to the Notion of Cognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gershenson, Carlos</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this thesis I present a virtual laboratory which implements five different
models for controlling animats: a rule-based system, a behaviour-based system,
a concept-based system, a neural network, and a Braitenberg architecture.
Through different experiments, I compare the performance of the models and
conclude that there is no &quot;best&quot; model, since different models are better for
different things in different contexts.
  The models I chose, although quite simple, represent different approaches for
studying cognition. Using the results as an empirical philosophical aid,
  I note that there is no &quot;best&quot; approach for studying cognition, since
different approaches have all advantages and disadvantages, because they study
different aspects of cognition from different contexts. This has implications
for current debates on &quot;proper&quot; approaches for cognition: all approaches are a
bit proper, but none will be &quot;proper enough&quot;. I draw remarks on the notion of
cognition abstracting from all the approaches used to study it, and propose a
simple classification for different types of cognition.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of load-balancing the demand for content in a
peer-to-peer network across heterogeneous peer nodes that hold replicas of the
content. Previous decentralized load balancing techniques in distributed
systems base their decisions on periodic updates containing information about
load or available capacity observed at the serving entities. We show that these
techniques do not work well in the peer-to-peer context; either they do not
address peer node heterogeneity, or they suffer from significant load
oscillations. We propose a new decentralized algorithm, Max-Cap, based on the
maximum inherent capacities of the replica nodes and show that unlike previous
algorithms, it is not tied to the timeliness or frequency of updates. Yet,
Max-Cap can handle the heterogeneity of a peer-to-peer environment without
suffering from load oscillations.

 <dc:title>A universal alphabet and rewrite system</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present two ways in which an infinite universal alphabet may be generated
using a novel rewrite system that conserves zero (a special character of the
alphabet and the symbol for that character) at every step. The recursive method
delivers the entire alphabet in one step when invoked with the zero character
as the initial subset alphabet. The iterative method with the same start
delivers characters that act as ciphers for properties that the developing
subset alphabet contains. These properties emerge in an arbitrary sequence and
there are an infinite number of ways they may be selected. The subset alphabets
in addition to having mathematical interpretation as algebra can also be
constrained to emerge in a minimal way which then has application as a
foundational physical system. Each subset alphabet may itself be the basis of a
rewrite system where rules that operate on symbols (representing characters) or
collections of symbols manipulate the specific properties in a dynamic way.

 <dc:description>  Despite recent excitement generated by the peer-to-peer (P2P) paradigm and
the surprisingly rapid deployment of some P2P applications, there are few
quantitative evaluations of P2P systems behavior. The open architecture,
achieved scale, and self-organizing structure of the Gnutella network make it
an interesting P2P architecture to study. Like most other P2P applications,
Gnutella builds, at the application level, a virtual network with its own
routing mechanisms. The topology of this virtual network and the routing
mechanisms used have a significant influence on application properties such as
performance, reliability, and scalability. We have built a &quot;crawler&quot; to extract
the topology of Gnutella's application level network. In this paper we analyze
the topology graph and evaluate generated network traffic. Our two major
findings are that: (1) although Gnutella is not a pure power-law network, its
current configuration has the benefits and drawbacks of a power-law structure,
and (2) the Gnutella virtual network topology does not match well the
underlying Internet topology, hence leading to ineffective use of the physical
networking infrastructure. These findings guide us to propose changes to the
Gnutella protocol and implementations that may bring significant performance
and scalability improvements. We believe that our findings as well as our
measurement and analysis techniques have broad applicability to P2P systems and
provide unique insights into P2P system design tradeoffs.

mathematical relations involving the number of processors and the dimension of
the treated problem, and with these conditions I define, on the ground of the
reachable speedup, some classes of parallelism for the implementations. I also
derive a condition for obtaining superlinear speedup. The used mathematical
technics are those of differential calculus. I describe some examples from
classical problems offered by the specialized literature on the subject.

 <dc:description>  A recently introduced general-purpose heuristic for finding high-quality
solutions for many hard optimization problems is reviewed. The method is
inspired by recent progress in understanding far-from-equilibrium phenomena in
terms of {\em self-organized criticality,} a concept introduced to describe
emergent complexity in physical systems. This method, called {\em extremal
optimization,} successively replaces the value of extremely undesirable
variables in a sub-optimal solution with new, random ones. Large,
avalanche-like fluctuations in the cost function self-organize from this
dynamics, effectively scaling barriers to explore local optima in distant
neighborhoods of the configuration space while eliminating the need to tune
parameters. Drawing upon models used to simulate the dynamics of granular
media, evolution, or geology, extremal optimization complements approximation
methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as {\em simulated
annealing}. It may be but one example of applying new insights into {\em
non-equilibrium phenomena} systematically to hard optimization problems. This
method is widely applicable and so far has proved competitive with -- and even
superior to -- more elaborate general-purpose heuristics on testbeds of
constrained optimization problems with up to $10^5$ variables, such as
bipartitioning, coloring, and satisfiability. Analysis of a suitable model
predicts the only free parameter of the method in accordance with all
experimental results.

 <dc:description>  Data-sharing scientific collaborations have particular characteristics,
potentially different from the current peer-to-peer environments. In this paper
we advocate the benefits of exploiting emergent patterns in self-configuring
networks specialized for scientific data-sharing collaborations. We speculate
that a peer-to-peer scientific collaboration network will exhibit small-world
topology, as do a large number of social networks for which the same pattern
has been documented. We propose a solution for locating data in decentralized,
scientific, data-sharing environments that exploits the small-worlds topology.
The research challenge we raise is: what protocols should be used to allow a
self-configuring peer-to-peer network to form small worlds similar to the way
in which the humans that use the network do in their social interactions?

 <dc:description>  DPLL and resolution are two popular methods for solving the problem of
propositional satisfiability. Rather than algorithms, they are families of
algorithms, as their behavior depend on some choices they face during
execution: DPLL depends on the choice of the literal to branch on; resolution
depends on the choice of the pair of clauses to resolve at each step. The
complexity of making the optimal choice is analyzed in this paper. Extending
previous results, we prove that choosing the optimal literal to branch on in
DPLL is Delta[log]^2-hard, and becomes NP^PP-hard if branching is only allowed
on a subset of variables. Optimal choice in regular resolution is both NP-hard
and CoNP-hard. The problem of determining the size of the optimal proofs is
also analyzed: it is CoNP-hard for DPLL, and Delta[log]^2-hard if a conjecture
we make is true. This problem is CoNP-hard for regular resolution.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of computing a preemptive schedule of equal-length jobs
with given release times, deadlines and weights. Our goal is to maximize the
weighted throughput, which is the total weight of completed jobs. In Graham's
notation this problem is described as (1 | r_j;p_j=p;pmtn | sum w_j U_j). We
provide an O(n^4)-time algorithm for this problem, improving the previous bound
of O(n^{10}) by Baptiste.

 <dc:description>  We study algorithmic aspects of bending wires and sheet metal into a
specified structure. Problems of this type are closely related to the question
of deciding whether a simple non-self-intersecting wire structure (a
carpenter's ruler) can be straightened, a problem that was open for several
years and has only recently been solved in the affirmative.
  If we impose some of the constraints that are imposed by the manufacturing
process, we obtain quite different results. In particular, we study the variant
of the carpenter's ruler problem in which there is a restriction that only one
joint can be modified at a time. For a linkage that does not self-intersect or
self-touch, the recent results of Connelly et al. and Streinu imply that it can
always be straightened, modifying one joint at a time. However, we show that
for a linkage with even a single vertex degeneracy, it becomes NP-hard to
decide if it can be straightened while altering only one joint at a time. If we
add the restriction that each joint can be altered at most once, we show that
the problem is NP-complete even without vertex degeneracies.
  In the special case, arising in wire forming manufacturing, that each joint
can be altered at most once, and must be done sequentially from one or both
ends of the linkage, we give an efficient algorithm to determine if a linkage
can be straightened.

 <dc:title>GridBank: A Grid Accounting Services Architecture (GASA) for Distributed

 <dc:description>  Computational Grids are emerging as new infrastructure for Internet-based
parallel and distributed computing. They enable the sharing, exchange,
discovery, and aggregation of resources distributed across multiple
administrative domains, organizations and enterprises. To accomplish this,
Grids need infrastructure that supports various services: security, uniform
access, resource management, scheduling, application composition, computational
economy, and accountability. Many Grid projects have developed technologies
that provide many of these services with an exception of accountability. To
overcome this limitation, we propose a new infrastructure called Grid Bank that
provides services for accounting. This paper presents requirements of Grid
accountability and different models within which it can operate and proposes
Grid Bank Services Architecture that meets them. The paper highlights
implementation issues with detailed discussion on format for various
records/database that the GridBank need to maintain. It also presents protocols
for interaction between GridBank and various components within Grid computing
environments.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new measure for planar point sets S that captures a
combinatorial distance that S is from being a convex set: The reflexivity
rho(S) of S is given by the smallest number of reflex vertices in a simple
polygonalization of S. We prove various combinatorial bounds and provide
efficient algorithms to compute reflexivity, both exactly (in special cases)
and approximately (in general). Our study considers also some closely related
quantities, such as the convex cover number kappa_c(S) of a planar point set,
which is the smallest number of convex chains that cover S, and the convex
partition number kappa_p(S), which is given by the smallest number of convex
chains with pairwise-disjoint convex hulls that cover S. We have proved that it
is NP-complete to determine the convex cover or the convex partition number and
have given logarithmic-approximation algorithms for determining each.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the revision of partially ordered beliefs. It proposes
a semantic representation of epistemic states by partial pre-orders on
interpretations and a syntactic representation by partially ordered belief
bases. Two revision operations, the revision stemming from the history of
observations and the possibilistic revision, defined when the epistemic state
is represented by a total pre-order, are generalized, at a semantic level, to
the case of a partial pre-order on interpretations, and at a syntactic level,
to the case of a partially ordered belief base. The equivalence between the two
representations is shown for the two revision operations.

 <dc:description>  In mathematical modeling of the non-squared frequency-dependent diffusions,
also known as the anomalous diffusions, it is desirable to have a positive real
Fourier transform for the time derivative of arbitrary fractional or odd
integer order. The Fourier transform of the fractional time derivative in the
Riemann-Liouville and Caputo senses, however, involves a complex power function
of the fractional order. In this study, a positive time derivative of
fractional or odd integer order is introduced to respect the positivity in
modeling the anomalous diffusions.

 <dc:description>  We introduce exponential search trees as a novel technique for converting
static polynomial space search structures for ordered sets into fully-dynamic
linear space data structures.
  This leads to an optimal bound of O(sqrt(log n/loglog n)) for searching and
updating a dynamic set of n integer keys in linear space. Here searching an
integer y means finding the maximum key in the set which is smaller than or
equal to y. This problem is equivalent to the standard text book problem of
maintaining an ordered set (see, e.g., Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein:
Introduction to Algorithms, 2nd ed., MIT Press, 2001).
  The best previous deterministic linear space bound was O(log n/loglog n) due
Fredman and Willard from STOC 1990. No better deterministic search bound was
known using polynomial space.
  We also get the following worst-case linear space trade-offs between the
number n, the word length w, and the maximal key U &lt; 2^w: O(min{loglog n+log
n/log w, (loglog n)(loglog U)/(logloglog U)}). These trade-offs are, however,
not likely to be optimal.
  Our results are generalized to finger searching and string searching,
providing optimal results for both in terms of n.

 <dc:description>  Abduction is one of the most important forms of reasoning; it has been
successfully applied to several practical problems such as diagnosis. In this
paper we investigate whether the computational complexity of abduction can be
reduced by an appropriate use of preprocessing. This is motivated by the fact
that part of the data of the problem (namely, the set of all possible
assumptions and the theory relating assumptions and manifestations) are often
known before the rest of the problem. In this paper, we show some complexity
results about abduction when compilation is allowed.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies complexity of recognition of classes of bounded
configurations by a generalization of conventional cellular automata (CA) --
finite dynamic cellular automata (FDCA). Inspired by the CA-based models of
biological and computer vision, this study attempts to derive the properties of
a complexity measure and of the classes of input configurations that make it
beneficial to realize the recognition via a two-layered automaton as compared
to a one-layered automaton. A formalized model of an image pattern recognition
task is utilized to demonstrate that the derived conditions can be satisfied
for a non-empty set of practical problems.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new and easily-realizable distributed hash table (DHT)
peer-to-peer structure, incorporating a random caching strategy that allows for
{\em polylogarithmic search time} while having only a {\em constant cache}
size. We also show that a very large class of deterministic caching strategies,
which covers almost all previously proposed DHT systems, can not achieve
polylog search time with constant cache size. In general, the new scheme is the
first known DHT structure with the following highly-desired properties: (a)
Random caching strategy with constant cache size; (b) Average search time of
$O(log^{2}(N))$; (c) Guaranteed search time of $O(log^{3}(N))$; (d) Truly local
cache dynamics with constant overhead for node deletions and additions; (e)
Self-organization from any initial network state towards the desired structure;
and (f) Allows a seamless means for various trade-offs, e.g., search speed or
anonymity at the expense of larger cache size.

 <dc:description>  As is well known, Buss' theory of bounded arithmetic $S^{1}_{2}$ proves
$\Sigma_{0}^{b}(\Sigma_{1}^{b})-LIND$; however, we show that Allen's
$D_{2}^{1}$ does not prove $\Sigma_{0}^{b}(\Sigma_{1}^{b})-LLIND$ unless $P =
NC$. We also give some interesting alternative axiomatisations of $S^{1}_{2}$.

 <dc:title>Selection of future events from a time series in relation to estimations

 <dc:description>  A new general procedure for a priori selection of more predictable events
from a time series of observed variable is proposed. The procedure is
applicable to time series which contains different types of events that feature
significantly different predictability, or, in other words, to heteroskedastic
time series. A priori selection of future events in accordance to expected
uncertainty of their forecasts may be helpful for making practical decisions.
The procedure first implies creation of two neural network based forecasting
models, one of which is aimed at prediction of conditional mean and other -
conditional dispersion, and then elaboration of the rule for future event
selection into groups of more and less predictable events. The method is
demonstrated and tested by the example of the computer generated time series,
and then applied to the real world time series, Dow Jones Industrial Average
index.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the deterministic on-line
{\em Sum of Squares} algorithm ($SS$) for bin packing introduced and studied
experimentally in \cite{CJK99}, along with several new variants. $SS$ is
applicable to any instance of bin packing in which the bin capacity $B$ and
item sizes $s(a)$ are integral (or can be scaled to be so), and runs in time
$O(nB)$. It performs remarkably well from an average case point of view: For
any discrete distribution in which the optimal expected waste is sublinear,
$SS$ also has sublinear expected waste. For any discrete distribution where the
optimal expected waste is bounded, $SS$ has expected waste at most $O(\log n)$.
In addition, we discuss several interesting variants on $SS$, including a
randomized $O(nB\log B)$-time on-line algorithm $SS^*$, based on $SS$, whose
expected behavior is essentially optimal for all discrete distributions.
Algorithm $SS^*$ also depends on a new linear-programming-based
pseudopolynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-hard problem of determining,
given a discrete distribution $F$, just what is the growth rate for the optimal
expected waste. This article is a greatly expanded version of the conference
paper \cite{sumsq2000}.

 <dc:description>  The Sonix is the main control software for the IBR-2 instruments. This is a
modular configurable and flexible system created using the Varman (real time
database) and the X11/OS9 graphical package in the OS-9 environment. In the
last few years we were mostly focused on making this system more reliable and
user friendly. Because the VME hardware and software upgrade is rather
expensive we would like to replace existing VME + OS9 control computers with
the PC+Windows XP ones in the future. This could be done with the help of
VME-PCI adapters.

 <dc:title>New Developments in Interval Arithmetic and Their Implications for
  Floating-Point Standardization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the prospect of a processor that can perform interval arithmetic
at the same speed as conventional floating-point arithmetic. This makes it
possible for all arithmetic to be performed with the superior security of
interval methods without any penalty in speed. In such a situation the IEEE
floating-point standard needs to be compared with a version of floating-point
arithmetic that is ideal for the purpose of interval arithmetic. Such a
comparison requires a succinct and complete exposition of interval arithmetic
according to its recent developments. We present such an exposition in this
paper. We conclude that the directed roundings toward the infinities and the
definition of division by the signed zeros are valuable features of the
standard. Because the operations of interval arithmetic are always defined,
exceptions do not arise. As a result neither Nans nor exceptions are needed. Of
the status flags, only the inexact flag may be useful. Denormalized numbers
seem to have no use for interval arithmetic; in the use of interval
constraints, they are a handicap.

 <dc:description>  Floor-planning is a fundamental step in VLSI chip design. Based upon the
concept of orderly spanning trees, we present a simple O(n)-time algorithm to
construct a floor-plan for any n-node plane triangulation. In comparison with
previous floor-planning algorithms in the literature, our solution is not only
simpler in the algorithm itself, but also produces floor-plans which require
fewer module types. An equally important aspect of our new algorithm lies in
its ability to fit the floor-plan area in a rectangle of size (n-1)x(2n+1)/3.
Lower bounds on the worst-case area for floor-planning any plane triangulation
are also provided in the paper.

 <dc:title>A New Interpretation of Amdahl's Law and Geometric Scalability</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The multiprocessor effect refers to the loss of computing cycles due to
processing overhead. Amdahl's law and the Multiprocessing Factor (MPF) are two
scaling models used in industry and academia for estimating multiprocessor
capacity in the presence of this multiprocessor effect. Both models express
different laws of diminishing returns. Amdahl's law identifies diminishing
processor capacity with a fixed degree of serialization in the workload, while
the MPF model treats it as a constant geometric ratio. The utility of both
models for performance evaluation stems from the presence of a single parameter
that can be determined easily from a small set of benchmark measurements. This
utility, however, is marred by a dilemma. The two models produce different
results, especially for large processor configurations that are so important
for today's applications. The question naturally arises: Which of these two
models is the correct one to use? Ignoring this question merely reduces
capacity prediction to arbitrary curve-fitting. Removing the dilemma requires a
dynamical interpretation of these scaling models. We present a physical
interpretation based on queueing theory and show that Amdahl's law corresponds
to synchronous queueing in a bus model while the MPF model belongs to a Coxian
server model. The latter exhibits unphysical effects such as sublinear response
times hence, we caution against its use for large multiprocessor
configurations.

 <dc:description>  New generations of neutron scattering sources and instrumentation are
providing challenges in data handling for user software. Time-of-Flight
instruments used at pulsed sources typically produce hundreds or thousands of
channels of data for each detector segment. New instruments are being designed
with thousands to hundreds of thousands of detector segments. High intensity
neutron sources make possible parametric studies and texture studies which
further increase data handling requirements. The Integrated Spectral Analysis
Workbench (ISAW) software developed at Argonne handles large numbers of spectra
simultaneously while providing operations to reduce, sort, combine and export
the data. It includes viewers to inspect the data in detail in real time. ISAW
uses existing software components and packages where feasible and takes
advantage of the excellent support for user interface design and network
communication in Java. The included scripting language simplifies repetitive
operations for analyzing many files related to a given experiment. Recent
additions to ISAW include a contour view, a time-slice table view, routines for
finding and fitting peaks in data, and support for data from other facilities
using the NeXus format. In this paper, I give an overview of features and
planned improvements of ISAW. Details of some of the improvements are covered
in other presentations at this conference.

 <dc:description>  People change the identifiers through which they are reachable online as they
change jobs or residences or Internet service providers. This kind of personal
mobility makes reaching people online error-prone. As people move, they do not
always know who or what has cached their now obsolete identifiers so as to
inform them of the move. Use of these old identifiers can cause delivery
failure of important messages, or worse, may cause delivery of messages to
unintended recipients. For example, a sensitive email message sent to my now
obsolete work address at a former place of employment may reach my unfriendly
former boss instead of me.
  In this paper we describe HINTS, a historic name-trail service. This service
provides a persistent way to name willing participants online using today's
transient online identifiers. HINTS accomplishes this by connecting together
the names a person uses along with the times during which those names were
valid for the person, thus giving people control over the historic use of their
names. A correspondent who wishes to reach a mobile person can use an obsolete
online name for that person, qualified with a time at which the online name was
successfully used; HINTS resolves this historic name to a current valid online
identifier for the intended recipient, if that recipient has chosen to leave a
name trail in HINTS.

 <dc:description>  In the popular computer game of Tetris, the player is given a sequence of
tetromino pieces and must pack them into a rectangular gameboard initially
occupied by a given configuration of filled squares; any completely filled row
of the gameboard is cleared and all pieces above it drop by one row. We prove
that in the offline version of Tetris, it is NP-complete to maximize the number
of cleared rows, maximize the number of tetrises (quadruples of rows
simultaneously filled and cleared), minimize the maximum height of an occupied
square, or maximize the number of pieces placed before the game ends. We
furthermore show the extreme inapproximability of the first and last of these
objectives to within a factor of p^(1-epsilon), when given a sequence of p
pieces, and the inapproximability of the third objective to within a factor of
(2 - epsilon), for any epsilon&gt;0. Our results hold under several variations on
the rules of Tetris, including different models of rotation, limitations on
player agility, and restricted piece sets.

 <dc:description>  The &quot;event&quot; concept appears repeatedly when developing metadata models for
the description and management of multimedia content. During the typical life
cycle of multimedia content, events occur at many different levels - from the
events which happen during content creation (directing, acting, camera panning
and zooming) to the events which happen to the physical form (acquisition,
relocation, damage of film or video) to the digital conversion, reformatting,
editing and repackaging events, to the events which are depicted in the actual
content (political, news, sporting) to the usage, ownership and copyright
agreement events and even the metadata attribution events. Support is required
within both MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 for the clear and unambiguous description of all
of these event types which may occur at widely different levels of nesting and
granularity. In this paper we first describe an event-aware model (the ABC
model) which is capable of modeling and yet clearly differentiating between all
of these, often recursive and overlapping events. We then illustrate how this
model can be used as the foundation to facilitate semantic interoperability
between MPEG-7 and MPEG-21. By expressing the semantics of both MPEG-7 and
MPEG-21 metadata terms in RDF Schema (and some DAML+OIL extensions) and
attaching the MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 class and property hierarchies to the
appropriate top-level classes and properties of the ABC model, we are
essentially able to define a single distributed machine-understandable
ontology, which will enable interoperability of data and services across the
entire multimedia content delivery chain.

characterizes the elementary recursive functions. Type quantification is
restricted to be non-interleaved and stratified, i.e., the types are assigned
levels, and a quantified variable can only be instantiated by a type of smaller
level, with a slightly liberalized treatment of the level zero.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in Multiagent Systems (MAS) and Epistemic Logic within
Distributed Systems Theory, have used various combinatorial structures that
model both the geometry of the systems and the Kripke model structure of models
for the logic. Examining one of the simpler versions of these models,
interpreted systems, and the related Kripke semantics of the logic $S5_n$ (an
epistemic logic with $n$-agents), the similarities with the geometric /
homotopy theoretic structure of groupoid atlases is striking. These latter
objects arise in problems within algebraic K-theory, an area of algebra linked
to the study of decomposition and normal form theorems in linear algebra. They
have a natural well structured notion of path and constructions of path
objects, etc., that yield a rich homotopy theory.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new class of scheduling problems in which the optimization is
performed by the worker (single ``machine'') who performs the tasks. A typical
worker's objective is to minimize the amount of work he does (he is ``lazy''),
or more generally, to schedule as inefficiently (in some sense) as possible.
The worker is subject to the constraint that he must be busy when there is work
that he can do; we make this notion precise both in the preemptive and
nonpreemptive settings. The resulting class of ``perverse'' scheduling
problems, which we denote ``Lazy Bureaucrat Problems,'' gives rise to a rich
set of new questions that explore the distinction between maximization and
minimization in computing optimal schedules.

 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm for discovering patterns in time series and other
sequential data. We exhibit a reliable procedure for building the minimal set
of hidden, Markovian states that is statistically capable of producing the
behavior exhibited in the data -- the underlying process's causal states.
Unlike conventional methods for fitting hidden Markov models (HMMs) to data,
our algorithm makes no assumptions about the process's causal architecture (the
number of hidden states and their transition structure), but rather infers it
from the data. It starts with assumptions of minimal structure and introduces
complexity only when the data demand it. Moreover, the causal states it infers
have important predictive optimality properties that conventional HMM states
lack. We introduce the algorithm, review the theory behind it, prove its
asymptotic reliability, use large deviation theory to estimate its rate of
convergence, and compare it to other algorithms which also construct HMMs from
data. We also illustrate its behavior on an example process, and report
selected numerical results from an implementation.

 <dc:description>  Web attacks, i.e. attacks exclusively using the HTTP protocol, are rapidly
becoming one of the fundamental threats for information systems connected to
the Internet. When the attacks suffered by web servers through the years are
analyzed, it is observed that most of them are very similar, using a reduced
number of attacking techniques. It is generally agreed that classification can
help designers and programmers to better understand attacks and build more
secure applications. As an effort in this direction, a new taxonomy of web
attacks is proposed in this paper, with the objective of obtaining a
practically useful reference framework for security applications. The use of
the taxonomy is illustrated by means of multiplatform real world web attack
examples. Along with this taxonomy, important features of each attack category
are discussed. A suitable semantic-dependent web attack encoding scheme is
defined that uses different-length vectors. Possible applications are
described, which might benefit from this taxonomy and encoding scheme, such as
intrusion detection systems and application firewalls.

 <dc:description>  Part of the theory of logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning concerns
the study of fixed-point semantics for these paradigms. Several different
semantics have been proposed during the last two decades, and some have been
more successful and acknowledged than others. The rationales behind those
various semantics have been manifold, depending on one's point of view, which
may be that of a programmer or inspired by commonsense reasoning, and
consequently the constructions which lead to these semantics are technically
very diverse, and the exact relationships between them have not yet been fully
understood. In this paper, we present a conceptually new method, based on level
mappings, which allows to provide uniform characterizations of different
semantics for logic programs. We will display our approach by giving new and
uniform characterizations of some of the major semantics, more particular of
the least model semantics for definite programs, of the Fitting semantics, and
of the well-founded semantics. A novel characterization of the weakly perfect
model semantics will also be provided.

 <dc:description>  Query equivalence is investigated for disjunctive aggregate queries with
negated subgoals, constants and comparisons. A full characterization of
equivalence is given for the aggregation functions count, max, sum, prod,
toptwo and parity. A related problem is that of determining, for a given
natural number N, whether two given queries are equivalent over all databases
with at most N constants. We call this problem bounded equivalence. A complete
characterization of decidability of bounded equivalence is given. In
particular, it is shown that this problem is decidable for all the above
aggregation functions as well as for count distinct and average. For
quasilinear queries (i.e., queries where predicates that occur positively are
not repeated) it is shown that equivalence can be decided in polynomial time
for the aggregation functions count, max, sum, parity, prod, toptwo and
average. A similar result holds for count distinct provided that a few
additional conditions hold. The results are couched in terms of abstract
characteristics of aggregation functions, and new proof techniques are used.
Finally, the results above also imply that equivalence, under bag-set
semantics, is decidable for non-aggregate queries with negation.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes technological and methodological options to achieve
interoperability in accessing electronic information resources, available in
Internet, in the scope of Brazilian Digital Library in Science and Technology
Project - BDL, developed by Brazilian Institute for Scientific and Technical
Information - IBICT. It stresses the impact of the Web in the publishing and
communication processes in science and technology and also in the information
systems and libraries. The work points out the two major objectives of the BDL
Project: facilitates electronic publishing of different full text materials
such as theses, journal articles, conference papers,grey literature - by
Brazilian scientific community, so amplifying their nationally and
internationally visibility; and achieving, through a unified gateway, thus
avoiding a user to navigate and query across different information resources
individually. The work explains technological options and standards that will
assure interoperability in this context.

 <dc:description>  We show how coupling of local optimization processes can lead to better
solutions than multi-start local optimization consisting of independent runs.
This is achieved by minimizing the average energy cost of the ensemble, subject
to synchronization constraints between the state vectors of the individual
local minimizers. From an augmented Lagrangian which incorporates the
synchronization constraints both as soft and hard constraints, a network is
derived wherein the local minimizers interact and exchange information through
the synchronization constraints. From the viewpoint of neural networks, the
array can be considered as a Lagrange programming network for continuous
optimization and as a cellular neural network (CNN). The penalty weights
associated with the soft state synchronization constraints follow from the
solution to a linear program. This expresses that the energy cost of the
ensemble should maximally decrease. In this way successful local minimizers can
implicitly impose their state to the others through a mechanism of master-slave
dynamics resulting into a cooperative search mechanism. Improved information
spreading within the ensemble is obtained by applying the concept of
small-world networks. This work suggests, in an interdisciplinary context, the
importance of information exchange and state synchronization within ensembles,
towards issues as evolution, collective behaviour, optimality and intelligence.

 <dc:description>  This research proposes a language independent intra-process framework for
object based composition of unmodified code modules. Intuitively, the two major
programming models, threads and processes, can be considered as extremes along
a sharing axis. Multiple threads through a process share all global state,
whereas instances of a process (or independent processes) share no global
state. Weaves provide the generalized framework that allows arbitrary
(selective) sharing of state between multiple control flows through a process.
The Weaves framework supports multiple independent components in a single
process, with flexible state sharing and scheduling, all of which is achieved
without requiring any modification to existing code bases. Furthermore, the
framework allows dynamic instantiation of code modules and control flows
through them. In effect, weaves create intra-process modules (similar to
objects in OOP) from code written in any language. The Weaves paradigm allows
objects to be arbitrarily shared, it is a true superset of both processes as
well as threads, with code sharing and fast context switching time similar to
threads. Weaves does not require any special support from either the language
or application code, practically any code can be weaved. Weaves also include
support for fast automatic checkpointing and recovery with no application
support. This paper presents the elements of the Weaves framework and results
from our implementation that works by reverse-analyzing source-code independent
ELF object files. The current implementation has been validated over Sweep3D, a
benchmark for 3D discrete ordinates neutron transport [Koch et al., 1992], and
a user-level port of the Linux 2.4 family kernel TCP/IP protocol stack.

and $n$. Given any prefix $p$ of the first input sequence and any prefix $q$ of

$q$ can be generated in time proportional to the output size, once the

context of generating all the distinct character strings that represent an LCS
or in the context of generating all ways of embedding an LCS in the two input
strings.

 <dc:description>  An extension of the WHILE-language is developed for programming
game-theoretic mechanisms involving multiple agents. Examples of such
mechanisms include auctions, voting procedures, and negotiation protocols. A
structured operational semantics is provided in terms of extensive games of
almost perfect information. Hoare-style partial correctness assertions are
proposed to reason about the correctness of these mechanisms, where correctness
is interpreted as the existence of a subgame perfect equilibrium. Using an
extensional approach to pre- and postconditions, we show that an extension of
Hoare's original calculus is sound and complete for reasoning about subgame
perfect equilibria in game-theoretic mechanisms.

 <dc:title>Evaluation of the Performance of the Markov Blanket Bayesian Classifier
  Algorithm</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Madden, Michael G.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>I.2.6</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Markov Blanket Bayesian Classifier is a recently-proposed algorithm for
construction of probabilistic classifiers. This paper presents an empirical
comparison of the MBBC algorithm with three other Bayesian classifiers: Naive
Bayes, Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes and a general Bayesian network. All of these
are implemented using the K2 framework of Cooper and Herskovits. The
classifiers are compared in terms of their performance (using simple accuracy
measures and ROC curves) and speed, on a range of standard benchmark data sets.
It is concluded that MBBC is competitive in terms of speed and accuracy with
the other algorithms considered.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the DLV system, which is widely considered the
state-of-the-art implementation of disjunctive logic programming, and addresses
several aspects. As for problem solving, we provide a formal definition of its
kernel language, function-free disjunctive logic programs (also known as
disjunctive datalog), extended by weak constraints, which are a powerful tool
to express optimization problems. We then illustrate the usage of DLV as a tool
for knowledge representation and reasoning, describing a new declarative
programming methodology which allows one to encode complex problems (up to
$\Delta^P_3$-complete problems) in a declarative fashion. On the foundational
side, we provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the
language of DLV, and by deriving new complexity results we chart a complete
picture of the complexity of this language and important fragments thereof.
  Furthermore, we illustrate the general architecture of the DLV system which
has been influenced by these results. As for applications, we overview
application front-ends which have been developed on top of DLV to solve
specific knowledge representation tasks, and we briefly describe the main
international projects investigating the potential of the system for industrial
exploitation. Finally, we report about thorough experimentation and
benchmarking, which has been carried out to assess the efficiency of the
system. The experimental results confirm the solidity of DLV and highlight its
potential for emerging application areas like knowledge management and
information integration.

 <dc:description>  Although speech and gesture recognition has been studied extensively, all the
successful attempts of combining them in the unified framework were
semantically motivated, e.g., keyword-gesture cooccurrence. Such formulations
inherited the complexity of natural language processing. This paper presents a
Bayesian formulation that uses a phenomenon of gesture and speech articulation
for improving accuracy of automatic recognition of continuous coverbal
gestures. The prosodic features from the speech signal were coanalyzed with the
visual signal to learn the prior probability of co-occurrence of the prominent
spoken segments with the particular kinematical phases of gestures. It was
found that the above co-analysis helps in detecting and disambiguating visually
small gestures, which subsequently improves the rate of continuous gesture
recognition. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated on a large
database collected from the weather channel broadcast. This formulation opens
new avenues for bottom-up frameworks of multimodal integration.

 <dc:title>Maximing the Margin in the Input Space</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel criterion for support vector machine learning: maximizing
the margin in the input space, not in the feature (Hilbert) space. This
criterion is a discriminative version of the principal curve proposed by Hastie
et al. The criterion is appropriate in particular when the input space is
already a well-designed feature space with rather small dimensionality. The
definition of the margin is generalized in order to represent prior knowledge.
The derived algorithm consists of two alternating steps to estimate the dual
parameters. Firstly, the parameters are initialized by the original SVM. Then
one set of parameters is updated by Newton-like procedure, and the other set is
updated by solving a quadratic programming problem. The algorithm converges in
a few steps to a local optimum under mild conditions and it preserves the
sparsity of support vectors. Although the complexity to calculate temporal
variables increases the complexity to solve the quadratic programming problem
for each step does not change. It is also shown that the original SVM can be
seen as a special case. We further derive a simplified algorithm which enables
us to use the existing code for the original SVM.

 <dc:description>  In biological data, it is often the case that observed data are available
only for a subset of samples. When a kernel matrix is derived from such data,
we have to leave the entries for unavailable samples as missing. In this paper,
we make use of a parametric model of kernel matrices, and estimate missing
entries by fitting the model to existing entries. The parametric model is
created as a set of spectral variants of a complete kernel matrix derived from
another information source. For model fitting, we adopt the em algorithm based
on the information geometry of positive definite matrices. We will report
promising results on bacteria clustering experiments using two marker
sequences: 16S and gyrB.

 <dc:title>Can the whole brain be simpler than its &quot;parts&quot;?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eliashberg, Victor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This is the first in a series of connected papers discussing the problem of a
dynamically reconfigurable universal learning neurocomputer that could serve as
a computational model for the whole human brain. The whole series is entitled
&quot;The Brain Zero Project. My Brain as a Dynamically Reconfigurable Universal
Learning Neurocomputer.&quot; (For more information visit the website
www.brain0.com.) This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology.
Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural
modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements
of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can
be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole
&quot;unprogrammed&quot; (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal
representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same
way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex
analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The
&quot;curse of dimensionality&quot; that plagues purely phenomenological (&quot;brainless&quot;)
cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent
insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of
insufficiently high dimensionality. A &quot;partial&quot; modeler encounters &quot;Catch 22.&quot;
An attempt to simplify a cognitive problem by artificially reducing its
dimensionality makes the problem more difficult.

 <dc:description>  The number of the non-shared edges of two phylogenies is a basic measure of
the dissimilarity between the phylogenies. The non-shared edges are also the
building block for approximating a more sophisticated metric called the nearest
neighbor interchange (NNI) distance. In this paper, we give the first
subquadratic-time algorithm for finding the non-shared edges, which are then
used to speed up the existing approximating algorithm for the NNI distance from
$O(n^2)$ time to $O(n \log n)$ time. Another popular distance metric for
phylogenies is the subtree transfer (STT) distance. Previous work on computing
the STT distance considered degree-3 trees only. We give an approximation
algorithm for the STT distance for degree-$d$ trees with arbitrary $d$ and with
generalized STT operations.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of laying out a tree with fixed parent/child
structure in hierarchical memory. The goal is to minimize the expected number
of block transfers performed during a search along a root-to-leaf path, subject
to a given probability distribution on the leaves. This problem was previously
considered by Gil and Itai, who developed optimal but slow algorithms when the
block-transfer size B is known. We present faster but approximate algorithms
for the same problem; the fastest such algorithm runs in linear time and
produces a solution that is within an additive constant of optimal.
  In addition, we show how to extend any approximately optimal algorithm to the
cache-oblivious setting in which the block-transfer size is unknown to the
algorithm. The query performance of the cache-oblivious layout is within a
constant factor of the query performance of the optimal known-block-size
layout. Computing the cache-oblivious layout requires only logarithmically many
calls to the layout algorithm for known block size; in particular, the
cache-oblivious layout can be computed in O(N lg N) time, where N is the number
of nodes.
  Finally, we analyze two greedy strategies, and show that they have a
performance ratio between Omega(lg B / lg lg B) and O(lg B) when compared to
the optimal layout.

 <dc:description>  We illustrate the use of intersection types as a semantic tool for showing
properties of the lattice of lambda theories. Relying on the notion of easy
intersection type theory we successfully build a filter model in which the
interpretation of an arbitrary simple easy term is any filter which can be
described in an uniform way by a predicate. This allows us to prove the
consistency of a well-know lambda theory: this consistency has interesting
consequences on the algebraic structure of the lattice of lambda theories.

 <dc:description>  We consider parallel simulations for asynchronous systems employing L
processing elements that are arranged on a ring. Processors communicate only
among the nearest neighbors and advance their local simulated time only if it
is guaranteed that this does not violate causality. In simulations with no
constraints, in the infinite L-limit the utilization scales (Korniss et al, PRL
84, 2000); but, the width of the virtual time horizon diverges (i.e., the
measurement phase of the algorithm does not scale). In this work, we introduce
a moving window global constraint, which modifies the algorithm so that the
measurement phase scales as well. We present results of systematic studies in
which the system size (i.e., L and the volume load per processor) as well as
the constraint are varied. The constraint eliminates the extreme fluctuations
in the virtual time horizon, provides a bound on its width, and controls the
average progress rate. The width of the window constraint can serve as a tuning
parameter that, for a given volume load per processor, could be adjusted to
optimize the utilization so as to maximize the efficiency. This result may find
numerous applications in modeling the evolution of general spatially extended
short-range interacting systems with asynchronous dynamics, including dynamic
Monte Carlo studies.

 <dc:title>Vanquishing the XCB Question: The Methodology Discovery of the Last

 <dc:description>  With the inclusion of an effective methodology, this article answers in
detail a question that, for a quarter of a century, remained open despite
intense study by various researchers. Is the formula XCB =
e(x,e(e(e(x,y),e(z,y)),z)) a single axiom for the classical equivalential
calculus when the rules of inference consist of detachment (modus ponens) and
substitution? Where the function e represents equivalence, this calculus can be
axiomatized quite naturally with the formulas e(x,x), e(e(x,y),e(y,x)), and
e(e(x,y),e(e(y,z),e(x,z))), which correspond to reflexivity, symmetry, and
transitivity, respectively. (We note that e(x,x) is dependent on the other two
axioms.) Heretofore, thirteen shortest single axioms for classical equivalence
of length eleven had been discovered, and XCB was the only remaining formula of
that length whose status was undetermined. To show that XCB is indeed such a
single axiom, we focus on the rule of condensed detachment, a rule that
captures detachment together with an appropriately general, but restricted,
form of substitution. The proof we present in this paper consists of
twenty-five applications of condensed detachment, completing with the deduction
of transitivity followed by a deduction of symmetry. We also discuss some
factors that may explain in part why XCB resisted relinquishing its treasure
for so long. Our approach relied on diverse strategies applied by the automated
reasoning program OTTER. Thus ends the search for shortest single axioms for
the equivalential calculus.

 <dc:description>  It has long been an open question whether the formula XCB = EpEEEpqErqr is,
with the rules of substitution and detachment, a single axiom for the classical
equivalential calculus. This paper answers that question affirmatively, thus
completing a search for all such eleven-symbol single axioms that began seventy
years ago.

 <dc:title>Efficient Solving of Quantified Inequality Constraints over the Real

 <dc:description>  Let a quantified inequality constraint over the reals be a formula in the
first-order predicate language over the structure of the real numbers, where
the allowed predicate symbols are $\leq$ and $&lt;$. Solving such constraints is
an undecidable problem when allowing function symbols such $\sin$ or $\cos$. In
the paper we give an algorithm that terminates with a solution for all, except
for very special, pathological inputs. We ensure the practical efficiency of
this algorithm by employing constraint programming techniques.

 <dc:description>  We present new results on the relation between purely symbolic context-free
parsing strategies and their probabilistic counter-parts. Such parsing
strategies are seen as constructions of push-down devices from grammars. We
show that preservation of probability distribution is possible under two
conditions, viz. the correct-prefix property and the property of strong
predictiveness. These results generalize existing results in the literature
that were obtained by considering parsing strategies in isolation. From our
general results we also derive negative results on so-called generalized LR
parsing.

 <dc:description>  We suggest a variation of the Hellerstein--Koutsoupias--Papadimitriou
indexability model for datasets equipped with a similarity measure, with the
aim of better understanding the structure of indexing schemes for
similarity-based search and the geometry of similarity workloads. This in
particular provides a unified approach to a great variety of schemes used to
index into metric spaces and facilitates their transfer to more general
similarity measures such as quasi-metrics. We discuss links between performance
of indexing schemes and high-dimensional geometry. The concepts and results are
illustrated on a very large concrete dataset of peptide fragments equipped with
a biologically significant similarity measure.

 <dc:description>  We study here schedulers for a class of rules that naturally arise in the
context of rule-based constraint programming. We systematically derive a
scheduler for them from a generic iteration algorithm of Apt [2000]. We apply
this study to so-called membership rules of Apt and Monfroy [2001]. This leads
to an implementation that yields for these rules a considerably better
performance than their execution as standard CHR rules.

 <dc:description>  Research on information extraction from Web pages (wrapping) has seen much
activity recently (particularly systems implementations), but little work has
been done on formally studying the expressiveness of the formalisms proposed or
on the theoretical foundations of wrapping. In this paper, we first study
monadic datalog over trees as a wrapping language. We show that this simple
language is equivalent to monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to
specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for
Web information extraction and propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and
comparing wrappers. Along the way, several other results on the complexity of
query evaluation and query containment for monadic datalog over trees are
established, and a simple normal form for this language is presented. Using the
above results, we subsequently study the kernel fragment Elog$^-$ of the Elog
wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator).
Curiously, Elog$^-$ exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed,
programs in this language can be entirely visually specified.

 <dc:title>Arithmetic, First-Order Logic, and Counting Quantifiers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schweikardt, Nicole</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper gives a thorough overview of what is known about first-order logic
with counting quantifiers and with arithmetic predicates. As a main theorem we
show that Presburger arithmetic is closed under unary counting quantifiers.
Precisely, this means that for every first-order formula phi(y,z_1,...,z_k)
over the signature {&lt;,+} there is a first-order formula psi(x,z_1,...,z_k)
which expresses over the structure &lt;Nat,&lt;,+&gt; (respectively, over initial
segments of this structure) that the variable x is interpreted exactly by the
number of possible interpretations of the variable y for which the formula
phi(y,z_1,...,z_k) is satisfied. Applying this theorem, we obtain an easy proof
of Ruhl's result that reachability (and similarly, connectivity) in finite
graphs is not expressible in first-order logic with unary counting quantifiers
and addition. Furthermore, the above result on Presburger arithmetic helps to
show the failure of a particular version of the Crane Beach conjecture.

 <dc:description>  Traditional science searched for new objects and phenomena that led to
discoveries. Tomorrow's science will combine together the large pool of
information in scientific archives and make discoveries. Scienthists are
currently keen to federate together the existing scientific databases. The
major challenge in building a federation of these autonomous and heterogeneous
databases is system integration. Ineffective integration will result in defunct
federations and under utilized scientific data.
  Astronomy, in particular, has many autonomous archives spread over the
Internet. It is now seeking to federate these, with minimal effort, into a
Virtual Observatory that will solve complex distributed computing tasks such as
answering federated spatial join queries.
  In this paper, we present SkyQuery, a successful prototype of an evolving
federation of astronomy archives. It interoperates using the emerging Web
services standard. We describe the SkyQuery architecture and show how it
efficiently evaluates a probabilistic federated spatial join query.

 <dc:description>  Most popular, modern network simulators, such as ns, are targeted towards
simulating low-level protocol details. These existing simulators are not
intended for simulating large distributed applications with many hosts and many
concurrent connections over long periods of simulated time. We introduce a new
simulator, Narses, targeted towards large distributed applications. The goal of
Narses is to simulate and validate large applications efficiently using network
models of varying levels of detail. We introduce several simplifying
assumptions that allow our simulator to scale to the needs of large distributed
applications while maintaining a reasonable degree of accuracy. Initial results
show up to a 45 times speedup while consuming 28% of the memory used by ns.
Narses maintains a reasonable degree of accuracy -- within 8% on average.

 <dc:description>  The two most important notions of fractal dimension are {\it Hausdorff
dimension}, developed by Hausdorff (1919), and {\it packing dimension},
developed by Tricot (1982).
  Lutz (2000) has recently proven a simple characterization of Hausdorff
dimension in terms of {\it gales}, which are betting strategies that generalize
martingales. Imposing various computability and complexity constraints on these
gales produces a spectrum of effective versions of Hausdorff dimension.
  In this paper we show that packing dimension can also be characterized in
terms of gales. Moreover, even though the usual definition of packing dimension
is considerably more complex than that of Hausdorff dimension, our gale
characterization of packing dimension is an exact dual of -- and every bit as
simple as -- the gale characterization of Hausdorff dimension.
  Effectivizing our gale characterization of packing dimension produces a
variety of {\it effective strong dimensions}, which are exact duals of the
effective dimensions mentioned above.
  We develop the basic properties of effective strong dimensions and prove a
number of results relating them to fundamental aspects of randomness,
Kolmogorov complexity, prediction, Boolean circuit-size complexity,
polynomial-time degrees, and data compression.

 <dc:description>  As a part of our effort for studying the evolution and development of
cognition, we present results derived from synthetic experimentations in a
virtual laboratory where animats develop koncepts adaptively and ground their
meaning through action. We introduce the term &quot;koncept&quot; to avoid confusions and
ambiguity derived from the wide use of the word &quot;concept&quot;. We present the
models which our animats use for abstracting koncepts from perceptions,
plastically adapt koncepts, and associate koncepts with actions. On a more
philosophical vein, we suggest that knowledge is a property of a cognitive
system, not an element, and therefore observer-dependent.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we name some of the advantages of virtual laboratories; and
propose that a Behaviours Virtual Laboratory should be useful for both
biologists and AI researchers, offering a new perspective for understanding
adaptive behaviour. We present our development of a Behaviours Virtual
Laboratory, which at this stage is focused in action selection, and show some
experiments to illustrate the properties of our proposal, which can be accessed
via Internet.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes to model the intracellular signalling networks using a
fusion of behaviour-based systems and the blackboard architecture. In virtue of
this fusion, the model developed by us, which has been named Cellulat, allows
to take account two essential aspects of the intracellular signalling networks:
(1) the cognitive capabilities of certain types of networks' components and (2)
the high level of spatial organization of these networks. A simple example of
modelling of Ca2+ signalling pathways using Cellulat is presented here. An
intracellular signalling virtual laboratory is being developed from Cellulat.

 <dc:description>  A cell can be seen as an adaptive autonomous agent or as a society of
adaptive autonomous agents, where each can exhibit a particular behaviour
depending on its cognitive capabilities. We present an intracellular signalling
model obtained by integrating several computational techniques into an
agent-based paradigm. Cellulat, the model, takes into account two essential
aspects of the intracellular signalling networks: cognitive capacities and a
spatial organization. Exemplifying the functionality of the system by modelling
the EGFR signalling pathway, we discuss the methodology as well as the purposes
of an intracellular signalling virtual laboratory, presently under development.

 <dc:description>  A knowledge base is redundant if it contains parts that can be inferred from
the rest of it. We study the problem of checking whether a CNF formula (a set
of clauses) is redundant, that is, it contains clauses that can be derived from
the other ones. Any CNF formula can be made irredundant by deleting some of its
clauses: what results is an irredundant equivalent subset (I.E.S.) We study the
complexity of some related problems: verification, checking existence of a
I.E.S. with a given size, checking necessary and possible presence of clauses
in I.E.S.'s, and uniqueness. We also consider the problem of redundancy with
different definitions of equivalence.

 <dc:description>  Answer-set programming (ASP) paradigm is a way of using logic to solve search
problems. Given a search problem, to solve it one designs a theory in the logic
so that models of this theory represent problem solutions. To compute a
solution to a problem one needs to compute a model of the corresponding theory.
Several answer-set programming formalisms have been developed on the basis of
logic programming with the semantics of stable models. In this paper we show
that also the logic of predicate calculus gives rise to effective
implementations of the ASP paradigm, similar in spirit to logic programming
with stable model semantics and with a similar scope of applicability.
Specifically, we propose two logics based on predicate calculus as formalisms
for encoding search problems. We show that the expressive power of these logics
is given by the class NP-search. We demonstrate how to use them in programming
and develop computational tools for model finding. In the case of one of the
logics our techniques reduce the problem to that of propositional
satisfiability and allow one to use off-the-shelf satisfiability solvers. The
language of the other logic has more complex syntax and provides explicit means
to model some high-level constraints. For theories in this logic, we designed
our own solver that takes advantage of the expanded syntax. We present
experimental results demonstrating computational effectiveness of the overall
approach.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in programming languages study and design have established a
standard way of grounding computational systems representation in category
theory. These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control
and side-effects in functional and imperative languages. Another benefit is a
better way of modelling computational effects in logical frameworks. With this
analogy in mind, we embark on an investigation of inference systems based on
considering inference behaviour as a form of computation. We delineate a
categorical formalisation of control constructs in inference systems. This
representation emphasises the parallel between the modular articulation of the
categorical building blocks (triples) used to account for the inference
architecture and the modular composition of cognitive processes.

 <dc:description>  We present a new structural (or syntatic) approach for estimating the
satisfiability threshold of random 3-SAT formulae. We show its efficiency in
obtaining a jump from the previous upper bounds, lowering them to 4.506. The
method combines well with other techniques, and also applies to other problems,
such as the 3-colourability of random graphs.

 <dc:description>  Web pages contain a large variety of information, but are largely designed
for use by graphical web browsers. Mobile access to web-based information often
requires presenting HTML web pages using channels that are limited in their
graphical capabilities such as small-screens or audio-only interfaces. Content
transcoding and annotations have been explored as methods for intelligently
presenting HTML documents. Much of this work has focused on transcoding for
small-screen devices such as are found on PDAs and cell phones. Here, we focus
on the use of annotations and transcoding for presenting HTML content through a
voice user interface instantiated in VoiceXML. This transcoded voice interface
is designed with an assumption that it will not be used for extended web
browsing by voice, but rather to quickly gain directed access to information on
web pages. We have found repeated structures that are common in the
presentation of data on web pages that are well suited for voice presentation
and navigation. In this paper, we describe these structures and their use in an
annotation system we have implemented that produces a VoiceXML interface to
information originally embedded in HTML documents. We describe the transcoding
process used to translate HTML into VoiceXML, including transcoding features we
have designed to lead to highly usable VoiceXML code.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a model for dynamic adjustment of the motivation degree,
using a reinforcement learning approach, in an action selection mechanism
previously developed by the authors. The learning takes place in the
modification of a parameter of the model of combination of internal and
external stimuli. Experiments that show the claimed properties are presented,
using a VR simulation developed for such purposes. The importance of adaptation
by learning in action selection is also discussed.

for the action selection in an autonomous agent, based in an action selection
mechanism previously proposed by the authors. This combination model includes
additive and multiplicative elements, which allows to incorporate new
properties, which enhance the action selection. A given parameter a, which is
part of the proposed model, allows to regulate the degree of dependence of the
observed external behaviour from the internal states of the entity.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an approach to automatic indexing of e-prints based on a
pattern-matching technique making extensive use of an Associative Patterns
Dictionary (APD), developed by us. Entries in the APD consist of natural
language phrases with the same semantic interpretation as a set of keywords
from a controlled vocabulary. The method also allows to recognize within
e-prints formulae written in TeX notations that might also appear as keywords.
We present an automatic indexing system, AUTEX, which we have applied to
keyword index e-prints in selected areas in high energy physics (HEP) making
use of the DESY-HEPI thesaurus as a controlled vocabulary.

inconsistent relational databases, that is databases that do not satisfy a
given set of integrity constraints. For this purpose we provide closing and
opening criteria for branches in tableaux that are built for database instances
and their integrity constraints. We use the tableaux based characterization as
a basis for consistent query answering, that is for retrieving from the
database answers to queries that are consistent wrt the integrity constraints.

 <dc:description>  We propose the ``Competing Salesmen Problem'' (CSP), a 2-player competitive
version of the classical Traveling Salesman Problem. This problem arises when
considering two competing salesmen instead of just one. The concern for a
shortest tour is replaced by the necessity to reach any of the customers before
the opponent does. In particular, we consider the situation where players take
turns, moving along one edge at a time within a graph G=(V,E). The set of
customers is given by a subset V_C V of the vertices. At any given time, both
players know of their opponent's position. A player wins if he is able to reach
a majority of the vertices in V_C before the opponent does. We prove that the
CSP is PSPACE-complete, even if the graph is bipartite, and both players start
at distance 2 from each other. We show that the starting player may lose the
game, even if both players start from the same vertex. For bipartite graphs, we
show that the starting player always can avoid a loss. We also show that the
second player can avoid to lose by more than one customer, when play takes
place on a graph that is a tree T, and V_C consists of leaves of T. For the
case where T is a star and V_C consists of n leaves of T, we give a simple and
fast strategy which is optimal for both players. If V_C consists not only of
leaves, the situation is more involved.

 <dc:description>  We study the satisfiability of randomly generated formulas formed by $M$
clauses of exactly $K$ literals over $N$ Boolean variables. For a given value
of $N$ the problem is known to be most difficult with $\alpha=M/N$ close to the
experimental threshold $\alpha_c$ separating the region where almost all
formulas are SAT from the region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results
from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to
the existence of a clustering phenomenon of the solutions when $\alpha$ is
close to (but smaller than) $\alpha_c$. We introduce a new type of message
passing algorithm which allows to find efficiently a satisfiable assignment of
the variables in the difficult region. This algorithm is iterative and composed
of two main parts. The first is a message-passing procedure which generalizes
the usual methods like Sum-Product or Belief Propagation: it passes messages
that are surveys over clusters of the ordinary messages. The second part uses
the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the surveys in order to
fix variables and simplify the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that
remains is solved by a conventional heuristic.

 <dc:title>Ownership Confinement Ensures Representation Independence for
  Object-Oriented Programs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Dedicated to the memory of Edsger W.Dijkstra.
  Representation independence or relational parametricity formally
characterizes the encapsulation provided by language constructs for data
abstraction and justifies reasoning by simulation. Representation independence
has been shown for a variety of languages and constructs but not for shared
references to mutable state; indeed it fails in general for such languages.
This paper formulates representation independence for classes, in an
imperative, object-oriented language with pointers, subclassing and dynamic
dispatch, class oriented visibility control, recursive types and methods, and a
simple form of module. An instance of a class is considered to implement an
abstraction using private fields and so-called representation objects.
Encapsulation of representation objects is expressed by a restriction, called
confinement, on aliasing. Representation independence is proved for programs
satisfying the confinement condition. A static analysis is given for
confinement that accepts common designs such as the observer and factory
patterns. The formalization takes into account not only the usual interface
between a client and a class that provides an abstraction but also the
interface (often called ``protected'') between the class and its subclasses.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of minimal-change integrity maintenance in the context
of integrity constraints in relational databases. We assume that
integrity-restoration actions are limited to tuple deletions. We identify two
basic computational issues: repair checking (is a database instance a repair of
a given database?) and consistent query answers (is a tuple an answer to a
given query in every repair of a given database?). We study the computational
complexity of both problems, delineating the boundary between the tractable and
the intractable. We consider denial constraints, general functional and
inclusion dependencies, as well as key and foreign key constraints. Our results
shed light on the computational feasibility of minimal-change integrity
maintenance. The tractable cases should lead to practical implementations. The
intractability results highlight the inherent limitations of any integrity
enforcement mechanism, e.g., triggers or referential constraint actions, as a
way of performing minimal-change integrity maintenance.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of finding a large color space that can be generated
by all units in multi-projector tiled display systems. Viewing the problem
geometrically as one of finding a large parallelepiped within the intersection
of multiple parallelepipeds, and using colorimetric principles to define a
volume-based objective function for comparing feasible solutions, we develop an
algorithm for finding the optimal gamut in time O(n^3), where n denotes the
number of projectors in the system. We also discuss more efficient quasiconvex
programming algorithms for alternative objective functions based on maximizing
the quality of the color space extrema.

 <dc:description>  Nonlinear manifold learning from unorganized data points is a very
challenging unsupervised learning and data visualization problem with a great
variety of applications. In this paper we present a new algorithm for manifold
learning and nonlinear dimension reduction. Based on a set of unorganized data
points sampled with noise from the manifold, we represent the local geometry of
the manifold using tangent spaces learned by fitting an affine subspace in a
neighborhood of each data point. Those tangent spaces are aligned to give the
internal global coordinates of the data points with respect to the underlying
manifold by way of a partial eigendecomposition of the neighborhood connection
matrix. We present a careful error analysis of our algorithm and show that the
reconstruction errors are of second-order accuracy. We illustrate our algorithm
using curves and surfaces both in
  2D/3D and higher dimensional Euclidean spaces, and 64-by-64 pixel face images
with various pose and lighting conditions. We also address several theoretical
and algorithmic issues for further research and improvements.

 <dc:description>  JohnnyVon is an implementation of self-replicating automata in continuous
two-dimensional space. Two types of particles drift about in a virtual liquid.
The particles are automata with discrete internal states but continuous
external relationships. Their internal states are governed by finite state
machines but their external relationships are governed by a simulated physics
that includes brownian motion, viscosity, and spring-like attractive and
repulsive forces. The particles can be assembled into patterns that can encode
arbitrary strings of bits. We demonstrate that, if an arbitrary &quot;seed&quot; pattern
is put in a &quot;soup&quot; of separate individual particles, the pattern will replicate
by assembling the individual particles into copies of itself. We also show
that, given sufficient time, a soup of separate individual particles will
eventually spontaneously form self-replicating patterns. We discuss the
implications of JohnnyVon for research in nanotechnology, theoretical biology,
and artificial life.

 <dc:description>  Keyphrases are useful for a variety of purposes, including summarizing,
indexing, labeling, categorizing, clustering, highlighting, browsing, and
searching. The task of automatic keyphrase extraction is to select keyphrases
from within the text of a given document. Automatic keyphrase extraction makes
it feasible to generate keyphrases for the huge number of documents that do not
have manually assigned keyphrases. Good performance on this task has been
obtained by approaching it as a supervised learning problem. An input document
is treated as a set of candidate phrases that must be classified as either
keyphrases or non-keyphrases. To classify a candidate phrase as a keyphrase,
the most important features (attributes) appear to be the frequency and
location of the candidate phrase in the document. Recent work has demonstrated
that it is also useful to know the frequency of the candidate phrase as a
manually assigned keyphrase for other documents in the same domain as the given
document (e.g., the domain of computer science). Unfortunately, this
keyphrase-frequency feature is domain-specific (the learning process must be
repeated for each new domain) and training-intensive (good performance requires
a relatively large number of training documents in the given domain, with
manually assigned keyphrases). The aim of the work described here is to remove
these limitations. In this paper, I introduce new features that are derived by
mining lexical knowledge from a very large collection of unlabeled data,
consisting of approximately 350 million Web pages without manually assigned
keyphrases. I present experiments that show that the new features result in
improved keyphrase extraction, although they are neither domain-specific nor
training-intensive.

 <dc:description>  The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation. A
positive semantic orientation implies desirability (e.g., &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;intrepid&quot;)
and a negative semantic orientation implies undesirability (e.g., &quot;disturbing&quot;,
&quot;superfluous&quot;). This paper introduces a simple algorithm for unsupervised
learning of semantic orientation from extremely large corpora. The method
involves issuing queries to a Web search engine and using pointwise mutual
information to analyse the results. The algorithm is empirically evaluated
using a training corpus of approximately one hundred billion words -- the
subset of the Web that is indexed by the chosen search engine. Tested with
3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative), the algorithm attains an
accuracy of 80%. The 3,596 test words include adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and
verbs. The accuracy is comparable with the results achieved by Hatzivassiloglou
and McKeown (1997), using a complex four-stage supervised learning algorithm
that is restricted to determining the semantic orientation of adjectives.

 <dc:description>  Many academic journals ask their authors to provide a list of about five to
fifteen key words, to appear on the first page of each article. Since these key
words are often phrases of two or more words, we prefer to call them
keyphrases. There is a surprisingly wide variety of tasks for which keyphrases
are useful, as we discuss in this paper. Recent commercial software, such as
Microsoft's Word 97 and Verity's Search 97, includes algorithms that
automatically extract keyphrases from documents. In this paper, we approach the
problem of automatically extracting keyphrases from text as a supervised
learning task. We treat a document as a set of phrases, which the learning
algorithm must learn to classify as positive or negative examples of
keyphrases. Our first set of experiments applies the C4.5 decision tree
induction algorithm to this learning task. The second set of experiments
applies the GenEx algorithm to the task. We developed the GenEx algorithm
specifically for this task. The third set of experiments examines the
performance of GenEx on the task of metadata generation, relative to the
performance of Microsoft's Word 97. The fourth and final set of experiments
investigates the performance of GenEx on the task of highlighting, relative to
Verity's Search 97. The experimental results support the claim that a
specialized learning algorithm (GenEx) can generate better keyphrases than a
general-purpose learning algorithm (C4.5) and the non-learning algorithms that
are used in commercial software (Word 97 and Search 97).

 <dc:description>  This report presents an empirical evaluation of four algorithms for
automatically extracting keywords and keyphrases from documents. The four
algorithms are compared using five different collections of documents. For each
document, we have a target set of keyphrases, which were generated by hand. The
target keyphrases were generated for human readers; they were not tailored for
any of the four keyphrase extraction algorithms. Each of the algorithms was
evaluated by the degree to which the algorithm's keyphrases matched the
manually generated keyphrases. The four algorithms were (1) the AutoSummarize
feature in Microsoft's Word 97, (2) an algorithm based on Eric Brill's
part-of-speech tagger, (3) the Summarize feature in Verity's Search 97, and (4)
NRC's Extractor algorithm. For all five document collections, NRC's Extractor
yields the best match with the manually generated keyphrases.

 <dc:title>Answering Subcognitive Turing Test Questions: A Reply to French</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Turney, Peter D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Robert French has argued that a disembodied computer is incapable of passing
a Turing Test that includes subcognitive questions. Subcognitive questions are
designed to probe the network of cultural and perceptual associations that
humans naturally develop as we live, embodied and embedded in the world. In
this paper, I show how it is possible for a disembodied computer to answer
subcognitive questions appropriately, contrary to French's claim. My approach
to answering subcognitive questions is to use statistical information extracted
from a very large collection of text. In particular, I show how it is possible
to answer a sample of subcognitive questions taken from French, by issuing
queries to a search engine that indexes about 350 million Web pages. This
simple algorithm may shed light on the nature of human (sub-) cognition, but
the scope of this paper is limited to demonstrating that French is mistaken: a
disembodied computer can answer subcognitive questions.

 <dc:description>  We prove that the exact versions of the domatic number problem are complete
for the levels of the boolean hierarchy over NP. The domatic number problem,
which arises in the area of computer networks, is the problem of partitioning a
given graph into a maximum number of disjoint dominating sets. This number is
called the domatic number of the graph. We prove that the problem of
determining whether or not the domatic number of a given graph is {\em exactly}
one of k given values is complete for the 2k-th level of the boolean hierarchy
over NP. In particular, for k = 1, it is DP-complete to determine whether or
not the domatic number of a given graph equals exactly a given integer. Note
that DP is the second level of the boolean hierarchy over NP. We obtain similar
results for the exact versions of generalized dominating set problems and of
the conveyor flow shop problem. Our reductions apply Wagner's conditions
sufficient to prove hardness for the levels of the boolean hierarchy over NP.

 <dc:description>  We present a data model for spatio-temporal databases. In this model
spatio-temporal data is represented as a finite union of objects described by
means of a spatial reference object, a temporal object and a geometric
transformation function that determines the change or movement of the reference
object in time.
  We define a number of practically relevant classes of spatio-temporal
objects, and give complete results concerning closure under Boolean set
operators for these classes. Since only few classes are closed under all set
operators, we suggest an extension of the model, which leads to better closure
properties, and therefore increased practical applicability. We also discuss a
normal form for this extended data model.

representation play a special role in classical numeration systems. The aim of
this paper is to characterize the numbers having an ultimately periodic
representation in generalized systems built on a regular language. The

the equivalence of the classical &quot;theta&quot;-expansions with our generalized

 <dc:description>  Ever increasing computational power will require methods for automatic
programming. We present an alternative to genetic programming, based on a
general model of thinking and learning. The advantage is that evolution takes
place in the space of constructs and can thus exploit the mathematical
structures of this space. The model is formalized, and a macro language is
presented which allows for a formal yet intuitive description of the problem
under consideration. A prototype has been developed to implement the scheme in
PERL. This method will lead to a concentration on the analysis of problems, to
a more rapid prototyping, to the treatment of new problem classes, and to the
investigation of philosophical problems. We see fields of application in
nonlinear differential equations, pattern recognition, robotics, model
building, and animated pictures.

algorithm (GenEx), incorporating specialized procedural domain knowledge, can
generate better keyphrases than a generalpurpose algorithm (C4.5). Subjective
human evaluation of the keyphrases generated by Extractor suggests that about
80% of the keyphrases are acceptable to human readers. This level of
performance should be satisfactory for a wide variety of applications.

 <dc:description>  The idea that there are any large-scale trends in the evolution of biological
organisms is highly controversial. It is commonly believed, for example, that
there is a large-scale trend in evolution towards increasing complexity, but
empirical and theoretical arguments undermine this belief. Natural selection
results in organisms that are well adapted to their local environments, but it
is not clear how local adaptation can produce a global trend. In this paper, I
present a simple computational model, in which local adaptation to a randomly
changing environment results in a global trend towards increasing evolutionary
versatility. In this model, for evolutionary versatility to increase without
bound, the environment must be highly dynamic. The model also shows that
unbounded evolutionary versatility implies an accelerating evolutionary pace. I
believe that unbounded increase in evolutionary versatility is a large-scale
trend in evolution. I discuss some of the testable predictions about organismal
evolution that are suggested by the model.

 <dc:description>  We develop and analyze algorithms for dispersing a swarm of primitive robots
in an unknown environment, R. The primary objective is to minimize the
makespan, that is, the time to fill the entire region. An environment is
composed of pixels that form a connected subset of the integer grid.
  There is at most one robot per pixel and robots move horizontally or
vertically at unit speed. Robots enter R by means of k&gt;=1 door pixels
  Robots are primitive finite automata, only having local communication, local
sensors, and a constant-sized memory.
  We first give algorithms for the single-door case (i.e., k=1), analyzing the
algorithms both theoretically and experimentally. We prove that our algorithms
have optimal makespan 2A-1, where A is the area of R.
  We next give an algorithm for the multi-door case (k&gt;1), based on a
wall-following version of the leader-follower strategy. We prove that our
strategy is O(log(k+1))-competitive, and that this bound is tight for our
strategy and other related strategies.

 <dc:title>How to Shift Bias: Lessons from the Baldwin Effect</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  An inductive learning algorithm takes a set of data as input and generates a
hypothesis as output. A set of data is typically consistent with an infinite
number of hypotheses; therefore, there must be factors other than the data that
determine the output of the learning algorithm. In machine learning, these
other factors are called the bias of the learner. Classical learning algorithms
have a fixed bias, implicit in their design. Recently developed learning
algorithms dynamically adjust their bias as they search for a hypothesis.
Algorithms that shift bias in this manner are not as well understood as
classical algorithms. In this paper, we show that the Baldwin effect has
implications for the design and analysis of bias shifting algorithms. The
Baldwin effect was proposed in 1896, to explain how phenomena that might appear
to require Lamarckian evolution (inheritance of acquired characteristics) can
arise from purely Darwinian evolution. Hinton and Nowlan presented a
computational model of the Baldwin effect in 1987. We explore a variation on
their model, which we constructed explicitly to illustrate the lessons that the
Baldwin effect has for research in bias shifting algorithms. The main lesson is
that it appears that a good strategy for shift of bias in a learning algorithm
is to begin with a weak bias and gradually shift to a strong bias.

Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus advanced in favour of the proposition
that humans have language-specific innate knowledge. I start by examining an a
priori argument based on Gold's theorem, that purports to prove that natural
languages cannot be learned, and some formal issues related to the choice of
statistical grammars rather than symbolic grammars. I present three novel
algorithms for learning various parts of natural languages: first, an algorithm
for the induction of syntactic categories from unlabelled text using
distributional information, that can deal with ambiguous and rare words;
secondly, a set of algorithms for learning morphological processes in a variety
of languages, including languages such as Arabic with non-concatenative
morphology; thirdly an algorithm for the unsupervised induction of a
context-free grammar from tagged text. I carefully examine the interaction
between the various components, and show how these algorithms can form the
basis for a empiricist model of language acquisition. I therefore conclude that
the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus is unsupported by the evidence.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) involves sequential decision making in uncertain
environments. The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit
of acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an
optimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used
solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm,
or various other methods using macro-actions.
  Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of
the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement
learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple
model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model
makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an
optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal.
In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables
fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations.

 <dc:description>  Since the seminal work of J. A. Robinson on resolution, many lifting lemmas
for simplifying proofs of completeness of resolution have been proposed in the
literature. In the logic programming framework, they may also help to detect
some infinite derivations while proving goals under the SLD-resolution. In this
paper, we first generalize a version of the lifting lemma, by extending the
relation &quot;is more general than&quot; so that it takes into account only some
arguments of the atoms. The other arguments, which we call neutral arguments,
are disregarded. Then we propose two syntactic conditions of increasing power
for identifying neutral arguments from mere inspection of the text of a logic
program.

 <dc:description>  A double pendulum subject to external torques is used as a model to study the
stability of a planar manipulator with two links and two rotational driven
joints. The hamiltonian equations of motion and the fixed points (stationary
solutions) in phase space are determined. Under suitable conditions, the
presence of constant torques does not change the number of fixed points, and
preserves the topology of orbits in their linear neighborhoods; two equivalent
invariant manifolds are observed, each corresponding to a saddle-center fixed
point.

 <dc:description>  Research on bias in machine learning algorithms has generally been concerned
with the impact of bias on predictive accuracy. We believe that there are other
factors that should also play a role in the evaluation of bias. One such factor
is the stability of the algorithm; in other words, the repeatability of the
results. If we obtain two sets of data from the same phenomenon, with the same
underlying probability distribution, then we would like our learning algorithm
to induce approximately the same concepts from both sets of data. This paper
introduces a method for quantifying stability, based on a measure of the
agreement between concepts. We also discuss the relationships among stability,
predictive accuracy, and bias.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a theory of error in cross-validation testing of
algorithms for predicting real-valued attributes. The theory justifies the
claim that predicting real-valued attributes requires balancing the conflicting
demands of simplicity and accuracy. Furthermore, the theory indicates precisely
how these conflicting demands must be balanced, in order to minimize
cross-validation error. A general theory is presented, then it is developed in
detail for linear regression and instance-based learning.

 <dc:title>Theoretical Analyses of Cross-Validation Error and Voting in

 <dc:description>  This paper begins with a general theory of error in cross-validation testing
of algorithms for supervised learning from examples. It is assumed that the
examples are described by attribute-value pairs, where the values are symbolic.
Cross-validation requires a set of training examples and a set of testing
examples. The value of the attribute that is to be predicted is known to the
learner in the training set, but unknown in the testing set. The theory
demonstrates that cross-validation error has two components: error on the
training set (inaccuracy) and sensitivity to noise (instability). This general
theory is then applied to voting in instance-based learning. Given an example
in the testing set, a typical instance-based learning algorithm predicts the
designated attribute by voting among the k nearest neighbors (the k most
similar examples) to the testing example in the training set. Voting is
intended to increase the stability (resistance to noise) of instance-based
learning, but a theoretical analysis shows that there are circumstances in
which voting can be destabilizing. The theory suggests ways to minimize
cross-validation error, by insuring that voting is stable and does not
adversely affect accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Diagnosing faults in aircraft gas turbine engines is a complex problem. It
involves several tasks, including rapid and accurate interpretation of patterns
in engine sensor data. We have investigated contextual normalization for the
development of a software tool to help engine repair technicians with
interpretation of sensor data. Contextual normalization is a new strategy for
employing machine learning. It handles variation in data that is due to
contextual factors, rather than the health of the engine. It does this by
normalizing the data in a context-sensitive manner. This learning strategy was
developed and tested using 242 observations of an aircraft gas turbine engine
in a test cell, where each observation consists of roughly 12,000 numbers,
gathered over a 12 second interval. There were eight classes of observations:
seven deliberately implanted classes of faults and a healthy class. We compared
two approaches to implementing our learning strategy: linear regression and
instance-based learning. We have three main results. (1) For the given problem,
instance-based learning works better than linear regression. (2) For this
problem, contextual normalization works better than other common forms of
normalization. (3) The algorithms described here can be the basis for a useful
software tool for assisting technicians with the interpretation of sensor data.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying
reviews as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down). The
classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of
the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a
positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., &quot;subtle
nuances&quot;) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations
(e.g., &quot;very cavalier&quot;). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is
calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word
&quot;excellent&quot; minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word
&quot;poor&quot;. A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic
orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average
accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four
different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel
destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for
movie reviews.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for recognizing
synonyms, based on statistical data acquired by querying a Web search engine.
The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and
Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR
is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of
English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a
collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both
tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL
questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised
learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent
Semantic Indexing).

 <dc:description>  Inductive concept learning is the task of learning to assign cases to a
discrete set of classes. In real-world applications of concept learning, there
are many different types of cost involved. The majority of the machine learning
literature ignores all types of cost (unless accuracy is interpreted as a type
of cost measure). A few papers have investigated the cost of misclassification
errors. Very few papers have examined the many other types of cost. In this
paper, we attempt to create a taxonomy of the different types of cost that are
involved in inductive concept learning. This taxonomy may help to organize the
literature on cost-sensitive learning. We hope that it will inspire researchers
to investigate all types of cost in inductive concept learning in more depth.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of classifying observations when features
are context-sensitive, specifically when the testing set involves a context
that is different from the training set. The paper begins with a precise
definition of the problem, then general strategies are presented for enhancing
the performance of classification algorithms on this type of problem. These
strategies are tested on two domains. The first domain is the diagnosis of gas
turbine engines. The problem is to diagnose a faulty engine in one context,
such as warm weather, when the fault has previously been seen only in another
context, such as cold weather. The second domain is speech recognition. The
problem is to recognize words spoken by a new speaker, not represented in the
training set. For both domains, exploiting context results in substantially
more accurate classification.

 <dc:title>Myths and Legends of the Baldwin Effect</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This position paper argues that the Baldwin effect is widely misunderstood by
the evolutionary computation community. The misunderstandings appear to fall
into two general categories. Firstly, it is commonly believed that the Baldwin
effect is concerned with the synergy that results when there is an evolving
population of learning individuals. This is only half of the story. The full
story is more complicated and more interesting. The Baldwin effect is concerned
with the costs and benefits of lifetime learning by individuals in an evolving
population. Several researchers have focussed exclusively on the benefits, but
there is much to be gained from attention to the costs. This paper explains the
two sides of the story and enumerates ten of the costs and benefits of lifetime
learning by individuals in an evolving population. Secondly, there is a cluster
of misunderstandings about the relationship between the Baldwin effect and
Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics. The Baldwin effect is not
Lamarckian. A Lamarckian algorithm is not better for most evolutionary
computing problems than a Baldwinian algorithm. Finally, Lamarckian inheritance
is not a better model of memetic (cultural) evolution than the Baldwin effect.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we review five heuristic strategies for handling
context-sensitive features in supervised machine learning from examples. We
discuss two methods for recovering lost (implicit) contextual information. We
mention some evidence that hybrid strategies can have a synergetic effect. We
then show how the work of several machine learning researchers fits into this
framework. While we do not claim that these strategies exhaust the
possibilities, it appears that the framework includes all of the techniques
that can be found in the published literature on contextsensitive learning.

 <dc:title>The Identification of Context-Sensitive Features: A Formal Definition of
  Context for Concept Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A large body of research in machine learning is concerned with supervised
learning from examples. The examples are typically represented as vectors in a
multi-dimensional feature space (also known as attribute-value descriptions). A
teacher partitions a set of training examples into a finite number of classes.
The task of the learning algorithm is to induce a concept from the training
examples. In this paper, we formally distinguish three types of features:
primary, contextual, and irrelevant features. We also formally define what it
means for one feature to be context-sensitive to another feature.
Context-sensitive features complicate the task of the learner and potentially
impair the learner's performance. Our formal definitions make it possible for a
learner to automatically identify context-sensitive features. After
context-sensitive features have been identified, there are several strategies
that the learner can employ for managing the features; however, a discussion of
these strategies is outside of the scope of this paper. The formal definitions
presented here correct a flaw in previously proposed definitions. We discuss
the relationship between our work and a formal definition of relevance.

 <dc:description>  The Inductive Logic Programming community has considered proof-complexity and
model-complexity, but, until recently, size-complexity has received little
attention. Recently a challenge was issued &quot;to the international computing
community&quot; to discover low size-complexity Prolog programs for classifying
trains. The challenge was based on a problem first proposed by Ryszard
Michalski, 20 years ago. We interpreted the challenge as a problem in
cost-sensitive classification and we applied a recently developed
cost-sensitive classifier to the competition. Our algorithm was relatively
successful (we won a prize). This paper presents our algorithm and analyzes the
results of the competition.

 <dc:description>  We have analyzed manufacturing data from several different semiconductor
manufacturing plants, using decision tree induction software called Q-YIELD.
The software generates rules for predicting when a given product should be
rejected. The rules are intended to help the process engineers improve the
yield of the product, by helping them to discover the causes of rejection.
Experience with Q-YIELD has taught us the importance of data engineering --
preprocessing the data to enable or facilitate decision tree induction. This
paper discusses some of the data engineering problems we have encountered with
semiconductor manufacturing data. The paper deals with two broad classes of
problems: engineering the features in a feature vector representation and
engineering the definition of the target concept (the classes). Manufacturing
process data present special problems for feature engineering, since the data
have multiple levels of granularity (detail, resolution). Engineering the
target concept is important, due to our focus on understanding the past, as
opposed to the more common focus in machine learning on predicting the future.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of classifying observations when features
are context-sensitive, especially when the testing set involves a context that
is different from the training set. The paper begins with a precise definition
of the problem, then general strategies are presented for enhancing the
performance of classification algorithms on this type of problem. These
strategies are tested on three domains. The first domain is the diagnosis of
gas turbine engines. The problem is to diagnose a faulty engine in one context,
such as warm weather, when the fault has previously been seen only in another
context, such as cold weather. The second domain is speech recognition. The
context is given by the identity of the speaker. The problem is to recognize
words spoken by a new speaker, not represented in the training set. The third
domain is medical prognosis. The problem is to predict whether a patient with
hepatitis will live or die. The context is the age of the patient. For all
three domains, exploiting context results in substantially more accurate
classification.

 <dc:description>  Evolvability is the capacity to evolve. This paper introduces a simple
computational model of evolvability and demonstrates that, under certain
conditions, evolvability can increase indefinitely, even when there is no
direct selection for evolvability. The model shows that increasing evolvability
implies an accelerating evolutionary pace. It is suggested that the conditions
for indefinitely increasing evolvability are satisfied in biological and
cultural evolution. We claim that increasing evolvability is a large-scale
trend in evolution. This hypothesis leads to testable predictions about
biological and cultural evolution.

 <dc:description>  This paper solves the problem of computing conformal structures of general
2-manifolds represented as triangle meshes. We compute conformal structures in
the following way: first compute homology bases from simplicial complex
structures, then construct dual cohomology bases and diffuse them to harmonic
1-forms. Next, we construct bases of holomorphic differentials. We then obtain
period matrices by integrating holomorphic differentials along homology bases.
We also study the global conformal mapping between genus zero surfaces and
spheres, and between general meshes and planes. Our method of computing
conformal structures can be applied to tackle fundamental problems in computer
aid design and computer graphics, such as geometry classification and
identification, and surface global parametrization.

 <dc:description>  We consider geometric instances of the Maximum Weighted Matching Problem
(MWMP) and the Maximum Traveling Salesman Problem (MTSP) with up to 3,000,000
vertices. Making use of a geometric duality relationship between MWMP, MTSP,
and the Fermat-Weber-Problem (FWP), we develop a heuristic approach that yields
in near-linear time solutions as well as upper bounds. Using various
computational tools, we get solutions within considerably less than 1% of the
optimum.
  An interesting feature of our approach is that, even though an FWP is hard to
compute in theory and Edmonds' algorithm for maximum weighted matching yields a
polynomial solution for the MWMP, the practical behavior is just the opposite,
and we can solve the FWP with high accuracy in order to find a good heuristic
solution for the MWMP.

 <dc:description>  Community identification algorithms have been used to enhance the quality of
the services perceived by its users. Although algorithms for community have a
widespread use in the Web, their application to portals or specific subsets of
the Web has not been much studied. In this paper, we propose a technique for
local community identification that takes into account user access behavior
derived from access logs of servers in the Web. The technique takes a departure
from the existing community algorithms since it changes the focus of in terest,
moving from authors to users. Our approach does not use relations imposed by
authors (e.g. hyperlinks in the case of Web pages). It uses information derived
from user accesses to a service in order to infer relationships. The
communities identified are of great interest to content providers since they
can be used to improve quality of their services. We also propose an evaluation
methodology for analyzing the results obtained by the algorithm. We present two
case studies based on actual data from two services: an online bookstore and an
online radio. The case of the online radio is particularly relevant, because it
emphasizes the contribution of the proposed algorithm to find out communities
in an environment (i.e., streaming media service) without links, that represent
the relations imposed by authors (e.g. hyperlinks in the case of Web pages).

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new approach for drawing diagrams that have
applications in software visualization. Our approach is to use a technique we
call confluent drawing for visualizing non-planar diagrams in a planar way.
This approach allows us to draw, in a crossing-free manner, graphs--such as
software interaction diagrams--that would normally have many crossings. The
main idea of this approach is quite simple: we allow groups of edges to be
merged together and drawn as &quot;tracks&quot; (similar to train tracks). Producing such
confluent diagrams automatically from a graph with many crossings is quite
challenging, however, so we offer two heuristic algorithms to test if a
non-planar graph can be drawn efficiently in a confluent way. In addition, we
identify several large classes of graphs that can be completely categorized as
being either confluently drawable or confluently non-drawable.

 <dc:description>  In this note we show that local equilibrium equations (the generalization of
the TAP equations or of the belief propagation equations) do have solutions in
the colorable phase of the coloring problem. The same results extend to other
optimization problems where the solutions has cost zero (e.g.
K-satisfiability). On a random graph the solutions of the local equilibrium
equations are associated to clusters of configurations (clustering states). On
a random graph the local equilibrium equations have solutions almost everywhere
in the uncolored phase; in this case we have to introduce the concept
quasi-solution of the local equilibrium equations.

 <dc:description>  In previous work, we introduced the notion of functional strategies:
first-class generic functions that can traverse terms of any type while mixing
uniform and type-specific behaviour. Functional strategies transpose the notion
of term rewriting strategies (with coverage of traversal) to the functional
programming paradigm. Meanwhile, a number of Haskell-based models and
combinator suites were proposed to support generic programming with functional
strategies.
  In the present paper, we provide a compact and matured reconstruction of
functional strategies. We capture strategic polymorphism by just two primitive
combinators. This is done without commitment to a specific functional language.
We analyse the design space for implementational models of functional
strategies. For completeness, we also provide an operational reference model
for implementing functional strategies (in Haskell). We demonstrate the
generality of our approach by reconstructing representative fragments of the
Strafunski library for functional strategies.

 <dc:title>An Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse Game Approach to Collapse Results in Database

 <dc:description>  We present a new Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game approach to collapse results in
database theory and we show that, in principle, this approach suffices to prove
every natural generic collapse result. Following this approach we can deal with
certain infinite databases where previous, highly involved methods fail. We
prove the natural generic collapse for Z-embeddable databases over any linearly
ordered context structure with arbitrary monadic predicates, and for
N-embeddable databases over the context structure (R,&lt;,+,Mon_Q,Groups). Here,
N, Z, R, denote the sets of natural numbers, integers, and real numbers,
respectively. Groups is the collection of all subgroups of (R,+) that contain
Z, and Mon_Q is the collection of all subsets of a particular infinite subset Q
of N. Restricting the complexity of the formulas that may be used to formulate
queries to Boolean combinations of purely existential first-order formulas, we
even obtain the collapse for N-embeddable databases over any linearly ordered
context structure with arbitrary predicates. Finally, we develop the notion of
N-representable databases, which is a natural generalization of the classical
notion of finitely representable databases. We show that natural generic
collapse results for N-embeddable databases can be lifted to the larger class
of N-representable databases. To obtain, in particular, the collapse result for
(N,&lt;,+,Mon_Q), we explicitly construct a winning strategy for the duplicator in
the presence of the built-in addition relation +. This, as a side product, also
leads to an Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game proof of the theorem of Ginsburg and
Spanier, stating that the spectra of FO(&lt;,+)-sentences are semi-linear.

 <dc:description>  Comprehensive semantic descriptions of Web services are essential to exploit
them in their full potential, that is, discovering them dynamically, and
enabling automated service negotiation, composition and monitoring. The
semantic mechanisms currently available in service registries which are based
on taxonomies fail to provide the means to achieve this. Although the terms
taxonomy and ontology are sometimes used interchangably there is a critical
difference. A taxonomy indicates only class/subclass relationship whereas an
ontology describes a domain completely. The essential mechanisms that ontology
languages provide include their formal specification (which allows them to be
queried) and their ability to define properties of classes. Through properties
very accurate descriptions of services can be defined and services can be
related to other services or resources. In this paper, we discuss the
advantages of describing service semantics through ontology languages and
describe how to relate the semantics defined with the services advertised in
service registries like UDDI and ebXML.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe a framework for exploiting the semantics of Web
services through UDDI registries. As a part of this framework, we extend the
DAML-S upper ontology to describe the functionality we find essential for
e-businesses. This functionality includes relating the services with electronic
catalogs, describing the complementary services and finding services according
to the properties of products or services. Once the semantics is defined, there
is a need for a mechanism in the service registry to relate it with the service
advertised. The ontology model developed is general enough to be used with any
service registry. However when it comes to relating the semantics with services
advertised, the capabilities provided by the registry effects how this is
achieved. We demonstrate how to integrate the described service semantics to
UDDI registries.

 <dc:description>  Belief integration methods are often aimed at deriving a single and
consistent knowledge base that retains as much as possible of the knowledge
bases to integrate. The rationale behind this approach is the minimal change
principle: the result of the integration process should differ as less as
possible from the knowledge bases to integrate. We show that this principle can
be reformulated in terms of a more general model of belief revision, based on
the assumption that inconsistency is due to the mistakes the knowledge bases
contain. Current belief revision strategies are based on a specific kind of
mistakes, which however does not include all possible ones. Some alternative
possibilities are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Let $G$ be an $n$-node planar graph. In a visibility representation of $G$,
each node of $G$ is represented by a horizontal line segment such that the line
segments representing any two adjacent nodes of $G$ are vertically visible to
each other. In the present paper we give the best known compact visibility
representation of $G$. Given a canonical ordering of the triangulated $G$, our
algorithm draws the graph incrementally in a greedy manner. We show that one of
three canonical orderings obtained from Schnyder's realizer for the
triangulated $G$ yields a visibility representation of $G$ no wider than
$\frac{22n-40}{15}$. Our easy-to-implement O(n)-time algorithm bypasses the
complicated subroutines for four-connected components and four-block trees
required by the best previously known algorithm of Kant. Our result provides a
negative answer to Kant's open question about whether $\frac{3n-6}{2}$ is a
worst-case lower bound on the required width. Also, if $G$ has no degree-three
(respectively, degree-five) internal node, then our visibility representation
for $G$ is no wider than $\frac{4n-9}{3}$ (respectively, $\frac{4n-7}{3}$).
Moreover, if $G$ is four-connected, then our visibility representation for $G$
is no wider than $n-1$, matching the best known result of Kant and He. As a
by-product, we obtain a much simpler proof for a corollary of Wagner's Theorem
on realizers, due to Bonichon, Sa\&quot;{e}c, and Mosbah.

 <dc:description>  Theoretical computer science has found fertile ground in many areas of
mathematics. The approach has been to consider classical problems through the
prism of computational complexity, where the number of basic computational
steps taken to solve a problem is the crucial qualitative parameter. This new
approach has led to a sequence of advances, in setting and solving new
mathematical challenges as well as in harnessing discrete mathematics to the
task of solving real-world problems.
  In this talk, I will survey the development of modern cryptography -- the
mathematics behind secret communications and protocols -- in this light. I will
describe the complexity theoretic foundations underlying the cryptographic
tasks of encryption, pseudo-randomness number generators and functions, zero
knowledge interactive proofs, and multi-party secure protocols. I will attempt
to highlight the paradigms and proof techniques which unify these foundations,
and which have made their way into the mainstream of complexity theory.

 <dc:title>On the Work of Madhu Sudan: the 2002 Nevalinna Prize Winner</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Madhu Sudan's work spans many areas of computer science theory including
computational complexity theory, the design of efficient algorithms,
algorithmic coding theory, and the theory of program checking and correcting.
  Two results of Sudan stand out in the impact they have had on the mathematics
of computation. The first work shows a probabilistic characterization of the
class NP -- those sets for which short and easily checkable proofs of
membership exist, and demonstrates consequences of this characterization to
classifying the complexity of approximation problems. The second work shows a
polynomial time algorithm for list decoding the Reed Solomon error correcting
codes.
  This short note will be devoted to describing Sudan's work on
probabilistically checkable proofs -- the so called {\it PCP theorem} and its
implications.

 <dc:title>Practical and Robust Stenciled Shadow Volumes for Hardware-Accelerated

 <dc:description>  Twenty-five years ago, Crow published the shadow volume approach for
determining shadowed regions in a scene. A decade ago, Heidmann described a
hardware-accelerated stencil buffer-based shadow volume algorithm.
  Unfortunately hardware-accelerated stenciled shadow volume techniques have
not been widely adopted by 3D games and applications due in large part to the
lack of robustness of described techniques. This situation persists despite
widely available hardware support. Specifically what has been lacking is a
technique that robustly handles various &quot;hard&quot; situations created by near or
far plane clipping of shadow volumes.
  We describe a robust, artifact-free technique for hardware-accelerated
rendering of stenciled shadow volumes. Assuming existing hardware, we resolve
the issues otherwise caused by shadow volume near and far plane clipping
through a combination of (1) placing the conventional far clip plane &quot;at
infinity&quot;, (2) rasterization with infinite shadow volume polygons via
homogeneous coordinates, and (3) adopting a zfail stencil-testing scheme. Depth
clamping, a new rasterization feature provided by NVIDIA's GeForce3, preserves
existing depth precision by not requiring the far plane to be placed at
infinity. We also propose two-sided stencil testing to improve the efficiency
of rendering stenciled shadow volumes.

 <dc:description>  Flavor (Formal Language for Audio-Visual Object Representation) has been
created as a language for describing coded multimedia bitstreams in a formal
way so that the code for reading and writing bitstreams can be automatically
generated. It is an extension of C++ and Java, in which the typing system
incorporates bitstream representation semantics. This allows describing in a
single place both the in-memory representation of data as well as their
bitstream-level (compressed) representation. Flavor also comes with a
translator that automatically generates standard C++ or Java code from the
Flavor source code so that direct access to compressed multimedia information
by application developers can be achieved with essentially zero programming.
Flavor has gone through many enhancements and this paper fully describes the
latest version of the language and the translator. The software has been made
into an open source project as of Version 4.1, and the latest downloadable
Flavor package is available at http://flavor.sourceforge.net.

 <dc:description>  It has been suggested in voice over IP that an appropriate choice of the
distribution used in modeling the delay jitters, can improve the play-out
algorithm. In this paper, we propose a tool using which, one can determine, at
a given instance, which distribution model best explains the jitter
distribution. This is done using Expectation Maximization, to choose amongst
possible distribution models which include, the i.i.d exponential distribution,
the gamma distribution etc.

 <dc:description>  Optimization of decision problems in stochastic environments is usually
concerned with maximizing the probability of achieving the goal and minimizing
the expected episode length. For interacting agents in time-critical
applications, learning of the possibility of scheduling of subtasks (events) or
the full task is an additional relevant issue. Besides, there exist highly
stochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from
episode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of
time. The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g.,
planning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work,
formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the
duration of events are derived. The emerging Bellman-type equation is a simple
extension of Sobel's work (1982). Methods of dynamic programming as well as
methods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. Computer
demonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle.

 <dc:description>  There is a growing interest in using Kalman-filter models in brain modelling.
In turn, it is of considerable importance to make Kalman-filters amenable for
reinforcement learning. In the usual formulation of optimal control it is
computed off-line by solving a backward recursion. In this technical note we
show that slight modification of the linear-quadratic-Gaussian Kalman-filter
model allows the on-line estimation of optimal control and makes the bridge to
reinforcement learning. Moreover, the learning rule for value estimation
assumes a Hebbian form weighted by the error of the value estimation.

 <dc:description>  We relate two formerly independent areas: Formal concept analysis and logic
of domains. We will establish a correspondene between contextual attribute
logic on formal contexts resp. concept lattices and a clausal logic on coherent
algebraic cpos. We show how to identify the notion of formal concept in the
domain theoretic setting. In particular, we show that a special instance of the
resolution rule from the domain logic coincides with the concept closure
operator from formal concept analysis. The results shed light on the use of
contexts and domains for knowledge representation and reasoning purposes.

 <dc:description>  A Script Language in this paper is designed to transform the original data
into the target data by the computing formula. The Script Language can be
translated into the corresponding SQL Language, and the computation is finally
implemented by the first type of dynamic SQL. The Script Language has the
operations of insert, update, delete, union, intersect, and minus for the table
in the database.The Script Language is edited by a text file and you can easily
modify the computing formula in the text file to deal with the situations when
the computing formula have been changed. So you only need modify the text of
the script language, but needn't change the programs that have complied.

 <dc:description>  Much work has been done on extending the well-founded semantics to general
disjunctive logic programs and various approaches have been proposed. However,
these semantics are different from each other and no consensus is reached about
which semantics is the most intended. In this paper we look at disjunctive
well-founded reasoning from different angles. We show that there is an
intuitive form of the well-founded reasoning in disjunctive logic programming
which can be characterized by slightly modifying some exisitng approaches to
defining disjunctive well-founded semantics, including program transformations,
argumentation, unfounded sets (and resolution-like procedure). We also provide
a bottom-up procedure for this semantics. The significance of our work is not
only in clarifying the relationship among different approaches, but also shed
some light on what is an intended well-founded semantics for disjunctive logic
programs.

 <dc:description>  An Open Network Handle System (ONHS) provides an intermediate level of
service between IP numbers and domain names. A handle adheres permanently to an
owner, who may assign and reassign it to different addresses at will. But a
handle is a number, carrying no significance in natural language. Any user
desiring a handle may generate one from a public key. This memo describes a
simple implementation of an Open Network Handle System using the security
extensions to the Domain Name System (DNSSEC).

 <dc:description>  A bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland selection rule is an adaptive strategy for
recursively selecting a subsequence of an infinite binary sequence; such a
subsequence may be interpreted as the query sequence of a time-bounded Turing
machine. In this paper we show that if A is an algorithmically random sequence,
A_0 is selected from A via a bounded Kolmogorov-Loveland selection rule, and
A_1 denotes the sequence of nonselected bits of A, then A_1 is independent of
A_0; that is, A_1 is algorithmically random relative to A_0. This result has
been used by Kautz and Miltersen [1] to show that relative to a random oracle,
NP does not have p-measure zero (in the sense of Lutz [2]).

 <dc:description>  The probability of observing $x_t$ at time $t$, given past observations
$x_1...x_{t-1}$ can be computed with Bayes' rule if the true generating
distribution $\mu$ of the sequences $x_1x_2x_3...$ is known. If $\mu$ is
unknown, but known to belong to a class $M$ one can base ones prediction on the
Bayes mix $\xi$ defined as a weighted sum of distributions $\nu\in M$. Various
convergence results of the mixture posterior $\xi_t$ to the true posterior
$\mu_t$ are presented. In particular a new (elementary) derivation of the
convergence $\xi_t/\mu_t\to 1$ is provided, which additionally gives the rate
of convergence. A general sequence predictor is allowed to choose an action
$y_t$ based on $x_1...x_{t-1}$ and receives loss $\ell_{x_t y_t}$ if $x_t$ is
the next symbol of the sequence. No assumptions are made on the structure of
$\ell$ (apart from being bounded) and $M$. The Bayes-optimal prediction scheme
$\Lambda_\xi$ based on mixture $\xi$ and the Bayes-optimal informed prediction
scheme $\Lambda_\mu$ are defined and the total loss $L_\xi$ of $\Lambda_\xi$ is
bounded in terms of the total loss $L_\mu$ of $\Lambda_\mu$. It is shown that
$L_\xi$ is bounded for bounded $L_\mu$ and $L_\xi/L_\mu\to 1$ for $L_\mu\to
\infty$. Convergence of the instantaneous losses are also proven.

 <dc:description>  We prove lower bounds of order $n\log n$ for both the problem to multiply
polynomials of degree $n$, and to divide polynomials with remainder, in the
model of bounded coefficient arithmetic circuits over the complex numbers.
These lower bounds are optimal up to order of magnitude. The proof uses a
recent idea of R. Raz [Proc. 34th STOC 2002] proposed for matrix
multiplication. It reduces the linear problem to multiply a random circulant
matrix with a vector to the bilinear problem of cyclic convolution. We treat
the arising linear problem by extending J. Morgenstern's bound [J. ACM 20, pp.
305-306, 1973] in a unitarily invariant way. This establishes a new lower bound
on the bounded coefficient complexity of linear forms in terms of the singular
values of the corresponding matrix. In addition, we extend these lower bounds
for linear and bilinear maps to a model of circuits that allows a restricted
number of unbounded scalar multiplications.

 <dc:description>  XML is of great importance in information storage and retrieval because of
its recent emergence as a standard for data representation and interchange on
the Internet. However XML provides little semantic content and as a result
several papers have addressed the topic of how to improve the semantic
expressiveness of XML. Among the most important of these approaches has been
that of defining integrity constraints in XML. In a companion paper we defined
strong functional dependencies in XML(XFDs). We also presented a set of axioms
for reasoning about the implication of XFDs and showed that the axiom system is
sound for arbitrary XFDs. In this paper we prove that the axioms are also
complete for unary XFDs (XFDs with a single path on the l.h.s.). The second
contribution of the paper is to prove that the implication problem for unary
XFDs is decidable and to provide a linear time algorithm for it.

 <dc:description>  Grid infrastructures and computing environments have progressed significantly
in the past few years. The vision of truly seamless Grid usage relies on
runtime systems support that is cognizant of the operational issues underlying
grid computations and, at the same time, is flexible enough to accommodate
diverse application scenarios. This paper addresses the twin aspects of Grid
infrastructure and application support through a novel combination of two
computational technologies: Weaves - a source-language independent parallel
runtime compositional framework that operates through reverse-analysis of
compiled object files, and runtime recommender systems that aid in dynamic
knowledge-based application composition. Domain-specific adaptivity is
exploited through a novel compositional system that supports runtime
recommendation of code modules and a sophisticated checkpointing and runtime
migration solution that can be transparently deployed over Grid
infrastructures. A core set of &quot;adaptivity schemas&quot; are provided as templates
for adaptive composition of large-scale scientific computations. Implementation
issues, motivating application contexts, and preliminary results are described.

 <dc:description>  We perform a smoothed analysis of the termination phase of an interior-point
method. By combining this analysis with the smoothed analysis of Renegar's
interior-point algorithm by Dunagan, Spielman and Teng, we show that the
smoothed complexity of an interior-point algorithm for linear programming is $O
(m^{3} \log (m/\sigma))$. In contrast, the best known bound on the worst-case
complexity of linear programming is $O (m^{3} L)$, where $L$ could be as large
as $m$. We include an introduction to smoothed analysis and a tutorial on proof
techniques that have been useful in smoothed analyses.

 <dc:description>  We provide a semantic framework for preference handling in answer set
programming. To this end, we introduce preference preserving consequence
operators. The resulting fixpoint characterizations provide us with a uniform
semantic framework for characterizing preference handling in existing
approaches. Although our approach is extensible to other semantics by means of
an alternating fixpoint theory, we focus here on the elaboration of preferences
under answer set semantics. Alternatively, we show how these approaches can be
characterized by the concept of order preservation. These uniform semantic
characterizations provide us with new insights about interrelationships and
moreover about ways of implementation.

 <dc:description>  Immanants are polynomial functions of n by n matrices attached to irreducible
characters of the symmetric group S_n, or equivalently to Young diagrams of
size n. Immanants include determinants and permanents as extreme cases. Valiant
proved that computation of permanents is a complete problem in his algebraic
model of NP theory, i.e., it is VNP-complete. We prove that computation of
immanants is VNP-complete if the immanants are attached to a family of diagrams
whose separation is $\Omega(n^\delta)$ for some $\delta&gt;0$. We define the
separation of a diagram to be the largest number of overhanging boxes contained
in a single row. Our theorem proves a conjecture of Buergisser for a large
variety of families, and in particular we recover with new proofs his
VNP-completeness results for hooks and rectangles.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a simple and efficient strategy to obtain a data
structure generator to accomplish a perfect hash of quite general order
restricted multidimensional arrays named {\em phormas}. The constructor of such
objects gets two parameters as input: an n-vector a of non negative integers
and a boolean function B on the types of order restrictions on the coordinates
of the valid n-vectors bounded by a. At compiler time, the phorma constructor
builds, from the pair a,B, a digraph G(a,B) with a single source s and a single
sink t such that the st-paths are in 1-1 correspondence with the members of the
B-restricted a-bounded array A(a,B). Besides perfectly hashing A(a,B), G(a,B)
is an instance of an NW-family. This permits other useful computational tasks
on it.

 <dc:description>  This article answers two questions (posed in the literature), each concerning
the guaranteed existence of proofs free of double negation. A proof is free of
double negation if none of its deduced steps contains a term of the form
n(n(t)) for some term t, where n denotes negation. The first question asks for
conditions on the hypotheses that, if satisfied, guarantee the existence of a
double-negation-free proof when the conclusion is free of double negation. The
second question asks about the existence of an axiom system for classical
propositional calculus whose use, for theorems with a conclusion free of double
negation, guarantees the existence of a double-negation-free proof. After
giving conditions that answer the first question, we answer the second question
by focusing on the Lukasiewicz three-axiom system. We then extend our studies
to infinite-valued sentential calculus and to intuitionistic logic and
generalize the notion of being double-negation free. The double-negation proofs
of interest rely exclusively on the inference rule condensed detachment, a rule
that combines modus ponens with an appropriately general rule of substitution.
The automated reasoning program OTTER played an indispensable role in this
study.

 <dc:description>  The paper compares computational aspects of four approaches to compute
conservation laws of single differential equations (DEs) or systems of them,
ODEs and PDEs. The only restriction, required by two of the four corresponding
computer algebra programs, is that each DE has to be solvable for a leading
derivative. Extra constraints for the conservation laws can be specified.
Examples include new conservation laws that are non-polynomial in the
functions, that have an explicit variable dependence and families of
conservation laws involving arbitrary functions. The following equations are
investigated in examples: Ito, Liouville, Burgers, Kadomtsev-Petviashvili,
Karney-Sen-Chu-Verheest, Boussinesq, Tzetzeica, Benney.

 <dc:description>  A new integration technique is presented for systems of linear partial
differential equations (PDEs) for which syzygies can be formulated that obey
conservation laws. These syzygies come for free as a by-product of the
differential Groebner Basis computation. Compared with the more obvious way of
integrating a single equation and substituting the result in other equations
the new technique integrates more than one equation at once and therefore
introduces temporarily fewer new functions of integration that in addition
depend on fewer variables. Especially for high order PDE systems in many
variables the conventional integration technique may lead to an explosion of
the number of functions of integration which is avoided with the new method. A
further benefit is that redundant free functions in the solution are either
prevented or that their number is at least reduced.

 <dc:subject>I.1.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A method is presented that reduces the number of terms of systems of linear
equations (algebraic, ordinary and partial differential equations). As a
byproduct these systems have a tendency to become partially decoupled and are
more likely to be factorizable or integrable. A variation of this method is
applicable to non-linear systems. Modifications to improve efficiency are given
and examples are shown. This procedure can be used in connection with the
computation of the radical of a differential ideal (differential Groebner
basis).

 <dc:subject>G.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper performs the analysis necessary to bound the running time of
known, efficient algorithms for generating all longest common subsequences.
That is, we bound the running time as a function of input size for algorithms
with time essentially proportional to the output size. This paper considers
both the case of computing all distinct LCSs and the case of computing all LCS
embeddings. Also included is an analysis of how much better the efficient
algorithms are than the standard method of generating LCS embeddings. A full
analysis is carried out with running times measured as a function of the total
number of input characters, and much of the analysis is also provided for cases
in which the two input sequences are of the same specified length or of two
independently specified lengths.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers an example of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) leading
to subtle errors that break separation of interface and implementations. A
comprehensive principle that guards against such errors is undecidable. The
paper introduces a set of mechanically verifiable rules that prevent these
insidious problems. Although the rules seem restrictive, they are powerful and
expressive, as we show on several familiar examples. The rules contradict both
the spirit and the letter of the OOP. The present examples as well as available
theoretical and experimental results pose a question if OOP is conducive to
software development at all.

 <dc:description>  The National Fusion Collaboratory (NFC) project was created to advance
scientific understanding and innovation in magnetic fusion research by enabling
more efficient use of existing experimental facilities through more effective
integration of experiment, theory, and modeling. To achieve this objective, NFC
introduced the concept of &quot;network services&quot;, which build on top of
computational Grids, and provide Fusion codes, together with their maintenance
and hardware resources as a service to the community. This mode of operation
requires the development of new authorization and enforcement capabilities. In
addition, the nature of Fusion experiments places strident quality of service
requirements on codes run during the experimental cycle. In this paper, we
describe Grid computing requirements of the Fusion community, and present our
first experiments in meeting those requirements.

 <dc:description>  Message passing programs commonly use buffers to avoid unnecessary
synchronizations and to improve performance by overlapping communication with
computation. Unfortunately, using buffers makes the program no longer portable,
potentially unable to complete on systems without a sufficient number of
buffers. Effective buffer use entails that the minimum number needed for a safe
execution be allocated.
  We explore a variety of problems related to buffer allocation for safe and
efficient execution of message passing programs. We show that determining the
minimum number of buffers or verifying a buffer assignment are intractable
problems. However, we give a polynomial time algorithm to determine the minimum
number of buffers needed to allow for asynchronous execution. We extend these
results to several different buffering schemes, which in some cases make the
problems tractable.

 <dc:title>Many Hard Examples in Exact Phase Transitions with Application to

 <dc:description>  This paper first analyzes the resolution complexity of two random CSP models
(i.e. Model RB/RD) for which we can establish the existence of phase
transitions and identify the threshold points exactly. By encoding CSPs into
CNF formulas, it is proved that almost all instances of Model RB/RD have no
tree-like resolution proofs of less than exponential size. Thus, we not only
introduce new families of CNF formulas hard for resolution, which is a central
task of Proof-Complexity theory, but also propose models with both many hard
instances and exact phase transitions. Then, the implications of such models
are addressed. It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that an
application of Model RB/RD might be in the generation of hard satisfiable
instances, which is not only of practical importance but also related to some
open problems in cryptography such as generating one-way functions.
Subsequently, a further theoretical support for the generation method is shown
by establishing exponential lower bounds on the complexity of solving random
satisfiable and forced satisfiable instances of RB/RD near the threshold.
Finally, conclusions are presented, as well as a detailed comparison of Model
RB/RD with the Hamiltonian cycle problem and random 3-SAT, which, respectively,
exhibit three different kinds of phase transition behavior in NP-complete
problems.

 <dc:description>  GoTools is a program which solves life &amp; death problems in the game of Go.
This paper describes experiments using a Genetic Algorithm to optimize
heuristic weights used by GoTools' tree-search. The complete set of heuristic
weights is composed of different subgroups, each of which can be optimized with
a suitable fitness function. As a useful side product, an MPI interface for
FreePascal was implemented to allow the use of a parallelized fitness function
running on a Beowulf cluster. The aim of this exercise is to optimize the
current version of GoTools, and to make tools available in preparation of an
extension of GoTools for solving open boundary life &amp; death problems, which
will introduce more heuristic parameters to be fine tuned.

 <dc:description>  An overview of some methods of statistical physics applied to the analysis of
algorithms for optimization problems (satisfiability of Boolean constraints,
vertex cover of graphs, decoding, ...) with distributions of random inputs is
proposed. Two types of algorithms are analyzed: complete procedures with
backtracking (Davis-Putnam-Loveland-Logeman algorithm) and incomplete, local
search procedures (gradient descent, random walksat, ...). The study of
complete algorithms makes use of physical concepts such as phase transitions,
dynamical renormalization flow, growth processes, ... As for local search
procedures, the connection between computational complexity and the structure
of the cost function landscape is questioned, with emphasis on the notion of
metastability.

 <dc:description>  Regular expression patterns are a key feature of document processing
languages like Perl and XDuce. It is in this context that the first and longest
match policies have been proposed to disambiguate the pattern matching process.
We formally define a matching semantics with these policies and show that the
generally accepted method of simulating longest match by first match and
recursion is incorrect. We continue by solving the associated type inference
problem, which consists in calculating for every subexpression the set of words
the subexpression can still match when these policies are in effect, and show
how this algorithm can be used to efficiently implement the matching process.

 <dc:description>  We propose an assembly algorithm {\sc Barnacle} for sequences generated by
the clone-based approach. We illustrate our approach by assembling the human
genome. Our novel method abandons the original physical-mapping-first
framework. As we show, {\sc Barnacle} more effectively resolves conflicts due
to repeated sequences. The latter is the main difficulty of the sequence
assembly problem. Inaddition, we are able to detect inconsistencies in the
underlying data. We present and compare our results on the December 2001 freeze
of the public working draft of the human genome with NCBI's assembly (Build
28).
  The assembly of December 2001 freeze of the public working draft generated by
{\sc Barnacle} and the source code of {\sc Barnacle} are available at
(http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~vchoi).

 <dc:description>  As Grids are emerging as the next generation service-oriented computing
platforms, they need to support Grid economy that helps in the management of
supply and demand for resources and offers an economic incentive for Grid
resource providers. To enable this Grid economy, a market-like Grid environment
including an infrastructure that supports the publication of services and their
discovery is needed. As part of the Gridbus project, we proposed and have
developed a Grid Market Directory (GMD) that serves as a registry for
high-level service publication and discovery in Virtual Organisations.

 <dc:description>  Computational Grids are emerging as a platform for next-generation parallel
and distributed computing. Large-scale parametric studies and parameter sweep
applications find a natural place in the Grid?s distribution model. There is
little or no communication between jobs. The task of parallelizing and
distributing existing applications is conceptually trivial. These properties of
parametric studies make it an ideal place to start developing integrated
development environments (IDEs) for rapidly Grid-enabling applications.
However, the availability of IDEs for scientists to Grid-enable their
applications, without the need of developing them as parallel applications
explicitly, is still lacking. This paper presents a Java based IDE called
Visual Parametric Tool (VPT), developed as part of the Gridbus project, for
rapid creation of parameter sweep (data parallel/SPMD) applications. It
supports automatic creation of parameter script and parameterisation of the
input data files, which is compatible with the Nimrod-G parameter specification
language. The usefulness of VPT is demonstrated by a case study on composition
of molecular docking application as a parameter sweep application. Such
applications can be deployed on clusters using the Nimrod/enFuzion system and
on global Grids using the Nimrod-G grid resource broker.

 <dc:description>  We discuss a problem of handling resource reservations. The resource can be
reserved for some time, it can be freed or it can be queried what is the
largest amount of reserved resource during a time interval. We show that the
problem has a lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ per operation on average and we
give a matching upper bound algorithm. Our solution also solves a dynamic
version of the related problems of a prefix sum and a partial sum.

 <dc:description>  In this work we describe, design and analyze the security of a
tamper-evident, append-only data structure for maintaining secure data
sequences in a loosely coupled distributed system where individual system
components may be mutually distrustful. The resulting data structure, called an
Authenticated Append-Only Skip List (AASL), allows its maintainers to produce
one-way digests of the entire data sequence, which they can publish to others
as a commitment on the contents and order of the sequence. The maintainer can
produce efficiently succinct proofs that authenticate a particular datum in a
particular position of the data sequence against a published digest. AASLs are
secure against tampering even by malicious data structure maintainers. First,
we show that a maintainer cannot ``invent'' and authenticate data elements for
the AASL after he has committed to the structure. Second, he cannot equivocate
by being able to prove conflicting facts about a particular position of the
data sequence. This is the case even when the data sequence grows with time and
its maintainer publishes successive commitments at times of his own choosing.
  AASLs can be invaluable in reasoning about the integrity of system logs
maintained by untrusted components of a loosely-coupled distributed system.

 <dc:description>  Most traditional artificial intelligence (AI) systems of the past 50 years
are either very limited, or based on heuristics, or both. The new millennium,
however, has brought substantial progress in the field of theoretically optimal
and practically feasible algorithms for prediction, search, inductive inference
based on Occam's razor, problem solving, decision making, and reinforcement
learning in environments of a very general type. Since inductive inference is
at the heart of all inductive sciences, some of the results are relevant not
only for AI and computer science but also for physics, provoking nontraditional
predictions based on Zuse's thesis of the computer-generated universe.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe an algorithm for aligning sentences with their
translations in a bilingual corpus using lexical information of the languages.
Existing efficient algorithms ignore word identities and consider only the
sentence lengths (Brown, 1991; Gale and Church, 1993). For a sentence in the
source language text, the proposed algorithm picks the most likely translation
from the target language text using lexical information and certain heuristics.
It does not do statistical analysis using sentence lengths. The algorithm is
language independent. It also aids in detecting addition and deletion of text
in translations. The algorithm gives comparable results with the existing
algorithms in most of the cases while it does better in cases where statistical
algorithms do not give good results.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel structure, the data-sharing graph, for characterizing
sharing patterns in large-scale data distribution systems. We analyze this
structure in two such systems and uncover small-world patterns for data-sharing
relationships. Using the data-sharing graph for system characterization has
potential both for basic science, because we can identify new structures
emerging in real, dynamic networks; and for system design, because we can
exploit these structures when designing data location and delivery mechanisms.
We conjecture that similar patterns arise in other large-scale systems and that
these patterns can be exploited for mechanism design.

 <dc:title>A Proposal to Separate Handles from Names on the Internet</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>O'Donnell, Michael J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Networked communications inherently depend on the ability of the sender of a
message to indicate through some token how the message should be delivered to a
particular recipient. The tokens that refer messages to recipients are
variously known as routes, addresses,handles, and names} ordered by their
relative nearness to network topology vs. human meaning. All four sorts of
token refer in some way to a recipient, but they are controlled by different
authorities and their meanings depend on different contextual parameters.
  Today's global Internet employs dynamically determined routes, IP addresses,
and domain names. Domain names combine the functions of handles and names. The
high value of domain names as names leads to substantial social and legal
dispute about their assignment, degrading their value as handles. The time has
come to provide a distinct open network handle system (ONHS), using handles
that are not meaningful in natural language and are therefore not subject to
the disputes surrounding the use of names.
  A handle service may be deployed easily as a handle domain within the current
Domain Name System. In order to minimize the administrative load, and maximize
their own autonomy, netizens may use public-key cryptography to assign their
own handles.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of the Internet, search engines have begun sprouting like
mushrooms after a rainfall. Only in recent years, have developers become more
innovative, and came up with guided searching facilities online. The goals of
these applications are to help ease and guide the searching efforts of a novice
web user toward their desired objectives. A number of implementations of such
services are emerging. This paper proposes a guided meta-search engine, called
&quot;Guided Google&quot;, as it serves as an interface to the actual Google.com search
engine, using the Google Web Services.

 <dc:description>  The lack of computational power within an organization for analyzing
scientific data, and the distribution of knowledge (by scientists) and
technologies (advanced scientific devices) are two major problems commonly
observed in scientific disciplines. One such scientific discipline is brain
science. The analysis of brain activity data gathered from the MEG
(Magnetoencephalography) instrument is an important research topic in medical
science since it helps doctors in identifying symptoms of diseases. The data
needs to be analyzed exhaustively to efficiently diagnose and analyze brain
functions and requires access to large-scale computational resources. The
potential platform for solving such resource intensive applications is the
Grid. This paper describes a MEG data analysis system developed by us,
leveraging Grid technologies, primarily Nimrod-G, Gridbus, and Globus. This
paper explains the application of economy-based grid scheduling algorithms to
the problem domain for on-demand processing of analysis jobs.

 <dc:description>  Use of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) service networks introduces a new communication
paradigm because peers are both clients and servers and so each peer may
provide/request services to/from other peers. Empirical studies of P2P networks
have been undertaken and reveal useful characteristics. However there is to
date little analytical work to describe P2P networks with respect to their
communication paradigm and their interconnections. This paper provides an
analytical formulation and optimisation of peer connection efficiency, in terms
of minimising the fraction of wasted connection time. Peer connection
efficiency is analysed for both a uni- and multi-connected peer. Given this
fundamental optimisation, the paper optimises the number of connections that
peers should make use of as a function of network load, in terms of minimising
the total queue size that requests in the P2P network experience. The results
of this paper provide a basis for engineering high performance P2P
interconnection networks. The optimisations are useful for reducing bandwidth
and power consumption, e.g. in the case of peers being mobile devices with a
limited power supply. Also these results could be used to determine when a
(virtual) circuit should be switched to support a connection.

 <dc:description>  The Open Language Archives Community (OLAC) is an international partnership
of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of
language resources. The Dublin Core (DC) Element Set and the OAI Protocol have
provided a solid foundation for the OLAC framework. However, we need more
precision in community-specific aspects of resource description than is offered
by DC. Furthermore, many of the institutions and individuals who might
participate in OLAC do not have the technical resources to support the OAI
protocol. This paper presents our solutions to these two problems. To address
the first, we have developed an extensible application profile for language
resource metadata. To address the second, we have implemented Vida (the virtual
data provider) and Viser (the virtual service provider), which permit community
members to provide data and services without having to implement the OAI
protocol. These solutions are generic and could be adopted by other specialized
subcommunities.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of designing an overlay network and routing mechanism
that permits finding resources efficiently in a peer-to-peer system. We argue
that many existing approaches to this problem can be modeled as the
construction of a random graph embedded in a metric space whose points
represent resource identifiers, where the probability of a connection between
two nodes depends only on the distance between them in the metric space. We
study the performance of a peer-to-peer system where nodes are embedded at grid
points in a simple metric space: a one-dimensional real line. We prove upper
and lower bounds on the message complexity of locating particular resources in
such a system, under a variety of assumptions about failures of either nodes or
the connections between them. Our lower bounds in particular show that the use
of inverse power-law distributions in routing, as suggested by Kleinberg
(1999), is close to optimal. We also give efficient heuristics to dynamically
maintain such a system as new nodes arrive and old nodes depart. Finally, we
give experimental results that suggest promising directions for future work.

 <dc:description>  We present a new method for segmenting, and a new user interface for indexing
and visualizing, the semantic content of extended instructional videos. Given a
series of key frames from the video, we generate a condensed view of the data
by clustering frames according to media type and visual similarities. Using
various visual filters, key frames are first assigned a media type (board,
class, computer, illustration, podium, and sheet). Key frames of media type
board and sheet are then clustered based on contents via an algorithm with
near-linear cost. A novel user interface, the result of two user studies,
displays related topics using icons linked topologically, allowing users to
quickly locate semantically related portions of the video. We analyze the
accuracy of the segmentation tool on 17 instructional videos, each of which is
from 75 to 150 minutes in duration (a total of 40 hours); the classification
accuracy exceeds 96%.

 <dc:description>  We develop cryptographically secure techniques to guarantee unconditional
privacy for respondents to polls. Our constructions are efficient and
practical, and are shown not to allow cheating respondents to affect the
``tally'' by more than their own vote -- which will be given the exact same
weight as that of other respondents. We demonstrate solutions to this problem
based on both traditional cryptographic techniques and quantum cryptography.

 <dc:description>  The article deals with a kind of recursive function templates in C++, where
the recursion is realized corresponding template parameters to achieve better
computational performance. Some specialization of these template functions ends
the recursion and can be implemented using optimized hardware dependent or
independent routines. The method is applied in addition to the known expression
templates technique to solve linear algebra expressions with the help of the
BLAS library. The whole implementation produces a new library, which keeps
object-oriented benefits and has a higher computational speed represented in
the tests.

 <dc:description>  Among their many uses, growth processes (probabilistic amplification), were
used for constructing reliable networks from unreliable components, and
deriving complexity bounds of various classes of functions. Hence, determining
the initial conditions for such processes is an important and challenging
problem. In this paper we characterize growth processes by their initial
conditions and derive conditions under which results such as Valiant's (1984)
hold. First, we completely characterize growth processes that use linear
connectives. Second, by extending Savick\'y's (1990) analysis, via
``Restriction Lemmas'', we characterize growth processes that use monotone
connectives, and show that our technique is applicable to growth processes that
use other connectives as well. Additionally, we obtain explicit bounds on the
convergence rates of several growth processes, including the growth process
studied by Savick\'y (1990).

 <dc:title>Defeasible Logic Programming: An Argumentative Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The work reported here introduces Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP), a
formalism that combines results of Logic Programming and Defeasible
Argumentation. DeLP provides the possibility of representing information in the
form of weak rules in a declarative manner, and a defeasible argumentation
inference mechanism for warranting the entailed conclusions.
  In DeLP an argumentation formalism will be used for deciding between
contradictory goals. Queries will be supported by arguments that could be
defeated by other arguments. A query q will succeed when there is an argument A
for q that is warranted, ie, the argument A that supports q is found undefeated
by a warrant procedure that implements a dialectical analysis.
  The defeasible argumentation basis of DeLP allows to build applications that
deal with incomplete and contradictory information in dynamic domains. Thus,
the resulting approach is suitable for representing agent's knowledge and for
providing an argumentation based reasoning mechanism to agents.

 <dc:description>  We show how to find a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph of degree at most three
with n vertices, in time O(2^{n/3}) ~= 1.260^n and linear space. Our algorithm
can find the minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle (traveling salesman problem), in
the same time bound. We can also count or list all Hamiltonian cycles in a
degree three graph in time O(2^{3n/8}) ~= 1.297^n. We also solve the traveling
salesman problem in graphs of degree at most four, by randomized and
deterministic algorithms with runtime O((27/4)^{n/3}) ~= 1.890^n and
O((27/4+epsilon)^{n/3}) respectively. Our algorithms allow the input to specify
a set of forced edges which must be part of any generated cycle. Our cycle
listing algorithm shows that every degree three graph has O(2^{3n/8})
Hamiltonian cycles; we also exhibit a family of graphs with 2^{n/3} Hamiltonian
cycles per graph.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a new approach to experimentally estimate the
application schedulability for various processor frequencies. We use additional
workload generated by an artificial high priority routine to simulate the
frequency decrease of a processor. Then we estimate the schedulability of
applications at different frequencies. The results of such estimation can be
used to determine the frequencies and control algorithms of dynamic voltage
scaling/dynamic frequency scaling (DVS/DFS) implementations. The paper presents
a general problem description, the proposed schedulability estimation method,
its analysis and evaluation.

 <dc:description>  We show that, for the purpose of pricing Swaptions, the Swap rate and the
corresponding Forward rates can be considered lognormal under a single
martingale measure. Swaptions can then be priced as options on a basket of
lognormal assets and an approximation formula is derived for such options. This
formula is centered around a Black-Scholes price with an appropriate
volatility, plus a correction term that can be interpreted as the expected
tracking error. The calibration problem can then be solved very efficiently
using semidefinite programming.

 <dc:title>Risk-Management Methods for the Libor Market Model Using Semidefinite

 <dc:description>  When interest rate dynamics are described by the Libor Market Model as in
BGM97, we show how some essential risk-management results can be obtained from
the dual of the calibration program. In particular, if the objetive is to
maximize another swaption's price, we show that the optimal dual variables
describe a hedging portfolio in the sense of \cite{Avel96}. In the general
case, the local sensitivity of the covariance matrix to all market movement
scenarios can be directly computed from the optimal dual solution. We also show
how semidefinite programming can be used to manage the Gamma exposure of a
portfolio.

 <dc:title>Constraint-based analysis of composite solvers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cooperative constraint solving is an area of constraint programming that
studies the interaction between constraint solvers with the aim of discovering
the interaction patterns that amplify the positive qualities of individual
solvers. Automatisation and formalisation of such studies is an important issue
of cooperative constraint solving.
  In this paper we present a constraint-based analysis of composite solvers
that integrates reasoning about the individual solvers and the processed data.
The idea is to approximate this reasoning by resolution of set constraints on
the finite sets representing the predicates that express all the necessary
properties. We illustrate application of our analysis to two important
cooperation patterns: deterministic choice and loop.

 <dc:description>  We propose variations of the class of hidden monomial cryptosystems in order
to make it resistant to all known attacks. We use identities built upon a
single bivariate polynomial equation with coefficients in a finite field.
Indeed, it can be replaced by a ``small'' ideal, as well. Throughout, we set up
probabilistic encryption protocols, too. The same ideas extend to digital
signature algorithms, as well. Our schemes work as well on differential fields
of positive characteristic, and elsewhere.

 <dc:description>  This note is about the relationship between two theories of negation as
failure -- one based on program completion, the other based on stable models,
or answer sets. Francois Fages showed that if a logic program satisfies a
certain syntactic condition, which is now called ``tightness,'' then its stable
models can be characterized as the models of its completion. We extend the
definition of tightness and Fages' theorem to programs with nested expressions
in the bodies of rules, and study tight logic programs containing the
definition of the transitive closure of a predicate.

 <dc:description>  There is a growing interest in using Kalman-filter models for brain
modelling. In turn, it is of considerable importance to represent Kalman-filter
in connectionist forms with local Hebbian learning rules. To our best
knowledge, Kalman-filter has not been given such local representation. It seems
that the main obstacle is the dynamic adaptation of the Kalman-gain. Here, a
connectionist representation is presented, which is derived by means of the
recursive prediction error method. We show that this method gives rise to
attractive local learning rules and can adapt the Kalman-gain.

 <dc:description>  In the first part of the paper, we present an (1+\mu)-approximation algorithm
to the minimum-spanning tree of points in a planar arrangement of lines, where
the metric is the number of crossings between the spanning tree and the lines.
The expected running time is O((n/\mu^5) alpha^3(n) log^5 n), where \mu &gt; 0 is
a prescribed constant.
  In the second part of our paper, we show how to embed such a crossing metric,
into high-dimensions, so that the distances are preserved. As a result, we can
deploy a large collection of subquadratic approximations algorithms \cite
im-anntr-98,giv-rahdg-99 for problems involving points with the crossing metric
as a distance function. Applications include matching, clustering,
nearest-neighbor, and furthest-neighbor.

 <dc:description>  In this paper I present a first attempt for a possible description of fluids
dynamics by mean of a cellular automata technique. With the use of simple and
elementary rules, based on random behaviour either, the model permits to obtain
the evolution in time for a two-dimensional grid, where one molecule of the
material fluid can ideally place itself on a single geometric square. By mean
of computational simulations, some realistic effects, here showed by use of
digital pictures, have been obtained. In a subsequent step of this work I think
to use a parallel program for a high performances computational simulation, for
increasing the degree of realism of the digital rendering by mean of a
three-dimensional grid too. For the execution of the simulations, numerical
methods of resolution for differential equations have not been used.

 <dc:description>  The detection of insufficiently resolved or ill-conditioned integrand
structures is critical for the reliability assessment of the quadrature rule
outputs. We discuss a method of analysis of the profile of the integrand at the
quadrature knots which allows inferences approaching the theoretical 100% rate
of success, under error estimate sharpening. The proposed procedure is of the
highest interest for the solution of parametric integrals arising in complex
physical models.

 <dc:description>  The reader-writer-problem is a standard problem in concurrent programming. A
resource is shared by several processes which need either inclusive reading or
exclusive writing access. The known solutions to this problem typically involve
a number of global counters and queues. Here a very simple algorithm is
presented which needs only two semaphores for synchronisation and no other
global objects. The approach yields a fair solution without starving.

 <dc:description>  We discuss philosophical issues concerning the notion of cognition basing
ourselves in experimental results in cognitive sciences, especially in computer
simulations of cognitive systems. There have been debates on the &quot;proper&quot;
approach for studying cognition, but we have realized that all approaches can
be in theory equivalent. Different approaches model different properties of
cognitive systems from different perspectives, so we can only learn from all of
them. We also integrate ideas from several perspectives for enhancing the
notion of cognition, such that it can contain other definitions of cognition as
special cases. This allows us to propose a simple classification of different
types of cognition.

 <dc:description>  The paper studies an implementation methodology for partial and disjunctive
stable models where partiality and disjunctions are unfolded from a logic
program so that an implementation of stable models for normal
(disjunction-free) programs can be used as the core inference engine. The
unfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial
stable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and
modular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial
stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models.
Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now
become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case.
Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be
determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an
implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine
for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is
demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of
disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine. The
performance of the resulting system is compared to that of dlv which is a
state-of-the-art special purpose system for disjunctive programs.

distributed systems, especially those employed in safety-critical environments,
should be able to operate properly even in the presence of software faults.
Monitoring the execution of a distributed system, and, on detecting a fault,
initiating the appropriate corrective action is an important way to tolerate
such faults. This gives rise to the predicate detection problem which requires
finding a consistent cut of a given computation that satisfies a given global
predicate, if it exists.
  Detecting a predicate in a computation is, however, an NP-complete problem.
To ameliorate the associated combinatorial explosion problem, we introduce the
notion of computation slice. Formally, the slice of a computation with respect
to a predicate is a (sub)computation with the least number of consistent cuts
that contains all consistent cuts of the computation satisfying the predicate.
To detect a predicate, rather than searching the state-space of the
computation, it is much more efficient to search the state-space of the slice.
  We prove that the slice exists and is uniquely defined for all predicates. We
present efficient slicing algorithms for several useful classes of predicates.
We develop efficient heuristic algorithms for computing an approximate slice
for predicates for which computing the slice is otherwise provably intractable.
Our experimental results show that slicing can lead to an exponential
improvement over existing techniques for predicate detection in terms of time
and space.

 <dc:description>  We present an efficient lock-free algorithm for parallel accessible hash
tables with open addressing, which promises more robust performance and
reliability than conventional lock-based implementations. ``Lock-free'' means
that it is guaranteed that always at least one process completes its operation
within a bounded number of steps. For a single processor architecture our
solution is as efficient as sequential hash tables. On a multiprocessor
architecture this is also the case when all processors have comparable speeds.
The algorithm allows processors that have widely different speeds or come to a
halt. It can easily be implemented using C-like languages and requires on
average only constant time for insertion, deletion or accessing of elements.
The algorithm allows the hash tables to grow and shrink when needed.
  Lock-free algorithms are hard to design correctly, even when apparently
straightforward. Ensuring the correctness of the design at the earliest
possible stage is a major challenge in any responsible system development. In
view of the complexity of the algorithm, we turned to the interactive theorem
prover PVS for mechanical support. We employ standard deductive verification
techniques to prove around 200 invariance properties of our algorithm, and
describe how this is achieved with the theorem prover PVS.

 <dc:title>Extending the code generation capabilities of the Together CASE tool to

 <dc:subject>D.2.2</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Together is the recommended software development tool in the Atlas
collaboration. The programmatic API, which provides the capability to use and
augment Together's internal functionality, is comprised of three major
components - IDE, RWI and SCI. IDE is a read-only interface used to generate
custom outputs based on the information contained in a Together model. RWI
allows to both extract and write information to a Together model. SCI is the
Source Code Interface, as the name implies it allows to work at the level of
the source code. Together is extended by writing modules (java classes)
extensively making use of the relevant API. We exploited Together extensibility
to add support for the Atlas Dictionary Language. ADL is an extended subset of
OMG IDL. The implemented module (ADLModule) makes Together to support ADL
keywords, enables options and generate ADL object descriptions directly from
UML Class diagrams. The module thoroughly accesses a Together reverse
engineered C++ project - and/or design only class diagrams - and it is general
enough to allow for possibly additional HEP-specific Together tool tailoring.

 <dc:description>  The aim of this paper is a theoretical study of a cache system in order to
optimize proxy cache systems and to modernize construction principles including
prefetching schemes. Two types of correlations, Zipf-like distribution and
normalizing conditions, play a role of the fundamental laws. A corresponding
system of equations allows to describe the basic effects like ratio between
construction parts, steady-state performance, optimal size, long-term
prefetching, etc. A modification of the fundamental laws leads to the
description of new effects of documents' renewal in the global network. An
internet traffic caching system based on Zipf-like distribution (ZBS) is
invented. The additional module to the cache construction gives an effective
prefetching by lifetime.

certain assumptions (known as Cartesian and radial functional models), we
derive asymptotic expressions for the bias and the covariance matrix of the
parameter estimates. We also extend Kanatani's version of the Cramer-Rao lower
bound, which he proved for unbiased estimates only, to more general estimates
that include many popular algorithms (most notably, the orthogonal least
squares and algebraic fits). We then show that the gradient-weighted algebraic
fit is statistically efficient and describe all other statistically efficient
algebraic fits.

 <dc:description>  Today's cluster computers suffer from slow I/O, which slows down
I/O-intensive applications. We show that fast disk I/O can be achieved by
operating a parallel file system over fast networks such as Myrinet or Gigabit
Ethernet.
  In this paper, we demonstrate how the ParaStation3 communication system helps
speed-up the performance of parallel I/O on clusters using the open source
parallel virtual file system (PVFS) as testbed and production system. We will
describe the set-up of PVFS on the Alpha-Linux-Cluster-Engine (ALiCE) located
at Wuppertal University, Germany. Benchmarks on ALiCE achieve
write-performances of up to 1 GB/s from a 32-processor compute-partition to a
32-processor PVFS I/O-partition, outperforming known benchmark results for PVFS
on the same network by more than a factor of 2. Read-performance from
buffer-cache reaches up to 2.2 GB/s. Our benchmarks are giant, I/O-intensive
eigenmode problems from lattice quantum chromodynamics, demonstrating stability
and performance of PVFS over Parastation in large-scale production runs.

 <dc:description>  It has been shown that a neural network model recently proposed to describe
basic memory performance is based on a ternary/binary coding/decoding algorithm
which leads to a new neural network assembly memory model (NNAMM) providing
maximum-likelihood recall/recognition properties and implying a new memory unit
architecture with Hopfield two-layer network, N-channel time gate, auxiliary
reference memory, and two nested feedback loops. For the data coding used,
conditions are found under which a version of Hopfied network implements
maximum-likelihood convolutional decoding algorithm and, simultaneously, linear
statistical classifier of arbitrary binary vectors with respect to Hamming
distance between vector analyzed and reference vector given. In addition to
basic memory performance and etc, the model explicitly describes the dependence
on time of memory trace retrieval, gives a possibility of one-trial learning,
metamemory simulation, generalized knowledge representation, and distinct
description of conscious and unconscious mental processes. It has been shown
that an assembly memory unit may be viewed as a model of a smallest inseparable
part or an 'atom' of consciousness. Some nontraditional neurobiological
backgrounds (dynamic spatiotemporal synchrony, properties of time dependent and
error detector neurons, early precise spike firing, etc) and the model's
application to solve some interdisciplinary problems from different scientific
fields are discussed.

 <dc:title>Multi-target particle filtering for the probability hypothesis density</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sidenbladh, Hedvig</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>G.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  When tracking a large number of targets, it is often computationally
expensive to represent the full joint distribution over target states. In cases
where the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a
separate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem.
Another approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track
only the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis
density (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the
expected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is
kept, the model-data association problem is avoided.
  The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD
filter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of
multiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show
that the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving
near-real-time performance.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers finite-automata based algorithms for handling linear
arithmetic with both real and integer variables. Previous work has shown that
this theory can be dealt with by using finite automata on infinite words, but
this involves some difficult and delicate to implement algorithms. The
contribution of this paper is to show, using topological arguments, that only a
restricted class of automata on infinite words are necessary for handling real
and integer linear arithmetic. This allows the use of substantially simpler
algorithms, which have been successfully implemented.

 <dc:description>  The study of Complex Systems is considered by many to be a new scientific
field, and is distinguished by being a discipline that has applications within
many separate areas of scientific study. The study of Neural Networks, Traffic
Patterns, Artificial Intelligence, Social Systems, and many other scientific
areas can all be considered to fall within the realm of Complex Systems, and
can be studied from this new perspective. The advent of more capable computer
systems has allowed these systems to be simulated and modeled with far greater
ease, and new understanding of computer modeling approaches has allowed the
fledgling science to be studied as never before.
  The preliminary focus of this paper will be to provide a general overview of
the science of Complex Systems, including terminology, definitions, history,
and examples. I will attempt to look at some of the most important trends in
different areas of research, and give a general overview of research methods
that have been used in parallel with computer modeling. Also, I will further
define the areas of the science that concern themselves with computer modeling
and simulation, and I will attempt to make it clear why the science only came
into its own when the proper modeling and simulation tools were finally
available. In addition, although there seems to be general agreement between
different authors and institutes regarding the generalities of the study, there
are some differences in terminology and methodology. I have attempted in this
paper to bring as many elements together as possible, as far as the scope of
the subject is concerned, without losing focus by studying Complex System
techniques that are bound to one particular area of scientific study, unless
that area is that of computer modeling.

given to demonstrate the usage of the R-calculus. The properties about
reachability and completeness of the R-calculus are formally defined and are

 <dc:description>  We extend a result of Goldreich and Ron about estimating the collision
probability of a hash function. Their estimate has a polynomial tail. We prove
that when the load factor is greater than a certain constant, the estimator has
a gaussian tail. As an application we find an estimate of an upper bound for
the average search time in hashing with chaining, for a particular user (we
allow the overall key distribution to be different from the key distribution of
a particular user). The estimator has a gaussian tail.

 <dc:description>  There is likeness of the Internet to human brains which has led to the
metaphor of the world-wide computer network as a `Global Brain'. We consider
conferences as 'binding events' in the Global Brain that can lead to
metacognitive structures on a global scale. One of the critical factors for
that phenomenon to happen (similar to the biological brain) are the time-scales
characteristic for the information exchange. In an electronic newsletter- the
Complexity Digest (ComDig) we include webcasting of audio (mp3) and video (asf)
files from international conferences in the weekly ComDig issues. Here we
present the time variation of the weekly rate of accesses to the conference
files. From those empirical data it appears that the characteristic time-scales
related to access of web-casting files is of the order of a few weeks. This is
at least an order of magnitude shorter than the characteristic time-scales of
peer reviewed publications and conference proceedings. We predict that this
observation will have profound implications on the nature of future conference
proceedings, presumably in electronic form.

 <dc:description>  We discuss design techniques for catadioptric sensors that realize given
projections. In general, these problems do not have solutions, but approximate
solutions may often be found that are visually acceptable. There are several
methods to approach this problem, but here we focus on what we call the
``vector field approach''. An application is given where a true panoramic
mirror is derived, i.e. a mirror that yields a cylindrical projection to the
viewer without any digital unwarping.

 <dc:description>  We present a fully automatic method for music classification, based only on
compression of strings that represent the music pieces. The method uses no
background knowledge about music whatsoever: it is completely general and can,
without change, be used in different areas like linguistic classification and
genomics. It is based on an ideal theory of the information content in
individual objects (Kolmogorov complexity), information distance, and a
universal similarity metric. Experiments show that the method distinguishes
reasonably well between various musical genres and can even cluster pieces by
composer.

 <dc:description>  The LOCKSS project has developed and deployed in a world-wide test a
peer-to-peer system for preserving access to journals and other archival
information published on the Web. It consists of a large number of independent,
low-cost, persistent web caches that cooperate to detect and repair damage to
their content by voting in &quot;opinion polls.&quot; Based on this experience, we
present a design for and simulations of a novel protocol for voting in systems
of this kind. It incorporates rate limitation and intrusion detection to ensure
that even some very powerful adversaries attacking over many years have only a
small probability of causing irrecoverable damage before being detected.

 <dc:description>  A number of recent studies of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems
level (AS graph) are based on the BGP-based AS connectivity maps (original
maps). The so-called extended maps use additional data sources and contain more
complete pictures of the AS graph. In this paper, we compare an original map,
an extended map and a synthetic map generated by the Barabasi-Albert model. We
examine the recently reported rich-club phenomenon, alternative routing paths
and attack tolerance. We point out that the majority of the missing links of
the original maps are the connecting links between rich nodes (nodes with large
numbers of links) of the extended maps. We show that the missing links are
relevant because links between rich nodes can be crucial for the network
structure.

 <dc:description>  The Internet topology at the Autonomous Systems level (AS graph) has a
power--law degree distribution and a tier structure. In this paper, we
introduce the Interactive Growth (IG) model based on the joint growth of new
nodes and new links. This simple and dynamic model compares favorable with
other Internet power--law topology generators because it not only closely
resembles the degree distribution of the AS graph, but also accurately matches
the hierarchical structure, which is measured by the recently reported
rich-club phenomenon.

 <dc:description>  Recently we introduced the rich-club phenomenon as a quantitative metric to
characterize the tier structure of the Autonomous Systems level Internet
topology (AS graph) and we proposed the Interactive Growth (IG) model, which
closely matches the degree distribution and hierarchical structure of the AS
graph and compares favourble with other available Internet power-law topology
generators. Our research was based on the widely used BGP AS graph obtained
from the Oregon BGP routing tables. Researchers argue that Traceroute AS graph,
extracted from the traceroute data collected by the CAIDA's active probing
tool, Skitter, is more complete and reliable. To be prudent, in this paper we
analyze and compare topological structures of Traceroute AS graph and BGP AS
graph. Also we compare with two synthetic Internet topologies generated by the
IG model and the well-known Barabasi-Albert (BA) model. Result shows that both
AS graphs show the rich-club phenomenon and have similar tier structures, which
are closely matched by the IG model, however the BA model does not show the
rich-club phenomenon at all.

 <dc:description>  We present Matrix Distributed Processing, a C++ library for fast development
of efficient parallel algorithms. MDP is based on MPI and consists of a
collection of C++ classes and functions such as lattice, site and field. Once
an algorithm is written using these components the algorithm is automatically
parallel and no explicit call to communication functions is required. MDP is
particularly suitable for implementing parallel solvers for multi-dimensional
differential equations and mesh-like problems.

 <dc:description>  The sharpened No-Free-Lunch-theorem (NFL-theorem) states that the performance
of all optimization algorithms averaged over any finite set F of functions is
equal if and only if F is closed under permutation (c.u.p.) and each target
function in F is equally likely. In this paper, we first summarize some
consequences of this theorem, which have been proven recently: The average
number of evaluations needed to find a desirable (e.g., optimal) solution can
be calculated; the number of subsets c.u.p. can be neglected compared to the
overall number of possible subsets; and problem classes relevant in practice
are not likely to be c.u.p. Second, as the main result, the NFL-theorem is
extended. Necessary and sufficient conditions for NFL-results to hold are given
for arbitrary, non-uniform distributions of target functions. This yields the
most general NFL-theorem for optimization presented so far.

 <dc:description>  The LOCKSS program has developed and deployed in a world-wide test a system
for preserving access to academic journals published on the Web. The
fundamental problem for any digital preservation system is that it must be
affordable for the long term. To reduce the cost of ownership, the LOCKSS
system uses generic PC hardware, open source software, and peer-to-peer
technology. It is packaged as a ``network appliance'', a single-function box
that can be connected to the Internet, configured and left alone to do its job
with minimal monitoring or administration. The first version of this system was
based on a Linux boot floppy. After three years of testing it was replaced by a
second version, based on OpenBSD and booting from CD-ROM.
  We focus in this paper on the design, implementation and deployment of a
network appliance based on an open source operating system. We provide an
overview of the LOCKSS application and describe the experience of deploying and
supporting its first version. We list the requirements we took from this to
drive the design of the second version, describe how we satisfied them in the
OpenBSD environment, and report on the initial

 <dc:description>  Unfamiliar, large-scale virtual environments are difficult to navigate. This
paper presents design guidelines to ease navigation in such virtual
environments. The guidelines presented here focus on the design and placement
of landmarks in virtual environments. Moreover, the guidelines are based
primarily on the extensive empirical literature on navigation in the real
world. A rationale for this approach is provided by the similarities between
navigational behavior in real and virtual environments.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a mobile audio space intended for use by gelled social
groups. In face-to-face interactions in such social groups, conversational
floors change frequently, e.g., two participants split off to form a new
conversational floor, a participant moves from one conversational floor to
another, etc. To date, audio spaces have provided little support for such
dynamic regroupings of participants, either requiring that the participants
explicitly specify with whom they wish to talk or simply presenting all
participants as though they are in a single floor. By contrast, the audio space
described here monitors participant behavior to identify conversational floors
as they emerge. The system dynamically modifies the audio delivered to each
participant to enhance the salience of the participants with whom they are
currently conversing. We report a user study of the system, focusing on
conversation analytic results.

 <dc:description>  Inevitability properties in branching temporal logics are of the syntax
forall eventually \phi, where \phi is an arbitrary (timed) CTL formula. In the
sense that &quot;good things will happen&quot;, they are parallel to the &quot;liveness&quot;
properties in linear temporal logics. Such inevitability properties in
dense-time logics can be analyzed with greatest fixpoint calculation. We
present algorithms to model-check inevitability properties both with and
without requirement of non-Zeno computations. We discuss a technique for early
decision on greatest fixpoints in the temporal logics, and experiment with the
effect of non-Zeno computations on the evaluation of greatest fixpoints. We
also discuss the TCTL subclass with only universal path quantifiers which
allows for the safe abstraction analysis of inevitability properties. Finally,
we report our implementation and experiments to show the plausibility of our
ideas.

 <dc:title>Quasi-Optimal Arithmetic for Quaternion Polynomials</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Fast algorithms for arithmetic on real or complex polynomials are well-known
and have proven to be not only asymptotically efficient but also very
practical. Based on Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), they for instance multiply
two polynomials of degree up to N or multi-evaluate one at N points
simultaneously within quasi-linear time O(N.polylog N). An extension to (and in
fact the mere definition of) polynomials over the skew-field H of quaternions
is promising but still missing. The present work proposes three such
definitions which in the commutative case coincide but for H turn out to
differ, each one satisfying some desirable properties while lacking others. For
each notion we devise algorithms for according arithmetic; these are
quasi-optimal in that their running times match lower complexity bounds up to
polylogarithmic factors.

 <dc:description>  We present the first explicit connection between quantum computation and
lattice problems. Namely, we show a solution to the Unique Shortest Vector
Problem (SVP) under the assumption that there exists an algorithm that solves
the hidden subgroup problem on the dihedral group by coset sampling. Moreover,
we solve the hidden subgroup problem on the dihedral group by using an average
case subset sum routine. By combining the two results, we get a quantum
reduction from $\Theta(n^{2.5})$-unique-SVP to the average case subset sum
problem.

 <dc:description>  We address the text-to-text generation problem of sentence-level paraphrasing
-- a phenomenon distinct from and more difficult than word- or phrase-level
paraphrasing. Our approach applies multiple-sequence alignment to sentences
gathered from unannotated comparable corpora: it learns a set of paraphrasing
patterns represented by word lattice pairs and automatically determines how to
apply these patterns to rewrite new sentences. The results of our evaluation
experiments show that the system derives accurate paraphrases, outperforming
baseline systems.

 <dc:description>  Cluster analysis often serves as the initial step in the process of data
classification. In this paper, the problem of clustering different length input
data is considered. The edit distance as the minimum number of elementary edit
operations needed to transform one vector into another is used. A heuristic for
clustering unequal length vectors, analogue to the well known k-means algorithm
is described and analyzed. This heuristic determines cluster centroids
expanding shorter vectors to the lengths of the longest ones in each cluster in
a specific way. It is shown that the time and space complexities of the
heuristic are linear in the number of input vectors. Experimental results on
real data originating from a system for classification of Web attacks are
given.

circuit model of computation. The model is developed abstractly in close
analogy with (classical) deterministic and probabilistic circuits, without

 <dc:title>Stochastic Volatility in a Quantitative Model of Stock Market Returns</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Daniel, Gilles</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>G3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Standard quantitative models of the stock market predict a log-normal
distribution for stock returns (Bachelier 1900, Osborne 1959), but it is
recognised (Fama 1965) that empirical data, in comparison with a Gaussian,
exhibit leptokurtosis (it has more probability mass in its tails and centre)
and fat tails (probabilities of extreme events are underestimated). Different
attempts to explain this departure from normality have coexisted. In
particular, since one of the strong assumptions of the Gaussian model concerns
the volatility, considered finite and constant, the new models were built on a
non finite (Mandelbrot 1963) or non constant (Cox, Ingersoll and Ross 1985)
volatility. We investigate in this thesis a very recent model (Dragulescu et
al. 2002) based on a Brownian motion process for the returns, and a stochastic
mean-reverting process for the volatility. In this model, the forward
Kolmogorov equation that governs the time evolution of returns is solved
analytically. We test this new theory against different stock indexes (Dow
Jones Industrial Average, Standard and Poor s and Footsie), over different
periods (from 20 to 105 years). Our aim is to compare this model with the
classical Gaussian and with a simple Neural Network, used as a benchmark. We
perform the usual statistical tests on the kurtosis and tails of the expected
distributions, paying particular attention to the outliers. As claimed by the
authors, the new model outperforms the Gaussian for any time lag, but is
artificially too complex for medium and low frequencies, where the Gaussian is
preferable. Moreover this model is still rejected for high frequencies, at a
0.05 level of significance, due to the kurtosis, incorrectly handled.

suitable for implementation in software, thus provides a solution to a recent

provide efficient algorithms for generation of irreducible and primitive LFSR's
of this new type.

 <dc:description>  In extension of the bit commitment task and following work initiated by
Crepeau and Kilian, we introduce and solve the problem of characterising the
optimal rate at which a discrete memoryless channel can be used for bit
commitment. It turns out that the answer is very intuitive: it is the maximum
equivocation of the channel (after removing trivial redundancy), even when
unlimited noiseless bidirectional side communication is allowed.
  By a well-known reduction, this result provides a lower bound on the
channel's capacity for implementing coin tossing, which we conjecture to be an
equality.
  The method of proving this relates the problem to Wyner's wire--tap channel
in an amusing way. We also discuss extensions to quantum channels.

system, or Grid. A quantitative study of such services can aid in understanding
the performance limitations, advise in the deployment of the systems, and help
evaluate future development work. To this end, we study the performance of
three monitoring and information services for distributed systems: the Globus
Toolkit's Monitoring and Discovery Service (MDS), the European Data Grid
Relational Grid Monitoring Architecture (R-GMA), and Hawkeye, part of the
Condor project. We perform experiments to test their scalability with respect
to number of users, number of resources, and amount of data collected. Our
study shows that each approach has different behaviors, often due to their
different design goals. In the four sets of experiments we conducted to
evaluate the performance of the service components under different
circumstances, we found a strong advantage to caching or prefetching the data,
as well as the need to have primary components at well connected sites due to
high load seen by all systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces and analyzes symmetric and anti-symmetric quantum
binary functions. Generally, such functions uniquely convert a given
computational basis state into a different basis state, but with either a plus
or a minus sign. Such functions may serve along with a constant function (in a
Deutsch-Jozsa type of algorithm) to provide 2**n deterministic qubit
combinations (for n qubits) instead of just one.

 <dc:description>  We consider a class of multivariate recurrences frequently arising in the
worst case analysis of Davis-Putnam-style exponential time backtracking
algorithms for NP-hard problems. We describe a technique for proving asymptotic
upper bounds on these recurrences, by using a suitable weight function to
reduce the problem to that of solving univariate linear recurrences; show how
to use quasiconvex programming to determine the weight function yielding the
smallest upper bound; and prove that the resulting upper bounds are within a
polynomial factor of the true asymptotics of the recurrence. We develop and
implement a multiple-gradient descent algorithm for the resulting quasiconvex
programs, using a real-number arithmetic package for guaranteed accuracy of the
computed worst case time bounds.

 <dc:title>Blind Normalization of Speech From Different Channels</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Levin, David N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.7</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show how to construct a channel-independent representation of speech that
has propagated through a noisy reverberant channel. This is done by blindly
rescaling the cepstral time series by a non-linear function, with the form of
this scale function being determined by previously encountered cepstra from
that channel. The rescaled form of the time series is an invariant property of
it in the following sense: it is unaffected if the time series is transformed
by any time-independent invertible distortion. Because a linear channel with
stationary noise and impulse response transforms cepstra in this way, the new
technique can be used to remove the channel dependence of a cepstral time
series. In experiments, the method achieved greater channel-independence than
cepstral mean normalization, and it was comparable to the combination of
cepstral mean normalization and spectral subtraction, despite the fact that no
measurements of channel noise or reverberations were required (unlike spectral
subtraction).

 <dc:description>  We prove lower bounds for the direct sum problem for two-party bounded error
randomised multiple-round communication protocols. Our proofs use the notion of
information cost of a protocol, as defined by Chakrabarti, Shi, Wirth and Yao
and refined further by Bar-Yossef, Jayram, Kumar and Sivakumar. Our main
technical result is a `compression' theorem saying that, for any probability
distribution $\mu$ over the inputs, a $k$-round private coin bounded error
protocol for a function $f$ with information cost $c$ can be converted into a
$k$-round deterministic protocol for $f$ with bounded distributional error and
communication cost $O(kc)$. We prove this result using a substate theorem about
relative entropy and a rejection sampling argument. Our direct sum result
follows from this `compression' result via elementary information theoretic
arguments.
  We also consider the direct sum problem in quantum communication. Using a
probabilistic argument, we show that messages cannot be compressed in this
manner even if they carry small information. Hence, new techniques may be
necessary to tackle the direct sum problem in quantum communication.

 <dc:title>Model Checking for a Class of Weighted Automata</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A large number of different model checking approaches has been proposed
during the last decade. The different approaches are applicable to different
model types including untimed, timed, probabilistic and stochastic models. This
paper presents a new framework for model checking techniques which includes
some of the known approaches, but enlarges the class of models for which model
checking can be applied to the general class of weighted automata. The approach
allows an easy adaption of model checking to models which have not been
considered yet for this purpose. Examples for those new model types for which
model checking can be applied are max/plus or min/plus automata which are well
established models to describe different forms of dynamic systems and
optimization problems. In this context, model checking can be used to verify
temporal or quantitative properties of a system. The paper first presents
briefly our class of weighted automata, as a very general model type. Then
Valued Computational Tree Logic (CTL$) is introduced as a natural extension of
the well known branching time logic CTL. Afterwards, algorithms to check a
weighted automaton according to a CTL$ formula are presented. As a last result,
a bisimulation is presented for weighted automata and for CTL$.

 <dc:description>  JohnnyVon is an implementation of self-replicating machines in continuous
two-dimensional space. Two types of particles drift about in a virtual liquid.
The particles are automata with discrete internal states but continuous
external relationships. Their internal states are governed by finite state
machines but their external relationships are governed by a simulated physics
that includes Brownian motion, viscosity, and spring-like attractive and
repulsive forces. The particles can be assembled into patterns that can encode
arbitrary strings of bits. We demonstrate that, if an arbitrary &quot;seed&quot; pattern
is put in a &quot;soup&quot; of separate individual particles, the pattern will replicate
by assembling the individual particles into copies of itself. We also show
that, given sufficient time, a soup of separate individual particles will
eventually spontaneously form self-replicating patterns. We discuss the
implications of JohnnyVon for research in nanotechnology, theoretical biology,
and artificial life.

 <dc:description>  We explore an instance of the question of partitioning a polygon into pieces,
each of which is as ``circular'' as possible, in the sense of having an aspect
ratio close to 1. The aspect ratio of a polygon is the ratio of the diameters
of the smallest circumscribing circle to the largest inscribed disk. The
problem is rich even for partitioning regular polygons into convex pieces, the
focus of this paper. We show that the optimal (most circular) partition for an
equilateral triangle has an infinite number of pieces, with the lower bound
approachable to any accuracy desired by a particular finite partition. For
pentagons and all regular k-gons, k &gt; 5, the unpartitioned polygon is already
optimal. The square presents an interesting intermediate case. Here the
one-piece partition is not optimal, but nor is the trivial lower bound
approachable. We narrow the optimal ratio to an aspect-ratio gap of 0.01082
with several somewhat intricate partitions.

 <dc:description>  Given a $k$-uniform hyper-graph, the E$k$-Vertex-Cover problem is to find the
smallest subset of vertices that intersects every hyper-edge. We present a new
multilayered PCP construction that extends the Raz verifier. This enables us to
prove that E$k$-Vertex-Cover is NP-hard to approximate within factor
$(k-1-\epsilon)$ for any $k \geq 3$ and any $\epsilon&gt;0$. The result is
essentially tight as this problem can be easily approximated within factor $k$.
Our construction makes use of the biased Long-Code and is analyzed using
combinatorial properties of $s$-wise $t$-intersecting families of subsets.

 <dc:description>  We report about the current state of development of a document suite and its
applications. This collection of tools for the flexible and robust processing
of documents in German is based on the use of XML as unifying formalism for
encoding input and output data as well as process information. It is organized
in modules with limited responsibilities that can easily be combined into
pipelines to solve complex tasks. Strong emphasis is laid on a number of
techniques to deal with lexical and conceptual gaps that are typical when
starting a new application.

 <dc:title>Small Spans in Scaled Dimension</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hitchcock, John M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Juedes and Lutz (1995) proved a small span theorem for polynomial-time
many-one reductions in exponential time. This result says that for language A
decidable in exponential time, either the class of languages reducible to A
(the lower span) or the class of problems to which A can be reduced (the upper
span) is small in the sense of resource-bounded measure and, in particular,
that the degree of A is small. Small span theorems have been proven for
increasingly stronger polynomial-time reductions, and a small span theorem for
polynomial-time Turing reductions would imply BPP != EXP. In contrast to the
progress in resource-bounded measure, Ambos-Spies, Merkle, Reimann, and Stephan
(2001) showed that there is no small span theorem for the resource-bounded
dimension of Lutz (2000), even for polynomial-time many-one reductions.
  Resource-bounded scaled dimension, recently introduced by Hitchcock, Lutz,
and Mayordomo (2003), provides rescalings of resource-bounded dimension. We use
scaled dimension to further understand the contrast between measure and
dimension regarding polynomial-time spans and degrees. We strengthen prior
results by showing that the small span theorem holds for polynomial-time
many-one reductions in the -3rd-order scaled dimension, but fails to hold in
the -2nd-order scaled dimension. Our results also hold in exponential space.
  As an application, we show that determining the -2nd- or -1st-order scaled
dimension in ESPACE of the many-one complete languages for E would yield a
proof of P = BPP or P != PSPACE. On the other hand, it is shown unconditionally
that the complete languages for E have -3rd-order scaled dimension 0 in ESPACE
and -2nd- and -1st-order scaled dimension 1 in E.

 <dc:title>Transforming the Structure of Network Interconnection and Transport</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>C.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Vibrant development of a network-based economy requires separating investment
in highly location specific local access technology from the development of
standardized, geography-independent, wide-area network services. Thus far
interconnection arrangements and associated regulations have been too closely
tied to the idiosyncratic geographic structure of individual operators'
networks. A key industry challenge is to foster the development of a wide area
lattice of common geographic points of interconnection. Sound regulatory and
anti-trust policy can help address this industry need.

 <dc:description>  An acceleration in the growth of communications bandwidth in use and a rapid
reduction in bandwidth prices have not accompanied the U.S. economy's strong
performance in the second half of the 1990s. Overall U.S. bandwidth in use has
grown robustly throughout the 1990s, but growth has not significantly
accelerated in the second half of 1990s. Average prices for U.S. bandwidth in
use have fallen little in nominal terms in the second half of the 1990s. Policy
makers and policy analysts should recognize that institutional change, rather
than more competitors of established types, appears to be key to dramatic
improvements in bandwidth growth and prices. Such a development could provide a
significant additional impetus to aggregate growth and productivity.

 <dc:description>  To contribute to understanding of information economies of daily life, this
paper explores over the past millennium given names of a large number of
persons. Analysts have long both condemned and praised mass media as a source
of common culture, national unity, or shared symbolic experiences. Names,
however, indicate a large decline in shared symbolic experience over the past
two centuries, a decline that the growth of mass media does not appear to have
affected significantly. Study of names also shows that action and personal
relationships, along with time horizon, are central aspects of effective
communication across a large population. The observed preference for
personalization over the past two centuries and the importance of action and
personal relationships to effective communication are aspects of information
economies that are likely to have continuing significance for industry
developments, economic statistics, and public policy.

 <dc:title>Revolutionary Ideas for Radio Regulation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Galbi, Douglas A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>C.2.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Radio technology seems destined to become part of the standard
micro-processor input/output system. But unlike for memory or display systems,
for radio systems government regulation matters a lot. Much discussion of radio
regulation has focused on narrow spectrum management and interference issues.
Reflecting on historical experience and centuries of conversation about
fundamental political choices, persons working with radio technology should
also ponder three questions. First, what is a good separation and balance of
powers in radio regulation? Second, how should radio regulation be
geographically configured? Third, how should radio regulation understand and
respect personal freedom and equality? Working out answering to these questions
involves a general process of shaping good government. This process will be
hugely important for radio regulation, technology, and applications.

 <dc:description>  It is very costly to build up lexical resources and domain ontologies.
Especially when confronted with a new application domain lexical gaps and a
poor coverage of domain concepts are a problem for the successful exploitation
of natural language document analysis systems that need and exploit such
knowledge sources. In this paper we report about ongoing experiments with
`bootstrapping techniques' for lexicon and ontology creation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we describe an approach for the analysis of documents in German
and English with a shared pool of resources. For the analysis of German
documents we use a document suite, which supports the user in tasks like
information retrieval and information extraction. The core of the document
suite is based on our tool XDOC. Now we want to exploit these methods for the
analysis of English documents as well. For this aim we need a multilingual
presentation format of the resources. These resources must be transformed into
an unified format, in which we can set additional information about linguistic
characteristics of the language depending on the analyzed documents. In this
paper we describe our approach for such an exchange model for multilingual
resources based on XML.

 <dc:title>Using Regression Techniques to Predict Large Data Transfers</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The recent proliferation of Data Grids and the increasingly common practice
of using resources as distributed data stores provide a convenient environment
for communities of researchers to share, replicate, and manage access to copies
of large datasets. This has led to the question of which replica can be
accessed most efficiently. In such environments, fetching data from one of the
several replica locations requires accurate predictions of end-to-end transfer
times. The answer to this question can depend on many factors, including
physical characteristics of the resources and the load behavior on the CPUs,
networks, and storage devices that are part of the end-to-end data path linking
possible sources and sinks. Our approach combines end-to-end application
throughput observations with network and disk load variations and captures
whole-system performance and variations in load patterns. Our predictions
characterize the effect of load variations of several shared devices (network
and disk) on file transfer times. We develop a suite of univariate and
multivariate predictors that can use multiple data sources to improve the
accuracy of the predictions as well as address Data Grid variations
(availability of data and sporadic nature of transfers). We ran a large set of
data transfer experiments using GridFTP and observed performance predictions
within 15% error for our testbed sites, which is quite promising for a
pragmatic system.

$\Pi$ can be approximated in polynomial time within a ratio of $t$, and it is
NP-hard to approximate it within a ratio better than $t$. We survey some of the
known approximation threshold results, and discuss the pattern that emerges
from the known results.

 <dc:description>  We survey recent developments in the study of probabilistic complexity
classes. While the evidence seems to support the conjecture that probabilism
can be deterministically simulated with relatively low overhead, i.e., that
$P=BPP$, it also indicates that this may be a difficult question to resolve. In
fact, proving that probabilistic algorithms have non-trivial deterministic
simulations is basically equivalent to proving circuit lower bounds, either in
the algebraic or Boolean models.

 <dc:description>  Recent results established exponential lower bounds for the length of any
Resolution proof for the weak pigeonhole principle. More formally, it was
proved that any Resolution proof for the weak pigeonhole principle, with $n$
holes and any number of pigeons, is of length $\Omega(2^{n^{\epsilon}})$, (for
a constant $\epsilon = 1/3$). One corollary is that certain propositional
formulations of the statement $P \ne NP$ do not have short Resolution proofs.
After a short introduction to the problem of $P \ne NP$ and to the research
area of propositional proof complexity, I will discuss the above mentioned
lower bounds for the weak pigeonhole principle and the connections to the
hardness of proving $P \ne NP$.

computational power. The model is based on the concept of language recognition
by probabilistic automata due to Rabin and models of analog computation in a
noisy environment suggested by Maass and Orponen, and Maass and Sontag. Our
main result is a generalization of Rabin's reduction theorem that implies that
under very mild conditions, the computational power of the automaton is limited
to regular languages.

 <dc:title>Hardness of approximating the weight enumerator of a binary linear code</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vyalyi, M. N.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F.1.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of evaluation of the weight enumerator of a binary
linear code. We show that the exact evaluation is hard for polynomial
hierarchy. More exactly, if WE is an oracle answering the solution of the
evaluation problem then P^WE=P^GapP. Also we consider the approximative
evaluation of the weight enumerator. In the case of approximation with additive
accuracy $2^{\alpha n}$, $\alpha$ is constant the problem is hard in the above
sense. We also prove that approximate evaluation at a single point $e^{\pi
i/4}$ is hard for $0&lt;\al&lt;\al_0\approx0.88$.

 <dc:description>  Many &quot;good&quot; topologies for interconnection networks are based on line
digraphs of regular digraphs. These digraphs support unitary matrices. We
propose the property &quot;being the digraph of a unitary matrix&quot; as additional
criterion for the design of new interconnection networks. We define a
composition of digraphs, which we call diagonal union. Diagonal union can be
used to construct digraphs of unitary matrices. We remark that digraphs
obtained via diagonal union are state split graphs, as defined in symbolic
dynamics. Finally, we list some potential directions for future research.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a temporal logic to reason on global applications in an
asynchronous setting. First, we define the Distributed States Logic (DSL), a
modal logic for localities that embeds the local theories of each component
into a theory of the distributed states of the system. We provide the logic
with a sound and complete axiomatization. The contribution is that it is
possible to reason about properties that involve several components, even in
the absence of a global clock. Then, we define the Distributed States Temporal
Logic (DSTL) by introducing temporal operators a' la Unity. We support our
proposal by working out a pair of examples: a simple secure communication
system, and an algorithm for distributed leader election.
  The motivation for this work is that the existing logics for distributed
systems do not have the right expressive power to reason on the systems
behaviour, when the communication is based on asynchronous message passing. On
the other side, asynchronous communication is the most used abstraction when
modelling global applications.

 <dc:description>  Search in cyclic AND/OR graphs was traditionally known to be an unsolved
problem. In the recent past several important studies have been reported in
this domain. In this paper, we have taken a fresh look at the problem. First, a
new and comprehensive theoretical framework for cyclic AND/OR graphs has been
presented, which was found missing in the recent literature. Based on this
framework, two best-first search algorithms, S1 and S2, have been developed. S1
does uninformed search and is a simple modification of the Bottom-up algorithm
by Martelli and Montanari. S2 performs a heuristically guided search and
replicates the modification in Bottom-up's successors, namely HS and AO*. Both
S1 and S2 solve the problem of searching AND/OR graphs in presence of cycles.
We then present a detailed analysis for the correctness and complexity results
of S1 and S2, using the proposed framework. We have observed through
experiments that S1 and S2 output correct results in all cases.

 <dc:description>  We address the classical knapsack problem and a variant in which an upper

appropriate combinations of rounding techniques yield novel and powerful ways
of rounding. As an application of these techniques, we present a linear-storage
Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) and a Fully Polynomial Time
Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) that compute an approximate solution, of any fixed
accuracy, in linear time. This linear complexity bound gives a substantial
improvement of the best previously known polynomial bounds.

 <dc:description>  The Ubiquitous Interactor (UBI) addresses the problems of design and
development that arise around services that need to be accessed from many
different devices. In UBI, the same service can present itself with different
user interfaces on different devices. This is done by separating interaction
between users and services from presentation. The interaction is kept the same
for all devices, and different presentation information is provided for
different devices. This way, tailored user interfaces for many different
devices can be created without multiplying development and maintenance work. In
this paper we describe the system design of UBI, the system implementation, and
two services implemented for the system: a calendar service and a stockbroker
service.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the concept of Approximate grammar and how it can
be used to extract information from a documemt. As the structure of
informational strings cannot be defined well in a document, we cannot use the
conventional grammar rules to represent the information. Hence, the need arises
to design an approximate grammar that can be used effectively to accomplish the
task of Information extraction. Approximate grammars are a novel step in this
direction. The rules of an approximate grammar can be given by a user or the
machine can learn the rules from an annotated document. We have performed our
experiments in both the above areas and the results have been impressive.

 <dc:description>  We present the first in-place algorithm for sorting an array of size n that
performs, in the worst case, at most O(n log n) element comparisons and O(n)
element transports.
  This solves a long-standing open problem, stated explicitly, e.g., in [J.I.
Munro and V. Raman, Sorting with minimum data movement, J. Algorithms, 13,
374-93, 1992], of whether there exists a sorting algorithm that matches the
asymptotic lower bounds on all computational resources simultaneously.

 <dc:title>On the Ramsey Numbers for Bipartite Multigraphs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A coloring of a complete bipartite graph is shuffle-preserved if it is the
case that assigning a color $c$ to edges $(u, v)$ and $(u', v')$ enforces the
same color assignment for edges $(u, v')$ and $(u',v)$. (In words, the induced
subgraph with respect to color $c$ is complete.) In this paper, we investigate
a variant of the Ramsey problem for the class of complete bipartite
multigraphs. (By a multigraph we mean a graph in which multiple edges, but no
loops, are allowed.) Unlike the conventional m-coloring scheme in Ramsey theory
which imposes a constraint (i.e., $m$) on the total number of colors allowed in
a graph, we introduce a relaxed version called m-local coloring which only
requires that, for every vertex $v$, the number of colors associated with $v$'s
incident edges is bounded by $m$. Note that the number of colors found in a
graph under $m$-local coloring may exceed m. We prove that given any $n \times
n$ complete bipartite multigraph $G$, every shuffle-preserved $m$-local
coloring displays a monochromatic copy of $K_{p,p}$ provided that $2(p-1)(m-1)
&lt; n$. Moreover, the above bound is tight when (i) $m=2$, or (ii) $n=2^k$ and
$m=3\cdot 2^{k-2}$ for every integer $k\geq 2$. As for the lower bound of $p$,
we show that the existence of a monochromatic $K_{p,p}$ is not guaranteed if
$p&gt; \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil$. Finally, we give a generalization for
$k$-partite graphs and a method applicable to general graphs. Many conclusions
found in $m$-local coloring can be inferred to similar results of $m$-coloring.

 <dc:title>Computing only minimal answers in disjunctive deductive databases</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Johnson, C. A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>F4.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A method is presented for computing minimal answers in disjunctive deductive
databases under the disjunctive stable model semantics. Such answers are
constructed by repeatedly extending partial answers. Our method is complete (in
that every minimal answer can be computed) and does not admit redundancy (in
the sense that every partial answer generated can be extended to a minimal
answer), whence no non-minimal answer is generated. For stratified databases,
the method does not (necessarily) require the computation of models of the
database in their entirety. Compilation is proposed as a tool by which problems
relating to computational efficiency and the non-existence of disjunctive
stable models can be overcome. The extension of our method to other semantics
is also considered.

idea, by dealing with a set of gene expression data, which could be obtained
from developmental biology, the procedures are sketched with comments in some
details. We mean representation by choosing a proper function, which fits well
with observed data of a series, and turning its characteristics into numbers,
which extract the intrinsic properties of fluctuating data. With help of a
machine learning techniques, this method will give a classification of
developmental biological data as well as any varying data during a certain
period and the classification can be applied for diagnosis of a disease.

 <dc:description>  Let F be a random k-SAT formula on n variables, formed by selecting uniformly
and independently m = rn out of all possible k-clauses. It is well-known that
if r&gt;2^k ln 2, then the formula F is unsatisfiable with probability that tends
to 1 as n tends to infinity. We prove that there exists a sequence t_k = O(k)
such that if r &lt; 2^k ln 2 - t_k, then the formula F is satisfiable with
probability that tends to 1 as n tends to infinity.
  Our technique yields an explicit lower bound for the random k-SAT threshold
for every k. For k&gt;3 this improves upon all previously known lower bounds. For
example, when k=10 our lower bound is 704.94 while the upper bound is 708.94.

 <dc:title>The NPC Framework for Building Information Dissemination Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Numerous systems for dissemination, retrieval, and archiving of documents
have been developed in the past. Those systems often focus on one of these
aspects and are hard to extend and combine. Typically, the transmission
protocols, query and filtering languages are fixed as well as the interfaces to
other systems. We rather envisage the seamless establishment of networks among
the providers, repositories and consumers of information, supporting
information retrieval and dissemination while being highly interoperable and
extensible.
  We propose a framework with a single event-based mechanism that unifies
document storage, retrieval, and dissemination. This framework offers complete
openness with respect to document and metadata formats, transmission protocols,
and filtering mechanisms. It specifies a high-level building kit, by which
arbitrary processors for document streams can be incorporated to support the
retrieval, transformation, aggregation and disaggregation of documents. Using
the same kit, interfaces for different transmission protocols can be added
easily to enable the communication with various information sources and
information consumers.

 <dc:description>  When simultaneously reasoning with evidences about several different events
it is necessary to separate the evidence according to event. These events
should then be handled independently. However, when propositions of evidences
are weakly specified in the sense that it may not be certain to which event
they are referring, this may not be directly possible. In this paper a
criterion for partitioning evidences into subsets representing events is
established. This criterion, derived from the conflict within each subset,
involves minimising a criterion function for the overall conflict of the
partition. An algorithm based on characteristics of the criterion function and
an iterative optimisation among partitionings of evidences is proposed.

 <dc:description>  For the case of evidence ordered in a complete directed acyclic graph this
paper presents a new algorithm with lower computational complexity for
Dempster's rule than that of step-by-step application of Dempster's rule. In
this problem, every original pair of evidences, has a corresponding evidence
against the simultaneous belief in both propositions. In this case, it is
uncertain whether the propositions of any two evidences are in logical
conflict. The original evidences are associated with the vertices and the
additional evidences are associated with the edges. The original evidences are
ordered, i.e., for every pair of evidences it is determinable which of the two
evidences is the earlier one. We are interested in finding the most probable
completely specified path through the graph, where transitions are possible
only from lower- to higher-ranked vertices. The path is here a representation
for a sequence of states, for instance a sequence of snapshots of a physical
object's track. A completely specified path means that the path includes no
other vertices than those stated in the path representation, as opposed to an
incompletely specified path that may also include other vertices than those
stated. In a hierarchical network of all subsets of the frame, i.e., of all
incompletely specified paths, the original and additional evidences support
subsets that are not disjoint, thus it is not possible to prune the network to
a tree. Instead of propagating belief, the new algorithm reasons about the
logical conditions of a completely specified path through the graph. The new
algorithm is O(|THETA| log |THETA|), compared to O(|THETA| ** log |THETA|) of
the classic brute force algorithm.

 <dc:title>Finding a Posterior Domain Probability Distribution by Specifying

 <dc:description>  This article is an extension of the results of two earlier articles. In [J.
Schubert, On nonspecific evidence, Int. J. Intell. Syst. 8 (1993) 711-725] we
established within Dempster-Shafer theory a criterion function called the
metaconflict function. With this criterion we can partition into subsets a set
of several pieces of evidence with propositions that are weakly specified in
the sense that it may be uncertain to which event a proposition is referring.
In a second article [J. Schubert, Specifying nonspecific evidence, in
Cluster-based specification techniques in Dempster-Shafer theory for an
evidential intelligence analysis of multiple target tracks, Ph.D. Thesis,
TRITA-NA-9410, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, 1994, ISBN
91-7170-801-4] we not only found the most plausible subset for each piece of
evidence, we also found the plausibility for every subset that this piece of
evidence belongs to the subset. In this article we aim to find a posterior
probability distribution regarding the number of subsets. We use the idea that
each piece of evidence in a subset supports the existence of that subset to the
degree that this piece of evidence supports anything at all. From this we can
derive a bpa that is concerned with the question of how many subsets we have.
That bpa can then be combined with a given prior domain probability
distribution in order to obtain the sought-after posterior domain distribution.

 <dc:description>  We consider the one-round Voronoi game, where player one (``White'', called
``Wilma'') places a set of n points in a rectangular area of aspect ratio r
&lt;=1, followed by the second player (``Black'', called ``Barney''), who places
the same number of points. Each player wins the fraction of the board closest
to one of his points, and the goal is to win more than half of the total area.
This problem has been studied by Cheong et al., who showed that for large
enough $n$ and r=1, Barney has a strategy that guarantees a fraction of 1/2+a,
for some small fixed a.
  We resolve a number of open problems raised by that paper. In particular, we
give a precise characterization of the outcome of the game for optimal play: We
show that Barney has a winning strategy for n&gt;2 and r&gt;sqrt{2}/n, and for n=2
and r&gt;sqrt{3}/2. Wilma wins in all remaining cases, i.e., for n&gt;=3 and
r&lt;=sqrt{2}/n, for n=2 and r&lt;=sqrt{3}/2, and for n=1. We also discuss complexity
aspects of the game on more general boards, by proving that for a polygon with
holes, it is NP-hard to maximize the area Barney can win against a given set of
points by Wilma.

 <dc:description>  When reasoning with uncertainty there are many situations where evidences are
not only uncertain but their propositions may also be weakly specified in the
sense that it may not be certain to which event a proposition is referring. It
is then crucial not to combine such evidences in the mistaken belief that they
are referring to the same event. This situation would become manageable if the
evidences could be clustered into subsets representing events that should be
handled separately. In an earlier article we established within Dempster-Shafer
theory a criterion function called the metaconflict function. With this
criterion we can partition a set of evidences into subsets. Each subset
representing a separate event. In this article we will not only find the most
plausible subset for each piece of evidence, we will also find the plausibility
for every subset that the evidence belongs to the subset. Also, when the number
of subsets are uncertain we aim to find a posterior probability distribution
regarding the number of subsets.

 <dc:description>  In Intelligence Analysis it is of vital importance to manage uncertainty.
Intelligence data is almost always uncertain and incomplete, making it
necessary to reason and taking decisions under uncertainty. One way to manage
the uncertainty in Intelligence Analysis is Dempster-Shafer Theory. This thesis
contains five results regarding multiple target tracks and intelligence
specification.

 <dc:title>On rho in a Decision-Theoretic Apparatus of Dempster-Shafer Theory</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Schubert, Johan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>I.2.3</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Thomas M. Strat has developed a decision-theoretic apparatus for
Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J.
Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility
intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest
expected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice
when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of
another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals.
This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the
ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out
as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we
might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among
the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected
utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of
each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest
expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of
rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not
only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational
choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus,
an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the
value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is
sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to
discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is
justifiable.

 <dc:description>  In an earlier article [J. Schubert, On nonspecific evidence, Int. J. Intell.
Syst. 8(6), 711-725 (1993)] we established within Dempster-Shafer theory a
criterion function called the metaconflict function. With this criterion we can
partition into subsets a set of several pieces of evidence with propositions
that are weakly specified in the sense that it may be uncertain to which event
a proposition is referring. Each subset in the partitioning is representing a
separate event. The metaconflict function was derived as the plausibility that
the partitioning is correct when viewing the conflict in Dempster's rule within
each subset as a newly constructed piece of metalevel evidence with a
proposition giving support against the entire partitioning. In this article we
extend the results of the previous article. We will not only find the most
plausible subset for each piece of evidence as was done in the earlier article.
In addition we will specify each piece of nonspecific evidence, in the sense
that we find to which events the proposition might be referring, by finding the
plausibility for every subset that this piece of evidence belong to the subset.
In doing this we will automatically receive indication that some evidence might
be false. We will then develop a new methodology to exploit these newly
specified pieces of evidence in a subsequent reasoning process. This will
include methods to discount evidence based on their degree of falsity and on
their degree of credibility due to a partial specification of affiliation, as
well as a refined method to infer the event of each subset.

 <dc:description>  We develop a classification method for incoming pieces of evidence in
Dempster-Shafer theory. This methodology is based on previous work with
clustering and specification of originally nonspecific evidence. This
methodology is here put in order for fast classification of future incoming
pieces of evidence by comparing them with prototypes representing the clusters,
instead of making a full clustering of all evidence. This method has a
computational complexity of O(M * N) for each new piece of evidence, where M is
the maximum number of subsets and N is the number of prototypes chosen for each
subset. That is, a computational complexity independent of the total number of
previously arrived pieces of evidence. The parameters M and N are typically
fixed and domain dependent in any application.

 <dc:description>  We describe how specialized database technology and data analysis methods
were applied by the Swedish defense to help deal with the violation of Swedish
marine territory by foreign submarine intruders during the Eighties and early
Nineties. Among several approaches tried some yielded interesting information,
although most of the key questions remain unanswered. We conclude with a survey
of belief-function- and genetic-algorithm-based methods which were proposed to
support interpretation of intelligence reports and prediction of future
submarine positions, respectively.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study a problem within Dempster-Shafer theory where 2**n - 1
pieces of evidence are clustered by a neural structure into n clusters. The
clustering is done by minimizing a metaconflict function. Previously we
developed a method based on iterative optimization. However, for large scale
problems we need a method with lower computational complexity. The neural
structure was found to be effective and much faster than iterative optimization
for larger problems. While the growth in metaconflict was faster for the neural
structure compared with iterative optimization in medium sized problems, the
metaconflict per cluster and evidence was moderate. The neural structure was
able to find a global minimum over ten runs for problem sizes up to six
clusters.

are clustered into subsets by a neural network structure. The clustering is
done by minimizing a metaconflict function. Previously we developed a method
based on iterative optimization. While the neural method had a much lower
computation time than iterative optimization its average clustering performance
was not as good. Here, we develop a hybrid of the two methods. We let the
neural structure do the initial clustering in order to achieve a high
computational performance. Its solution is fed as the initial state to the
iterative optimization in order to improve the clustering performance.

done by minimizing a metaconflict function. We now develop a method for
simultaneous clustering and determination of number of clusters during
iteration in the neural structure. We let the output signals of neurons
represent the degree to which a pieces of evidence belong to a corresponding
cluster. From these we derive a probability distribution regarding the number
of clusters, which gradually during the iteration is transformed into a
determination of number of clusters. This gradual determination is fed back
into the neural structure at each iteration to influence the clustering
process.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to manage intelligence in
constant time as a pre-process to information fusion through a series of
processes dealing with issues such as clustering reports, ranking reports with
respect to importance, extraction of prototypes from clusters and immediate
classification of newly arriving intelligence reports. These methods are used
when intelligence reports arrive which concerns different events which should
be handled independently, when it is not known a priori to which event each
intelligence report is related. We use clustering that runs as a back-end
process to partition the intelligence into subsets representing the events, and
in parallel, a fast classification that runs as a front-end process in order to
put the newly arriving intelligence into its correct information fusion
process.

 <dc:description>  In this article we investigate a problem within Dempster-Shafer theory where
2**q - 1 pieces of evidence are clustered into q clusters by minimizing a
metaconflict function, or equivalently, by minimizing the sum of weight of
conflict over all clusters. Previously one of us developed a method based on a
Hopfield and Tank model. However, for very large problems we need a method with
lower computational complexity. We demonstrate that the weight of conflict of
evidence can, as an approximation, be linearized and mapped to an
antiferromagnetic Potts Spin model. This facilitates efficient numerical
solution, even for large problem sizes. Optimal or nearly optimal solutions are
found for Dempster-Shafer clustering benchmark tests with a time complexity of
approximately O(N**2 log**2 N). Furthermore, an isomorphism between the
antiferromagnetic Potts spin model and a graph optimization problem is shown.
The graph model has dynamic variables living on the links, which have a priori
probabilities that are directly related to the pairwise conflict between pieces
of evidence. Hence, the relations between three different models are shown.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present an application where we put together two methods for
clustering and classification into a force aggregation method. Both methods are
based on conflicts between elements. These methods work with different type of
elements (intelligence reports, vehicles, military units) on different
hierarchical levels using specific conflict assessment methods on each level.
We use Dempster-Shafer theory for conflict calculation between elements,
Dempster-Shafer clustering for clustering these elements, and templates for
classification. The result of these processes is a complete force aggregation
on all levels handled.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we develop methods for selection of templates and use these
templates to recluster an already performed Dempster-Shafer clustering taking
into account intelligence to template fit during the reclustering phase. By
this process the risk of erroneous force aggregation based on some misplace
pieces of evidence from the first clustering process is greatly reduced.
Finally, a more reliable force aggregation is performed using the result of the
second clustering. These steps are taken in order to maintain most of the
excellent computational performance of Dempster-Shafer clustering, while at the
same time improve on the clustering result by including some higher relations
among intelligence reports described by the templates. The new improved
algorithm has a computational complexity of O(n**3 log**2 n) compared to O(n**2
log**2 n) of standard Dempster-Shafer clustering using Potts spin mean field
theory.

attracting and conflicting metalevel evidence. Such clustering is done when the
belief functions concern multiple events, and all belief functions are mixed
up. The clustering process is used as the means for separating the belief
functions into subsets that should be handled independently. While the
conflicting metalevel evidence is generated internally from pairwise conflicts
of all belief functions, the attracting metalevel evidence is assumed given by
some external source.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we develop a method for report level tracking based on
Dempster-Shafer clustering using Potts spin neural networks where clusters of
incoming reports are gradually fused into existing tracks, one cluster for each
track. Incoming reports are put into a cluster and continuous reclustering of
older reports is made in order to obtain maximum association fit within the
cluster and towards the track. Over time, the oldest reports of the cluster
leave the cluster for the fixed track at the same rate as new incoming reports
are put into it. Fusing reports to existing tracks in this fashion allows us to
take account of both existing tracks and the probable future of each track, as
represented by younger reports within the corresponding cluster. This gives us
a robust report-to-track association. Compared to clustering of all available
reports this approach is computationally faster and has a better
report-to-track association than simple step-by-step association.

 <dc:title>Using Dynamic Simulation in the Development of Construction Machinery</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As in the car industry for quite some time, dynamic simulation of complete
vehicles is being practiced more and more in the development of off-road
machinery. However, specific questions arise due not only to company structure
and size, but especially to the type of product. Tightly coupled, non-linear
subsystems of different domains make prediction and optimisation of the
complete system's dynamic behaviour a challenge. Furthermore, the demand for
versatile machines leads to sometimes contradictory target requirements and can
turn the design process into a hunt for the least painful compromise. This can
be avoided by profound system knowledge, assisted by simulation-driven product
development. This paper gives an overview of joint research into this issue by
Volvo Wheel Loaders and Linkoping University on that matter, lists the results
of a related literature review and introduces the term &quot;operateability&quot;. Rather
than giving detailed answers, the problem space for ongoing and future research
is examined and possible solutions are sketched.
