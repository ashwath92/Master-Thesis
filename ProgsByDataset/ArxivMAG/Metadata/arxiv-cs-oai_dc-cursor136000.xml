 <dc:title>Out-of-focus Blur: Image De-blurring</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Image de-blurring is important in many cases of imaging a real scene or
object by a camera. This project focuses on de-blurring an image distorted by
an out-of-focus blur through a simulation study. A pseudo-inverse filter is
first explored but it fails because of severe noise amplification. Then
Tikhonov regularization methods are employed, which produce greatly improved
results compared to the pseudo-inverse filter. In Tikhonov regularization, the
choice of the regularization parameter plays a critical rule in obtaining a
high-quality image, and the regularized solutions possess a semi-convergence
property. The best result, with the relative restoration error of 8.49%, is
achieved when the prescribed discrepancy principle is used to decide an optimal
value. Furthermore, an iterative method, Conjugated Gradient, is employed for
image de-blurring, which is fast in computation and leads to an even better
result with the relative restoration error of 8.22%. The number of iteration in
CG acts as a regularization parameter, and the iterates have a semi-convergence
property as well.

 <dc:title>Shannon information storage in noisy phase-modulated fringes and
  fringe-data compression by phase-shifting algorithms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Optical phase-modulated fringe-patterns are usually digitized with XxY pixels
and 8 bits/pixel (or higher) gray-levels. The digitized 8 bits/pixel are
raw-data bits, not Shannon information bits. Here we show that noisy
fringe-patterns store much less Shannon information than the capacity of the
digitizing camera. This means that high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) cameras may
waste to noise most bits/pixel. For example one would not use smartphone
cameras for high quality phase-metrology, because of their lower (S/N) images.
However smartphones digitize high-resolution (12 megapixel) images, and as we
show here, the information storage of an image depends on its bandwidth and its
(S/N). The standard formalism for measuring information are the Shannon-entropy
H, and the Shannon capacity theorem (SCT). According to SCT, low (S/N) images
may be compensated with a larger fringe-bandwidth to obtain high-information
phase measurements. So broad bandwidth fringes may give high quality phase, in
spite of digitizing low (S/N) fringe images. Most real-life images are
redundant, they have smooth zones where the pixel-value do not change much, and
data compression algorithms are paramount for image transmission/storage.
Shannon's capacity theorem is used to gauge competing image compression
algorithms. Here we show that phase-modulated phase-shifted fringes are highly
correlated, and as a consequence, phase-shifting algorithms (PSAs) may be used
as fringe-data compressors. Therefore a PSA may compress a large number of
phase-shifted fringes into a single complex-valued image. This is important in
spaceborne optical/RADAR phase-telemetry where downlink is severely limited by
huge distance and low-power downlink. That is, instead of transmitting M
phase-shifted fringes, one only transmit the phase-demodulated signal as
compressed sensing data.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the potential of adaptive equalization techniques to mitigate
inter-channel nonlinear interference noise (NLIN). We derive a lower bound on
the mutual information of a system using adaptive equalization, showing that
the channel estimation error determines the equalizer's performance. We develop
an adaptive equalization scheme which uses the statistics of the NLIN to obtain
optimal detection, based on Kalman filtering and maximum likelihood sequence
estimation (MLSE). This scheme outperforms commonly used equalizers and
significantly increases performance.

 <dc:description>  Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) relies on multi-step data
processing pipelines to accurately determine brain activity; among them, the
crucial step of spatial smoothing. These pipelines are commonly suboptimal,
given the local optimisation strategy they use, treating each step in
isolation. With the advent of new tools for deep learning, recent work has
proposed to turn these pipelines into end-to-end learning networks. This change
of paradigm offers new avenues to improvement as it allows for a global
optimisation. The current work aims at benefitting from this paradigm shift by
defining a smoothing step as a layer in these networks able to adaptively
modulate the degree of smoothing required by each brain volume to better
accomplish a given data analysis task. The viability is evaluated on real fMRI
data where subjects did alternate between left and right finger tapping tasks.

 <dc:description>  Sleep studies are important for diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia,
narcolepsy or sleep apnea. They rely on manual scoring of sleep stages from raw
polisomnography signals, which is a tedious visual task requiring the workload
of highly trained professionals. Consequently, research efforts to purse for an
automatic stage scoring based on machine learning techniques have been carried
out over the last years. In this work, we resort to multitaper spectral
analysis to create visually interpretable images of sleep patterns from EEG
signals as inputs to a deep convolutional network trained to solve visual
recognition tasks. As a working example of transfer learning, a system able to
accurately classify sleep stages in new unseen patients is presented.
Evaluations in a widely-used publicly available dataset favourably compare to
state-of-the-art results, while providing a framework for visual interpretation
of outcomes.

 <dc:title>Target Set Selection Parameterized by Clique-Width and Maximum Threshold</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hartmann, Tim A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Target Set Selection problem takes as an input a graph $G$ and a
non-negative integer threshold $ \mbox{thr}(v) $ for every vertex $v$. A vertex
$v$ can get active as soon as at least $ \mbox{thr}(v) $ of its neighbors have
been activated. The objective is to select a smallest possible initial set of
vertices, the target set, whose activation eventually leads to the activation
of all vertices in the graph.
  We show that Target Set Selection is in FPT when parameterized with the
combined parameters clique-width of the graph and the maximum threshold value.
This generalizes all previous FPT-membership results for the parameterization
by maximum threshold, and thereby solves an open question from the literature.
We stress that the time complexity of our algorithm is surprisingly
well-behaved and grows only single-exponentially in the parameters.

 <dc:description>  We study the following geometric separation problem:
  Given a set $R$ of red points and a set $B$ of blue points in the plane, find
a minimum-size set of lines that separate $R$ from $B$. We show that, in its
full generality, parameterized by the number of lines $k$ in the solution, the
problem is unlikely to be solvable significantly faster than the brute-force
$n^{O(k)}$-time algorithm, where $n$ is the total number of points. Indeed, we
show that an algorithm running in time $f(k)n^{o(k/ \log k)}$, for any
computable function $f$, would disprove ETH. Our reduction crucially relies on
selecting lines from a set with a large number of different slopes (i.e., this
number is not a function of $k$). Conjecturing that the problem variant where
the lines are required to be axis-parallel is FPT in the number of lines, we
show the following preliminary result. Separating $R$ from $B$ with a
minimum-size set of axis-parallel lines is FPT in the size of either set, and
can be solved in time $O^*(9^{|B|})$ (assuming that $B$ is the smallest set).

 <dc:description>  Speech recognition is largely taking advantage of deep learning, showing that
substantial benefits can be obtained by modern Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). The most popular RNNs are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs), which
typically reach state-of-the-art performance in many tasks thanks to their
ability to learn long-term dependencies and robustness to vanishing gradients.
Nevertheless, LSTMs have a rather complex design with three multiplicative
gates, that might impair their efficient implementation. An attempt to simplify
LSTMs has recently led to Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which are based on just
two multiplicative gates.
  This paper builds on these efforts by further revising GRUs and proposing a
simplified architecture potentially more suitable for speech recognition. The
contribution of this work is two-fold. First, we suggest to remove the reset
gate in the GRU design, resulting in a more efficient single-gate architecture.
Second, we propose to replace tanh with ReLU activations in the state update
equations. Results show that, in our implementation, the revised architecture
reduces the per-epoch training time with more than 30% and consistently
improves recognition performance across different tasks, input features, and
noisy conditions when compared to a standard GRU.

 <dc:description>  Social media mining has become one of the most popular research areas in Big
Data with the explosion of social networking information from Facebook,
Twitter, LinkedIn, Weibo and so on. Understanding and representing the
structure of a social network is a key in social media mining. In this paper,
we propose the Motif Iteration Model (MIM) to represent the structure of a
social network. As the name suggested, the new model is based on iteration of
basic network motifs. In order to better show the properties of the model, a
heuristic and greedy algorithm called Vertex Reordering and Arranging (VRA) is
proposed by studying the adjacency matrix of the three-vertex undirected
network motifs. The algorithm is for mapping from the adjacency matrix of a
network to a binary image, it shows a new perspective of network structure
visualization. In summary, this model provides a useful approach towards
building link between images and networks and offers a new way of representing
the structure of a social network.

 <dc:description>  The future wireless networks envision ultra-reliable communication with
efficient use of the limited wireless channel resources. Closed-loop repetition
protocols where retransmission of a packet is enabled using a feedback channel
has been adopted since early days of wireless telecommunication. Protocols such
as automatic repeat request (ARQ) are used in today's wireless technologies as
a mean to provide the link with reduced rate of packet outage and increased
average throughput. The performance of such protocols is strongly dependent to
the feedback channel reliability. This paper studies the problem of feedback
error and proposes a new method of acknowledging packet delivery for
retransmission protocols in unreliable feedback channel conditions. The
proposed method is based on backwards composite acknowledgment from multiple
packets in a retransmission protocol and provides the scheduler of the wireless
channel with additional parameters to configure ultra-reliable communication
for a user depending on channel quality. Numerical analysis are presented which
show orders of magnitude increase in reliability of the proposed method as
compared to ARQ at the cost of a small increase in average experienced delay.

 <dc:description>  Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a two-dimensional
signaling technique that has recently emerged in the literature to tackle the
time-varying (TV) wireless channels. OTFS deploys the Doppler-delay plane to
multiplex the transmit data where the time variations of the TV channel are
integrated over time and hence the equivalent channel relating the input and
output of the system boils down to a time-invariant one. This signaling
technique can be implemented on the top of a given multicarrier waveform with
the addition of precoding and post-processing units to the modulator and
demodulator. In this paper, we present discrete-time formulation of an
OFDM-based OTFS system. We argue against deployment of window functions at the
OTFS transmitter in realistic scenarios and thus limit any sort of windowing to
the receiver side. We study the channel impact in discrete-time providing
deeper insights into OTFS systems. Moreover, our derivations lead to simplified
modulator and demodulator structures that are far simpler than those in the
literature.

to be connected in the cheapest possible way in an edge-weighted graph. This
problem has been extensively studied from the viewpoint of approximation and
also parameterization. In particular, on one hand Steiner Tree is known to be
APX-hard, and W[2]-hard on the other, if parameterized by the number of
non-terminals (Steiner vertices) in the optimum solution. In contrast to this
we give an efficient parameterized approximation scheme (EPAS), which
circumvents both hardness results. Moreover, our methods imply the existence of
a polynomial size approximate kernelization scheme (PSAKS) for the assumed
parameter.
  We further study the parameterized approximability of other variants of
Steiner Tree, such as Directed Steiner Tree and Steiner Forest. For neither of
these an EPAS is likely to exist for the studied parameter: for Steiner Forest
an easy observation shows that the problem is APX-hard, even if the input graph
contains no Steiner vertices. For Directed Steiner Tree we prove that computing
a constant approximation for this parameter is W[1]-hard. Nevertheless, we show
that an EPAS exists for Unweighted Directed Steiner Tree. Also we prove that
there is an EPAS and a PSAKS for Steiner Forest if in addition to the number of
Steiner vertices, the number of connected components of an optimal solution is
considered to be a parameter.

 <dc:title>Conditional Chromatic Filtering with Spatial Enhancement for Restoring
  Pansharpened Images</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Pansharpening techniques aim at fusing the structural detail of the
panchromatic and the color accuracy of the low-resolution spectral bands
provided by Earth observation satellites to produce a high-resolution
multispectral image. A large number of methods have been proposed in the
literature, most of which were developed based on certain assumptions about the
acquisition system. If any of these assumptions are not fulfilled, the quality
of the fused products may be seriously compromised. We propose a
post-processing restoration strategy to improve the quality of pansharpened
images. In a first stage, we introduce a nonlocal variational model for
filtering the chromatic components conditionally to the geometry of the
panchromatic. In the second stage, the structural component is replaced by the
locally histogram-matched panchromatic for spatial enhancement. An exhaustive
performance evaluation of the proposed restoration strategy illustrates its
efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are widely used in
probabilistic planning problems in which an agent interacts with an environment
using noisy and imprecise sensors. We study a setting in which the sensors are
only partially defined and the goal is to synthesize &quot;weakest&quot; additional
sensors, such that in the resulting POMDP, there is a small-memory policy for
the agent that almost-surely (with probability~1) satisfies a reachability
objective. We show that the problem is NP-complete, and present a symbolic
algorithm by encoding the problem into SAT instances. We illustrate trade-offs
between the amount of memory of the policy and the number of additional sensors
on a simple example. We have implemented our approach and consider three
classical POMDP examples from the literature, and show that in all the examples
the number of sensors can be significantly decreased (as compared to the
existing solutions in the literature) without increasing the complexity of the
policies.

 <dc:title>The Dependence of Frequency Distributions on Multiple Meanings of Words,

 <dc:description>  The dependence of the frequency distributions due to multiple meanings of
words in a text is investigated by deleting letters. By coding the words with
fewer letters the number of meanings per coded word increases. This increase is
measured and used as an input in a predictive theory. For a text written in
English, the word-frequency distribution is broad and fat-tailed, whereas if
the words are only represented by their first letter the distribution becomes
exponential. Both distribution are well predicted by the theory, as is the
whole sequence obtained by consecutively representing the words by the first
L=6,5,4,3,2,1 letters. Comparisons of texts written by Chinese characters and
the same texts written by letter-codes are made and the similarity of the
corresponding frequency-distributions are interpreted as a consequence of the
multiple meanings of Chinese characters. This further implies that the
difference of the shape for word-frequencies for an English text written by
letters and a Chinese text written by Chinese characters is due to the coding
and not to the language per se.

 <dc:description>  We propose to use question answering (QA) data from Web forums to train
chatbots from scratch, i.e., without dialog training data. First, we extract
pairs of question and answer sentences from the typically much longer texts of
questions and answers in a forum. We then use these shorter texts to train
seq2seq models in a more efficient way. We further improve the parameter
optimization using a new model selection strategy based on QA measures.
Finally, we propose to use extrinsic evaluation with respect to a QA task as an
automatic evaluation method for chatbots. The evaluation shows that the model
achieves a MAP of 63.5% on the extrinsic task. Moreover, it can answer
correctly 49.5% of the questions when they are similar to questions asked in
the forum, and 47.3% of the questions when they are more conversational in
style.

 <dc:description>  Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication is a key component of the future
autonomous driving systems. V2V can provide an improved awareness of the
surrounding environment, and the knowledge about the future actions of nearby
vehicles. However, V2V communication is subject to different kind of failures
and delays, so a distributed fault-tolerant approach is required for safe and
efficient transportation. This work considers fully autonomous vehicles that
operates using local sensory information, and aided with fault-tolerant V2V
communication. The sensors provide all basic functionality, but are overridden
by V2V whenever is possible to increase the efficiency. As an example scenario,
we consider intersection crossing (IC) with autonomous vehicles that cooperate
via V2V communication, and propose a fully distributed and a fault-tolerant
algorithm for this problem. According to our numerical results, based on a real
data set, we show the crossing delay is only slightly increased in the presence
of a burst of V2V failures, and that V2V can be successfully used in most
scenarios.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new channel estimation scheme for TDD/FDD massive
MIMO systems by reconstructing uplink/downlink channel covariance matrices
(CCMs) with the aid of array signal processing techniques. Specifically, the
angle information and power angular spectrum (PAS) of each multi-path channel
is extracted from the instantaneous uplink channel state information (CSI).
Then, the uplink CCM is reconstructed and can be used to improve the uplink
channel estimation without any additional training cost. In virtue of angle
reciprocity as well as PAS reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels,
the downlink CCM could also be inferred with a similar approach even for FDD
massive MIMO systems. Then, the downlink instantaneous CSI can be obtained by
training towards the dominant eigen-directions of each user. The proposed
strategy is applicable for any kind of PAS distributions and array geometries.
Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
methods over the existing ones.

 <dc:subject>I.2.11</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Within the area of multi-agent systems, normative systems are a widely used
framework for the coordination of interdependent activities. A crucial problem
associated with normative systems is that of synthesising norms that
effectively accomplish a coordination task and whose compliance forms a
rational choice for the agents within the system. In this work, we introduce a
framework for the synthesis of normative systems that effectively coordinate a
multi-agent system and whose norms are likely to be adopted by rational agents.
Our approach roots in evolutionary game theory. Our framework considers
multi-agent systems in which evolutionary forces lead successful norms to
prosper and spread within the agent population, while unsuccessful norms are
discarded. The outputs of this evolutionary norm synthesis process are
normative systems whose compliance forms a rational choice for the agents. We
empirically show the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluation
in a simulated traffic domain.

 <dc:description>  Cloud users have little visibility into the performance characteristics and
utilization of the physical machines underpinning the virtualized cloud
resources they use. This uncertainty forces users and researchers to reverse
engineer the inner workings of cloud systems in order to understand and
optimize the conditions their applications operate. At Massachusetts Open Cloud
(MOC), as a public cloud operator, we'd like to expose the utilization of our
physical infrastructure to stop this wasteful effort. Mindful that such
exposure can be used maliciously for gaining insight into other users
workloads, in this position paper we argue for the need for an approach that
balances openness of the cloud overall with privacy for each tenant inside of
it. We believe that this approach can be instantiated via a novel combination
of several security and privacy technologies. We discuss the potential
benefits, implications of transparency for cloud systems and users, and
technical challenges/possibilities.

 <dc:description>  The fifth generation (5G) wireless standard will support several new use
cases and 10 to 100 times the performance of fourth generation (4G) systems.
Because of the diverse applications for 5G, flexible solutions which can
address conflicting requirements will be needed. In this paper, we propose a
solution which enables the use of discrete Fourier transform spread orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM) and OFDM, which address different
requirements, using a common reference symbol (RS) design. In this solution,
the DFT-s-OFDM symbol contains RSs in the frequency domain that may be shared
by a subsequent OFDM symbol. The proposed scheme is generated by puncturing the
output of a DFT-spread block and replacing the punctured samples with RSs in
frequency. We prove that puncturing the interleaved samples at the output of
the DFT-spread operation equivalently introduces a periodic interference to the
data symbols at the input of the DFT-spread operation. We show that the
interference due to the puncturing can be removed with a low-complexity
receiver by exploiting the zeros inserted to certain locations before the
DFT-spread block at the transmitter. Simulation results support that the
proposed scheme removes the error floor caused by the puncturing and achieves
lower peak-to-average-power ratio than OFDM.

 <dc:description>  Current Distributed Radio Access Networks~(D-RANs), which are characterized
by a static configuration and deployment of Base Stations~(BSs), have exposed
their limitations in handling the temporal and geographical fluctuations of
capacity demands. At the same time, each BS's spectrum and computing resources
are only used by the active users in the cell range, causing idle BSs in some
areas/times and overloaded BSs in other areas/times. Recently, Cloud Radio
Access Network~(C-RAN) has been introduced as a new centralized paradigm for
wireless cellular networks in which---through virtualization---the BSs are
physically decoupled into Virtual Base Stations~(VBSs) and Remote Radio
Heads~(RRHs). In this paper, a novel elastic framework aimed at fully
exploiting the potential of C-RAN is proposed, which is able to adapt to the
fluctuation in capacity demand while at the same time maximizing the energy
efficiency and resource utilization. Simulation and testbed experiment results
are presented to illustrate the performance gains of the proposed elastic
solution against the current static deployment.

 <dc:description>  Web browsers are increasingly used as middleware platforms offering a central
access point for service provision. Using backend containerization, RESTful
APIs, and distributed computing allows for complex systems to be realized that
address the needs of modern compute intense environments. In this paper, we
present a web-based medical image data and information management software
platform called CHIPS (Cloud Healthcare Image Processing Service). This
cloud-based services allows for authenticated and secure retrieval of medical
image data from resources typically found in hospitals, organizes and presents
information in a modern feed-like interface, provides access to a growing
library of plugins that process these data, allows for easy data sharing
between users and provides powerful 3D visualization and real-time
collaboration. Image processing is orchestrated across additional cloud-based
resources using containerization technologies.

 <dc:description>  Redundancy for straggler mitigation, originally in data download and more
recently in distributed computing context, has been shown to be effective both
in theory and practice. Analysis of systems with redundancy has drawn
significant attention and numerous papers have studied pain and gain of
redundancy under various service models and assumptions on the straggler
characteristics. We here present a cost (pain) vs. latency (gain) analysis of
using simple replication or erasure coding for straggler mitigation in
executing jobs with many tasks. We quantify the effect of the tail of task
execution times and discuss tail heaviness as a decisive parameter for the cost
and latency of using redundancy. Specifically, we find that coded redundancy
achieves better cost vs. latency and allows for greater achievable latency and
cost tradeoff region compared to replication and can yield reduction in both
cost and latency under less heavy tailed execution times. We show that delaying
redundancy is not effective in reducing cost.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We investigate Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to model one particular
kind of image: frames from TV cartoons. Cartoons are particularly interesting
because their visual appearance emphasizes the important semantic information
about a scene while abstracting out the less important details, but each
cartoon series has a distinctive artistic style that performs this abstraction
in different ways. We consider a dataset consisting of images from two popular
television cartoon series, Family Guy and The Simpsons. We examine the ability
of GANs to generate images from each of these two domains, when trained
independently as well as on both domains jointly. We find that generative
models may be capable of finding semantic-level correspondences between these
two image domains despite the unsupervised setting, even when the training data
does not give labeled alignments between them.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new algorithm for color transfer between images that have
perceptually similar semantic structures. We aim to achieve a more accurate
color transfer that leverages semantically-meaningful dense correspondence
between images. To accomplish this, our algorithm uses neural representations
for matching. Additionally, the color transfer should be spatially-variant and
globally coherent. Therefore, our algorithm optimizes a local linear model for
color transfer satisfying both local and global constraints. Our proposed
approach jointly optimize matching and color transfer, adopting a
coarse-to-fine strategy. The proposed method can be successfully extended from
&quot;one-to-one&quot; to &quot;one-to-many&quot; color transfers. The latter further addresses the
problem of mismatching elements of the input image. We validate our proposed
method by testing it on a large variety of image content.

 <dc:description>  A snark is a bridgeless cubic graph which is not 3-edge-colourable. The
oddness of a bridgeless cubic graph is the minimum number of odd components in
any 2-factor of the graph.
  Lukot'ka, M\'acajov\'a, Maz\'ak and \v{S}koviera showed in [Electron. J.
Combin. 22 (2015)] that the smallest snark with oddness 4 has 28 vertices and
remarked and that there are exactly two such graphs of that order. However,
this remark is incorrect as -- using an exhaustive computer search -- we show
that there are in fact three snarks with oddness 4 on 28 vertices. In this note
we present the missing snark and also determine all snarks with oddness 4 up to
34 vertices.

 <dc:description>  Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a reliable metric for measuring the quality
of the classification performance on imbalanced data. The existing pairwise
learn to rank linear algorithms can optimize the AUC metric efficiently, but
lack modeling the nonlinearity underlying the data. The large scale and
nonlinear distribution of many real world data render the kernelized variants
of these linear classifiers impractical. In this paper, we propose a linear
K-hyperplane classifier for AUC maximization. The proposed method employs a set
of linear pairwise classifiers in order to approximate the nonlinear decision
boundary. More specifically, we define a set of landmark points using
unsupervised algorithm, and associate each landmark with a linear pairwise
classifier. These linear classifiers are learned jointly on pairs of instances
where each instance in the pair is weighted based on its distance from the
corresponding landmark point. We use a local coding algorithm to estimate the
weights of the instances. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our classifier is efficient and able to achieve roughly comparable AUC
classification performance as compared to kernalized pairwise classifier. The
proposed classifier also outperforms the linear RankSVM classifiers in terms of
AUC performance.

 <dc:description>  The increasing availability of rich and complex data in a variety of
scientific domains poses a pressing need for tools to enable scientists to
rapidly make sense of and gather insights from data. One proposed solution is
to design visual query systems (VQSs) that allow scientists to search for
desired patterns in their datasets. While many existing VQSs promise to
accelerate exploratory data analysis by facilitating this search, they are
unfortunately not widely used in practice. Through a year-long collaboration
with scientists in three distinct domains---astronomy, genetics, and material
science---we study the impact of various features within VQSs that can aid
rapid visual data analysis, and how VQSs fit into a scientists' analysis
workflow. Our findings offer design guidelines for improving the usability and
adoption of next-generation VQSs, paving the way for VQSs to be applied to a
variety of scientific domains.

 <dc:description>  In large scale collective decision making, social choice is a normative study
of how one ought to design a protocol for reaching consensus. However, in
instances where the underlying decision space is too large or complex for
ordinal voting, standard voting methods of social choice may be impractical.
How then can we design a mechanism - preferably decentralized, simple,
scalable, and not requiring any special knowledge of the decision space - to
reach consensus? We propose sequential deliberation as a natural solution to
this problem. In this iterative method, successive pairs of agents bargain over
the decision space using the previous decision as a disagreement alternative.
We describe the general method and analyze the quality of its outcome when the
space of preferences define a median graph. We show that sequential
deliberation finds a 1.208- approximation to the optimal social cost on such
graphs, coming very close to this value with only a small constant number of
agents sampled from the population. We also show lower bounds on simpler
classes of mechanisms to justify our design choices. We further show that
sequential deliberation is ex-post Pareto efficient and has truthful reporting
as an equilibrium of the induced extensive form game. We finally show that for
general metric spaces, the second moment of of the distribution of social cost
of the outcomes produced by sequential deliberation is also bounded.

 <dc:description>  A graph environment must be explored by a collection of mobile robots. Some
of the robots, a priori unknown, may turn out to be unreliable. The graph is
weighted and each node is assigned a deadline. The exploration is successful if
each node of the graph is visited before its deadline by a reliable robot. The
edge weight corresponds to the time needed by a robot to traverse the edge.
Given the number of robots which may crash, is it possible to design an
algorithm, which will always guarantee the exploration, independently of the
choice of the subset of unreliable robots by the adversary? We find the optimal
time, during which the graph may be explored. Our approach permits to find the
maximal number of robots, which may turn out to be unreliable, and the graph is
still guaranteed to be explored.
  We concentrate on line graphs and rings, for which we give positive results.
We start with the case of the collections involving only reliable robots. We
give algorithms finding optimal times needed for exploration when the robots
are assigned to fixed initial positions as well as when such starting positions
may be determined by the algorithm. We extend our consideration to the case
when some number of robots may be unreliable. Our most surprising result is
that solving the line exploration problem with robots at given positions, which
may involve crash-faulty ones, is NP-hard. The same problem has polynomial
solutions for a ring and for the case when the initial robots' positions on the
line are arbitrary.
  The exploration problem is shown to be NP-hard for star graphs, even when the
team consists of only two reliable robots.

 <dc:description>  In vehicular cyber-physical systems (CPS), safety information, including
vehicular speed and location information, is shared among vehicles via wireless
waves at specific frequency. This helps control vehicle to alleviate traffic
congestion and road accidents. However, Doppler shift existing between vehicles
with high relative speed causes an apparent frequency shift for the received
wireless wave, which consequently decreases the reliability of the recovered
safety information and jeopardizes the safety of vehicular CPS. Passive
confrontation of Doppler shift at the receiver side is not applicable due to
multiple Doppler shifts at each receiver. In this paper, we provide a proactive
Doppler shift compensation algorithm based on the probabilistic graphical
model. Each vehicle pre-compensates its carrier frequency individually so that
there is no frequency shift from the desired carrier frequency between each
pair of transceiver. The pre-compensated offset for each vehicle is computed in
a distributed fashion in order to be adaptive to the distributed and dynamic
topology of vehicular CPS. Besides, the updating procedure is designed in a
broadcasting fashion to reduce communication burden. It is rigorously proved
that the proposed algorithm is convergence guaranteed even for systems with
packet drops and random communication delays. Simulations based on real map and
transportation data verify the accuracy and convergence property of the
proposed algorithm. It is shown that this method achieves almost the optimal
frequency compensation accuracy with an error approaching the Cram\'{e}r-Rao
lower bound.

 <dc:description>  Flexible duplex is proposed to adapt to the channel and traffic asymmetry for
future wireless networks. In this paper, we propose two novel algorithms within
the flexible duplex framework for joint uplink and downlink resource allocation
in multi-cell scenario, named SAFP and RMDI, based on the awareness of
interference coupling among wireless links. Numerical results show significant
performance gain over the baseline system with fixed uplink/downlink resource
configuration, and over the dynamic TDD scheme that independently adapts the
configuration to time-varying traffic volume in each cell. The proposed
algorithms achieve two-fold increase when compared with the baseline scheme,
measured by the worst-case quality of service satisfaction level, under a low
level of traffic asymmetry. The gain is more significant when the traffic is
highly asymmetric, as it achieves three-fold increase.

 <dc:description>  To deal with the rapid growth of high-speed and/or ultra-low latency data
traffic for massive mobile users, fog radio access networks (Fog-RANs) have
emerged as a promising architecture for next-generation wireless networks. In
Fog-RANs, the edge nodes and user terminals possess storage, computation and
communication functionalities to various degrees, which provides high
flexibility for network operation, i.e., from fully centralized to fully
distributed operation. In this paper, we study the cache placement problem in
Fog-RANs, by taking into account flexible physical-layer transmission schemes
and diverse content preferences of different users. We develop both centralized
and distributed transmission aware cache placement strategies to minimize
users' average download delay subject to the storage capacity constraints. In
the centralized mode, the cache placement problem is transformed into a matroid
constrained submodular maximization problem, and an approximation algorithm is
proposed to find a solution within a constant factor to the optimum. In the
distributed mode, a belief propagation based distributed algorithm is proposed
to provide a suboptimal solution, with iterative updates at each BS based on
locally collected information. Simulation results show that by exploiting
caching and cooperation gains, the proposed transmission aware caching
algorithms can greatly reduce the users' average download delay.

 <dc:description>  We used computer proof-checking methods to verify the correctness of our
proofs of the propositions in Euclid Book I. We used axioms as close as
possible to those of Euclid, in a language closely related to that used in
Tarski's formal geometry. We used proofs as close as possible to those given by
Euclid, but filling Euclid's gaps and correcting errors. Euclid Book I has 48
propositions, we proved 213 theorems. The extras were partly &quot;Book Zero&quot;,
preliminaries of a very fundamental nature, partly propositions that Euclid
omitted but were used implicitly, partly advanced theorems that we found
necessary to fill Euclid's gaps, and partly just variants of Euclid's
propositions. We wrote these proofs in a simple fragment of first-order logic
corresponding to Euclid's logic, debugged them using a custom software tool,
and then checked them in the well-known and trusted proof checkers HOL Light
and Coq.

 <dc:description>  We characterize three notions of explainable AI that cut across research
fields: opaque systems that offer no insight into its algo- rithmic mechanisms;
interpretable systems where users can mathemat- ically analyze its algorithmic
mechanisms; and comprehensible systems that emit symbols enabling user-driven
explanations of how a conclusion is reached. The paper is motivated by a corpus
analysis of NIPS, ACL, COGSCI, and ICCV/ECCV paper titles showing differences
in how work on explainable AI is positioned in various fields. We close by

reasoning is central to output crafted explanations without requiring human
post processing as final step of the generative process.

 <dc:description>  Using a sharp version of the reverse Young inequality, and a R\'enyi entropy
comparison result due to Madiman and Wang, the authors are able to derive a
R\'enyi entropy power inequality for log-concave random vectors when R\'enyi
parameters belong to $(0,1)$. Furthermore, the estimates are shown to be
somewhat sharp.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: Image guidance is crucial for the success of many interventions.
Images are displayed on designated monitors that cannot be positioned optimally
due to sterility and spatial constraints. This indirect visualization causes
potential occlusion, hinders hand-eye coordination, leads to increased
procedure duration and surgeon load. Methods: We propose a virtual monitor
system that displays medical images in a mixed reality visualization using
optical see-through head-mounted displays. The system streams high-resolution
medical images from any modality to the head-mounted display in real-time that
are blended with the surgical site. It allows for mixed reality visualization
of images in head-, world-, or body-anchored mode and can thus be adapted to
specific procedural needs. Results: For typical image sizes, the proposed
system exhibits an average end-to-end delay and refresh rate of 214 +- 30 ms
and 41:4 +- 32:0 Hz, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed virtual monitor
system is capable of real-time mixed reality visualization of medical images.
In future, we seek to conduct first pre-clinical studies to quantitatively
assess the impact of the system on standard image guided procedures.

 <dc:title>The Capacity of Private Information Retrieval with Partially Known
  Private Side Information</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of private information retrieval (PIR) of a single
message out of $K$ messages from $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases
where a cache-enabled user (retriever) of cache-size $M$ possesses side
information in the form of full messages that are partially known to the
databases. In this model, the user and the databases engage in a two-phase
scheme, namely, the prefetching phase where the user acquires side information
and the retrieval phase where the user downloads desired information. In the
prefetching phase, the user receives $m_n$ full messages from the $n$th
database, under the cache memory size constraint $\sum_{n=1}^N m_n \leq M$. In
the retrieval phase, the user wishes to retrieve a message such that no
individual database learns anything about the identity of the desired message.
In addition, the identities of the side information messages that the user did
not prefetch from a database must remain private against that database. Since
the side information provided by each database in the prefetching phase is
known by the providing database and the side information must be kept private
against the remaining databases, we coin this model as \textit{partially known
private side information}. We characterize the capacity of the PIR with
partially known private side information to be
$C=\left(1+\frac{1}{N}+\cdots+\frac{1}{N^{K-M-1}}\right)^{-1}=\frac{1-\frac{1}{N}}{1-(\frac{1}{N})^{K-M}}$.
Interestingly, this result is the same if none of the databases knows any of
the prefetched side information, i.e., when the side information is obtained
externally, a problem posed by Kadhe et al. and settled by Chen-Wang-Jafar
recently. Thus, our result implies that there is no loss in using the same
databases for both prefetching and retrieval phases.

 <dc:description>  Analysis of an organization's computer network activity is a key component of
early detection and mitigation of insider threat, a growing concern for many
organizations. Raw system logs are a prototypical example of streaming data
that can quickly scale beyond the cognitive power of a human analyst. As a
prospective filter for the human analyst, we present an online unsupervised
deep learning approach to detect anomalous network activity from system logs in
real time. Our models decompose anomaly scores into the contributions of
individual user behavior features for increased interpretability to aid
analysts reviewing potential cases of insider threat. Using the CERT Insider
Threat Dataset v6.2 and threat detection recall as our performance metric, our
novel deep and recurrent neural network models outperform Principal Component
Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest based anomaly detection
baselines. For our best model, the events labeled as insider threat activity in
our dataset had an average anomaly score in the 95.53 percentile, demonstrating
our approach's potential to greatly reduce analyst workloads.

to discrete entropy power inequalities, the Littlewood-Offord problem, and

 <dc:description>  Large databases such as aflowlib.org provide valuable data sources for
discovering material trends through machine learning. Although a REST API and
query language are available, there is a learning curve associated with the
AFLUX language that acts as a barrier for new users. Additionally, the data is
stored using non-standard serialization formats. Here we present a high-level
API that allows immediate access to the aflowlib data using standard python
operators and language features. It provides an easy way to integrate aflowlib
data with other python materials packages such as ase and quippy, and provides
automatic deserialization into numpy arrays and python objects. This package is
available via &quot;pip install aflow&quot;.

 <dc:description>  Deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results in learning control
policies for complex sequential decision-making tasks. However, these neural
network-based policies are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples. This
vulnerability poses a potentially serious threat to safety-critical systems
such as autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism to
defend reinforcement learning agents from adversarial attacks by leveraging an
action-conditioned frame prediction module. Our core idea is that the
adversarial examples targeting at a neural network-based policy are not
effective for the frame prediction model. By comparing the action distribution
produced by a policy from processing the current observed frame to the action
distribution produced by the same policy from processing the predicted frame
from the action-conditioned frame prediction module, we can detect the presence
of adversarial examples. Beyond detecting the presence of adversarial examples,
our method allows the agent to continue performing the task using the predicted
frame when the agent is under attack. We evaluate the performance of our
algorithm using five games in Atari 2600. Our results demonstrate that the
proposed defense mechanism achieves favorable performance against baseline
algorithms in detecting adversarial examples and in earning rewards when the
agents are under attack.

 <dc:description>  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application-layer control
protocol for creating, modifying and terminating multimedia sessions. An open
issue is the control of overload that occurs when a SIP server lacks sufficient
CPU and memory resources to process all messages. We prove that the problem of
overload control in SIP network with a set of n servers and limited resources
is in the form of NP-hard. This paper proposes a Load-Balanced Call Admission
Controller (LB-CAC), based on a heuristic mathematical model to determine an
optimal resource allocation in such a way that maximizes call admission rates
regarding the limited resources of the SIP servers. LB-CAC determines the
optimal &quot;call admission rates&quot; and &quot;signaling paths&quot; for admitted calls along
optimal allocation of CPU and memory resources of the SIP servers through a new
linear programming model. This happens by acquiring some critical information
of SIP servers. An assessment of the numerical and experimental results
demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Online social networks, World Wide Web, media and technological networks, and
other types of so-called information networks are ubiquitous nowadays. These
information networks are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. They are
heterogeneous as they consist of multi-typed objects and relations, and they
are dynamic as they are constantly evolving over time. One of the challenging
issues in such heterogeneous and dynamic environments is to forecast those
relationships in the network that will appear in the future. In this paper, we
try to solve the problem of continuous-time relationship prediction in dynamic
and heterogeneous information networks. This implies predicting the time it
takes for a relationship to appear in the future, given its features that have
been extracted by considering both the heterogeneity and the temporal dynamics
of the underlying network. To this end, we first introduce a meta-path-based
feature extraction framework to effectively extract features suitable for
relationship prediction regarding the heterogeneity and dynamicity of the
network. Next, we propose a supervised nonparametric approach, called
Non-Parametric Generalized Linear Model (NP-GLM), which infers the hidden
underlying probability distribution of the relationship building time given its
features. We then present a learning algorithm to train NP-GLM and an inference
method to answer time-related queries. Extensive experiments conducted on both
synthetic dataset and real-world DBLP bibliographic citation network dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of Np-Glm in solving continuous-time relationship
prediction problem vis-a-vis alternative baselines.

 <dc:description>  Three-dimensional shells can be synthesized from the spontaneous self-folding
of two-dimensional templates of interconnected panels, called nets. The yield
is maximized following sequentially two design rules: (i) maximum number of
vertices with a single-edge cut and (ii) minimum radius of gyration of the net.
Previous methods to identify the optimal net are based on random search and
thus limited to very simple shell structures and not guaranteeing a unique
solution. Here, we show that the optimal net can be found using a deterministic
algorithm. We map the connectivity of the shell into a shell graph, where the
nodes and links of the graph represent the vertices and edges of the shell,
respectively. Applying the design rule (i) corresponds then to finding the set
of maximum leaf spanning trees of the shell graph, to which (ii) can be applied
straightforwardly. This method allows not only to designing the self-assembly
of much larger shell structures but also to apply additional design rules, as a
complete catalog of the maximum leaf spanning trees is obtained.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problems of stochastic stability and sliding mode
control for a class of continuous-time Markovian jump systems with
mode-dependent time-varying delays and partly unknown transition probabilities.
The design method is general enough to cover a wide spectrum of systems from
those with completely known transition probability rates to those with
completely unknown transition probability rates. Based on some mode-dependent
Lyapunov-Krasovski functionals and making use of the free-connection weighting
matrices, new delay-dependent conditions guaranteeing the existence of linear
switching surfaces and the stochastic stability of sliding mode dynamics are
derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Then, a sliding mode
controller is designed such that the resulted closed-loop system's trajectories
converge to predefined sliding surfaces in a finite time and remain there for
all subsequent times. This paper also proposes an adaptive sliding mode
controller design method which applies to cases in which mode-dependent
time-varying delays are unknown. All the conditions obtained in this paper are
in terms of LMI feasibility problems. Numerical examples are given to
illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of testing for community structure in networks using
relations between the observed frequencies of small subgraphs. We propose a
simple test for the existence of communities based only on the frequencies of
three-node subgraphs. The test statistic is shown to be asymptotically normal
under a null assumption of no community structure, and to have power
approaching one under a composite alternative hypothesis of a degree-corrected
stochastic block model. We also derive a version of the test that applies to
multivariate Gaussian data. Our approach achieves near-optimal detection rates
for the presence of community structure, in regimes where the signal-to-noise
is too weak to explicitly estimate the communities themselves, using existing
computationally efficient algorithms. We demonstrate how the method can be
effective for detecting structure in social networks, citation networks for
scientific articles, and correlations of stock returns between companies on the
S\&amp;P 500.

 <dc:title>Clustering Stream Data by Exploring the Evolution of Density Mountain</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Stream clustering is a fundamental problem in many streaming data analysis
applications. Comparing to classical batch-mode clustering, there are two key
challenges in stream clustering: (i) Given that input data are changing
continuously, how to incrementally update clustering results efficiently? (ii)
Given that clusters continuously evolve with the evolution of data, how to
capture the cluster evolution activities? Unfortunately, most of existing
stream clustering algorithms can neither update the cluster result in real time
nor track the evolution of clusters.
  In this paper, we propose an stream clustering algorithm EDMStream by
exploring the Evolution of Density Mountain. The density mountain is used to
abstract the data distribution, the changes of which indicate data distribution
evolution. We track the evolution of clusters by monitoring the changes of
density mountains. We further provide efficient data structures and filtering
schemes to ensure the update of density mountains in real time, which makes
online clustering possible. The experimental results on synthetic and real
datasets show that, comparing to the state-of-the-art stream clustering
algorithms, e.g., D-Stream, DenStream, DBSTREAM and MR-Stream, our algorithm
can response to a cluster update much faster (say 7-15x faster than the best of
the competitors) and at the same time achieve comparable cluster quality.
Furthermore, EDMStream can successfully capture the cluster evolution
activities.

 <dc:title>Rethinking Feature Discrimination and Polymerization for Large-scale

 <dc:description>  Feature matters. How to train a deep network to acquire discriminative
features across categories and polymerized features within classes has always
been at the core of many computer vision tasks, specially for large-scale
recognition systems where test identities are unseen during training and the
number of classes could be at million scale. In this paper, we address this
problem based on the simple intuition that the cosine distance of features in
high-dimensional space should be close enough within one class and far away
across categories. To this end, we proposed the congenerous cosine (COCO)
algorithm to simultaneously optimize the cosine similarity among data. It
inherits the softmax property to make inter-class features discriminative as
well as shares the idea of class centroid in metric learning. Unlike previous
work where the center is a temporal, statistical variable within one mini-batch
during training, the formulated centroid is responsible for clustering
inner-class features to enforce them polymerized around the network truncus.
COCO is bundled with discriminative training and learned end-to-end with stable
convergence. Experiments on five benchmarks have been extensively conducted to
verify the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale classification
task and large-scale human recognition problem.

 <dc:description>  Given $n$ pairs of points, $\mathcal{S} = \{\{p_1, q_1\}, \{p_2, q_2\},
\dots, \{p_n, q_n\}\}$, in some metric space, we study the problem of
two-coloring the points within each pair, red and blue, to optimize the cost of
a pair of node-disjoint networks, one over the red points and one over the blue
points. In this paper we consider our network structures to be spanning trees,
traveling salesman tours or matchings. We consider several different weight
functions computed over the network structures induced, as well as several
different objective functions. We show that some of these problems are NP-hard,
and provide constant factor approximation algorithms in all cases.

 <dc:description>  Modeling hypernymy, such as poodle is-a dog, is an important generalization
aid to many NLP tasks, such as entailment, relation extraction, and question
answering. Supervised learning from labeled hypernym sources, such as WordNet,
limit the coverage of these models, which can be addressed by learning
hypernyms from unlabeled text. Existing unsupervised methods either do not
scale to large vocabularies or yield unacceptably poor accuracy. This paper
introduces distributional inclusion vector embedding (DIVE), a
simple-to-implement unsupervised method of hypernym discovery via per-word
non-negative vector embeddings learned by modeling diversity of word context
with specialized negative sampling. In an experimental evaluation more
comprehensive than any previous literature of which we are aware - evaluating
on 11 datasets using multiple existing as well as newly proposed scoring
metrics - we find that our method can provide up to double or triple the
precision of previous unsupervised methods, and also sometimes outperforms
previous semi-supervised methods, yielding many new state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:title>The Tersoff many-body potential: Sustainable performance through

 <dc:description>  Molecular dynamics models materials by simulating each individual particle's
trajectory. Many-body potentials lead to a more accurate trajectory simulation,
and are used in materials science and computational chemistry. We present
optimization results for one multi-body potential on a range of vector
instruction sets, targeting both CPUs and accelerators like the Intel Xeon Phi.
Parallelization of MD simulations is well-studied; by contrast, vectorization
is relatively unexplored. Given the prevalence and power of modern vector
units, exploiting them is imperative for high performance software. When
running on a highly parallel machine, any improvement to the scalar performance
is paid back in hundreds or thousands of saved core hours. Vectorization is
already commonly used in the optimization or pair potentials; multi-body
potentials pose new, unique challenges. Indeed, their optimization pushes the
boundaries of current compilers, forcing us to use explicit vectorization
techniques for now. In this study, we add an optimized implementation of
Tersoff potential to the LAMMPS molecular dynamics simulation package. To
reduce the burden of explicit vectorization, we abstract from the specific
vector instruction set and desired precision: From one algorithm, we get
optimized implementations for many platforms, from SSE4.2 to AVX512, and the
Intel Xeon Phi. We compare the kernels across different architectures, and
determine suitable architecture-dependent parameters. Our optimizations benefit
any architecture, but have a disproportionate effect on the Intel Xeon Phi,
which beats the CPU (2xE5-2650) after optimization.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) has achieved a great success in image
recognition task by automatically learning a hierarchical feature
representation from raw data. While the majority of Time-Series Classification
(TSC) literature is focused on 1D signals, this paper uses Recurrence Plots
(RP) to transform time-series into 2D texture images and then take advantage of
the deep CNN classifier. Image representation of time-series introduces
different feature types that are not available for 1D signals, and therefore
TSC can be treated as texture image recognition task. CNN model also allows
learning different levels of representations together with a classifier,
jointly and automatically. Therefore, using RP and CNN in a unified framework
is expected to boost the recognition rate of TSC. Experimental results on the
UCR time-series classification archive demonstrate competitive accuracy of the
proposed approach, compared not only to the existing deep architectures, but
also to the state-of-the art TSC algorithms.

benchmark that was built from an employee happiness dataset where emoji happen
to be annotated with daily happiness of the author of the comment. The data
spans over 3 years, and 4k employees of 56 companies based in Barcelona. We
compare sentiment of writers to readers. Results indicate that, there is an 82%
agreement in how emoji sentiment is perceived by readers and writers. Finally,
we report that when authors use emoji they report higher levels of happiness.
Emoji use was not found to be correlated with differences in author moodiness.

mitigating the influence of individual data points. In particular, we focus on
sampling from an exponential family and specific generalized linear models,

offering a new RDP analysis for an existing method in order to add value to the
RDP framework. Each method is capable of achieving arbitrary RDP privacy

also protecting user privacy. The ESA design, and its Prochlo implementation,
are informed by our practical experiences with an existing, large deployment of

 <dc:description>  A means of building safe critical systems consists of formally modeling the
requirements formulated by stakeholders and ensuring their consistency with
respect to application domain properties. This paper proposes a metamodel for
an ontology modeling formalism based on OWL and PLIB. This modeling formalism
is part of a method for modeling the domain of systems whose requirements are
captured through SysML/KAOS. The formal semantics of SysML/KAOS goals are
represented using Event-B specifications. Goals provide the set of events,
while domain models will provide the structure of the system state of the
Event-B specification. Our proposal is illustrated through a case study dealing
with a Cycab localization component specification. The case study deals with
the specification of a localization software component that uses GPS,Wi-Fi and
sensor technologies for the realtime localization of the Cycab vehicle, an
autonomous ground transportation system designed to be robust and completely
independent.

 <dc:description>  In today's era of big data, robust least-squares regression becomes a more
challenging problem when considering the adversarial corruption along with
explosive growth of datasets. Traditional robust methods can handle the noise
but suffer from several challenges when applied in huge dataset including 1)
computational infeasibility of handling an entire dataset at once, 2) existence
of heterogeneously distributed corruption, and 3) difficulty in corruption
estimation when data cannot be entirely loaded. This paper proposes online and
distributed robust regression approaches, both of which can concurrently
address all the above challenges. Specifically, the distributed algorithm
optimizes the regression coefficients of each data block via heuristic hard
thresholding and combines all the estimates in a distributed robust
consolidation. Furthermore, an online version of the distributed algorithm is
proposed to incrementally update the existing estimates with new incoming data.
We also prove that our algorithms benefit from strong robustness guarantees in
terms of regression coefficient recovery with a constant upper bound on the
error of state-of-the-art batch methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate that our approaches are superior to those of existing
methods in effectiveness, with competitive efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Landauer's principle provides a link between Shannon's information entropy
and Clausius' thermodynamical entropy. We set up here a basic formula for the
incremental free energy of a quantum channel, possibly relative to infinite
systems, naturally arising by an Operator Algebraic point of view. By the
Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, we can indeed describe a canonical evolution
associated with a quantum channel state transfer. Such evolution is implemented
both by a modular Hamiltonian and a physical Hamiltonian, the latter being
determined by its functoriality properties. This allows us to make an intrinsic
analysis, extending our QFT index formula, but without any a priori given
dynamics; the associated incremental free energy is related to the logarithm of
the Jones index and is thus quantised. This leads to a general lower bound for
the incremental free energy of an irreversible quantum channel which is half of
the Landauer bound, and to further bounds corresponding to the discrete series
of the Jones index. In the finite dimensional context, or in the case of DHR
charges in QFT, where the dimension is a positive integer, our lower bound
agrees with Landauer's bound.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a deep learning framework for real-time speech-driven 3D facial
animation from just raw waveforms. Our deep neural network directly maps an
input sequence of speech audio to a series of micro facial action unit
activations and head rotations to drive a 3D blendshape face model. In
particular, our deep model is able to learn the latent representations of
time-varying contextual information and affective states within the speech.
Hence, our model not only activates appropriate facial action units at
inference to depict different utterance generating actions, in the form of lip
movements, but also, without any assumption, automatically estimates emotional
intensity of the speaker and reproduces her ever-changing affective states by
adjusting strength of facial unit activations. For example, in a happy speech,
the mouth opens wider than normal, while other facial units are relaxed; or in
a surprised state, both eyebrows raise higher. Experiments on a diverse
audiovisual corpus of different actors across a wide range of emotional states
show interesting and promising results of our approach. Being
speaker-independent, our generalized model is readily applicable to various
tasks in human-machine interaction and animation.

 <dc:title>Minimal Dependency Translation: a Framework for Computer-Assisted

 <dc:creator>Gasser, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces Minimal Dependency Translation (MDT), an ongoing
project to develop a rule-based framework for the creation of rudimentary
bilingual lexicon-grammars for machine translation and computer-assisted
translation into and out of under-resourced languages as well as initial steps
towards an implementation of MDT for English-to-Amharic translation. The basic
units in MDT, called groups, are headed multi-item sequences. In addition to
wordforms, groups may contain lexemes, syntactic-semantic categories, and
grammatical features. Each group is associated with one or more translations,
each of which is a group in a target language. During translation, constraint
satisfaction is used to select a set of source-language groups for the input
sentence and to sequence the words in the associated target-language groups.

 <dc:title>Fine-Grained Head Pose Estimation Without Keypoints</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Estimating the head pose of a person is a crucial problem that has a large
amount of applications such as aiding in gaze estimation, modeling attention,
fitting 3D models to video and performing face alignment. Traditionally head
pose is computed by estimating some keypoints from the target face and solving
the 2D to 3D correspondence problem with a mean human head model. We argue that
this is a fragile method because it relies entirely on landmark detection
performance, the extraneous head model and an ad-hoc fitting step. We present
an elegant and robust way to determine pose by training a multi-loss
convolutional neural network on 300W-LP, a large synthetically expanded
dataset, to predict intrinsic Euler angles (yaw, pitch and roll) directly from
image intensities through joint binned pose classification and regression. We
present empirical tests on common in-the-wild pose benchmark datasets which
show state-of-the-art results. Additionally we test our method on a dataset
usually used for pose estimation using depth and start to close the gap with
state-of-the-art depth pose methods. We open-source our training and testing
code as well as release our pre-trained models which can be found at

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a method to modify traditional convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) into interpretable CNNs, in order to clarify knowledge
representations in high conv-layers of CNNs. In an interpretable CNN, each
filter in a high conv-layer represents a certain object part. We do not need
any annotations of object parts or textures to supervise the learning process.
Instead, the interpretable CNN automatically assigns each filter in a high
conv-layer with an object part during the learning process. Our method can be
applied to different types of CNNs with different structures. The clear
knowledge representation in an interpretable CNN can help people understand the
logics inside a CNN, i.e., based on which patterns the CNN makes the decision.
Experiments showed that filters in an interpretable CNN were more semantically
meaningful than those in traditional CNNs.

 <dc:description>  Identifying nominals with no head match is a long-standing challenge in
coreference resolution with current systems performing significantly worse than
humans. In this paper we present a new neural network architecture which
outperforms the current state-of-the-art system on the English portion of the
CoNLL 2012 Shared Task. This is done by using a logistic regression on features
produced by two submodels, one of which is has the architecture proposed in
[CM16a] while the other combines domain specific embeddings of the antecedent
and the mention. We also propose some simple additional features which seem to
improve performance for all models substantially, increasing F1 by almost 4% on
basic logistic regression and other complex models.

 <dc:description>  While neural networks demonstrate stronger capabilities in pattern
recognition nowadays, they are also becoming larger and deeper. As a result,
the effort needed to train a network also increases dramatically. In many
cases, it is more practical to use a neural network intellectual property (IP)
that an IP vendor has already trained. As we do not know about the training
process, there can be security threats in the neural IP: the IP vendor
(attacker) may embed hidden malicious functionality, i.e. neural Trojans, into
the neural IP. We show that this is an effective attack and provide three
mitigation techniques: input anomaly detection, re-training, and input
preprocessing. All the techniques are proven effective. The input anomaly
detection approach is able to detect 99.8% of Trojan triggers although with
12.2% false positive. The re-training approach is able to prevent 94.1% of
Trojan triggers from triggering the Trojan although it requires that the neural
IP be reconfigurable. In the input preprocessing approach, 90.2% of Trojan
triggers are rendered ineffective and no assumption about the neural IP is
needed.

 <dc:description>  Techniques exploiting the sparsity of images in a transform domain have been
effective for various applications in image and video processing. Transform
learning methods involve cheap computations and have been demonstrated to
perform well in applications such as image denoising and medical image
reconstruction. Recently, we proposed methods for online learning of
sparsifying transforms from streaming signals, which enjoy good convergence
guarantees, and involve lower computational costs than online synthesis
dictionary learning. In this work, we apply online transform learning to video
denoising. We present a novel framework for online video denoising based on
high-dimensional sparsifying transform learning for spatio-temporal patches.
The patches are constructed either from corresponding 2D patches in successive
frames or using an online block matching technique. The proposed online video
denoising requires little memory, and offers efficient processing. Numerical
experiments compare the performance to the proposed video denoising scheme but
fixing the transform to be 3D DCT, as well as prior schemes such as dictionary
learning-based schemes, and the state-of-the-art VBM3D and VBM4D on several
video data sets, demonstrating the promising performance of the proposed
methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies optimal matroid partitioning problems for various
objective functions. In the problem, we are given a finite set $E$ and $k$
weighted matroids $(E, \mathcal{I}_i, w_i)$, $i = 1, \dots, k$, and our task is
to find a minimum partition $(I_1,\dots,I_k)$ of $E$ such that $I_i \in
\mathcal{I}_i$ for all $i$. For each objective function, we give a
polynomial-time algorithm or prove NP-hardness. In particular, for the case
when the given weighted matroids are identical and the objective function is
the sum of the maximum weight in each set (i.e., $\sum_{i=1}^k\max_{e\in
I_i}w_i(e)$), we show that the problem is strongly NP-hard but admits a PTAS.

 <dc:description>  One of key technologies for future large-scale location-aware services in
access is a scalable indoor localization technique. In this paper, we report
preliminary results from our investigation on the use of deep neural networks
(DNNs) for hierarchical building/floor classification and floor-level location
estimation based on Wi-Fi fingerprinting, which we carried out as part of a
feasibility study project on Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU) Campus
Information and Visitor Service System. To take into account the hierarchical
nature of the building/floor classification problem, we propose a new DNN
architecture based on a stacked autoencoder for the reduction of feature space
dimension and a feed-forward classifier for multi-label classification with
argmax functions to convert multi-label classification results into multi-class
classification ones. We also describe the demonstration of a prototype
DNN-based indoor localization system for floor-level location estimation using
real received signal strength (RSS) data collected at one of the buildings on
the XJTLU campus. The preliminary results for both building/floor
classification and floor-level location estimation clearly show the strengths
of DNN-based approaches, which can provide near state-of-the-art performance
with less parameter tuning and higher scalability.

 <dc:description>  Relatives and friends of an end-stage renal disease patient who offer to
donate a kidney are often found to be incompatible with their intended
recipients. Kidney paired donation matches one patient and his incompatible
donor with another patient and donor in the same situation for an organ
exchange. Let patient- donor pairs be the vertices of an undirected graph G,
with an edge connecting any two reciprocally compatible vertices. A matching in
G is a feasible set of paired donations. We describe various optimization
problems on kidney paired donation graphs G and the merits of each in clinical
transplantation. Because some matches are geographically undesirable, and the
expected lifespan of a transplanted kidney depends on the immunologic
concordance of donor and recipient, we weight the edges of G and seek a maximum
edge-weight matching. Unfortunately, such matchings might not have the maximum
cardinality; there is a risk of an unpredictable trade-off between the quality
and quantity of paired donations. We propose an edge-weighting of G which
guarantees that every matching with maximum weight also has maximum
cardinality, and also maximizes the number of transplants for an exceptional
subset of recipients, while reducing travel and favoring immunologic
concordance.

 <dc:title>Online unit covering in $L_2$</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghosh, Anirban</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a set of points $P$ in $L_2$, the classic Unit Covering (UC) problem
asks to compute the minimum number of unit disks (possibly intersecting)
required to cover the points in $P$, along with a placement of the disks. In
this paper, we study an online version of UC in $L_2$, which we call as Online
Unit Covering (OUC) in $L_2$, or, simply Online Unit Covering (OUC). In OUC,
the points arrive online sequentially. Once a point $p$ arrives, a decision
needs to be taken - either assign $p$ to a previously placed disk (if possible)
or place a new disk to cover $p$ since none of the previously placed disks can
cover $p$. In this setup, once a disk is placed, its placement cannot be
altered in future. We show that competitive ratio of an optimal deterministic
online algorithm for OUC is at least $3$ and at most $5$.

 <dc:title>GP-GAN: Gender Preserving GAN for Synthesizing Faces from Landmarks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Facial landmarks constitute the most compressed representation of faces and
are known to preserve information such as pose, gender and facial structure
present in the faces. Several works exist that attempt to perform high-level
face-related analysis tasks based on landmarks. In contrast, in this work, an
attempt is made to tackle the inverse problem of synthesizing faces from their
respective landmarks. The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate that
information preserved by landmarks (gender in particular) can be further
accentuated by leveraging generative models to synthesize corresponding faces.
Though the problem is particularly challenging due to its ill-posed nature, we
believe that successful synthesis will enable several applications such as
boosting performance of high-level face related tasks using landmark points and
performing dataset augmentation. To this end, a novel face-synthesis method
known as Gender Preserving Generative Adversarial Network (GP-GAN) that is
guided by adversarial loss, perceptual loss and a gender preserving loss is
presented. Further, we propose a novel generator sub-network UDeNet for GP-GAN
that leverages advantages of U-Net and DenseNet architectures. Extensive
experiments and comparison with recent methods are performed to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Robotic manipulation and grasping in cluttered and unstructured environments
is a current challenge for robotics. Enabling robots to operate in these
challenging environments have direct applications from automating warehouses to
harvesting fruit in agriculture. One of the main challenges associated with
these difficult robotic manipulation tasks is the motion planning and control
problem for multi-DoF (Degree of Freedom) manipulators. This paper presents the
design and performance evaluation of a novel low cost Cartesian manipulator,
Cartman who took first place in the Amazon Robotics Challenge 2017. It can
perform pick and place tasks of household items in a cluttered environment. The
robot is capable of linear speeds of 1 m/s and angular speeds of 1.5 rad/s,
capable of sub-millimeter static accuracy and safe payload capacity of 2kg.
Cartman can be produced for under 10 000 AUD. The complete design will be open
sourced and will be available at the time of ICRA 2018.

 <dc:description>  It is well accepted that convolutional neural networks play an important role
in learning excellent features for image classification and recognition.
However, in tradition they only allow adjacent layers connected, limiting
integration of multi-scale information. To further improve their performance,
we present a concatenating framework of shortcut convolutional neural networks.
This framework can concatenate multi-scale features by shortcut connections to
the fully-connected layer that is directly fed to the output layer. We do a
large number of experiments to investigate performance of the shortcut
convolutional neural networks on many benchmark visual datasets for different
tasks. The datasets include AR, FERET, FaceScrub, CelebA for gender
classification, CUReT for texture classification, MNIST for digit recognition,
and CIFAR-10 for object recognition. Experimental results show that the
shortcut convolutional neural networks can achieve better results than the
traditional ones on these tasks, with more stability in different settings of
pooling schemes, activation functions, optimizations, initializations, kernel
numbers and kernel sizes.

 <dc:description>  Automatic feature learning algorithms are at the forefront of modern day
machine learning research. We present a novel algorithm, supervised Q-walk,
which applies Q-learning to generate random walks on graphs such that the walks
prove to be useful for learning node features suitable for tackling with the
node classification problem. We present another novel algorithm, k-hops
neighborhood based confidence values learner, which learns confidence values of
labels for unlabelled nodes in the network without first learning the node
embedding. These confidence values aid in learning an apt reward function for
Q-learning.
  We demonstrate the efficacy of supervised Q-walk approach over existing
state-of-the-art random walk based node embedding learners in solving the
single / multi-label multi-class node classification problem using several real
world datasets.
  Summarising, our approach represents a novel state-of-the-art technique to
learn features, for nodes in networks, tailor-made for dealing with the node

 <dc:description>  In mobile millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, energy is a scarce resource due
to the large losses in the channel and high energy usage by analog-to-digital
converters (ADC), which scales with bandwidth. In this paper, we consider a
communication architecture that integrates the sub-6 GHz and mmWave
technologies in 5G cellular systems. In order to mitigate the energy scarcity
in mmWave systems, we investigate the rate-optimal and energy-efficient
physical layer resource allocation jointly across the sub-6 GHz and mmWave
interfaces. First, we formulate an optimization problem in which the objective
is to maximize the achievable sum rate under power constraints at the
transmitter and receiver. Our formulation explicitly takes into account the
energy consumption in integrated-circuit components, and assigns the optimal
power and bandwidth across the interfaces. We consider the settings with no
channel state information and partial channel state information at the
transmitter and under high and low SNR scenarios. Second, we investigate the
energy efficiency (EE) defined as the ratio between the amount of data
transmitted and the corresponding incurred cost in terms of power. We use
fractional programming and Dinkelbach's algorithm to solve the EE optimization
problem. Our results prove that despite the availability of huge bandwidths at
the mmWave interface, it may be optimal (in terms of achievable sum rate and
energy efficiency) to utilize it partially. Moreover, depending on the sub-6
GHz and mmWave channel conditions and total power budget, it may be optimal to
activate only one of the interfaces.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification is the task of recognizing or identifying a person
across multiple views in multi-camera networks. Although there has been much
progress in person re-identification, person re-identification in large-scale
multi-camera networks still remains a challenging task because of the large
spatio-temporal uncertainty and high complexity due to a large number of
cameras and people. To handle these difficulties, additional information such
as camera network topology should be provided, which is also difficult to
automatically estimate, unfortunately. In this study, we propose a unified
framework which jointly solves both person re-identification and camera network
topology inference problems with minimal prior knowledge about the
environments. The proposed framework takes general multi-camera network
environments into account and can be applied to online person re-identification
in large-scale multi-camera networks. In addition, to effectively show the
superiority of the proposed framework, we provide a new person
re-identification dataset with full annotations, named SLP, captured in the
multi-camera network consisting of nine non-overlapping cameras. Experimental
results using our person re-identification and public datasets show that the
proposed methods are promising for both person re-identification and camera
topology inference tasks.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge of users' emotion states helps improve human-computer interaction.
In this work, we presented EmoNet, an emotion detector of Chinese daily
dialogues based on deep convolutional neural networks. In order to maintain the
original linguistic features, such as the order, commonly used methods like
segmentation and keywords extraction were not adopted, instead we increased the
depth of CNN and tried to let CNN learn inner linguistic relationships. Our
main contribution is that we presented a new model and a new pipeline which can
be used in multi-language environment to solve sentimental problems.
Experimental results shows EmoNet has a great capacity in learning the emotion
of dialogues and achieves a better result than other state of art detectors do.

 <dc:description>  Non-linear dimensionality reduction (NDR) methods such as LLE and t-SNE are
popular with visualization researchers and experienced data analysts, but
present serious problems of interpretation. In this paper, we present
DimReader, a technique that recovers readable axes from such techniques.
DimReader is based on analyzing infinitesimal perturbations of the dataset with
respect to variables of interest. The recovered axes are in direct analogy with
positional legends of traditional scatterplots, and show how to solve the
computational challenges presented by the generalization to non-linear methods.
We show how automatic differentiation makes the calculation of such
perturbations efficient and can easily be integrated into programs written in
modern programming languages. We present results of DimReader on a variety of
NDR methods and datasets both synthetic and real-life, and show how it can be
used to compare different NDR methods and hyperparameter choices. Finally, we
discuss limitations of our proposal and situations where further research is

 <dc:title>Equilibrium Computation and Robust Optimization in Zero Sum Games with
  Submodular Structure</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wilder, Bryan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We define a class of zero-sum games with combinatorial structure, where the
best response problem of one player is to maximize a submodular function. For
example, this class includes security games played on networks, as well as the
problem of robustly optimizing a submodular function over the worst case from a
set of scenarios. The challenge in computing equilibria is that both players'
strategy spaces can be exponentially large. Accordingly, previous algorithms
have worst-case exponential runtime and indeed fail to scale up on practical
instances. We provide a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm which obtains a
guaranteed $(1 - 1/e)^2$-approximate mixed strategy for the maximizing player.
Our algorithm only requires access to a weakened version of a best response
oracle for the minimizing player which runs in polynomial time. Experimental
results for network security games and a robust budget allocation problem
confirm that our algorithm delivers near-optimal solutions and scales to much
larger instances than was previously possible.

 <dc:description>  Despite the number of NLP studies dedicated to thematic fit estimation,
little attention has been paid to the related task of composing and updating
verb argument expectations. The few exceptions have mostly modeled this
phenomenon with structured distributional models, implicitly assuming a
similarly structured representation of events. Recent experimental evidence,
however, suggests that human processing system could also exploit an
unstructured &quot;bag-of-arguments&quot; type of event representation to predict
upcoming input. In this paper, we re-implement a traditional structured model
and adapt it to compare the different hypotheses concerning the degree of
structure in our event knowledge, evaluating their relative performance in the
task of the argument expectations update.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In IEEE 802.11 networks, selfish stations can pursue a better quality of
service (QoS) through selfish MAC-layer attacks. Such attacks are easy to
perform, secure routing protocols do not prevent them, and their detection may
be complex. Two-hop relay topologies allow a new angle of attack: a selfish
relay can tamper with either source traffic, transit traffic, or both. We
consider the applicability of selfish attacks and their variants in the two-hop
relay topology, quantify their impact, and study defense measures.

 <dc:description>  Training feedforward neural networks with standard logistic activations is
considered difficult because of the intrinsic properties of these sigmoidal
functions. This work aims at showing that these networks can be trained to
achieve generalization performance comparable to those based on hyperbolic
tangent activations. The solution consists on applying a set of conditions in
parameter initialization, which have been derived from the study of the
properties of a single neuron from an information-theoretic perspective. The
proposed initialization is validated through an extensive experimental
analysis.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose spatial propagation networks for learning the
affinity matrix for vision tasks. We show that by constructing a row/column
linear propagation model, the spatially varying transformation matrix exactly
constitutes an affinity matrix that models dense, global pairwise relationships
of an image. Specifically, we develop a three-way connection for the linear
propagation model, which (a) formulates a sparse transformation matrix, where
all elements can be the output from a deep CNN, but (b) results in a dense
affinity matrix that effectively models any task-specific pairwise similarity
matrix. Instead of designing the similarity kernels according to image features
of two points, we can directly output all the similarities in a purely
data-driven manner. The spatial propagation network is a generic framework that
can be applied to many affinity-related tasks, including but not limited to
image matting, segmentation and colorization, to name a few. Essentially, the
model can learn semantically-aware affinity values for high-level vision tasks
due to the powerful learning capability of the deep neural network classifier.
We validate the framework on the task of refinement for image segmentation
boundaries. Experiments on the HELEN face parsing and PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic
segmentation tasks show that the spatial propagation network provides a
general, effective and efficient solution for generating high-quality
segmentation results.

 <dc:title>MMCR4NLP: Multilingual Multiway Corpora Repository for Natural Language

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multilinguality is gradually becoming ubiquitous in the sense that more and
more researchers have successfully shown that using additional languages help
improve the results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. Multilingual
Multiway Corpora (MMC) contain the same sentence in multiple languages. Such
corpora have been primarily used for Multi-Source and Pivot Language Machine
Translation but are also useful for developing multilingual sequence taggers by
transfer learning. While these corpora are available, they are not organized
for multilingual experiments and researchers need to write boilerplate code
every time they want to use said corpora. Moreover, because there is no
official MMC collection it becomes difficult to compare against existing
approaches. As such we present our work on creating a unified and
systematically organized repository of MMC spanning a large number of
languages. We also provide training, development and test splits for corpora
where official splits are unavailable. We hope that this will help speed up the
pace of multilingual NLP research and ensure that NLP researchers obtain
results that are more trustable since they can be compared easily. We indicate
corpora sources, extraction procedures if any and relevant statistics. We also
make our collection public for research purposes.

 <dc:description>  As today's organizational computer networks are ever evolving and becoming
more and more complex, finding potential vulnerabilities and conducting
security audits has become a crucial element in securing these networks. The
first step in auditing a network is reconnaissance by mapping it to get a
comprehensive overview over its structure. The growing complexity, however,
makes this task increasingly effortful, even more as mapping (instead of plain
scanning), presently, still involves a lot of manual work. Therefore, the
concept proposed in this paper automates the scanning and mapping of unknown
and non-cooperative computer networks in order to find security weaknesses or
verify access controls. It further helps to conduct audits by allowing
comparing documented with actual networks and finding unauthorized network
devices, as well as evaluating access control methods by conducting delta
scans. It uses a novel approach of augmenting data from iteratively chained
existing scanning tools with context, using genuine analytics modules to allow
assessing a network's topology instead of just generating a list of scanned
devices. It further contains a visualization model that provides a clear, lucid
topology map and a special graph for comparative analysis. The goal is to
provide maximum insight with a minimum of a priori knowledge.

 <dc:title>Achieving Phase-based Logic Bit Storage in Mechanical Metronomes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wang, Tianshi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, oscillator-based Boolean computation has been proposed for its
potentials in noise immunity and energy efficiency. In such a system, logic
bits are encoded in the relative phases of oscillating signals and stored in
injection-locked oscillators. To show that the scheme is very general and not
specific to electronic oscillators, in this paper, we report our work on
storing a phase-based logic bit in the relative phase between two mechanical
metronomes. While the synchronization of metronomes is a classic example
showing the effects of injection locking, our work takes it one step further by
demonstrating the bistable phase in sub-harmonically injection-locked
metronomes --- a key mechanism for oscillator-based Boolean computation.
Although we do not expect to make computers with metronomes, our study
demonstrates the generality of this new computation paradigm and may inspire
its practical implementations in various fields, eg, MEMS, silicon photonics,
spintronics, synthetic biology, etc.

 <dc:description>  Visual-only speech recognition is dependent upon a number of factors that can
be difficult to control, such as: lighting; identity; motion; emotion and
expression. But some factors, such as video resolution are controllable, so it
is surprising that there is not yet a systematic study of the effect of
resolution on lip-reading. Here we use a new data set, the Rosetta Raven data,
to train and test recognizers so we can measure the affect of video resolution
on recognition accuracy. We conclude that, contrary to common practice,
resolution need not be that great for automatic lip-reading. However it is
highly unlikely that automatic lip-reading can work reliably when the distance
between the bottom of the lower lip and the top of the upper lip is less than
four pixels at rest.

 <dc:description>  The collection of time series data increases as more monitoring and
automation are being deployed. These deployments range in scale from an
Internet of things (IoT) device located in a household to enormous distributed
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) producing large volumes of data at high velocity.
To store and analyze these vast amounts of data, specialized Time Series
Management Systems (TSMSs) have been developed to overcome the limitations of
general purpose Database Management Systems (DBMSs) for times series
management. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis and classification of
TSMSs developed through academic or industrial research and documented through
publications. Our classification is organized into categories based on the
architectures observed during our analysis. In addition, we provide an overview
of each system with a focus on the motivational use case that drove the
development of the system, the functionality for storage and querying of time
series a system implements, the components the system is composed of, and the
capabilities of each system with regard to Stream Processing and Approximate
Query Processing (AQP). Last, we provide a summary of research directions
proposed by other researchers in the field and present our vision for a next
generation TSMS.

 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require very large amounts of computation both
for training and for inference when deployed in the field. Many different
algorithms have been proposed to implement the most computationally expensive
layers of DNNs. Further, each of these algorithms has a large number of
variants, which offer different trade-offs of parallelism, data locality,
memory footprint, and execution time. In addition, specific algorithms operate
much more efficiently on specialized data layouts and formats.
  We state the problem of optimal primitive selection in the presence of data
format transformations, and show that it is NP-hard by demonstrating an
embedding in the Partitioned Boolean Quadratic Assignment problem (PBQP).
  We propose an analytic solution via a PBQP solver, and evaluate our approach
experimentally by optimizing several popular DNNs using a library of more than
70 DNN primitives, on an embedded platform and a general purpose platform. We
show experimentally that significant gains are possible versus the state of the
art vendor libraries by using a principled analytic solution to the problem of
layout selection in the presence of data format transformations.

 <dc:description>  In the quest for greater computer lip-reading performance there are a number
of tacit assumptions which are either present in the datasets (high resolution
for example) or in the methods (recognition of spoken visual units called
visemes for example). Here we review these and other assumptions and show the
surprising result that computer lip-reading is not heavily constrained by video
resolution, pose, lighting and other practical factors. However, the working
assumption that visemes, which are the visual equivalent of phonemes, are the
best unit for recognition does need further examination. We conclude that
visemes, which were defined over a century ago, are unlikely to be optimal for
a modern computer lip-reading system.

 <dc:description>  A critical assumption of all current visual speech recognition systems is
that there are visual speech units called visemes which can be mapped to units
of acoustic speech, the phonemes. Despite there being a number of published
maps it is infrequent to see the effectiveness of these tested, particularly on
visual-only lip-reading (many works use audio-visual speech). Here we examine
120 mappings and consider if any are stable across talkers. We show a method
for devising maps based on phoneme confusions from an automated lip-reading
system, and we present new mappings that show improvements for individual
talkers.

 <dc:title>Towards an Inferential Lexicon of Event Selecting Predicates for French</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Falk, Ingrid</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Martin, Fabienne</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a manually constructed seed lexicon encoding the inferential
profiles of French event selecting predicates across different uses. The
inferential profile (Karttunen, 1971a) of a verb is designed to capture the
inferences triggered by the use of this verb in context. It reflects the
influence of the clause-embedding verb on the factuality of the event described
by the embedded clause. The resource developed provides evidence for the
following three hypotheses: (i) French implicative verbs have an aspect
dependent profile (their inferential profile varies with outer aspect), while
factive verbs have an aspect independent profile (they keep the same
inferential profile with both imperfective and perfective aspect); (ii)
implicativity decreases with imperfective aspect: the inferences triggered by
French implicative verbs combined with perfective aspect are often weakened
when the same verbs are combined with imperfective aspect; (iii) implicativity
decreases with an animate (deep) subject: the inferences triggered by a verb
which is implicative with an inanimate subject are weakened when the same verb
is used with an animate subject. The resource additionally shows that verbs
with different inferential profiles display clearly distinct sub-categorisation
patterns. In particular, verbs that have both factive and implicative readings
are shown to prefer infinitival clauses in their implicative reading, and
tensed clauses in their factive reading.

 <dc:title>Isotropic and Steerable Wavelets in N Dimensions. A multiresolution
  analysis framework for ITK</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hernandez-Cerdan, Pablo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This document describes the implementation of the external module
ITKIsotropicWavelets, a multiresolution (MRA) analysis framework using
isotropic and steerable wavelets in the frequency domain. This framework
provides the backbone for state of the art filters for denoising, feature
detection or phase analysis in N-dimensions. It focus on reusability, and
highly decoupled modules for easy extension and implementation of new filters,
and it contains a filter for multiresolution phase analysis,
  The backbone of the multi-scale analysis is provided by an isotropic
band-limited wavelet pyramid, and the detection of directional features is
provided by coupling the pyramid with a generalized Riesz transform. The
generalized Riesz transform of order N behaves like a smoothed version of the
Nth order derivatives of the signal. Also, it is steerable: its components
impulse responses can be rotated to any spatial orientation, reducing
computation time when detecting directional features.

 <dc:title>A Bernoulli-Gaussian Physical Watermark for Detecting Integrity Attacks

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We examine the merit of Bernoulli packet drops in actively detecting
integrity attacks on control systems. The aim is to detect an adversary who
delivers fake sensor measurements to a system operator in order to conceal
their effect on the plant. Physical watermarks, or noisy additive Gaussian
inputs, have been previously used to detect several classes of integrity
attacks in control systems. In this paper, we consider the analysis and design
of Gaussian physical watermarks in the presence of packet drops at the control
input. On one hand, this enables analysis in a more general network setting. On
the other hand, we observe that in certain cases, Bernoulli packet drops can
improve detection performance relative to a purely Gaussian watermark. This
motivates the joint design of a Bernoulli-Gaussian watermark which incorporates
both an additive Gaussian input and a Bernoulli drop process. We characterize
the effect of such a watermark on system performance as well as attack
detectability in two separate design scenarios. Here, we consider a correlation
detector for attack recognition. We then propose efficiently solvable
optimization problems to intelligently select parameters of the Gaussian input
and the Bernoulli drop process while addressing security and performance
trade-offs. Finally, we provide numerical results which illustrate that a
watermark with packet drops can indeed outperform a Gaussian watermark.

 <dc:title>Relocation in Car Sharing Systems with Shared Stackable Vehicles:
  Modelling Challenges and Outlook</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Car sharing is expected to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in cities
while at the same time improving accessibility to public transport. However,
the most popular form of car sharing, one-way car sharing, still suffers from
the vehicle unbalance problem. Innovative solutions to this issue rely on
custom vehicles with stackable capabilities: customers or operators can drive a
train of vehicles if necessary, thus efficiently bringing several cars from an
area with few requests to an area with many requests. However, how to model a
car sharing system with stackable vehicles is an open problem in the related
literature. In this paper, we propose a queueing theoretical model to fill this
gap, and we use this model to derive an upper-bound on user-based relocation
capabilities. We also validate, for the first time in the related literature,
legacy queueing theoretical models against a trace of real car sharing data.
Finally, we present preliminary results about the impact, on car availability,
of simple user-based relocation heuristics with stackable vehicles. Our results
indicate that user-based relocation schemes that exploit vehicle stackability
can significantly improve car availability at stations.

 <dc:description>  Myocardial Infarction is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This
paper presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture which takes
raw Electrocardiography (ECG) signal from lead II, III and AVF and
differentiates between inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and healthy
signals. The performance of the model is evaluated on IMI and healthy signals
obtained from Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) database. A
subject-oriented approach is taken to comprehend the generalization capability
of the model and compared with the current state of the art. In a
subject-oriented approach, the network is tested on one patient and trained on
rest of the patients. Our model achieved a superior metrics scores (accuracy=
84.54%, sensitivity= 85.33% and specificity= 84.09%) when compared to the
benchmark. We also analyzed the discriminating strength of the features
extracted by the convolutional layers by means of geometric separability index
and euclidean distance and compared it with the benchmark model.

 <dc:title>A control mechanism for intramural periarterial drainage via astrocytes:
  How neuronal activity could improve waste clearance from the brain</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The mechanisms behind waste clearance from deep within the parenchyma of the
brain remain unclear to this date. Experimental evidence has shown that one
pathway for waste clearance, termed intramural periarterial drainage (IPAD), is
the rapid drainage of interstitial fluid (ISF) via basement membranes (BM) of
the smooth muscle cells (SMC) of cerebral arteries and its failure is closely
associated with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously
shown that arterial pulsations from the heart beat are not strong enough to
drive waste clearance. Here we demonstrate computational evidence for a
mechanism for cerebral waste clearance that is driven by functional hyperaemia,
that is, the dilation of cerebral arteries as a consequence of increased
neuronal demand. This mechanism is based on our model for fluid flow through
the vascular basement membrane. It accounts for waste clearance rates observed
in mouse experiments and aligns with pathological observations as well as
recommendations to lower the individual risk of AD, such as keeping mentally
and physically active.

 <dc:description>  In machine lip-reading, which is identification of speech from visual-only
information, there is evidence to show that visual speech is highly dependent
upon the speaker [1]. Here, we use a phoneme-clustering method to form new
phoneme-to-viseme maps for both individual and multiple speakers. We use these
maps to examine how similarly speakers talk visually. We conclude that broadly
speaking, speakers have the same repertoire of mouth gestures, where they
differ is in the use of the gestures.

 <dc:title>Latency Aware Drone Base Station Placement in Heterogeneous Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Different from traditional static small cells, Drone Base Stations (DBSs)
exhibit their own advantages, i.e., faster and cheaper to deploy, more flexibly
reconfigured, and likely to have better communications channels owing to the
presence of short-range line-of-sight links. Thus, applying DBSs into the
cellular network has great potential to increase the throughput of the network
and improve Quality of Service (QoS) of Mobile Users (MUs). In this paper, we
focus on how to place the DBS (i.e., jointly determining the location and the
association coverage of a DBS) in order to improve the QoS in terms of
minimizing the total average latency ratio of MUs by considering the energy
capacity limitation of the DBS. We formulate the DBS placement problem as an
optimization problem and design a Latency aware dronE bAse station Placement
(LEAP) algorithm to solve it efficiently. The performance of LEAP is
demonstrated via simulations as compared to other two baseline methods.

 <dc:description>  A heightened interest in the presence of the past has given rise to the new
field of memory studies, but there is a lack of search and research tools to
support studying how and why the past is evoked in diachronic discourses.
Searching for temporal references is not straightforward. It entails bridging
the gap between conceptually-based information needs on one side, and
term-based inverted indexes on the other.
  Our approach enables the search for references to (intersubjective)
historical periods in diachronic corpora. It consists of a
semantically-enhanced search engine that is able to find references to many
entities at a time, which is combined with a novel interface that invites its
user to actively sculpt the search result set. Until now we have been concerned
mostly with user-friendly retrieval and selection of sources, but our tool can
also contribute to existing efforts to create reusable linked data from and for
research in the humanities.

 <dc:description>  A parallel numerical simulation algorithm is presented for fractional-order
systems involving Caputo-type derivatives, based on the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
(ABM) predictor-corrector scheme. The parallel algorithm is implemented using
several different approaches: a pure MPI version, a combination of MPI with
OpenMP optimization and a memory saving speedup approach. All tests run on a
BlueGene/P cluster, and comparative improvement results for the running time
are provided. As an applied experiment, the solutions of a fractional-order
version of a system describing a forced series LCR circuit are numerically
computed, depicting cascades of period-doubling bifurcations which lead to the
onset of chaotic behavior.

 <dc:description>  Modern neuroimaging techniques provide us with unique views on brain
structure and function; i.e., how the brain is wired, and where and when
activity takes place. These large datasets contain increasingly rich
information that can be analyzed in terms of network structure to reveal
organizing principles at the systems level. Graph representations are versatile
models where nodes are associated to brain regions and edges to structural or
functional connections. Structural graphs model neural pathways in white matter
that are the anatomical backbone between regions. Functional graphs are built
based on functional connectivity, which is a pairwise measure of statistical
interdependency between activity traces of regions. Therefore, most research to
date has focussed on analyzing these graphs reflecting structure or function.
  Graph signal processing (GSP) is an emerging research theme where signals
recorded at the nodes of the graph are analyzed taking into account the
underlying graph structure. An increasing number of fundamental operations has
been generalized to the graph setting, allowing to analyze the signals from a
new viewpoint. Here, we introduce GSP for functional brain imaging and
demonstrate its potential to integrate brain structure, contained in the graph
itself, with brain function, residing in the graph signals. We show how brain
activity can be meaningfully filtered based on concepts of spectral modes
derived from brain structure. We also derive other operations such as surrogate
data generation or decompositions informed by cognitive systems. In sum, GSP
puts up a novel framework for the analysis of brain imaging data.

 <dc:description>Comment: We realized that there are some issues we have to resolve with our
  dataset, which may greatly affect how results are presented. We are worried
  that the current presentation may have incorrect results and discussion. We
  are working on to resolve this issue, but it may take some time. In the same
  time, it would be much appreciated if we could withdraw this paper as soon as
  possible. Thanks a lot!</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  Program obfuscation is a widely employed approach for software intellectual
property protection. However, general obfuscation methods (e.g., lexical
obfuscation, control obfuscation) implemented in mainstream obfuscation tools
are heuristic and have little security guarantee. Recently in 2013, Garg et al.
have achieved a breakthrough in secure program obfuscation with a graded
encoding mechanism and they have shown that it can fulfill a compelling
security property, i.e., indistinguishability. Nevertheless, the mechanism
incurs too much overhead for practical usage. Besides, it focuses on
obfuscating computation models (e.g., circuits) rather than real codes. In this
paper, we aim to explore secure and usable obfuscation approaches from the
literature. Our main finding is that currently we still have no such approaches
made secure and usable. The main reason is we do not have adequate evaluation
metrics concerning both security and performance. On one hand, existing
code-oriented obfuscation approaches generally evaluate the increased obscurity
rather than security guarantee. On the other hand, the performance requirement
for model-oriented obfuscation approaches is too weak to develop practical
program obfuscation solutions.

 <dc:description>  In machine lip-reading there is continued debate and research around the
correct classes to be used for recognition. In this paper we use a structured
approach for devising speaker-dependent viseme classes, which enables the
creation of a set of phoneme-to-viseme maps where each has a different quantity
of visemes ranging from two to 45. Viseme classes are based upon the mapping of
articulated phonemes, which have been confused during phoneme recognition, into
viseme groups. Using these maps, with the LiLIR dataset, we show the effect of
changing the viseme map size in speaker-dependent machine lip-reading, measured
by word recognition correctness and so demonstrate that word recognition with
phoneme classifiers is not just possible, but often better than word
recognition with viseme classifiers. Furthermore, there are intermediate units
between visemes and phonemes which are better still.

 <dc:description>  Closeness is a widely-studied centrality measure. Since it requires all
pairwise distances, computing closeness for all nodes is infeasible for large
real-world networks. However, for many applications, it is only necessary to
find the k most central nodes and not all closeness values. Prior work has
shown that computing the top-k nodes with highest closeness can be done much
faster than computing closeness for all nodes in real-world networks. However,
for networks that evolve over time, no dynamic top-k closeness algorithm exists
that improves on static recomputation. In this paper, we present several
techniques that allow us to efficiently compute the k nodes with highest
(harmonic) closeness after an edge insertion or an edge deletion. Our
algorithms use information obtained during earlier computations to omit
unnecessary work. However, they do not require asymptotically more memory than
the static algorithms (i. e., linear in the number of nodes). We propose
separate algorithms for complex networks (which exhibit the small-world
property) and networks with large diameter such as street networks, and we
compare them against static recomputation on a variety of real-world networks.
On many instances, our dynamic algorithms are two orders of magnitude faster
than recomputation; on some large graphs, we even reach average speedups
between $10^3$ and $10^4$.

 <dc:description>  Closeness is a widely-used centrality measure in social network analysis. For
a node it indicates the inverse average shortest-path distance to the other
nodes of the network. While the identification of the k nodes with highest
closeness received significant attention, many applications are actually
interested in finding a group of nodes that is central as a whole. For this
problem, only recently a greedy algorithm with approximation ratio (1-1/e) has
been proposed [Chen et al., ADC 2016]. Since this algorithm's running time is
still expensive for large networks, a heuristic without approximation guarantee
has also been proposed in the same paper. In the present paper we develop new
techniques to speed up the greedy algorithm without losing its theoretical
guarantee. Compared to a straightforward implementation, our approach is orders
of magnitude faster and, compared to the heuristic proposed by Chen et al., we
always find a solution with better quality in a comparable running time in our
experiments. Our method Greedy++ allows us to approximate the group with
maximum closeness on networks with up to hundreds of millions of edges in
minutes or at most a few hours. To have the same theoretical guarantee, the
greedy approach by [Chen et al., ADC 2016] would take several days already on
networks with hundreds of thousands of edges. In a comparison with the optimum,
our experiments show that the solution found by Greedy++ is actually much
better than the theoretical guarantee. Over all tested networks, the empirical
approximation ratio is never lower than 0.97. Finally, we study for the first
time the correlation between the top-k nodes with highest individual closeness
and an approximation of the most central group in large networks. Our results
show that the overlap between the two is relatively small, which indicates
empirically the need to distinguish between the two problems.

 <dc:description>  This year, the Agile Manifesto completes seventeen years and, throughout the
world, companies and researchers seek to understand their adoption stage, as
well as the benefits, barriers, and limitations of agile methods. Although we
have some studies and questionnaire data at the global level, we know little
about how the Paraguayan software community is adopting agile methods. The
present work conducted a research to set up the current stage of adoption,
initial concerns and barriers of implementation of agile methods in software
development companies in Paraguay. An online survey was sent to representatives
of 53 Paraguayan companies. Of these, 9 (17%) companies responded. The concern
about adopting more agile methods (44.44% of respondents) was the lack of
reliability in product quality if developed using agile methods. The main
barrier was the lack of experience (66.66%) of the companies.

 <dc:title>Fast Fine-grained Image Classification via Weakly Supervised
  Discriminative Localization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Fine-grained image classification is to recognize hundreds of subcategories
in each basic-level category. Existing methods employ discriminative
localization to find the key distinctions among subcategories. However, they
generally have two limitations: (1) Discriminative localization relies on
region proposal methods to hypothesize the locations of discriminative regions,
which are time-consuming. (2) The training of discriminative localization
depends on object or part annotations, which are heavily labor-consuming. It is
highly challenging to address the two key limitations simultaneously, and
existing methods only focus on one of them. Therefore, we propose a weakly
supervised discriminative localization approach (WSDL) for fast fine-grained
image classification to address the two limitations at the same time, and its
main advantages are: (1) n-pathway end-to-end discriminative localization
network is designed to improve classification speed, which simultaneously
localizes multiple different discriminative regions for one image to boost
classification accuracy, and shares full-image convolutional features generated
by region proposal network to accelerate the process of generating region
proposals as well as reduce the computation of convolutional operation. (2)
Multi-level attention guided localization learning is proposed to localize
discriminative regions with different focuses automatically, without using
object and part annotations, avoiding the labor consumption. Different level
attentions focus on different characteristics of the image, which are
complementary and boost the classification accuracy. Both are jointly employed
to simultaneously improve classification speed and eliminate dependence on
object and part annotations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods on 2
widely-used fine-grained image classification datasets, our WSDL approach
achieves the best performance.

 <dc:description>  To undertake machine lip-reading, we try to recognise speech from a visual
signal. Current work often uses viseme classification supported by language
models with varying degrees of success. A few recent works suggest phoneme
classification, in the right circumstances, can outperform viseme
classification. In this work we present a novel two-pass method of training
phoneme classifiers which uses previously trained visemes in the first pass.
With our new training algorithm, we show classification performance which
significantly improves on previous lip-reading results.

 <dc:description>  Efficient symbol detection algorithms carry critical importance for achieving
the spatial multiplexing gains promised by multi-input multi-output (MIMO)
systems. In this paper, we consider a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP)
based symbol detection algorithm, called M-BLAST, over uncoded quasi-static
MIMO channels. Relying on the successive interference cancellation (SIC)
receiver, M-BLAST algorithm offers a superior error performance over its
predecessor V-BLAST with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain of as large as 2 dB
under various settings of recent interest. Performance analysis of the M-BLAST
algorithm is very complicated since the proposed detection order depends on the
decision errors dynamically, which makes an already complex analysis of the
conventional ordered SIC receivers even more difficult. To this end, a rigorous
analytical framework is proposed to analyze the outage behavior of the M-BLAST
algorithm over binary complex alphabets and two transmitting antennas, which
has a potential to be generalized to multiple transmitting antennas and
multidimensional constellation sets. The numerical results show a very good
match between the analytical and simulation data under various SNR values and
modulation alphabets.

 <dc:title>Secure Private Information Retrieval from Colluding Databases with

 <dc:creator>Wang, Qiwen</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Skoglund, Mikael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of private information retrieval (PIR) is to retrieve one message
out of $K$ messages replicated at $N$ databases, without revealing the identity
of the desired message to the databases. We consider the problem of PIR with
colluding servers and eavesdroppers, named T-EPIR. Specifically, any $T$ out of
$N$ databases may collude, i.e. they may communicate their interactions with
the user to guess the identity of the requested message. An eavesdropper is
curious to know the database and can tap in on the incoming and outgoing
transmissions of any $E$ databases. The databases share some common randomness
unknown to the eavesdropper and the user, and use the common randomness to
generate the answers, such that the eavesdropper can learn no information about
the $K$ messages. Define $R^*$ as the optimal ratio of the number of the
desired message information bits to the number of total downloaded bits, and
$\rho^*$ to be the optimal ratio of the information bits of the shared common
randomness to the information bits of the desired file. In our previous work,
we found that when $E \geq T$, the optimal ratio that can be achieved equals
$1-\frac{E}{N}$. In this work, we focus on the case when $E \leq T$. We derive
an outer bound $R^* \leq (1-\frac{T}{N}) \frac{1-\frac{E}{N} \cdot
(\frac{T}{N})^{K-1}}{1-(\frac{T}{N})^K}$. We also obtain a lower bound of
$\rho^* \geq
\frac{\frac{E}{N}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}{(1-\frac{T}{N})(1-\frac{E}{N} \cdot
(\frac{T}{N})^{K-1})}$. For the achievability, we propose a scheme which
achieves the rate (inner bound)
$R=\frac{1-\frac{T}{N}}{1-(\frac{T}{N})^K}-\frac{E}{KN}$. The amount of shared
common randomness used in the achievable scheme is
$\frac{\frac{E}{N}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}{1-\frac{T}{N}-\frac{E}{KN}(1-(\frac{T}{N})^K)}$
times the file size. The gap between the derived inner and outer bounds
vanishes as the number of messages $K$ tends to infinity.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The secrecy outage performance of wireless communication systems operating
over spatially correlated composite fading channels is analyzed in this paper.
We adopt a multiplicative composite channel model for both the legitimate
communication link and the link between the eavesdropper and the legitimate
transmitter, consisting of Nakagami-$m$ distributed small-scale fading and
shadowing (large-scale fading) modeled by the Gamma distribution. We consider
the realistic case where small-scale fading between the links is independent,
but shadowing is arbitrarily correlated, and present novel analytical
expressions for the probability that the secrecy capacity falls below a target
secrecy rate. The presented numerically evaluated results, verified by
equivalent computer simulations, offer useful insights on the impact of
shadowing correlation and composite fading parameters on the system's secrecy
outage performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new approach to person re-identification using
images and natural language descriptions. We propose a joint vision and
language model based on CCA and CNN architectures to match across the two
modalities as well as to enrich visual examples for which there are no language
descriptions. We also introduce new annotations in the form of natural language
descriptions for two standard Re-ID benchmarks, namely CUHK03 and VIPeR. We
perform experiments on these two datasets with techniques based on CNN,
hand-crafted features as well as LSTM for analysing visual and natural
description data. We investigate and demonstrate the advantages of using
natural language descriptions compared to attributes as well as CNN compared to
LSTM in the context of Re-ID. We show that the joint use of language and vision
can significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on standard Re-ID
benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We consider two-way amplify and forward relaying, where multiple full-duplex
user pairs exchange information via a shared full-duplex massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) relay. We derive closed-form lower bound for the
spectral efficiency with zero-forcing processing at the relay, by using minimum
mean squared error channel estimation. The zero-forcing lower bound for the
system model considered herein, which is valid for arbitrary number of
antennas, is not yet derived in the massive MIMO relaying literature. We
numerically demonstrate the accuracy of the derived lower bound and the
performance improvement achieved using zero-forcing processing. We also
numerically demonstrate the spectral gains achieved by a full-duplex system
over a half-duplex one for various antenna regimes.

 <dc:description>  We propose a computational framework to learn stylisation patterns from
example drawings or writings, and then generate new trajectories that possess
similar stylistic qualities. We particularly focus on the generation and
stylisation of trajectories that are similar to the ones that can be seen in
calligraphy and graffiti art. Our system is able to extract and learn dynamic
and visual qualities from a small number of user defined examples which can be
recorded with a digitiser device, such as a tablet, mouse or motion capture
sensors. Our system is then able to transform new user drawn traces to be
kinematically and stylistically similar to the training examples. We implement
the system using a Recurrent Mixture Density Network (RMDN) combined with a
representation given by the parameters of the Sigma Lognormal model, a
physiologically plausible model of movement that has been shown to closely
reproduce the velocity and trace of human handwriting gestures.

 <dc:title>The Cafe Wall Illusion: Local and Global Perception from multiple scale

 <dc:description>  Geometrical illusions are a subclass of optical illusions in which the
geometrical characteristics of patterns such as orientations and angles are
distorted and misperceived as the result of low- to high-level retinal/cortical
processing. Modelling the detection of tilt in these illusions and their
strengths as they are perceived is a challenging task computationally and leads
to development of techniques that match with human performance. In this study,
we present a predictive and quantitative approach for modeling foveal and
peripheral vision in the induced tilt in Caf\'e Wall illusion in which parallel
mortar lines between shifted rows of black and white tiles appear to converge
and diverge. A bioderived filtering model for the responses of retinal/cortical
simple cells to the stimulus using Difference of Gaussians is utilized with an
analytic processing pipeline introduced in our previous studies to quantify the
angle of tilt in the model. Here we have considered visual characteristics of
foveal and peripheral vision in the perceived tilt in the pattern to predict
different degrees of tilt in different areas of the fovea and periphery as the
eye saccades to different parts of the image. The tilt analysis results from
several sampling sizes and aspect ratios, modelling variant foveal views are
used from our previous investigations on the local tilt, and we specifically
investigate in this work, different configurations of the whole pattern
modelling variant Gestalt views across multiple scales in order to provide
confidence intervals around the predicted tilts. The foveal sample sets are
verified and quantified using two different sampling methods. We present here a
precise and quantified comparison contrasting local tilt detection in the
foveal sets with a global average across all of the Caf\'e Wall configurations
tested in this work.

 <dc:description>  3D shape models that directly classify objects from 3D information have
become more widely implementable. Current state of the art models rely on deep
convolutional and inception models that are resource intensive. Residual neural
networks have been demonstrated to be easier to optimize and do not suffer from
vanishing/exploding gradients observed in deep networks. Here we implement a
residual neural network for 3D object classification of the 3D Princeton
ModelNet dataset. Further, we show that widening network layers dramatically
improves accuracy in shallow residual nets, and residual neural networks
perform comparable to state-of-the-art 3D shape net models, and we show that
widening network layers improves classification accuracy. We provide extensive
training and architecture parameters providing a better understanding of
available network architectures for use in 3D object classification.

 <dc:description>  High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) significantly reduces bit-rates over the
proceeding H.264 standard but at the expense of extremely high encoding
complexity. In HEVC, the quad-tree partition of coding unit (CU) consumes a
large proportion of the HEVC encoding complexity, due to the bruteforce search
for rate-distortion optimization (RDO). Therefore, this paper proposes a deep
learning approach to predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity
at both intra- and inter-modes, which is based on convolutional neural network
(CNN) and long- and short-term memory (LSTM) network. First, we establish a
large-scale database including substantial CU partition data for HEVC intra-
and inter-modes. This enables deep learning on the CU partition. Second, we
represent the CU partition of an entire coding tree unit (CTU) in the form of a
hierarchical CU partition map (HCPM). Then, we propose an early-terminated
hierarchical CNN (ETH-CNN) for learning to predict the HCPM. Consequently, the
encoding complexity of intra-mode HEVC can be drastically reduced by replacing
the brute-force search with ETH-CNN to decide the CU partition. Third, an
early-terminated hierarchical LSTM (ETH-LSTM) is proposed to learn the temporal
correlation of the CU partition. Then, we combine ETH-LSTM and ETH-CNN to
predict the CU partition for reducing the HEVC complexity for inter-mode.
Finally, experimental results show that our approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art approaches in reducing the HEVC complexity at both intra- and
inter-modes.

 <dc:title>Multi-layer architecture for efficient steganalysis of Undermp3cover in

 <dc:creator>Ghasemzadeh, Hamzeh</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Mp3 is a very popular audio format and hence it can be a good host for
carrying hidden messages. In fact, different steganography methods have been
proposed for mp3. But, only steganalysis of mp3stego has been conducted in the
literature. In this paper we mention some limitations of mp3stego and argue
that Undermp3cover (Ump3c) does not have them. Then, steganalysis of Ump3c is
conducted based on measuring mutual information between global gain and other
fields of mp3 bit stream. Furthermore, we show that different mp3 encoders have
quite different performances and therefore we propose a novel multi-layer
architecture for its steganalysis. In this manner, the first layer detects the
encoder and the second layer performs the steganalysis job. One of advantages
of this architecture is that feature extraction and feature selection can be
optimized per encoder. We show this architecture outperforms the conventional
single-layer methods. Comparing results of the proposed method with other works
show an improvement of 20.4% in accuracy of multi-encoder scenario.

 <dc:description>  Conventional compressive sensing (CS) reconstruction is very slow for its
characteristic of solving an optimization problem. Convolu- tional neural
network can realize fast processing while achieving compa- rable results. While
CS image recovery with high quality not only de- pends on good reconstruction
algorithms, but also good measurements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
measurement network in which measurement is obtained by learning. The new
network consists of a fully-connected layer and ReconNet. The fully-connected
layer which has low-dimension output acts as measurement. We train the
fully-connected layer and ReconNet simultaneously and obtain adaptive
measurement. Because the adaptive measurement fits dataset better, in contrast
with random Gaussian measurement matrix, under the same measuremen- t rate, it
can extract the information of scene more efficiently and get better
reconstruction results. Experiments show that the new network outperforms the
original one.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new approach to non-local means image denoising.
Instead of using all pixels located in the search window for estimating the
value of a pixel, we identify the highly corrupted pixels and assign less
weight to these pixels. This method is called robust non-local means. Numerical
and subjective evaluations using ultrasound images show good performances of
the proposed denoising method in recovering the shape of edges and important
detailed components, in comparison to traditional ultrasound image denoising
methods

 <dc:description>  Autoencoders have been recently used for encoding medical images. In this
study, we design and validate a new framework for retrieving medical images by
classifying Radon projections, compressed in the deepest layer of an
autoencoder. As the autoencoder reduces the dimensionality, a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) can be employed to classify the images. The integration of MLP
promotes a rather shallow learning architecture which makes the training
faster. We conducted a comparative study to examine the capabilities of
autoencoders for different inputs such as raw images, Histogram of Oriented
Gradients (HOG) and normalized Radon projections. Our framework is benchmarked
on IRMA dataset containing $14,410$ x-ray images distributed across $57$
different classes. Experiments show an IRMA error of $313$ (equivalent to
$\approx 82\%$ accuracy) outperforming state-of-the-art works on retrieval from
IRMA dataset using autoencoders.

 <dc:description>  Many automatic skin lesion diagnosis systems use segmentation as a
preprocessing step to diagnose skin conditions because skin lesion shape,
border irregularity, and size can influence the likelihood of malignancy. This
paper presents, examines and compares two different approaches to skin lesion
segmentation. The first approach uses U-Nets and introduces a histogram
equalization based preprocessing step. The second approach is a C-Means
clustering based approach that is much simpler to implement and faster to
execute. The Jaccard Index between the algorithm output and hand segmented
images by dermatologists is used to evaluate the proposed algorithms. While
many recently proposed deep neural networks to segment skin lesions require a
significant amount of computational power for training (i.e., computer with
GPUs), the main objective of this paper is to present methods that can be used
with only a CPU. This severely limits, for example, the number of training
instances that can be presented to the U-Net. Comparing the two proposed
algorithms, U-Nets achieved a significantly higher Jaccard Index compared to
the clustering approach. Moreover, using the histogram equalization for
preprocessing step significantly improved the U-Net segmentation results.

 <dc:description>  Despite the progress made in the field of medical imaging, it remains a large
area of open research, especially due to the variety of imaging modalities and
disease-specific characteristics. This paper is a comparative study describing
the potential of using local binary patterns (LBP), deep features and the
bag-of-visual words (BoVW) scheme for the classification of histopathological
images. We introduce a new dataset, \emph{KIMIA Path960}, that contains 960
histopathology images belonging to 20 different classes (different tissue
types). We make this dataset publicly available. The small size of the dataset
and its inter- and intra-class variability makes it ideal for initial
investigations when comparing image descriptors for search and classification
in complex medical imaging cases like histopathology. We investigate deep
features, LBP histograms and BoVW to classify the images via leave-one-out
validation. The accuracy of image classification obtained using LBP was 90.62\%
while the highest accuracy using deep features reached 94.72\%. The dictionary
approach (BoVW) achieved 96.50\%. Deep solutions may be able to deliver higher
accuracies but they need extensive training with a large number of (balanced)
image datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new neural network architecture for automatic generation of
missing characters in a Chinese font set. We call the neural network
architecture the Variational Grid Setting Network which is based on the
variational autoencoder (VAE) with some tweaks. The neural network model is
able to generate missing characters relatively large in size ($256 \times 256$
pixels). Moreover, we show that one can use very few samples for training data
set, and get a satisfied result.

 <dc:description>  In the present paper, we propose a source camera identification method for
mobile devices based on deep learning. Recently, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have shown a remarkable performance on several tasks such as image
recognition, video analysis or natural language processing. A CNN consists on a
set of layers where each layer is composed by a set of high pass filters which
are applied all over the input image. This convolution process provides the
unique ability to extract features automatically from data and to learn from
those features. Our proposal describes a CNN architecture which is able to
infer the noise pattern of mobile camera sensors (also known as camera
fingerprint) with the aim at detecting and identifying not only the mobile
device used to capture an image (with a 98\% of accuracy), but also from which
embedded camera the image was captured. More specifically, we provide an
extensive analysis on the proposed architecture considering different
configurations. The experiment has been carried out using the images captured
from different mobile devices cameras (MICHE-I Dataset was used) and the
obtained results have proved the robustness of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel and uniform algorithm for edge detection based on
SVM (support vector machine) with Three-dimensional Gaussian radial basis
function with kernel. Because of disadvantages in traditional edge detection
such as inaccurate edge location, rough edge and careless on detect soft edge.
The experimental results indicate how the SVM can detect edge in efficient way.
The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with existing methods,
including Sobel and canny detectors. The results show that this method is
better than classical algorithm such as canny and Sobel detector.

 <dc:title>A D2D-based Protocol for Ultra-Reliable Wireless Communications for
  Industrial Automation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As one indispensable use case for the 5G wireless systems on the roadmap,
ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) is a crucial requirement
for the coming era of wireless industrial automation. This paper aims to
develop communication techniques for making such a paradigm shift from the
conventional human-type broadband communications to the emerging machine-type
URLLC. One fundamental task for URLLC is to deliver a short command from the
controller to each actuator within the stringent delay requirement and also
with high-reliability in the downlink. Motivated by the geographic feature in
industrial automation that in the factories many tasks are assigned to
different groups of devices who work in close proximity to each other and thus
can form clusters of reliable device-to-device (D2D) networks, this paper
proposes a novel two-phase transmission protocol for achieving the above goal.
Specifically, in the first phase within the latency requirement, the
multi-antenna base station (BS) combines the messages of each group together
and multicasts them to the corresponding groups; while in the second phase, the
devices that have decoded the messages successfully, who are defined as the
leaders, help relay the messages to the other devices in their groups. Under
this protocol, we further design an innovative leader selection based
beamforming strategy at the BS by utilizing the sparse optimization technique,
which leads to the desired sparsity pattern in user activity, i.e., at least
one leader exists in each group, in the first phase, thus making full
utilization of the reliable D2D networks in the second phase. Simulation
results are provided to show that the proposed two-phase transmission protocol
considerably improves the reliability of the whole system within the stringent
latency requirement as compared to other existing schemes for URLLC such as
Occupy CoW.

 <dc:description>  Gray matter (GM) tissue changes have been associated with a wide range of
neurological disorders and was also recently found relevant as a biomarker for
disability in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The ability to automatically
segment the GM is, therefore, an important task for modern studies of the
spinal cord. In this work, we devise a modern, simple and end-to-end fully
automated human spinal cord gray matter segmentation method using Deep
Learning, that works both on in vivo and ex vivo MRI acquisitions. We evaluate
our method against six independently developed methods on a GM segmentation
challenge and report state-of-the-art results in 8 out of 10 different
evaluation metrics as well as major network parameter reduction when compared
to the traditional medical imaging architectures such as U-Nets.

 <dc:title>Coverage and Rate Analysis for Co-Existing RF/VLC Downlink Cellular

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper provides a stochastic geometry framework to perform the coverage
and rate analysis of a typical user in co-existing VLC and RF networks covering
a large indoor area. The developed framework can be customized to capture the
performance of a typical user in various network configurations such as (i)
RF-only, in which only small base-stations (SBSs) are available to provide the
coverage to a user, (ii) VLC-only, in which only optical BSs (OBSs) are
available to provide the coverage to a user, (iii) opportunistic RF/VLC, where
a user selects the network with maximum received signal power, and (iv) hybrid
RF/VLC, where a user can simultaneously utilize the available resources from
both RF and VLC networks. The developed model for VLC network precisely
captures the impact of the field-of-view (FOV) of the photo-detector (PD)
receiver on the number of interferers, distribution of the aggregate
interference, association probability, and the coverage of a typical user.
Closed-form approximations are presented for special cases of practical
interest and for asymptotic scenarios such as when the intensity of SBSs
becomes very low. The derived expressions enable us to obtain closed-form
solutions for various network design parameters (such as intensity of OBSs and
SBSs, transmit power, and/or FOV) such that the number of active users can be
distributed optimally among RF and VLC networks. Also, we optimize the network
parameters in order to prioritize the association of users to VLC network.
Finally, simulations are carried out to verify the derived analytical
solutions. Important trade-offs between height and intensity of OBSs are
highlighted to optimize the performance of a user in VLC networks.

 <dc:description>  Personal Health Systems (PHS) are mobile solutions tailored to monitoring
patients affected by chronic non communicable diseases. A patient affected by a
chronic disease can generate large amounts of events. Type 1 Diabetic patients
generate several glucose events per day, ranging from at least 6 events per day
(under normal monitoring) to 288 per day when wearing a continuous glucose
monitor (CGM) that samples the blood every 5 minutes for several days. This is
a large number of events to monitor for medical doctors, in particular when
considering that they may have to take decisions concerning adjusting the
treatment, which may impact the life of the patients for a long time. Given the
need to analyse such a large stream of data, doctors need a simple approach
towards physiological time series that allows them to promptly transfer their
knowledge into queries to identify interesting patterns in the data. Achieving
this with current technology is not an easy task, as on one hand it cannot be
expected that medical doctors have the technical knowledge to query databases
and on the other hand these time series include thousands of events, which
requires to re-think the way data is indexed. In order to tackle the knowledge
representation and efficiency problem, this contribution presents the kd-tree
cached event calculus (\ceckd) an event calculus extension for knowledge
engineering of temporal rules capable to handle many thousands events produced
by a diabetic patient. \ceckd\ is built as a support to a graphical interface
to represent monitoring rules for diabetes type 1. In addition, the paper
evaluates the \ceckd\ with respect to the cached event calculus (CEC) to show
how indexing events using kd-trees improves scalability with respect to the
current state of the art.

 <dc:title>Decoding visemes: improving machine lipreading (PhD thesis)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bear, Helen L</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Machine lipreading (MLR) is speech recognition from visual cues and a niche
research problem in speech processing &amp; computer vision. Current challenges
fall into two groups: the content of the video, such as rate of speech or; the
parameters of the video recording e.g, video resolution. We show that HD video
is not needed to successfully lipread with a computer. The term &quot;viseme&quot; is
used in machine lipreading to represent a visual cue or gesture which
corresponds to a subgroup of phonemes where the phonemes are visually
indistinguishable. A phoneme is the smallest sound one can utter, because there
are more phonemes per viseme, maps between units show a many-to-one
relationship. Many maps have been presented, we compare these and our results
show Lee's is best. We propose a new method of speaker-dependent
phoneme-to-viseme maps and compare these to Lee's. Our results show the
sensitivity of phoneme clustering and we use our new knowledge to augment a
conventional MLR system. It has been observed in MLR, that classifiers need
training on test subjects to achieve accuracy. Thus machine lipreading is
highly speaker-dependent. Conversely speaker independence is robust
classification of non-training speakers. We investigate the dependence of
phoneme-to-viseme maps between speakers and show there is not a high
variability of visemes, but there is high variability in trajectory between
visemes of individual speakers with the same ground truth. This implies a
dependency upon the number of visemes within each set for each individual. We
show that prior phoneme-to-viseme maps rarely have enough visemes and the
optimal size, which varies by speaker, ranges from 11-35. Finally we decode
from visemes back to phonemes and into words. Our novel approach uses the
optimum range visemes within hierarchical training of phoneme classifiers and
demonstrates a significant increase in classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in automated synthesis
techniques that are able to automatically generate code based on some intent
expressed by the programmer. A major challenge for the adoption of synthesis
remains in having the programmer communicate their intent. When the expressed
intent is coarse-grained (for example, restriction on the expected type of an
expression), the synthesizer often produces a long list of results for the
programmer to choose from, shifting the heavy-lifting to the user. An
alternative approach, successfully used in end-user synthesis is programming by
example (PBE), where the user leverages examples to interactively and
iteratively refine the intent. However, using only examples is not expressive
enough for programmers, who can observe the generated program and refine the
intent by directly relating to parts of the generated program.
  We present a novel approach to interacting with a synthesizer using a
granular interaction model. Our approach employs a rich interaction model where
(i) the synthesizer decorates a candidate program with debug information that
assists in understanding the program and identifying good or bad parts, and
(ii) the user is allowed to provide feedback not only on the expected output of
a program, but also on the underlying program itself. That is, when the user
identifies a program as (partially) correct or incorrect, they can also
explicitly indicate the good or bad parts, to allow the synthesizer to accept
or discard parts of the program instead of discarding the program as a whole.
  We show the value of our approach in a controlled user study. Our study shows
that participants have strong preference to using granular feedback instead of
examples, and are able to provide granular feedback much faster.

 <dc:description>  We are at an exciting time for machine lipreading. Traditional research
stemmed from the adaptation of audio recognition systems. But now, the computer
vision community is also participating. This joining of two previously
disparate areas with different perspectives on computer lipreading is creating
opportunities for collaborations, but in doing so the literature is
experiencing challenges in knowledge sharing due to multiple uses of terms and
phrases and the range of methods for scoring results.
  In particular we highlight three areas with the intention to improve
communication between those researching lipreading; the effects of
interchanging between speech reading and lipreading; speaker dependence across
train, validation, and test splits; and the use of accuracy, correctness,
errors, and varying units (phonemes, visemes, words, and sentences) to measure
system performance. We make recommendations as to how we can be more
consistent.

 <dc:description>  Electric and hybrid vehicles play an increasing role in the road transport
networks. Despite their advantages, they have a relatively limited cruising
range in comparison to traditional diesel/petrol vehicles, and require
significant battery charging time. We propose to model the facility location
problem of the placement of charging stations in road networks as a multiple
domination problem on reachability graphs. This model takes into consideration
natural assumptions such as a threshold for remaining battery load, and
provides some minimal choice for a travel direction to recharge the battery.
Experimental evaluation and simulations for the proposed facility location
model are presented in the case of real road networks corresponding to the
cities of Boston and Dublin.

 <dc:title>Visual gesture variability between talkers in continuous visual speech</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bear, Helen L</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent adoption of deep learning methods to the field of machine lipreading
research gives us two options to pursue to improve system performance. Either,
we develop end-to-end systems holistically or, we experiment to further our
understanding of the visual speech signal. The latter option is more difficult
but this knowledge would enable researchers to both improve systems and apply
the new knowledge to other domains such as speech therapy. One challenge in
lipreading systems is the correct labeling of the classifiers. These labels map
an estimated function between visemes on the lips and the phonemes uttered.
Here we ask if such maps are speaker-dependent? Prior work investigated
isolated word recognition from speaker-dependent (SD) visemes, we extend this
to continuous speech. Benchmarked against SD results, and the isolated words
performance, we test with RMAV dataset speakers and observe that with
continuous speech, the trajectory between visemes has a greater negative effect
on the speaker differentiation.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we give two new deterministic interpolation algorithms for
black-box multivariate polynomials. For a t-sparse and n-variate polynomial f
with a degree bound D and a term bound T, we show that at least half of the
terms of f can be recovered from the univariate polynomials obtained from f by
three types of Kronecker substitutions. We then give a criterion to check
whether these terms really belong to f. Repeat the above procedure for at most
log(t) times, f can be recovered. The algorithm has better complexity in D than
existing deterministic algorithms when the coefficients are from Q, and has
better complexities in T and D and the same complexity in n when the
coefficients are from a finite field.

 <dc:description>  We study the binary Ehrenfeucht Mycielski sequence seeking a balance between
the number of occurrences of different binary strings. There have been numerous
attempts to prove the balance conjecture of the sequence, which roughly states
that 1 and 0 occur equally often in it. Our contribution is twofold. First, we
study weaker forms of the conjecture proved in the past and lay out detailed
proofs for many lemmas which were stated without proofs. Secondly, we extend
the claim of balance to that of normality and prove a weaker form of simple
normality to word length 2.

 <dc:title>Reuleaux: Robot Base Placement by Reachability Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Makhal, Abhijit</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Goins, Alex K.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Before beginning any robot task, users must position the robot's base, a task
that now depends entirely on user intuition. While slight perturbation is
tolerable for robots with moveable bases, correcting the problem is imperative
for fixed-base robots if some essential task sections are out of reach. For
mobile manipulation robots, it is necessary to decide on a specific base
position before beginning manipulation tasks.
  This paper presents Reuleaux, an open source library for robot reachability
analyses and base placement. It reduces the amount of extra repositioning and
removes the manual work of identifying potential base locations. Based on the
reachability map, base placement locations of a whole robot or only the arm can
be efficiently determined. This can be applied to both statically mounted
robots, where position of the robot and work piece ensure the maximum amount of
work performed, and to mobile robots, where the maximum amount of workable area
can be reached. Solutions are not limited only to vertically constrained
placement, since complicated robotics tasks require the base to be placed at
unique poses based on task demand.
  All Reuleaux library methods were tested on different robots of different
specifications and evaluated for tasks in simulation and real world
environment. Evaluation results indicate that Reuleaux had significantly
improved performance than prior existing methods in terms of time-efficiency
and range of applicability.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We explore two solutions to the problem of mistranslating rare words in
neural machine translation. First, we argue that the standard output layer,
which computes the inner product of a vector representing the context with all
possible output word embeddings, rewards frequent words disproportionately, and
we propose to fix the norms of both vectors to a constant value. Second, we
integrate a simple lexical module which is jointly trained with the rest of the
model. We evaluate our approaches on eight language pairs with data sizes
ranging from 100k to 8M words, and achieve improvements of up to +4.5 BLEU,
surpassing phrase-based translation in nearly all settings.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a robotic pick-and-place system that is capable of
grasping and recognizing both known and novel objects in cluttered
environments. The key new feature of the system is that it handles a wide range
of object categories without needing any task-specific training data for novel
objects. To achieve this, it first uses a category-agnostic affordance
prediction algorithm to select among four different grasping primitive
behaviors. It then recognizes picked objects with a cross-domain image
classification framework that matches observed images to product images. Since
product images are readily available for a wide range of objects (e.g., from
the web), the system works out-of-the-box for novel objects without requiring
any additional training data. Exhaustive experimental results demonstrate that
our multi-affordance grasping achieves high success rates for a wide variety of
objects in clutter, and our recognition algorithm achieves high accuracy for
both known and novel grasped objects. The approach was part of the
MIT-Princeton Team system that took 1st place in the stowing task at the 2017
Amazon Robotics Challenge. All code, datasets, and pre-trained models are
available online at http://arc.cs.princeton.edu

 <dc:description>  Neuroscience research has produced many theories and computational neural
models of sensory nervous systems. Notwithstanding many different perspectives
towards developing intelligent machines, artificial intelligence has ultimately
been influenced by neuroscience. Therefore, this paper provides an introduction
to biologically inspired machine intelligence by exploring the basic principles
of sensation and perception as well as the structure and behavior of biological
sensory nervous systems like the neocortex. Concepts like spike timing,
synaptic plasticity, inhibition, neural structure, and neural behavior are
applied to a new model, Simple Cortex (SC). A software implementation of SC has
been built and demonstrates fast observation, learning, and prediction of
spatio-temporal sensory-motor patterns and sequences. Finally, this paper
suggests future areas of improvement and growth for Simple Cortex and other
related machine intelligence models.

 <dc:description>  For machines to lipread, or understand speech from lip movement, they decode
lip-motions (known as visemes) into the spoken sounds. We investigate the
visual speech channel to further our understanding of visemes. This has
applications beyond machine lipreading; speech therapists, animators, and

 <dc:title>Relationship Profiling over Social Networks: Reverse Smoothness from

 <dc:creator>Chang, Kevin Chen-Chuan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  On social networks, while nodes bear rich attributes, we often lack the
`semantics' of why each link is formed-- and thus we are missing the `road
signs' to navigate and organize the complex social universe. How to identify
relationship semantics without labels? Founded on the prevalent homophily
principle, we propose the novel problem of Attribute-based Relationship
Profiling (ARP), to profile the closeness w.r.t. the underlying relationships
(e.g., schoolmate) between users based on their similarity in the corresponding
attributes (e.g., education) and, as output, learn a set of social affinity
graphs, where each link is weighted by its probabilities of carrying the
relationships. As requirements, ARP should be systematic and complete to
profile every link for every relationship-- our challenges lie in effectively
modeling homophily. We propose a novel reverse smoothness principle by
observing that the similarity-closeness duality of homophily is consistent with
the well-known smoothness assumption in graph-based semi-supervised learning--
only the direction of inference is reversed. To realize smoothness over noisy
social graphs, we further propose a novel holistic closeness modeling approach
to capture `high-order' smoothness by extending closeness from edges to paths.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of
ARP.

 <dc:description>  How can we justify the validity of our computer security methods? This

are described for technical methods. An interdisciplinary argument from theory
explains the role that meta-methodological validation plays in the adversarial

 <dc:description>  With the rising popularity of Augmented and Virtual Reality, there is a need
for representing humans as virtual avatars in various application domains
ranging from remote telepresence, games to medical applications. Besides
explicitly modelling 3D avatars, sensing approaches that create person-specific
avatars are becoming popular. However, affordable solutions typically suffer
from a low visual quality and professional solution are often too expensive to
be deployed in nonprofit projects.
  We present an open-source project, BodyDigitizer, which aims at providing
both build instructions and configuration software for a high-resolution
photogrammetry-based 3D body scanner. Our system encompasses up to 96 Rasperry
PI cameras, active LED lighting, a sturdy frame construction and open-source
configuration software. %We demonstrate the applicability of the body scanner
in a nonprofit Mixed Reality health project. The detailed build instruction and
software are available at http://www.bodydigitizer.org.

 <dc:description>  Competitive resource allocation between adversarial decision makers arises in
a wide spectrum of real-world applications such as in communication systems,
cyber-physical systems security, as well as financial, political, and electoral
competition. As such, developing analytical tools to model and analyze
competitive resource allocation is crucial for devising optimal allocation
strategies and anticipating the potential outcomes of the competition. To this
end, the Colonel Blotto game is one of the most popular game-theoretic
frameworks for modeling and analyzing such competitive resource allocation
problems. However, in many real-world competitive situations, the Colonel
Blotto game does not admit solutions in deterministic strategies and, hence,
one must rely on analytically complex mixed-strategies with their associated
tractability, applicability, and practicality challenges. In this paper, a
generalization of the Colonel Blotto game which enables the derivation of
deterministic, practical, and implementable equilibrium strategies is proposed
while accounting for the heterogeneity of the battlefields. In addition, the
proposed generalized game enables accounting for the consumed resources in each
battlefield, a feature that is not considered in the classical Blotto game. For
the generalized game, the existence of a Nash equilibrium in pure-strategies is
shown. Then, closed-form analytical expressions of the equilibrium strategies,
are derived and the outcome of the game is characterized; based on the number
of resources of each player as well as the valuation of each battlefield. The
generated results provide invaluable insights on the outcome of the
competition. For example, the results show that, when both players are fully
rational, the more resourceful player can achieve a better total payoff at the
Nash equilibrium, a result that is not mimicked in the classical Blotto game.

 <dc:description>  Cloaking has long been exploited by spammers for the purpose of increasing
the exposure of their websites. In other words, cloaking has long served as a
major malicious technique in search engine optimization (SEO). Cloaking hides
the true nature of a website by delivering blatantly different content to users
versus web crawlers. Recently, we have also witnessed a rising trend of
employing cloaking in search engine marketing (SEM). However, detecting
cloaking is challenging. Existing approaches cannot detect IP cloaking and are
not suitable for detecting cloaking in SEM because their search-and-visit
method leads to click fraud. In addition, they focus on detecting and measuring
cloaking on the server side, but the results are not visible to users to help
them avoid frauds.
  Our work focuses on mitigating IP cloaking and SEM cloaking, and providing
client-based real-time cloaking detection services. To achieve these goals, we
first propose the Simhash-based Website Model (SWM), a condensed representation
of websites, which can model natural page dynamics. Based on SWM, we design and
implement Cloaker Catcher, an accurate, efficient and privacy-preserving
system, that consists of a server that crawls websites visited by users on
demand and a client-side extension that fetches spider views of websites from
the server and compares them with user views to detect cloaking. Since Cloaker
Catcher checks on the client side for each real user, IP cloaking can be
detected whenever it occurs and click fraud in SEM can also be prevented. Using
our system, we conducted the first analysis of SEM cloaking and found that the
main purpose of SEM cloakers is to provide illicit services.

 <dc:title>Robust and Secure Resource Allocation for Full-Duplex MISO Multicarrier

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the resource allocation algorithm design for
multiple-input single-output (MISO) multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access
(MC-NOMA) systems, in which a full-duplex base station serves multiple
half-duplex uplink and downlink users on the same subcarrier simultaneously.
The resource allocation is optimized for maximization of the weighted system
throughput while the information leakage is constrained and artificial noise is
injected to guarantee secure communication in the presence of multiple
potential eavesdroppers. To this end, we formulate a robust non-convex
optimization problem taking into account the imperfect channel state
information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channels and the quality-of-service
(QoS) requirements of the legitimate users. Despite the non-convexity of the
optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying monotonic optimization
which yields the optimal beamforming, artificial noise design, subcarrier
allocation, and power allocation policy. The optimal resource allocation policy
serves as a performance benchmark since the corresponding monotonic
optimization based algorithm entails a high computational complexity. Hence, we
also develop a low-complexity suboptimal resource allocation algorithm which
converges to a locally optimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that the
performance of the suboptimal algorithm closely approaches that of the optimal
algorithm. Besides, the proposed optimal MISO NOMA system can not only ensure
downlink and uplink communication security simultaneously but also provides a
significant system secrecy rate improvement compared to traditional MISO
orthogonal multiple access (OMA) systems and two other baseline schemes.

 <dc:description>  This work studies the null controllability of a system of coupled parabolic
PDEs. In particular, our work specializes to an important subclass of these
control problems which are coupled by first and zero-order couplings and are,
additionally, underactuated. We pose our control problem in a fairly new
framework which divides the problem into interconnected parts: we refer to the
first part as the analytic control problem, where we use slightly non-classical
techniques to prove null controllability by means of internal controls
appearing on every equation; we refer to the second part as the algebraic
control problem, where we use an algebraic method to invert a linear partial
differential operator that describes our system; this allows us to recover null
controllability by means of internal controls which appear on only a few of the
equations. We establish a null controllability result for the original problem
by solving these control problems concurrently.

 <dc:description>  When classifying point clouds, a large amount of time is devoted to the
process of engineering a reliable set of features which are then passed to a
classifier of choice. Generally, such features - usually derived from the
3D-covariance matrix - are computed using the surrounding neighborhood of
points. While these features capture local information, the process is usually
time-consuming, and requires the application at multiple scales combined with
contextual methods in order to adequately describe the diversity of objects
within a scene. In this paper we present a 1D-fully convolutional network that
consumes terrain-normalized points directly with the corresponding spectral
data,if available, to generate point-wise labeling while implicitly learning
contextual features in an end-to-end fashion. Our method uses only the
3D-coordinates and three corresponding spectral features for each point.
Spectral features may either be extracted from 2D-georeferenced images, as
shown here for Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, or extracted
directly for passive-derived point clouds,i.e. from muliple-view imagery. We
train our network by splitting the data into square regions, and use a pooling
layer that respects the permutation-invariance of the input points. Evaluated
using the ISPRS 3D Semantic Labeling Contest, our method scored second place
with an overall accuracy of 81.6%. We ranked third place with a mean F1-score
of 63.32%, surpassing the F1-score of the method with highest accuracy by
1.69%. In addition to labeling 3D-point clouds, we also show that our method
can be easily extended to 2D-semantic segmentation tasks, with promising
initial results.

 <dc:description>  How does the control architecture of a multiagent system impact the
achievable performance guarantees? In this paper we answer this question
relative to a class of resource allocation problems, termed multiagent set
covering problems. More specifically, we demonstrate how the degree of
information available to each agent imposes constraints on the achievable
efficiency guarantees associated with the emergent collective behavior. We
measure these efficiency guarantees using the well-known metrics of price of
anarchy and price of stability, which seek to bound the performance of the
worst and best performing equilibria, respectively. Our first result
demonstrates that when agents only know local information about the resources
they can select, a system operator is forced to manage an inherent trade-off
between the price of anarchy and price of stability, i.e., improving the
quality of the worst equilibria comes at the expenses of the best equilibria.
Our second result demonstrates that a system operator can move well beyond this
price of anarchy / price of stability frontier by designing a communication
protocol that provides agents with a limited amount of system-level information
beyond these local quantities.

resource-rich language through parallel data. We propose a transfer method that
employs information from source and target syntactic dependencies as well as
word alignment density to improve the quality of an iterative bootstrapping

 <dc:description>  In the emerging advancement in the branch of autonomous robotics, the ability
of a robot to efficiently localize and construct maps of its surrounding is
crucial. This paper deals with utilizing thermal-infrared cameras, as opposed
to conventional cameras as the primary sensor to capture images of the robot's
surroundings. For localization, the images need to be further processed before
feeding them to a navigational system. The main motivation of this paper was to
develop an edge detection methodology capable of utilizing the low-SNR poor
output from such a thermal camera and effectively detect smooth edges of the
surrounding environment. The enhanced edge detector proposed in this paper
takes the raw image from the thermal sensor, denoises the images, applies Canny
edge detection followed by CSS method. The edges are ranked to remove any noise
and only edges of the highest rank are kept. Then, the broken edges are linked
by computing edge metrics and a smooth edge of the surrounding is displayed in
a binary image. Several comparisons are also made in the paper between the
proposed technique and the existing techniques.

 <dc:description>  Robots are required to execute increasingly complex instructions in dynamic
environments, which can lead to a disconnect between the user's intent and the
robot's representation of the instructions. In this paper we present a natural
language instruction grounding framework which uses formal synthesis to enable
the robot to identify necessary environment assumptions for the task to be
successful. These assumptions are then expressed via natural language questions
referencing objects in the environment. The user is prompted to confirm or
reject the assumption. We demonstrate our approach on two tabletop
pick-and-place tasks.

 <dc:description>  Relational databases are valuable resources for learning novel and
interesting relations and concepts. Relational learning algorithms learn the
Datalog definition of new relations in terms of the existing relations in the
database. In order to constraint the search through the large space of
candidate definitions, users must tune the algorithm by specifying a language
bias. Unfortunately, specifying the language bias is done via trial and error
and is guided by the expert's intuitions. Hence, it normally takes a great deal
of time and effort to effectively use these algorithms. In particular, it is
hard to find a user that knows computer science concepts, such as database
schema, and has a reasonable intuition about the target relation in special
domains, such as biology. We propose AutoMode, a system that leverages
information in the schema and content of the database to automatically induce
the language bias used by popular relational learning systems. We show that
AutoMode delivers the same accuracy as using manually-written language bias by
imposing only a slight overhead on the running time of the learning algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Large sky surveys are increasingly relying on image subtraction pipelines for
real-time (and archival) transient detection. In this process one has to
contend with varying PSF, small brightness variations in many sources, as well
as artifacts resulting from saturated stars, and, in general, matching errors.
Very often the differencing is done with a reference image that is deeper than
individual images and the attendant difference in noise characteristics can
also lead to artifacts. We present here a deep-learning approach to transient
detection that encapsulates all the steps of a traditional image subtraction
pipeline -- image registration, background subtraction, noise removal, psf
matching, and subtraction -- into a single real-time convolutional network.
Once trained the method works lighteningly fast, and given that it does
multiple steps at one go, the advantages for multi-CCD, fast surveys like ZTF
and LSST are obvious.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Sensitive computation often has to be performed in a trusted execution
environment (TEE), which, in turn, requires tamper-proof hardware. If the
computational fabric can be tampered with, we may no longer be able to trust
the correctness of the computation. We study the idea of using computational
platforms in space as a means to protect data from adversarial physical access.
In this paper, we propose SpaceTEE - a practical implementation of this
approach using low-cost nano-satellites called CubeSats. We study the
constraints of such a platform, the cost of deployment, and discuss possible
applications under those constraints. As a case study, we design a hardware
security module solution (called SpaceHSM) and describe how it can be used to
implement a root-of-trust for a certi cate authority (CA).

 <dc:description>  We present massively parallel (MPC) algorithms and hardness of approximation
results for computing Single-Linkage Clustering of $n$ input $d$-dimensional
vectors under Hamming, $\ell_1, \ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ distances. All our
algorithms run in $O(\log n)$ rounds of MPC for any fixed $d$ and achieve
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for all distances (except Hamming for which we
show an exact algorithm). We also show constant-factor inapproximability
results for $o(\log n)$-round algorithms under standard MPC hardness
assumptions (for sufficiently large dimension depending on the distance used).
Efficiency of implementation of our algorithms in Apache Spark is demonstrated
through experiments on a variety of datasets exhibiting speedups of several
orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  In this article we show the duality between tensor networks and undirected
graphical models with discrete variables. We study tensor networks on
hypergraphs, which we call tensor hypernetworks. We show that the tensor
hypernetwork on a hypergraph exactly corresponds to the graphical model given
by the dual hypergraph. We translate various notions under duality. For
example, marginalization in a graphical model is dual to contraction in the
tensor network. Algorithms also translate under duality. We show that belief
propagation corresponds to a known algorithm for tensor network contraction.
This article is a reminder that the research areas of graphical models and
tensor networks can benefit from interaction.

 <dc:description>  We present the grasping system and design approach behind $\textit{Cartman}$,
the winning entrant in the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge. We investigate the
design processes leading up to the final iteration of the system and describe
the emergent solution by comparing it with key robotics design aspects.
Following our experience, we propose a new design aspect, precision vs.
redundancy, that should be considered alongside the previously proposed design
aspects of modularity vs. integration, generality vs. assumptions, computation
vs. embodiment and planning vs. feedback. We present the grasping system behind
$\textit{Cartman}$, the winning robot in the 2017 Amazon Robotics Challenge.
The system makes strong use of redundancy in design by implementing
complimentary tools, a suction gripper and a parallel gripper. This multi-modal
end-effector is combined with three grasp synthesis algorithms to accommodate
the range of objects provided by Amazon during the challenge. We provide a
detailed system description and an evaluation of its performance before
discussing the broader nature of the system with respect to the key aspects of
robotic design as initially proposed by the winners of the first Amazon Picking
Challenge. To address the principal nature of our grasping system and the
reason for its success, we propose an additional robotic design aspect
`precision vs. redundancy'.

 <dc:description>  Existing visual tracking methods usually localize a target object with a
bounding box, in which the performance of the foreground object trackers or
detectors is often affected by the inclusion of background clutter. To handle
this problem, we learn a patch-based graph representation for visual tracking.
The tracked object is modeled by with a graph by taking a set of
non-overlapping image patches as nodes, in which the weight of each node
indicates how likely it belongs to the foreground and edges are weighted for
indicating the appearance compatibility of two neighboring nodes. This graph is
dynamically learned and applied in object tracking and model updating. During
the tracking process, the proposed algorithm performs three main steps in each
frame. First, the graph is initialized by assigning binary weights of some
image patches to indicate the object and background patches according to the
predicted bounding box. Second, the graph is optimized to refine the patch
weights by using a novel alternating direction method of multipliers. Third,
the object feature representation is updated by imposing the weights of patches
on the extracted image features. The object location is predicted by maximizing
the classification score in the structured support vector machine. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed tracking algorithm performs well against the
state-of-the-art methods on large-scale benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a way to improve the compression based
dissimilarity measure, CDM. We propose to use a modified value of the file
size, where the original CDM uses an unmodified file size. Our application is a
music score analysis. We have chosen piano pieces from five different
composers. We have selected 75 famous pieces (15 pieces for each composer). We
computed the distances among all pieces by using the modified CDM. We use the
K-nearest neighbor method when we estimate the composer of each piece of music.
The modified CDM shows improved accuracy. The difference is statistically
significant.

 <dc:description>  Sketch portrait generation benefits a wide range of applications such as
digital entertainment and law enforcement. Although plenty of efforts have been
dedicated to this task, several issues still remain unsolved for generating
vivid and detail-preserving personal sketch portraits. For example, quite a few
artifacts may exist in synthesizing hairpins and glasses, and textural details
may be lost in the regions of hair or mustache. Moreover, the generalization
ability of current systems is somewhat limited since they usually require
elaborately collecting a dictionary of examples or carefully tuning
features/components. In this paper, we present a novel representation learning
framework that generates an end-to-end photo-sketch mapping through structure
and texture decomposition. In the training stage, we first decompose the input
face photo into different components according to their representational
contents (i.e., structural and textural parts) by using a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then, we utilize a Branched Fully
Convolutional Neural Network (BFCN) for learning structural and textural
representations, respectively. In addition, we design a Sorted Matching Mean
Square Error (SM-MSE) metric to measure texture patterns in the loss function.
In the stage of sketch rendering, our approach automatically generates
structural and textural representations for the input photo and produces the
final result via a probabilistic fusion scheme. Extensive experiments on
several challenging benchmarks suggest that our approach outperforms
example-based synthesis algorithms in terms of both perceptual and objective
metrics. In addition, the proposed method also has better generalization
ability across dataset without additional training.

 <dc:description>  An intuition on human segmentation is that when a human is moving in a video,
the video-context (e.g., appearance and motion clues) may potentially infer
reasonable mask information for the whole human body. Inspired by this, based
on popular deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), we explore a very-weakly
supervised learning framework for human segmentation task, where only an
imperfect human detector is available along with massive weakly-labeled YouTube
videos. In our solution, {the video-context guided human mask inference and CNN
based segmentation network learning iterate to mutually enhance each other
until no further improvement gains.} In the first step, each video is
decomposed into supervoxels by the unsupervised video segmentation. The
superpixels within the supervoxels are then classified as human or non-human by
graph optimization with unary energies from the imperfect human detection
results and the predicted confidence maps by the CNN trained in the previous
iteration. In the second step, the video-context derived human masks are used
as direct labels to train CNN. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL
VOC 2012 semantic segmentation benchmark demonstrate that the proposed
framework has already achieved superior results than all previous
weakly-supervised methods with object class or bounding box annotations. In
addition, by augmenting with the annotated masks from PASCAL VOC 2012, our
method reaches a new state-of-the-art performance on the human segmentation
task.

 <dc:title>Sum of Square Proof for Brascamp-Lieb Type Inequality</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Brascamp-Lieb inequality is an important mathematical tool in analysis,
geometry and information theory. There are various ways to prove Brascamp-Lieb
inequality such as heat flow method, Brownian motion and subadditivity of the
entropy. While Brascamp-Lieb inequality is originally stated in Euclidean
Space, discussed Brascamp-Lieb inequality for discrete Abelian group and
discussed Brascamp-Lieb inequality for Markov semigroups.
  Many mathematical inequalities can be formulated as algebraic inequalities
which asserts some given polynomial is nonnegative. In 1927, Artin proved that
any non- negative polynomial can be represented as a sum of squares of rational
functions, which can be further formulated as a polynomial certificate of the
nonnegativity of the polynomial. This is a Sum of Square proof of the
inequality. Take the degree of the polynomial certificate as the degree of Sum
of Square proof. The degree of an Sum of Square proof determines the complexity
of generating such proof by Sum of Square algorithm which is a powerful tool
for optimization and computer aided proof.
  In this paper, we give a Sum of Square proof for some special settings of
Brascamp- Lieb inequality following and and discuss some applications of
Brascamp-Lieb inequality on Abelian group and Euclidean Sphere. If the original
description of the inequality has constant degree and d is constant, the degree
of the proof is also constant. Therefore, low degree sum of square algorithm
can fully capture the power of low degree finite Brascamp-Lieb inequality.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks as powerful tools are widely used in various domains.
However, the nature of computations at each layer of the deep networks is far
from being well understood. Increasing the interpretability of deep neural
networks is thus important. Here, we construct a mean-field framework to
understand how compact representations are developed across layers, not only in
deterministic random deep networks but also in generative deep networks where
network parameters are learned from input data. Our theory shows that the deep
computation implements a dimensionality reduction while maintaining a finite
level of weak correlations between neurons for possible feature extraction.
This work may pave the way for understanding how a sensory hierarchy works in
general.

 <dc:description>  Most multi-dimensional (more than two dimensions) lattice partitions only
form additive quotient groups and lack multiplication operations. This prevents
us from constructing lattice codes based on multi-dimensional lattice
partitions directly from non-binary linear codes over finite fields. In this
paper, we design lattice codes from Construction A lattices where the
underlying linear codes are non-binary irregular repeat-accumulate (IRA) codes.
Most importantly, our codes are based on multi-dimensional lattice partitions
with finite constellations. We propose a novel encoding structure that adds
randomly generated lattice sequences to the encoder's messages, instead of
multiplying lattice sequences to the encoder's messages. We prove that our
approach can ensure that the decoder's messages exhibit permutation-invariance
and symmetry properties. With these two properties, the densities of the
messages in the iterative decoder can be modeled by Gaussian distributions
described by a single parameter. With Gaussian approximation, extrinsic
information transfer (EXIT) charts for our multi-dimensional IRA lattice codes
are developed and used for analyzing the convergence behavior and optimizing

the unrestricted Shannon limit within 0.46 dB and outperform the previously
designed lattice codes with two-dimensional lattice partitions and existing
lattice coding schemes for large codeword length.

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of technology enterprises are adopting cloud-native
architectures to offer their web-based products, by moving away from
privately-owned data-centers and relying exclusively on cloud service
providers. As a result, the cloud vendor industry members have lately
increased, along with the estimated annual revenue they share. However, in the
process of selecting a provider's cloud service over the competition, we
observe a lack of universal common ground in terms of terminology,
functionality of services and billing models. This is an important gap
especially under the new reality of the industry where each cloud provider has
moved towards his own service taxonomy, while the number of specialized
services has grown exponentially. This work discusses cloud services offered by
four dominant, in terms of their current market share, cloud vendors. We
provide a comparison of their services and sub-services, along with a taxonomy
that designates five major service families namely computing, storage,
databases, analytics, and networking. The aim of such clustering is to indicate
similarities, common design approaches and functional differences of the
offered services. The outcomes are essential both for individual researchers,
and bigger enterprises in their attempt to identify the set of cloud services
that will utterly meet their needs without compromises. While we acknowledge
the fact that this is a dynamic industry, where new services arise constantly,
and old ones experience important updates, this study paints a solid image of
the current offerings and gives prominence to the directions that cloud service
providers are following.

 <dc:description>  We study how to find relevant questions in community forums when the language
of the new questions is different from that of the existing questions in the
forum. In particular, we explore the Arabic-English language pair. We compare a
kernel-based system with a feed-forward neural network in a scenario where a
large parallel corpus is available for training a machine translation system,
bilingual dictionaries, and cross-language word embeddings. We observe that
both approaches degrade the performance of the system when working on the
translated text, especially the kernel-based system, which depends heavily on a
syntactic kernel. We address this issue using a cross-language tree kernel,
which compares the original Arabic tree to the English trees of the related
questions. We show that this kernel almost closes the performance gap with
respect to the monolingual system. On the neural network side, we use the
parallel corpus to train cross-language embeddings, which we then use to
represent the Arabic input and the English related questions in the same space.
The results also improve to close to those of the monolingual neural network.
Overall, the kernel system shows a better performance compared to the neural
network in all cases.

 <dc:description>  Internet and the proliferation of smart mobile devices have changed the way
information is created, shared, and spreads, e.g., microblogs such as Twitter,
weblogs such as LiveJournal, social networks such as Facebook, and instant
messengers such as Skype and WhatsApp are now commonly used to share thoughts
and opinions about anything in the surrounding world. This has resulted in the
proliferation of social media content, thus creating new opportunities to study
public opinion at a scale that was never possible before. Naturally, this
abundance of data has quickly attracted business and research interest from
various fields including marketing, political science, and social studies,
among many others, which are interested in questions like these: Do people like
the new Apple Watch? Do Americans support ObamaCare? How do Scottish feel about
the Brexit? Answering these questions requires studying the sentiment of
opinions people express in social media, which has given rise to the fast
growth of the field of sentiment analysis in social media, with Twitter being
especially popular for research due to its scale, representativeness, variety
of topics discussed, as well as ease of public access to its messages. Here we
present an overview of work on sentiment analysis on Twitter.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel approach to Maximum A Posteriori inference based on
discrete graphical models. By utilizing local Wasserstein distances for
coupling assignment measures across edges of the underlying graph, a given
discrete objective function is smoothly approximated and restricted to the
assignment manifold. A corresponding multiplicative update scheme combines in a
single process (i) geometric integration of the resulting Riemannian gradient
flow and (ii) rounding to integral solutions that represent valid labelings.
Throughout this process, local marginalization constraints known from the
established LP relaxation are satisfied, whereas the smooth geometric setting
results in rapidly converging iterations that can be carried out in parallel
for every edge.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we explore the potential of using sentence-level discourse
structure for machine translation evaluation. We first design discourse-aware
similarity measures, which use all-subtree kernels to compare discourse parse
trees in accordance with the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). Then, we show
that a simple linear combination with these measures can help improve various
existing machine translation evaluation metrics regarding correlation with
human judgments both at the segment- and at the system-level. This suggests
that discourse information is complementary to the information used by many of
the existing evaluation metrics, and thus it could be taken into account when
developing richer evaluation metrics, such as the WMT-14 winning combined
metric DiscoTKparty. We also provide a detailed analysis of the relevance of
various discourse elements and relations from the RST parse trees for machine
translation evaluation. In particular we show that: (i) all aspects of the RST
tree are relevant, (ii) nuclearity is more useful than relation type, and (iii)
the similarity of the translation RST tree to the reference tree is positively
correlated with translation quality.

 <dc:description>  In an age where people are becoming increasing likely to trust information
found through online media, journalists have begun employing techniques to lure
readers to articles by using catchy headlines, called clickbait. These
headlines entice the user into clicking through the article whilst not
providing information relevant to the headline itself. Previous methods of
detecting clickbait have explored techniques heavily dependent on feature
engineering, with little experimentation having been tried with neural network
architectures. We introduce a novel model combining recurrent neural networks,
attention layers and image embeddings. Our model uses a combination of
distributed word embeddings derived from unannotated corpora, character level
embeddings calculated through Convolutional Neural Networks. These
representations are passed through a bidirectional LSTM with an attention
layer. The image embeddings are also learnt from large data using CNNs.
Experimental results show that our model achieves an F1 score of 65.37% beating
the previous benchmark of 55.21%.

 <dc:description>  A tree $\sigma$-spanner of a positively real-weighted $n$-vertex and $m$-edge
undirected graph $G$ is a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ which approximately
preserves (i.e., up to a multiplicative stretch factor $\sigma$) distances in
$G$. Tree spanners with provably good stretch factors find applications in
communication networks, distributed systems, and network design. However,
finding an optimal or even a good tree spanner is a very hard computational
task. Thus, if one has to face a transient edge failure in $T$, the overall
effort that has to be afforded to rebuild a new tree spanner (i.e.,
computational costs, set-up of new links, updating of the routing tables, etc.)
can be rather prohibitive. To circumvent this drawback, an effective
alternative is that of associating with each tree edge a best possible (in
terms of resulting stretch) swap edge -- a well-established approach in the
literature for several other tree topologies. Correspondingly, the problem of
computing all the best swap edges of a tree spanner is a challenging
algorithmic problem, since solving it efficiently means to exploit the
structure of shortest paths not only in $G$, but also in all the scenarios in
which an edge of $T$ has failed. For this problem we provide a very efficient
solution, running in $O(n^2 \log^4 n)$ time, which drastically improves (almost
by a quadratic factor in $n$ in dense graphs!) on the previous known best
result.

 <dc:description>  Communication energy in a wireless network of mobile autonomous agents should
be considered as the sum of transmission energy and propulsion energy used to
facilitate the transfer of information. Accordingly, communication-theoretic
and Newtonian dynamic models are developed to model the communication and
locomotion expenditures of each node. These are subsequently used to formulate
a novel nonlinear optimal control problem (OCP) over a network of autonomous
nodes. It is then shown that, under certain conditions, the OCP can be
transformed into an equivalent convex form. Numerical results for a single link
between a node and access point allow for comparison with known solutions
before the framework is applied to a multiple-node UAV network, for which
previous results are not readily extended. Simulations show that transmission
energy can be of the same order of magnitude as propulsion energy allowing for
possible savings, whilst also exemplifying how speed adaptations together with
power control may increase the network throughput.

homes and everyday environments, new interactive capabilities will be required,
as exemplified by the soft design used for Disney's recent robot character
Baymax in popular fiction. Home robots will be required to be easy to interact
with and intelligent--adaptive, fun, unobtrusive and involving little effort to
power and maintain--and capable of carrying out useful tasks both on an
everyday level and during emergencies. The current article adopts an
exploratory medium fidelity prototyping approach for testing some new robotic
capabilities in regard to recognizing people's activities and intentions and
behaving in a way which is transparent to people. Results are discussed with
the aim of informing next designs.

 <dc:description>  It is well documented, and has been the topic of much research, that Computer
Science courses tend to have higher than average drop out rates at third level.
This is a problem that needs to be addressed with urgency but also caution. The
required number of Computer Science graduates is growing every year but the
number of graduates is not meeting this demand and one way that this problem
can be alleviated is to encourage students at an early age towards studying
Computer Science courses.
  This paper presents a systematic literature review on the role of visual and
textual programming languages when learning to program, particularly as a first
programming language. The approach is systematic, in that a structured search
of electronic resources has been conducted, and the results are presented and
quantitatively analysed. This study will give insight into whether or not the
current approaches to teaching young learners programming are viable, and
examines what we can do to increase the interest and retention of these
students as they progress through their education.

 <dc:description>  With an estimated 19 million operations performed annually, cataract surgery
is the most common surgical procedure. This paper investigates the automatic
monitoring of tool usage during a cataract surgery, with potential applications
in report generation, surgical training and real-time decision support. In this
study, tool usage is monitored in videos recorded through the surgical
microscope. Following state-of-the-art video analysis solutions, each frame of
the video is analyzed by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) whose outputs are
fed to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in order to take temporal relationships
between events into account. Novelty lies in the way those CNNs and RNNs are
trained. Computational complexity prevents the end-to-end training of &quot;CNN+RNN&quot;
systems. Therefore, CNNs are usually trained first, independently from the
RNNs. This approach is clearly suboptimal for surgical tool analysis: many
tools are very similar to one another, but they can generally be differentiated
based on past events. CNNs should be trained to extract the most useful visual
features in combination with the temporal context. A novel boosting strategy is
proposed to achieve this goal: the CNN and RNN parts of the system are
simultaneously enriched by progressively adding weak classifiers (either CNNs
or RNNs) trained to improve the overall classification accuracy. Experiments
were performed in a new dataset of 50 cataract surgery videos where the usage
of 21 surgical tools was manually annotated. Very good classification
performance are achieved in this dataset: tool usage could be labeled with an
average area under the ROC curve of $A_z$ = 0.9717 in offline mode (using past,
present and future information) and $A_z$ = 0.9696 in online mode (using past
and present information only).

 <dc:description>  The mining process in blockchain requires solving a proof-of-work puzzle,
which is resource expensive to implement in mobile devices due to the high
computing power and energy needed. In this paper, we, for the first time,
consider edge computing as an enabler for mobile blockchain. In particular, we
study edge computing resource management and pricing to support mobile
blockchain applications in which the mining process of miners can be offloaded
to an edge computing service provider. We formulate a two-stage Stackelberg
game to jointly maximize the profit of the edge computing service provider and
the individual utilities of the miners. In the first stage, the service
provider sets the price of edge computing nodes. In the second stage, the
miners decide on the service demand to purchase based on the observed prices.
We apply the backward induction to analyze the sub-game perfect equilibrium in
each stage for both uniform and discriminatory pricing schemes. For the uniform
pricing where the same price is applied to all miners, the existence and
uniqueness of Stackelberg equilibrium are validated by identifying the best
response strategies of the miners. For the discriminatory pricing where the
different prices are applied to different miners, the Stackelberg equilibrium
is proved to exist and be unique by capitalizing on the Variational Inequality
theory. Further, the real experimental results are employed to justify our
proposed model.

 <dc:description>  The centrality of a vertex v in a network intuitively captures how important
v is for communication in the network. The task of improving the centrality of
a vertex has many applications, as a higher centrality often implies a larger
impact on the network or less transportation or administration cost. In this
work we study the parameterized complexity of the NP-complete problems
Closeness Improvement and Betweenness Improvement in which we ask to improve a
given vertex' closeness or betweenness centrality by a given amount through
adding a given number of edges to the network. Herein, the closeness of a
vertex v sums the multiplicative inverses of distances of other vertices to v
and the betweenness sums for each pair of vertices the fraction of shortest
paths going through v. Unfortunately, for the natural parameter &quot;number of
edges to add&quot; we obtain hardness results, even in rather restricted cases. On
the positive side, we also give an island of tractability for the parameter
measuring the vertex deletion distance to cluster graphs.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of clearing a system of interconnected banks. Prior
work has shown that when banks can only enter into simple debt contracts with
each other, then a clearing vector of payments can be computed in polynomial
time. In this work, we show that the computational complexity of the clearing
problem drastically increases when banks can also enter into credit default
swaps (CDSs), i.e., financial derivative contracts that depend on the default
of another bank. We first show that many important decision problems are
NP-hard once CDSs are allowed. This includes deciding if a specific bank is at
risk of default and deciding if a clearing vector exists in the first place.
Second, we show that computing an approximate solution to the clearing problem
with sufficiently small constant error is PPAD-complete. To prove our results,
we demonstrate how financial networks with debt and CDSs can encode Boolean and
arithmetic operations. Our results have practical importance for network stress
tests and they reveal computational complexity as a new concern regarding the
stability of the financial system.

 <dc:description>  Public space utilization is crucial for urban developers to understand how
efficient a place is being occupied in order to improve existing or future
infrastructures. In a smart cities approach, implementing public space
monitoring with Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensors appear to be a viable
solution. However, choice of sensors often is a challenging problem and often
linked with scalability, coverage, energy consumption, accuracy, and privacy.
To get the most from low cost sensor with aforementioned design in mind, we
proposed data processing modules for capturing public space utilization with
Renewable Wireless Sensor Network (RWSN) platform using pyroelectric infrared
(PIR) and analog sound sensor. We first proposed a calibration process to
remove false alarm of PIR sensor due to the impact of weather and environment.
We then demonstrate how the sounds sensor can be processed to provide various
insight of a public space. Lastly, we fused both sensors and study a particular
public space utilization based on one month data to unveil its usage.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Beamforming in Frequency Selective Massive MIMO Systems: A

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose novel hybrid analog and digital beamforming
techniques for the uplink of massive multiple-input multiple output (MIMO)
systems under frequency-selective and rich scattering propagation conditions.
Considering an L-tap wireless channel, we first derive the closed-forms for
single-carrier L-tap and 1-tap radio frequency (RF) beamformers. Then, we
demonstrate that the proposed beamformers significantly reduce the root mean
square (RMS) delay spread of the effective channel observed at the baseband. We
also provide the analytical expressions for the asymptotic sum-rate and
illustrate that the performance of the proposed beamformers are comparable to
that of digital matched-filtering (MF). Moreover, we evaluate a hybrid
beamforming technique using our proposed single-carrier beamforming methods at
the RF along with a multicarrier technique using zero-forcing (ZF) at the
baseband. Furthermore, we examine the performance of this method for a
subconnected architecture, and with the use of digital phase shifters. Our
simulation results and analysis indicate that single-carrier RF beamforming
with multicarrier baseband techniques is indeed a promising solution for
frequency-selective, rich scattering massive MIMO scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new optimization method for independent low-rank
matrix analysis (ILRMA) based on a parametric majorization-equalization
algorithm. ILRMA is an efficient blind source separation technique that
simultaneously estimates a spatial demixing matrix (spatial model) and the
power spectrograms of each estimated source (source model). In ILRMA, since
both models are alternately optimized by iterative update rules, the difference
in the convergence speeds between these models often results in a poor local
solution. To solve this problem, we introduce a new parameter that controls the
convergence speed of the source model and find the best balance between the
optimizations in the spatial and source models for ILRMA.

 <dc:description>  There have been several spectral bounds for the percolation transition in
networks, using spectrum of matrices associated with the network such as the
adjacency matrix and the non-backtracking matrix. However they are far from
being tight when the network is sparse and displays clustering or transitivity,
which is represented by existence of short loops e.g. triangles. In this work,
for the bond percolation, we first propose a message passing algorithm for
calculating size of percolating clusters considering effects of triangles, then
relate the percolation transition to the leading eigenvalue of a matrix that we
name the triangle-non-backtracking matrix, by analyzing stability of the
message passing equations. We establish that our method gives a tighter
lower-bound to the bond percolation transition than previous spectral bounds,
and it becomes exact for an infinite network with no loops longer than 3. We
evaluate numerically our methods on synthetic and real-world networks, and
discuss further generalizations of our approach to include higher-order
sub-structures.

 <dc:description>  We present GraphMatch, an approximate yet efficient method for building the
matching graph for large-scale structure-from-motion (SfM) pipelines. Unlike
modern SfM pipelines that use vocabulary (Voc.) trees to quickly build the
matching graph and avoid a costly brute-force search of matching image pairs,
GraphMatch does not require an expensive offline pre-processing phase to
construct a Voc. tree. Instead, GraphMatch leverages two priors that can
predict which image pairs are likely to match, thereby making the matching
process for SfM much more efficient. The first is a score computed from the
distance between the Fisher vectors of any two images. The second prior is
based on the graph distance between vertices in the underlying matching graph.
GraphMatch combines these two priors into an iterative &quot;sample-and-propagate&quot;
scheme similar to the PatchMatch algorithm. Its sampling stage uses Fisher
similarity priors to guide the search for matching image pairs, while its
propagation stage explores neighbors of matched pairs to find new ones with a
high image similarity score. Our experiments show that GraphMatch finds the
most image pairs as compared to competing, approximate methods while at the
same time being the most efficient.

 <dc:description>  In some estimation problems, not all the parameters can be identified, which
results in singularity of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). The Cram\'er-Rao
Bound (CRB), which is the inverse of the FIM, is then not defined. To
regularize the estimation problem, one can impose constraints on the parameters
and derive the corresponding CRBs. The correspondence between local
identifiability and FIM regularity is studied here. Furthermore the number of
FIM singularities is shown to be equal to the number of independent constraints
necessary to have a well-defined constrained CRB and local identifiability. In
general, many sets of constraints can render the parameters identifiable,
giving different values for the CRB, that are not always relevant. When the
constraints can be chosen, we propose a constrained CRB, the pseudo-inverse of
the FIM, which gives, for a minimum number of constraints, the lowest bound on
the mean squared estimation error. These results are applied to two approaches
to blind FIR multichannel estimation which allow identification of the channel
up to a scale or phase factor. These two approaches correspond to deterministic
and Gaussian models for the unknown channel inputs. The singularities of the
FIMs and local identifiability are studied and the corresponding constrained
CRBs are derived and interpreted.

 <dc:description>  Radiomics aims to extract and analyze large numbers of quantitative features
from medical images and is highly promising in staging, diagnosing, and
predicting outcomes of cancer treatments. Nevertheless, several challenges need
to be addressed to construct an optimal radiomics predictive model. First, the
predictive performance of the model may be reduced when features extracted from
an individual imaging modality are blindly combined into a single predictive
model. Second, because many different types of classifiers are available to
construct a predictive model, selecting an optimal classifier for a particular
application is still challenging. In this work, we developed multi-modality and
multi-classifier radiomics predictive models that address the aforementioned
issues in currently available models. Specifically, a new reliable classifier
fusion strategy was proposed to optimally combine output from different
modalities and classifiers. In this strategy, modality-specific classifiers
were first trained, and an analytic evidential reasoning (ER) rule was
developed to fuse the output score from each modality to construct an optimal
predictive model. One public data set and two clinical case studies were
performed to validate model performance. The experimental results indicated
that the proposed ER rule based radiomics models outperformed the traditional
models that rely on a single classifier or simply use combined features from
different modalities.

 <dc:description>  The explosion in volume and variety of data offers enormous potential for
research and commercial use. Increased availability of personal data is of
particular interest in enabling highly customised services tuned to individual
needs. Preserving the privacy of individuals against reidentification attacks
in this fast-moving ecosystem poses significant challenges for a one-size fits
all approach to anonymisation.
  In this paper we present ($k$,$\epsilon$)-anonymisation, an approach that
combines the $k$-anonymisation and $\epsilon$-differential privacy models into
a single coherent framework, providing privacy guarantees at least as strong as
those offered by the individual models. Linking risks of less than 5\% are
observed in experimental results, even with modest values of $k$ and
$\epsilon$.
  Our approach is shown to address well-known limitations of $k$-anonymity and
$\epsilon$-differential privacy and is validated in an extensive experimental
campaign using openly available datasets.

 <dc:description>  We present a new oblivious walking strategy for convex subdivisions. Our walk
is faster than the straight walk and more generally applicable than the
visibility walk. To prove termination of our walk we use a novel monotonically

 <dc:description>  We study the computation of approximate pure Nash equilibria in Shapley value
(SV) weighted congestion games, introduced in [19]. This class of games
considers weighted congestion games in which Shapley values are used as an
alternative (to proportional shares) for distributing the total cost of each
resource among its users. We focus on the interesting subclass of such games
with polynomial resource cost functions and present an algorithm that computes
approximate pure Nash equilibria with a polynomial number of strategy updates.
Since computing a single strategy update is hard, we apply sampling techniques
which allow us to achieve polynomial running time. The algorithm builds on the
algorithmic ideas of [7], however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the
first algorithmic result on computation of approximate equilibria using other
than proportional shares as player costs in this setting. We present a novel
relation that approximates the Shapley value of a player by her proportional
share and vice versa. As side results, we upper bound the approximate price of
anarchy of such games and significantly improve the best known factor for
computing approximate pure Nash equilibria in weighted congestion games of [7].

 <dc:description>  Given a matrix, the Null Space Problem asks for a basis of its null space
having the fewest nonzeros. This problem is known to be NP-complete and even
hard to approximate. The null space of a forest is the null space of its
adjacency matrix. Sander and Sander (2005) and Akbari et al. (2006),
independently, proved that the null space of each forest admits a
$\{-1,0,1\}$-basis. We devise an algorithm for determining a sparsest basis of
the null space of any given forest which, in addition, is a $\{-1,0,1\}$-basis.
Our algorithm is time-optimal in the sense that it takes time at most
proportional to the number of nonzeros in any sparsest basis of the null space
of the input forest. Moreover, we show that, given a forest $F$ on $n$
vertices, the set of those vertices $x$ for which there is a vector in the null
space of $F$ that is nonzero at $x$ and the number of nonzeros in any sparsest
basis of the null space of $F$ can be found in $O(n)$ time.

 <dc:description>  Frequency domain analysis of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems in feedback
with static nonlinearities is a classical and fruitful topic of nonlinear
systems theory. We generalize this approach beyond equilibrium stability
analysis with the aim of characterizing feedback systems whose asymptotic
behavior is low dimensional. We illustrate the theory with a generalization of
the circle criterion for the analysis of multistable and oscillatory Lur'e
feedback systems.

 <dc:description>  A cellular automaton is presented whose governing rule is that the Kolmogorov
complexity of a cell's neighborhood may not increase when the cell's present
value is substituted for its future value. Using an approximation of this
two-dimensional Kolmogorov complexity the underlying automaton is shown to be
capable of simulating logic circuits. It is also shown to capture trianry logic
described by a quandle, a non-associative algebraic structure. A similar
automaton whose rule permits at times the increase of a cell's neighborhood
complexity is shown to produce animated entities which can be used as
information carriers akin to gliders in Conway's game of life.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the optimal control problem known as the Linear
Quadratic Regulator in the case when the dynamics are unknown. We propose a
multi-stage procedure, called Coarse-ID control, that estimates a model from a
few experimental trials, estimates the error in that model with respect to the
truth, and then designs a controller using both the model and uncertainty
estimate. Our technique uses contemporary tools from random matrix theory to
bound the error in the estimation procedure. We also employ a recently
developed approach to control synthesis called System Level Synthesis that
enables robust control design by solving a convex optimization problem. We
provide end-to-end bounds on the relative error in control cost that are nearly
optimal in the number of parameters and that highlight salient properties of
the system to be controlled such as closed-loop sensitivity and optimal control
magnitude. We show experimentally that the Coarse-ID approach enables efficient
computation of a stabilizing controller in regimes where simple control schemes
that do not take the model uncertainty into account fail to stabilize the true
system.

 <dc:description>  Low dimensional embeddings that capture the main variations of interest in
collections of data are important for many applications. One way to construct
these embeddings is to acquire estimates of similarity from the crowd. However,
similarity is a multi-dimensional concept that varies from individual to
individual. Existing models for learning embeddings from the crowd typically
make simplifying assumptions such as all individuals estimate similarity using
the same criteria, the list of criteria is known in advance, or that the crowd
workers are not influenced by the data that they see. To overcome these
limitations we introduce Context Embedding Networks (CENs). In addition to
learning interpretable embeddings from images, CENs also model worker biases
for different attributes along with the visual context i.e. the visual
attributes highlighted by a set of images. Experiments on two noisy crowd
annotated datasets show that modeling both worker bias and visual context
results in more interpretable embeddings compared to existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  IQ tests are an accepted method for assessing human intelligence. The tests
consist of several parts that must be solved under a time constraint. Of all
the tested abilities, pattern recognition has been found to have the highest
correlation with general intelligence. This is primarily because pattern
recognition is the ability to find order in a noisy environment, a necessary
skill for intelligent agents. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN) model for solving geometric pattern recognition problems. The CNN
receives as input multiple ordered input images and outputs the next image
according to the pattern. Our CNN is able to solve problems involving rotation,
reflection, color, size and shape patterns and score within the top 5% of human
performance.

 <dc:description>  We present a deep neural network for a model-free prediction of a chaotic
dynamical system from noisy observations. The proposed deep learning model aims
to predict the conditional probability distribution of a state variable. The
Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) is employed to model the nonlinear
dynamics and a softmax layer is used to approximate a probability distribution.
The LSTM model is trained by minimizing a regularized cross-entropy function.
The LSTM model is validated against delay-time chaotic dynamical systems,
Mackey-Glass and Ikeda equations. It is shown that the present LSTM makes a
good prediction of the nonlinear dynamics by effectively filtering out the
noise. It is found that the prediction uncertainty of a multiple-step forecast
of the LSTM model is not a monotonic function of time; the predicted standard
deviation may increase or decrease dynamically in time.

 <dc:description>  Traffic flow prediction is an important research issue to avoid traffic
congestion in transportation systems. Traffic congestion avoiding can be
achieved by knowing traffic flow and then conducting transportation planning.
Achieving traffic flow prediction is challenging as the prediction is affected
by many complex factors such as inter-region traffic, vehicles' relations, and
sudden events. However, as the mobile data of vehicles has been widely
collected by sensor-embedded devices in transportation systems, it is possible
to predict the traffic flow by analysing mobile data. This study proposes a
deep learning based prediction algorithm, DeepTFP, to collectively predict the
traffic flow on each and every traffic road of a city. This algorithm uses
three deep residual neural networks to model temporal closeness, period, and
trend properties of traffic flow. Each residual neural network consists of a
branch of residual convolutional units. DeepTFP aggregates the outputs of the
three residual neural networks to optimize the parameters of a time series
prediction model. Contrast experiments on mobile time series data from the
transportation system of England demonstrate that the proposed DeepTFP
outperforms the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture based method in
prediction accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Radiation source detection has seen various applications in the past decade,
ranging from the detection of dirty bombs in public places to scanning critical
nuclear facilities for leakage or flaws, and in the autonomous inspection of
nuclear sites. Despite the success in detecting single point sources or a small
number of spatially separated point sources, most of the existing algorithms
fail to localize sources in complex scenarios with a large number of point
sources or non-trivial distributions &amp; bulk sources. Even in simpler
environments, most existing algorithms are not scalable to larger regions
and/or higher dimensional spaces. For effective autonomous inspection, we not
only need to estimate the positions of the sources, but also the number,
distribution, and intensities of each of them. In this paper, we present a
novel algorithm for the robust localization of an arbitrary distribution of
radiation sources using multi-layer sequential Monte Carlo methods coupled with
suitable clustering algorithms. We achieve near-perfect accuracy, in terms of
F1-scores (&gt; 0.95), while allowing the algorithm to scale, both to large
regions in space and to higher dimensional spaces (5 tested).

 <dc:title>Detecting LTE-U Duty Cycling Misbehavior for Fair Sharing with Wi-Fi in

 <dc:description>  Coexistence of Wi-Fi and LTE Unlicensed (LTE-U) in shared or unlicensed bands
has drawn growing attention from both academia and industry. An important
consideration is fairness between Wi-Fi and duty cycled LTE-U, which is often
defined in terms of channel access time, as adopted by the LTE-U Forum. Despite
many studies on duty cycle adaptation design for fair sharing, one crucial fact
has often been neglected: LTE-U systems unilaterally control LTE-U duty cycles;
hence, as self- interested users, they have incentives to misbehave, e.g.,
transmitting with a larger duty cycle that exceeds a given limit, so as to gain
a greater share in channel access time and throughput. In this paper, we
propose a scheme that allows the spectrum manager managing the shared bands to
estimate the duty cycle of a target LTE-U cell based on PHY layer observations
from a nearby Wi-Fi AP, without interrupting normal Wi-Fi operations. We
further propose a thresholding scheme to detect duty cycling misbehavior (i.e.,
determining if the duty cycle exceeds the assigned limit), and analyze its
performance in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities. The proposed
schemes are implemented in ns3 and evaluated with extensive simulations. Our
results show that the proposed scheme provides an estimate within +/- 1% of the
true duty cycle, and detects misbehavior with a duty cycle 2.8% higher than the
limit with a detection probability of at least 95%, while keeping the false
alarm probability less than or equal to 1%.

 <dc:description>  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema are common complications
of diabetes which can lead to vision loss. The grading of DR is a fairly
complex process that requires the detection of fine features such as
microaneurysms, intraretinal hemorrhages, and intraretinal microvascular
abnormalities. Because of this, there can be a fair amount of grader
variability. There are different methods of obtaining the reference standard
and resolving disagreements between graders, and while it is usually accepted
that adjudication until full consensus will yield the best reference standard,
the difference between various methods of resolving disagreements has not been
examined extensively. In this study, we examine the variability in different
methods of grading, definitions of reference standards, and their effects on
building deep learning models for the detection of diabetic eye disease. We
find that a small set of adjudicated DR grades allows substantial improvements
in algorithm performance. The resulting algorithm's performance was on par with
that of individual U.S. board-certified ophthalmologists and retinal
specialists.

 <dc:title>Note on &quot;The Complexity of Counting Surjective Homomorphisms and
  Compactions&quot;</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dell, Holger</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Focke, Goldberg, and \v{Z}ivn\'y (arXiv 2017) prove a complexity dichotomy
for the problem of counting surjective homomorphisms from a large input graph G
without loops to a fixed graph H that may have loops. In this note, we give a
short proof of a weaker result: Namely, we only prove the #P-hardness of the
more general problem in which G may have loops. Our proof is an application of
a powerful framework of Lov\'asz (2012), and it is analogous to proofs of
Curticapean, Dell, and Marx (STOC 2017) who studied the &quot;dual&quot; problem in which
the pattern graph G is small and the host graph H is the input. Independently,
Chen (arXiv 2017) used Lov\'asz's framework to prove a complexity dichotomy for
counting surjective homomorphisms to fixed finite structures.

 <dc:title>Determining Impact of Social Media Badges through Joint Clustering of
  Temporal Traces and User Features</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kusmierczyk, Tomasz</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Badges are a common, and sometimes the only, method of incentivizing users to
perform certain actions on online sites. However, due to many competing factors
influencing user temporal dynamics, it is difficult to determine whether the
badge had (or will have) the intended effect or not.
  In this paper, we introduce two complementary approaches for determining
badge influence on users. In the first one, we cluster users' temporal traces
(represented with point processes) and apply covariates (user features) to
regularize results. In the second approach, we first classify users' temporal
traces with a novel statistical framework, and then we refine the
classification results with a semi-supervised clustering of covariates.
  Outcomes obtained from an evaluation on synthetic datasets and experiments on
two badges from a popular Q&amp;A platform confirm that it is possible to validate,
characterize and to some extent predict users affected by the badge.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new Koopman operator approach to the decomposition
of nonlinear dynamical systems using Koopman Gramians. We introduce the notion
of an input-Koopman operator, and show how input-Koopman operators can be used
to cast a nonlinear system into the classical state-space form, and identify
conditions under which input and state observable functions are well separated.
We then extend an existing method of dynamic mode decomposition for learning
Koopman operators from data known as deep dynamic mode decomposition to systems
with controls or disturbances. We illustrate the accuracy of the method in
learning an input-state separable Koopman operator for an example system, even
when the underlying system exhibits mixed state-input terms. We next introduce
a nonlinear decomposition algorithm, based on Koopman Gramians, that maximizes
internal subsystem observability and disturbance rejection from unwanted noise
from other subsystems. We derive a relaxation based on Koopman Gramians and
multi-way partitioning for the resulting NP-hard decomposition problem. We
lastly illustrate the proposed algorithm with the swing dynamics for an IEEE
39-bus system.

 <dc:description>  High-dimensional systems that have a low-dimensional dominant behavior allow
for model reduction and simplified analysis. We use differential analysis to
formalize this important concept in a nonlinear setting. We show that dominance
can be studied through linear dissipation inequalities and an interconnection
theory that closely mimics the classical analysis of stability by means of
dissipativity theory. In this approach, stability is seen as the limiting
situation where the dominant behavior is 0-dimensional. The generalization
opens novel tractable avenues to study multistability through 1-dominance and
limit cycle oscillations through 2-dominance.

 <dc:description>  We study Ollivier-Ricci curvature, a discrete version of Ricci curvature,
which has gained popularity over the past several years and has found
applications in diverse fields. However, the Ollivier-Ricci curvature requires
an optimal mass transport problem to be solved, which can be computationally
expensive for large networks. In view of this, we propose two alternative
measures of curvature to Ollivier-Ricci which are motivated by the Jaccard
coefficient and are demonstrably less computationally intensive, a cheaper
Jaccard (JC) and a more expensive generalized Jaccard (gJC) curvature metric.
We show theoretically that the gJC closely matches the Ollivier-Ricci curvature
for Erdos-Renyi graphs in the asymptotic regime of large networks. Furthermore,
we study the goodness of approximation between the proposed curvature metrics
and Ollivier-Ricci curvature for several network models and real networks. Our
results suggest that in comparison to an alternative curvature metric for
graphs, the Forman-Ricci curvature, the gJC exhibits a reasonably good fit to
the Ollivier-Ricci curvature for a wide range of networks, while the JC is
shown to be a good proxy only for certain scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are increasingly being used in a variety of machine
learning applications applied to rich user data on the cloud. However, this
approach introduces a number of privacy and efficiency challenges, as the cloud
operator can perform secondary inferences on the available data. Recently,
advances in edge processing have paved the way for more efficient, and private,
data processing at the source for simple tasks and lighter models, though they
remain a challenge for larger, and more complicated models. In this paper, we
present a hybrid approach for breaking down large, complex deep models for
cooperative, privacy-preserving analytics. We do this by breaking down the
popular deep architectures and fine-tune them in a particular way. We then
evaluate the privacy benefits of this approach based on the information exposed
to the cloud service. We also asses the local inference cost of different
layers on a modern handset for mobile applications. Our evaluations show that
by using certain kind of fine-tuning and embedding techniques and at a small
processing costs, we can greatly reduce the level of information available to
unintended tasks applied to the data feature on the cloud, and hence achieving
the desired tradeoff between privacy and performance.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel framework for the discretisation of multi-label problems
on arbitrary, continuous domains. Our work bridges the gap between general FEM
discretisations, and labeling problems that arise in a variety of computer
vision tasks, including for instance those derived from the generalised Potts
model. Starting from the popular formulation of labeling as a convex relaxation
by functional lifting, we show that FEM discretisation is valid for the most
general case, where the regulariser is anisotropic and non-metric. While our
findings are generic and applicable to different vision problems, we
demonstrate their practical implementation in the context of semantic 3D
reconstruction, where such regularisers have proved particularly beneficial.
The proposed FEM approach leads to a smaller memory footprint as well as faster
computation, and it constitutes a very simple way to enable variable, adaptive
resolution within the same model.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of distributed medium access control in a
time slotted wireless multiple access network with an unknown finite number of
homogeneous users. Assume that each user has a single transmission option. In
each time slot, a user chooses either to idle or to transmit a packet. Under a
general channel model, a distributed medium access control framework is
proposed to adapt transmission probabilities of all users to a value that is
near optimal with respect to a predetermined symmetric network utility.
Probability target of each user in the proposed algorithm is calculated based
upon a channel contention measure, which is defined as the conditional success
probability of a virtual packet. It is shown that the proposed algorithm falls
into the classical stochastic approximation framework with guaranteed
convergence when the contention measure can be directly obtained from the
receiver. On the other hand, computer simulations show that, when the
contention measure is not directly available, a revised medium access control
algorithm can still be developed to help the system converging to the same
desired equilibrium.

 <dc:description>  Purpose: Design of a preconditioner for fast and efficient parallel imaging
and compressed sensing reconstructions. Theory: Parallel imaging and compressed
sensing reconstructions become time consuming when the problem size or the
number of coils is large, due to the large linear system of equations that has
to be solved in l_1 and l_2-norm based reconstruction algorithms. Such linear
systems can be solved efficiently using effective preconditioning techniques.
Methods: In this paper we construct such a preconditioner by approximating the
system matrix of the linear system, which comprises the data fidelity and
includes total variation and wavelet regularization, by a matrix with the
assumption that is a block circulant matrix with circulant blocks. Due to its
circulant structure, the preconditioner can be constructed quickly and its
inverse can be evaluated fast using only two fast Fourier transformations. We
test the performance of the preconditioner for the conjugate gradient method as
the linear solver, integrated into the Split Bregman algorithm. Results: The
designed circulant preconditioner reduces the number of iterations required in
the conjugate gradient method by almost a factor of~5. The speed up results in
a total acceleration factor of approximately 2.5 for the entire reconstruction
algorithm when implemented in MATLAB, while the initialization time of the
preconditioner is negligible. Conclusion: The proposed preconditioner reduces
the reconstruction time for parallel imaging and compressed sensing in a Split
Bregman implementation and can easily handle large systems since it is
Fourier-based, allowing for efficient computations.

 <dc:description>  Extracting, harvesting and building large-scale annotated radiological image
datasets is a greatly important yet challenging problem. It is also the
bottleneck to designing more effective data-hungry computing paradigms (e.g.,
deep learning) for medical image analysis. Yet, vast amounts of clinical
annotations (usually associated with disease image findings and marked using
arrows, lines, lesion diameters, segmentation, etc.) have been collected over
several decades and stored in hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication
Systems. In this paper, we mine and harvest one major type of clinical
annotation data - lesion diameters annotated on bookmarked images - to learn an
effective multi-class lesion detector via unsupervised and supervised deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our dataset is composed of 33,688
bookmarked radiology images from 10,825 studies of 4,477 unique patients. For
every bookmarked image, a bounding box is created to cover the target lesion
based on its measured diameters. We categorize the collection of lesions using
an unsupervised deep mining scheme to generate clustered pseudo lesion labels.
Next, we adopt a regional-CNN method to detect lesions of multiple categories,
regardless of missing annotations (normally only one lesion is annotated,
despite the presence of multiple co-existing findings). Our integrated mining,
categorization and detection framework is validated with promising empirical
results, as a scalable, universal or multi-purpose CAD paradigm built upon
abundant retrospective medical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that detection
accuracy can be significantly improved by incorporating pseudo lesion labels
(e.g., Liver lesion/tumor, Lung nodule/tumor, Abdomen lesions, Chest lymph node
and others). This dataset will be made publicly available (under the open
science initiative).

 <dc:description>  Delay and sum (DAS) is the most common beamforming algorithm in linear-array
photoacoustic imaging (PAI) as a result of its simple implementation. However,
it leads to a low resolution and high sidelobes. Delay multiply and sum (DMAS)
was used to address the incapabilities of DAS, providing a higher image
quality. However, the resolution improvement is not well enough compared to
eigenspace-based minimum variance (EIBMV). In this paper, the EIBMV beamformer
has been combined with DMAS algebra, called EIBMV-DMAS, using the expansion of
DMAS algorithm. The proposed method is used as the reconstruction algorithm in
linear-array PAI. EIBMV-DMAS is experimentally evaluated where the quantitative
and qualitative results show that it outperforms DAS, DMAS and EIBMV. The
proposed method degrades the sidelobes for about 365 %, 221 % and 40 %,
compared to DAS, DMAS and EIBMV, respectively. Moreover, EIBMV-DMAS improves
the SNR about 158 %, 63 % and 20 %, respectively.

 <dc:title>CELIO: An application development framework for interactive spaces</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shrinivasan, Yedendra B.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Yunfeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Developing applications for interactive space is different from developing
cross-platform applications for personal computing. Input, output, and
architectural variations in each interactive space introduce big overhead in
terms of cost and time for developing, deploying and maintaining applications
for interactive spaces. Often, these applications become on-off experience tied
to the deployed spaces. To alleviate this problem and enable rapid responsive
space design applications similar to responsive web design, we present CELIO
application development framework for interactive spaces. The framework is
micro services based and neatly decouples application and design specifications
from hardware and architecture specifications of an interactive space. In this
paper, we describe this framework and its implementation details. Also, we
briefly discuss the use cases developed using this framework.

 <dc:title>Combining absolute and relative pointing for fast and accurate distant
  interaction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Yunfeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Traditional relative pointing devices such as mice and trackpads are
unsuitable for pointing at distant displays, because they encumber the users by
requiring either a flat surface to operate on or being held by two hands. Past
research has examined many new pointing methods, but few could surpass the
speed and accuracy of mice and trackpads. This paper introduces a new pointing
system that is developed based on HTC Vive, a relatively low-cost virtual
reality system, and proposes two methods of combining absolute and relative
pointing. The proposed methods were compared against single-mode pointing
methods (i.e., pure absolute pointing and pure relative pointing) in a Fitts'
law study. The results show that with only a short period of practice, one
hybrid pointing technique enabled faster and more accurate pointing than both
single-mode pointing techniques, which included a trackpad.

 <dc:description>  We present DepCC, the largest to date linguistically analyzed corpus in
English including 365 million documents, composed of 252 billion tokens and 7.5
billion of named entity occurrences in 14.3 billion sentences from a web-scale
crawl of the CommonCrawl project. The sentences are processed with a dependency
parser and with a named entity tagger and contain provenance information,
enabling various applications ranging from training syntax-based word
embeddings based on to open information extraction and question answering. We
demonstrate the utility of this corpus on the verb similarity task by showing
that a distributional model trained on our corpus yields better results than
models trained on smaller corpora, like Wikipedia. This distributional model
outperforms the state of art models of verb similarity trained on smaller
corpora on the SimVerb3500 dataset.

 <dc:description>  Selfish Network Creation focuses on modeling real world networks from a
game-theoretic point of view. One of the classic models by Fabrikant et al.
[PODC'03] is the network creation game, where agents correspond to nodes in a
network which buy incident edges for the price of $\alpha$ per edge to minimize
their total distance to all other nodes. The model is well-studied but still
has intriguing open problems. The most famous conjectures state that the price
of anarchy is constant for all $\alpha$ and that for $\alpha \geq n$ all
equilibrium networks are trees.
  We introduce a novel technique for analyzing stable networks for high
edge-price $\alpha$ and employ it to improve on the best known bounds for both
conjectures. In particular we show that for $\alpha &gt; 4n-13$ all equilibrium
networks must be trees, which implies a constant price of anarchy for this
range of $\alpha$. Moreover, we also improve the constant upper bound on the
price of anarchy for equilibrium trees.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) has recently achieved impressive results. A
potential problem of the existing NMT algorithm, however, is that the decoding
is conducted from left to right, without considering the right context. This
paper proposes an two-stage approach to solve the problem. In the first stage,
a conventional attention-based NMT system is used to produce a draft
translation, and in the second stage, a novel double-attention NMT system is
used to refine the translation, by looking at the original input as well as the
draft translation. This drafting-and-refinement can obtain the right-context
information from the draft, hence producing more consistent translations. We
evaluated this approach using two Chinese-English translation tasks, one with
44k pairs and 1M pairs respectively. The experiments showed that our approach
achieved positive improvements over the conventional NMT system: the
improvements are 2.4 and 0.9 BLEU points on the small-scale and large-scale
tasks, respectively.

 <dc:title>A Comparative Analysis of Materialized Views Selection and Concurrency
  Control Mechanisms in NoSQL Databases</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Increasing resource demands require relational databases to scale. While
relational databases are well suited for vertical scaling, specialized hardware
can be expensive. Conversely, emerging NewSQL and NoSQL data stores are
designed to scale horizontally. NewSQL databases provide ACID transaction
support; however, joins are limited to the partition keys, resulting in
restricted query expressiveness. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are
designed to scale out linearly on commodity hardware; however, they are limited
by slow join performance. Hence, we consider if the NoSQL join performance can
be improved while ensuring ACID semantics and without drastically sacrificing
write performance, disk utilization and query expressiveness.
  This paper presents the Synergy system that leverages schema and workload
driven mechanism to identify materialized views and a specialized concurrency
control system on top of a NoSQL database to enable scalable data management
with familiar relational conventions. Synergy trades slight write performance
degradation and increased disk utilization for faster join performance
(compared to standard NoSQL databases) and improved query expressiveness
(compared to NewSQL databases). Experimental results using the TPC-W benchmark
show that, for a database populated with 1M customers, the Synergy system
exhibits a maximum performance improvement of 80.5% as compared to other
evaluated systems.

 <dc:description>  Mobile devices use language models to suggest words and phrases for use in
text entry. Traditional language models are based on contextual word frequency
in a static corpus of text. However, certain types of phrases, when offered to
writers as suggestions, may be systematically chosen more often than their
frequency would predict. In this paper, we propose the task of generating
suggestions that writers accept, a related but distinct task to making accurate
predictions. Although this task is fundamentally interactive, we propose a
counterfactual setting that permits offline training and evaluation. We find
that even a simple language model can capture text characteristics that improve
acceptability.

 <dc:description>  Energy is often the most constrained resource in networks of battery-powered
devices, and as devices become smaller, they spend a larger fraction of their
energy on communication (transceiver usage) not computation. As an imperfect
proxy for true energy usage, we define energy complexity to be the number of
time slots a device transmits/listens; idle time and computation are free.
  In this paper we investigate the energy complexity of fundamental
communication primitives such as broadcast in multi-hop radio networks. We
consider models with collision detection (CD) and without (No-CD), as well as
both randomized and deterministic algorithms. Some take-away messages from this
work include:
  1. The energy complexity of broadcast in a multi-hop network is intimately
connected to the time complexity of leader election in a single-hop (clique)
network. Many existing lower bounds on time complexity immediately transfer to
energy complexity. For example, in the CD and No-CD models, we need
$\Omega(\log n)$ and $\Omega(\log^2 n)$ energy, respectively.
  2. The energy lower bounds above can almost be achieved, given sufficient
($\Omega(n)$) time. In the CD and No-CD models we can solve broadcast using
$O(\frac{\log n\log\log n}{\log\log\log n})$ energy and $O(\log^3 n)$ energy,
respectively.
  3. The complexity measures of Energy and Time are in conflict, and it is an
open problem whether both can be minimized simultaneously. We give a tradeoff
showing it is possible to be nearly optimal in both measures simultaneously.
For any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, broadcast can be solved in
$O(D^{1+\epsilon}\log^{O(1/\epsilon)} n)$ time with $O(\log^{O(1/\epsilon)} n)$
energy, where $D$ is the diameter of the network.

 <dc:description>  Smart city vision brings emerging heterogeneous communication technologies
such as Fog Computing (FC) together to substantially reduce the latency and
energy consumption of Internet of Everything (IoE) devices running various
applications. The key feature that distinguishes the FC paradigm for smart
cities is that it spreads communication and computing resources over the
wired/wireless access network (e.g., proximate access points and base stations)
to provide resource augmentation (e.g., cyberforaging) for resource and
energy-limited wired/wireless (possibly mobile) things. Moreover, smart city
applications are developed with the goal of improving the management of urban
flows and allowing real-time responses to challenges that can arise in users'
transactional relationships. This article presents a Fog-supported smart city
network architecture called Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN), a
multi-tier structure in which the applications running on things jointly
compute, route, and communicate with one another through the smart city
environment to decrease latency and improve energy provisioning and the
efficiency of services among things with different capabilities. An important
concern that arises with the introduction of FOCAN is the need to avoid
transferring data to/from distant things and instead to cover the nearest
region for an IoT application. We define three types of communications between
FOCAN devices (e.g., interprimary, primary, and secondary communication) to
manage applications in a way that meets the quality of service standards for
the IoE. One of the main advantages of FOCAN is that the devices can provide
the services with low energy usage and in an efficient manner. Simulation
results for a selected case study demonstrate the tremendous impact of the
FOCAN energy-efficient solution on the communication performance of various
types of things in smart cities.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an automatic system for the analysis and labeling
of structural scenes, floor plan drawings in Computer-aided Design (CAD)
format. The proposed system applies a fusion strategy to detect and recognize
various components of CAD floor plans, such as walls, doors, windows and other
ambiguous assets. Technically, a general rule-based filter parsing method is
fist adopted to extract effective information from the original floor plan.
Then, an image-processing based recovery method is employed to correct
information extracted in the first step. Our proposed method is fully automatic
and real-time. Such analysis system provides high accuracy and is also
evaluated on a public website that, on average, archives more than ten
thousands effective uses per day and reaches a relatively high satisfaction
rate.

 <dc:description>  A set of general allometric scaling laws is derived for different systems
represented by tree networks. The formulation postulates self-similar networks
with an arbitrary number of branches developed in each generation, and with an
inhomogeneous structure given by a fractal relation between successive
generations. Three idealized examples are considered: networks of masses,
electric resistors, and elastic springs, which obey a specific recurrence
relation between generations. The results can be generalized to networks made
with different elements obeying equivalent relations. The equivalent values of
the networks (total mass, resistance and elastic coefficient) are compared with
their corresponding spatial scales (length, cross-section and volume) in order
to derive allometric scaling laws. Under appropriate fractal-like
approximations of the length and cross-section of the branches, some allometric
exponents reported in the literature are recovered (for instance, the 3/4-law
of metabolism in biological organisms or the hydraulic conductivity scaling in
porous networks). The formulation allows different choices of the fractal
parameters, thus enabling the derivation of new power-laws not reported before.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents our latest investigations on different features for
factored language models for Code-Switching speech and their effect on
automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. We focus on syntactic and
semantic features which can be extracted from Code-Switching text data and
integrate them into factored language models. Different possible factors, such
as words, part-of-speech tags, Brown word clusters, open class words and
clusters of open class word embeddings are explored. The experimental results
reveal that Brown word clusters, part-of-speech tags and open-class words are
the most effective at reducing the perplexity of factored language models on
the Mandarin-English Code-Switching corpus SEAME. In ASR experiments, the model
containing Brown word clusters and part-of-speech tags and the model also
including clusters of open class word embeddings yield the best mixed error
rate results. In summary, the best language model can significantly reduce the
perplexity on the SEAME evaluation set by up to 10.8% relative and the mixed
error rate by up to 3.4% relative.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we propose a novel robot learning framework called Neural Task
Programming (NTP), which bridges the idea of few-shot learning from
demonstration and neural program induction. NTP takes as input a task
specification (e.g., video demonstration of a task) and recursively decomposes
it into finer sub-task specifications. These specifications are fed to a
hierarchical neural program, where bottom-level programs are callable
subroutines that interact with the environment. We validate our method in three
robot manipulation tasks. NTP achieves strong generalization across sequential
tasks that exhibit hierarchal and compositional structures. The experimental
results show that NTP learns to generalize well to- wards unseen tasks with
increasing lengths, variable topologies, and changing objectives.

 <dc:title>Source Coding Optimization for Distributed Average Consensus</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pilgrim, Ryan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Consensus is a common method for computing a function of the data distributed
among the nodes of a network. Of particular interest is distributed average
consensus, whereby the nodes iteratively compute the sample average of the data
stored at all the nodes of the network using only near-neighbor communications.
In real-world scenarios, these communications must undergo quantization, which
introduces distortion to the internode messages. In this thesis, a model for
the evolution of the network state statistics at each iteration is developed
under the assumptions of Gaussian data and additive quantization error. It is
shown that minimization of the communication load in terms of aggregate source
coding rate can be posed as a generalized geometric program, for which an
equivalent convex optimization can efficiently solve for the global minimum.
Optimization procedures are developed for rate-distortion-optimal vector
quantization, uniform entropy-coded scalar quantization, and fixed-rate uniform
quantization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance of these
approaches. For small numbers of iterations, the fixed-rate optimizations are
verified using exhaustive search. Comparison to the prior art suggests
competitive performance under certain circumstances but strongly motivates the
incorporation of more sophisticated coding strategies, such as differential,
predictive, or Wyner-Ziv coding.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we explore an efficient variant of convolutional sparse coding
with unit norm code vectors where reconstruction quality is evaluated using an
inner product (cosine distance). To use these codes for discriminative
classification, we describe a model we term Energy-Based Spherical Sparse

stacking this encoder to make a deep layered model for image classification.

 <dc:description>  A problem of classification of local field potentials (LFPs), recorded from
the prefrontal cortex of a macaque monkey, is considered. An adult macaque
monkey is trained to perform a memory-based saccade. The objective is to decode
the eye movement goals from the LFP collected during a memory period. The LFP
classification problem is modeled as that of classification of smooth functions
embedded in Gaussian noise. It is then argued that using minimax function
estimators as features would lead to consistent LFP classifiers. The theory of
Gaussian sequence models allows us to represent minimax estimators as finite
dimensional objects. The LFP classifier resulting from this mathematical
endeavor is a spectrum based technique, where Fourier series coefficients of
the LFP data, followed by appropriate shrinkage and thresholding, are used as
features in a linear discriminant classifier. The classifier is then applied to
the LFP data to achieve high decoding accuracy. The function classification
approach taken in the paper also provides a systematic justification for using
Fourier series, with shrinkage and thresholding, as features for the problem,
as opposed to using the power spectrum. It also suggests that phase information
is crucial to the decision making.

 <dc:description>  A key challenge in the legal domain is the adaptation and representation of
the legal knowledge expressed through texts, in order for legal practitioners
and researchers to access this information easier and faster to help with
compliance related issues. One way to approach this goal is in the form of a
taxonomy of legal concepts. While this task usually requires a manual
construction of terms and their relations by domain experts, this paper
describes a methodology to automatically generate a taxonomy of legal noun
concepts. We apply and compare two approaches on a corpus consisting of
statutory instruments for UK, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland laws.

 <dc:title>Track Xplorer: A System for Visual Analysis of Sensor-based Motor
  Activity Predictions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Detecting motor activities from sensor datasets is becoming increasingly
common in a wide range of applications with the rapid commoditization of
wearable sensors. To detect activities, data scientists iteratively experiment
with different classifiers before deciding on a single model. Evaluating,
comparing, and reasoning about prediction results of alternative classifiers is
a crucial step in the process of iterative model development. However, standard
aggregate performance metrics (such as accuracy score) and textual display of
individual event sequences have limited granularity and scalability to
effectively perform this critical step.
  To ameliorate these limitations, we introduce Track Xplorer, an interactive
visualization system to query, analyze and compare the classification output of
activity detection in multi-sensor data. Track Xplorer visualizes the results
of different classifiers as well as the ground truth labels and the video of
activities as temporally-aligned linear tracks. Through coordinated track
visualizations, Track Xplorer enables users to interactively explore and
compare the results of different classifiers, assess their accuracy with
respect to the ground truth labels and video. Users can brush arbitrary regions
of any classifier track, zoom in and out with ease, and playback the
corresponding video segment to contextualize the performance of the classifier
within the selected region.
  Track Xplorer also contributes an algebra over track representations to
filter, compose, and compare classification outputs, enabling users to
effectively reason about the performance of classifiers. We demonstrate how our
tool helps data scientists debug misclassifications and improve the prediction
performance in developing activity classifiers for real-world, multi-sensor
data gathered from Parkinson's patients.

 <dc:description>  We introduce, and investigate the properties of, the family of quantum

the reflexive noncommutative Orlicz spaces over semi-finite W*-algebras and
noncommutative Lp spaces over any W*-algebras providing two important

 <dc:description>  Although reliable long precision floating-point arithmetic libraries such as
QD and MPFR/GMP are necessary to solve ill-conditioned problems in numerical
simulation, long precision BLAS-level computation such as matrix multiplication
has not been fully optimized because tuning costs are very high compared to
IEEE float and double precision arithmetic. In this study, we develop a
technique to shorten this tuning time by using prediction of computational
times in several block sizes for the blocking algorithm, and then selecting the
fastest matrix multiplication method for tuning multiple precision dense real
matrix multiplication in various precisions, matrix sizes, and degrees of
parallelization.

robot to autonomously deploy passive structures to reach otherwise-inaccessible
regions of the environment to accomplish high-level tasks. An environment
characterization algorithm identifies features in the environment that can be
augmented to create a path between two disconnected regions of the environment.
Specially-designed building blocks enable the robot to create structures that
can augment the identified features to expand the reachable space of the robot.
A high-level planner reasons about the high-level task, robot locomotion
capabilities, and the environment to decide if and where to augment the
environment in order to perform the desired task. These autonomous,
perception-driven augmentation tools extend the adaptive capabilities of
modular robot systems.

 <dc:description>  Identification of the parameters of stable linear dynamical systems is a
well-studied problem in the literature, both in the low and high-dimensional
settings. However, there are hardly any results for the unstable case,
especially regarding finite time bounds. For this setting, classical results on
least-squares estimation of the dynamics parameters are not applicable and
therefore new concepts and technical approaches need to be developed to address
the issue. Unstable linear systems reflect key real applications in control
theory, econometrics, and finance.
  This study establishes finite time bounds for the identification error of the
least-squares estimates for a fairly large class of heavy-tailed noise
distributions, and transition matrices of such systems. The results relate the
time length required as a function of the problem dimension and key
characteristics of the true underlying transition matrix and the noise
distribution. To obtain them, appropriate concentration inequalities for random
matrices and for sequences of martingale differences are leveraged.

 <dc:title>InfiniViz: Interactive Visual Exploration using Progressive Bin
  Refinement</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Interactive visualizations can accelerate the data analysis loop through
near-instantaneous feedback. To achieve interactivity, techniques such as data
cubes and sampling are typically employed. While data cubes can speedup
querying for moderate-sized datasets, they are ineffective at doing so at a
larger scales due to the size of the materialized data cubes. On the other
hand, while sampling can help scale to large datasets, it adds sampling error
and the associated issues into the process.
  While increasing accuracy by looking at more data may sometimes be valuable,
providing result minutiae might not be necessary if they do not impart
additional significant information. Indeed, such details not only incur a
higher \emph{computational} cost, but also tax the \emph{cognitive} load of the
analyst with worthless trivia. To reduce both the computational and cognitive
expenses, we introduce \emph{InfiniViz}. Through a novel result
refinement-based querying paradigm, \emph{InfiniViz} provides error-free
results for large datasets by increasing bin resolutions progressively over
time. Through real and simulated workloads over real and benchmark datasets, we
evaluate and demonstrate \emph{InfiniViz}'s utility at reducing both cognitive
and computational costs, while minimizing information loss.

 <dc:title>Improved Schemes for Asymptotically Optimal Repair of MDS Codes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chowdhury, Ameera</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Vardy, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An $(n,k,l)$ MDS code of length $n$, dimension $k$, and sub-packetization $l$
over a finite field $F$ is a set of $n$ symbol vectors of length $l$ over $F$
with the property that any $k$ vectors can recover the entire data of $kl$
symbols. When a node fails, we can recover it by downloading symbols from the
surviving nodes, and the total number of symbols downloaded in the worst case
is the repair bandwidth of the code. By the cut-set bound, the repair bandwidth
of an $(n,k,l)$ MDS code is at least $(n-1)l/(n-k)$.
  There are several constructions of $(n,k,l)$ MDS codes whose repair
bandwidths meet or asymptotically meet the cut-set bound. Letting $r=n-k$
denote the number of parities, Ye and Barg constructed $(n,k,r^{n})$
Reed--Solomon codes that asymptotically meet the cut-set bound. Ye and Barg
also constructed optimal bandwidth and optimal update $(n,k,r^{n})$ MDS codes.
A key idea in these constructions is to expand integers in base $r$.
  We show in this paper that, when $r$ is an integral power, we can
significantly reduce the sub-packetization of Ye's and Barg's constructions
while achieving asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth. As an example, when $r
= 2^m$, we achieve the sub-packetization of $2^{m+n-1}$, which improves upon
the sub-packetization of $2^{mn}$ in Ye's and Barg's constructions. In general,
when $r = s^m$ for an integer $s \ge 2$, our codes have sub-packetization $l =
s^{m+n-1} = rs^{n-1}$. Specifically, when $r=s^{m}$, we obtain an
$(n,k,s^{m+n-1})$ Reed--Solomon code and an optimal update $(n,k,s^{m+n-1})$
MDS code, which both have asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth. In order to
obtain these results, we extend and generalize the $r$-ary expansion idea in
Ye's and Barg's constructions.

 <dc:title>Explicit MDS Codes with Complementary Duals</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 1964, Massey introduced a class of codes with complementary duals which
are called Linear Complimentary Dual (LCD for short) codes. He showed that LCD
codes have applications in communication system, side-channel attack (SCA) and
so on. LCD codes have been extensively studied in literature. On the other
hand, MDS codes form an optimal family of classical codes which have wide
applications in both theory and practice. The main purpose of this paper is to
give an explicit construction of several classes of LCD MDS codes, using tools
from algebraic function fields. We exemplify this construction and obtain
several classes of explicit LCD MDS codes for the odd characteristic case.

 <dc:description>  This paper represents a novel regenerative braking approach for the Electric
Vehicles. The proposed method solves the short-range problem which is
corresponding to the charge of the battery pack. The DTC switching algorithm
has been modified to recover the electrical energy from Electrical Vehicle
(EV), driven by Brushless DC motor, without using the additional power
converter or the other electrical energy storage devices. During regenerative
braking process, different switching pattern is applied to the inverter to
convert the mechanical energy to the electrical energy through the reverse
diodes. This switching pattern is different from the normal operation due to
the special arrangement of voltage vectors which is considered to convert the
mechanical energy to electrical energy. The state of charge of the battery is
used as a performance indicator of the method. Simultaneously, a model
reference adaptive system has been designed to tune the system parameters.
Several simulations are carried out to validate the performance and
effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show the high capability and
performance of the designed method.

 <dc:description>  Minimum storage regenerating codes have minimum storage of data in each node
and therefore are maximal distance separable (MDS for short) codes. Thus, the
number of nodes is upper bounded by $2^{\fb}$, where $\fb$ is the bits of data
stored in each node. From both theoretical and practical points of view (see
the details in Section 1), it is natural to consider regenerating codes that
nearly have minimum storage of data, and meanwhile the number of nodes is
unbounded. One of the candidates for such regenerating codes is an algebraic
geometry code. In this paper, we generalize the repairing algorithm of
Reed-Solomon codes given in \cite[STOC2016]{GW16} to algebraic geometry codes
and present an efficient repairing algorithm for arbitrary one-point algebraic
geometry codes. By applying our repairing algorithm to the one-point algebraic
geometry codes based on the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower, one can repair a code of
rate $1-\Ge$ and length $n$ over $\F_{q}$ with bandwidth $(n-1)(1-\Gt)\log q$
for any $\Ge=2^{(\Gt-1/2)\log q}$ with a real $\tau\in(0,1/2)$. In addition,
storage in each node for an algebraic geometry code is close to the minimum
storage. Due to nice structures of Hermitian curves, repairing of Hermitian
codes is also investigated. As a result, we are able to show that algebraic
geometry codes are regenerating codes with good parameters. An example reveals
that Hermitian codes outperform Reed-Solomon codes for certain parameters.

 <dc:title>To prune, or not to prune: exploring the efficacy of pruning for model
  compression</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Model pruning seeks to induce sparsity in a deep neural network's various
connection matrices, thereby reducing the number of nonzero-valued parameters
in the model. Recent reports (Han et al., 2015; Narang et al., 2017) prune deep
networks at the cost of only a marginal loss in accuracy and achieve a sizable
reduction in model size. This hints at the possibility that the baseline models
in these experiments are perhaps severely over-parameterized at the outset and
a viable alternative for model compression might be to simply reduce the number
of hidden units while maintaining the model's dense connection structure,
exposing a similar trade-off in model size and accuracy. We investigate these
two distinct paths for model compression within the context of energy-efficient
inference in resource-constrained environments and propose a new gradual
pruning technique that is simple and straightforward to apply across a variety
of models/datasets with minimal tuning and can be seamlessly incorporated
within the training process. We compare the accuracy of large, but pruned
models (large-sparse) and their smaller, but dense (small-dense) counterparts
with identical memory footprint. Across a broad range of neural network
architectures (deep CNNs, stacked LSTM, and seq2seq LSTM models), we find
large-sparse models to consistently outperform small-dense models and achieve
up to 10x reduction in number of non-zero parameters with minimal loss in
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  For a base station that supports cellular communications in sub-6 GHz LTE
bands and millimeter (mmWave) bands, we propose a supervised machine learning
algorithm to improve the success rate in the handover between the two radio
technologies. The proposed algorithm uses sub-6 GHz LTE channel measurements
and prior mmWave measurements within a temporal window to estimate mmWave

improvement in inter-radio access technology handover success rates for the
proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  This work presents a novel diffusion based dual-phase molecular communication
system where the source leverages multiple cooperating nanomachines to improve
the end-to-end reliability of communication. The Neyman-Pearson Likelihood
Ratio Tests are derived for each of the cooperative as well as the destination
nanomachines in the presence of multi-user interference. Further, to
characterize the performance of the aforementioned system, closed form
expressions are derived for the probabilities of detection, false alarm at the
individual cooperative, destination nanomachines, as well as the overall
end-to-end probability of error. Simulation results demonstrate a significant
improvement in the end-to-end performance of the proposed cooperative framework
in comparison to multiple-input single-output and single-input single-output
molecular communication scenarios in the existing literature.

 <dc:description>  Hurricane Sandy was one of the deadliest and costliest of hurricanes over the
past few decades. Many states experienced significant power outage, however
many people used social media to communicate while having limited or no access
to traditional information sources. In this study, we explored the evolution of
various communication patterns using machine learning techniques and determined
user concerns that emerged over the course of Hurricane Sandy. The original
data included ~52M tweets coming from ~13M users between October 14, 2012 and
November 12, 2012. We run topic model on ~763K tweets from top 4,029 most
frequent users who tweeted about Sandy at least 100 times. We identified 250
well-defined communication patterns based on perplexity. Conversations of most
frequent and relevant users indicate the evolution of numerous storm-phase
(warning, response, and recovery) specific topics. People were also concerned
about storm location and time, media coverage, and activities of political
leaders and celebrities. We also present each relevant keyword that contributed
to one particular pattern of user concerns. Such keywords would be particularly
meaningful in targeted information spreading and effective crisis communication
in similar major disasters. Each of these words can also be helpful for
efficient hash-tagging to reach target audience as needed via social media. The
pattern recognition approach of this study can be used in identifying real time
user needs in future crises.

 <dc:description>  The concept of citation indexing has become deeply involved in many parts of
research itself and the broad environment in which research plays an integral
role, ranging from research evaluation, numerous indicators, to an increasingly
wider range of scientific disciplines. In this article, we pay tribute to
Eugene Garfield and present a scientometric review of the intellectual assets
that he brought to us. In addition, we explore the intellectual landscape that
has subsequently evolved in connection to many of his ideas. We illustrate what
systematic reviews of the scientific literature may reveal and what we may
learn from the rich information conveyed through citation-induced patterns. The
study is conducted with CiteSpace, one of many science mapping tools based on
data from the Web of Science and Scopus. Without Garfield's inventions, none of
these would be possible.

 <dc:description>  A new method to enhance head shadow in low frequencies is presented,
resulting in interaural level differences that can be used to unambiguously
localize sounds. Enhancement is achieved with a fixed beamformer with
ipsilateral directionality in each ear. The microphone array consists of one
microphone per device. The method naturally handles multiple sources without
sound location estimations. In a localization experiment with simulated bimodal
listeners, performance improved from 51{\deg} to 28{\deg} root-mean-square
error compared with standard omni-directional microphones. The method is also
promising for bilateral cochlear implant or hearing aid users and for improved
speech perception in multi-talker environments.

natural environments. This challenging task requires, in addition to the
recognition of articulated body actions, the extraction of semantic elements
from the scene such as the identity of the manipulated objects. In this paper,
we present a self-organizing neural network for the recognition of human-object
interactions from RGB-D videos. Our model consists of a hierarchy of Grow When
Required (GWR) networks which learn prototypical representations of body motion
patterns and objects, also accounting for the development of action-object
mappings in an unsupervised fashion. To demonstrate this ability, we report
experimental results on a dataset of daily activities collected for the purpose
of this study as well as on a publicly available benchmark dataset. In line
with neurophysiological studies, our self-organizing architecture shows higher
neural activation for congruent action-object pairs learned during training
sessions with respect to artificially created incongruent ones. We show that
our model achieves good classification accuracy on the benchmark dataset in an
unsupervised fashion, showing competitive performance with respect to strictly
supervised state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the incentive mechanism design from a novel and
practically important perspective in which mobile users as contributors do not
join simultaneously and a requester desires large efforts from early
contributors. A two-stage Tullock contest framework is constructed:at the
second stage the potential contributors compete for splittable reward by
exerting efforts, and at the first stage the requester can orchestrate the
incentive mechanism to maximize his crowdsensing efficiency given the rewarding
budget. A general reward discrimination mechanism is developed for timeliness
sensitive crowdsensing where an earlier contributor usually has a larger
maximum achievable reward and thus allocates more efforts. Owning to the lack
of joining time information, two practical implementations, namely earliest-n
and termination time, are announced to the contributors. For each of them, we
formulate a Stackelberg Bayesian game in which the joining time of a
contributor is his type and not available to his opponents. The uniqueness of
Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is proved in each strategy. To maximize the
requester's efficiency, we compute the optimal number of rewarded contributors
in the earliest-n scheme and the optimal deadline in the termination time
scheme. Our contest framework is applicable not only to the closed crowdsensing
with fixed number of contributors, but also to the open crowdsensing that the
arrival of contributors is governed by a stochastic process. Extensive
simulations manifest that with appropriate reward discriminations, the
requester is able to achieve a much higher efficiency with the optimal
selection of the number of rewarded contributiors and the termination time.

 <dc:title>Plane-extraction from depth-data using a Gaussian mixture regression

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel algorithm for unsupervised extraction of piecewise planar
models from depth-data. Among other applications, such models are a good way of
enabling autonomous agents (robots, cars, drones, etc.) to effectively perceive
their surroundings and to navigate in three dimensions. We propose to do this
by fitting the data with a piecewise-linear Gaussian mixture regression model
whose components are skewed over planes, making them flat in appearance rather
than being ellipsoidal, by embedding an outlier-trimming process that is
formally incorporated into the proposed expectation-maximization algorithm, and
by selectively fusing contiguous, coplanar components. Part of our motivation
is an attempt to estimate more accurate plane-extraction by allowing each model
component to make use of all available data through probabilistic clustering.
The algorithm is thoroughly evaluated against a standard benchmark and is shown
to rank among the best of the existing state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning methods are used on spectroscopic data to predict drug content
in tablets from near infrared (NIR) spectra. Using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), features are ex- tracted from the spectroscopic data. Extended
multiplicative scatter correction (EMSC) and a novel spectral data augmentation
method are benchmarked as preprocessing steps. The learned models perform
better or on par with hypothetical optimal partial least squares (PLS) models
for all combinations of preprocessing. Data augmentation with subsequent EMSC
in combination gave the best results. The deep learning model CNNs also
outperform the PLS models in an extrapolation chal- lenge created using data
from a second instrument and from an analyte concentration not covered by the
training data. Qualitative investigations of the CNNs kernel activations show
their resemblance to wellknown data processing methods such as smoothing,
slope/derivative, thresholds and spectral region selection.

 <dc:description>  NTRU cryptosystem has allowed designing a range of cryptographic schemes due
to its flexibility and efficiency. Although NTRU cryptosystem was introduced
nearly two decades ago, it has not yet received any attention like designing a
secret key encryption. In this paper, we propose a secret key encryption over
NTRU lattices, named as NTRUCipher. This NTRUCipher is designed using
modification of the NTRU public key encryption. We analyze this cipher
efficiency and the space complexity with respect to security aspects, and also
show that the NTRUCipher is secured under the indistinguishability chosen
plaintext attack.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we give a characterization of both Boolean and arithmetic
circuit classes of logarithmic depth in the vein of descriptive complexity
theory, i.e., the Boolean classes $\textrm{NC}^1$, $\textrm{SAC}^1$ and
$\textrm{AC}^1$ as well as their arithmetic counterparts $\#\textrm{NC}^1$,
$\#\textrm{SAC}^1$ and $\#\textrm{AC}^1$. We build on Immerman's
characterization of constant-depth polynomial-size circuits by formulas of
first-order logic, i.e., $\textrm{AC}^0 = \textrm{FO}$, and augment the logical
language with an operator for defining relations in an inductive way.
Considering slight variations of the new operator, we obtain uniform
characterizations of the three just mentioned Boolean classes. The arithmetic
classes can then be characterized by functions counting winning strategies in
semantic games for formulas characterizing languages in the corresponding
Boolean class.

 <dc:description>  In large and active software projects, it becomes impractical for a developer
to stay aware of all project activity. While it might not be necessary to know
about each commit or issue, it is arguably important to know about the ones
that are unusual. To investigate this hypothesis, we identified unusual events
in 200 GitHub projects using a comprehensive list of ways in which an artifact
can be unusual and asked 140 developers responsible for or affected by these
events to comment on the usefulness of the corresponding information. Based on
2,096 answers, we identify the subset of unusual events that developers
consider particularly useful, including large code modifications and unusual
amounts of reviewing activity, along with qualitative evidence on the reasons
behind these answers. Our findings provide a means for reducing the amount of
information that developers need to parse in order to stay up to date with
development activity in their projects.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of representing semantic concepts in speech by
learning from untranscribed speech paired with images of scenes. This setting
is relevant in low-resource speech processing, robotics, and human language
acquisition research. We use an external image tagger to generate soft labels,
which serve as targets for training a neural model that maps speech to keyword
labels. We introduce a newly collected data set of human semantic relevance
judgements and an associated task, semantic keyword spotting, where the goal is
to search for spoken utterances that are semantically relevant to a given text
query. Without seeing any text, the model trained on parallel speech and images
achieves a precision of almost 60% on its top ten semantic retrievals. Compared
to a model trained on transcriptions, our model matches human judgements better
by some measures, especially in retrieving non-verbatim semantic matches.

objects. It combines a partial-sums-based structure that retrieves in constant
time the position of the object at any instant, with a hierarchical
minimum-bounding-boxes representation that allows determining if the object is
seen in a certain rectangular area during a time period. Combined with spatial
snapshots at regular intervals, the representation is shown to outperform
classical ones by orders of magnitude in space, and also to outperform previous
compressed representations in time performance, when using the same amount of
space.

 <dc:description>  The vitality of an arc/node of a graph with respect to the maximum flow
between two fixed nodes is defined as the reduction of the maximum flow caused
by the removal of that arc/node. In this paper we address the issue of
determining the vitality of arcs and/or nodes for the network flow problem over
various classes of graphs and digraphs. First of all we show how to compute the
vitality of all arcs in a general undirected graph by solving $n-1$ max flow
instances, i.e., in worst case time $O(n \cdot \mbox{MF}(n,m))$, where
$\mbox{MF}(n,m)$ is the time needed to solve a max-flow instance. In
$st$-planar graphs (directed or undirected) we can compute the vitality of all
arcs and all nodes in $O(n)$ worst case time. Moreover, after determining the
vitality of arcs and/or nodes, and given a planar embedding of the graph, we
can determine the vitality of a &quot;contiguous&quot; (w.r.t. that embedding) set of
arcs/nodes in time proportional to the size of the set. In the case of general
undirected planar graphs, the vitality of all nodes/arcs is computed in $O(n
\log n)$ worst case time, while for the directed planar case we solve the same
problem in $O(np)$, where $p$ is the number of arcs in a path from $s^{*}$ to
$t^{*}$ in the dual graph.

 <dc:description>  Journal of the History of Biology provides a fifty-year long record for
examining the evolution of the history of biology as a scholarly discipline. In
this paper, we present a new dataset and preliminary quantitative analysis of
the thematic content of JHB from the perspectives of geography, organisms, and
thematic fields. The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB
has increased steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content
of JHB articles remains strongly lopsided toward the United States, United
Kingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much less dramatically over
time. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily
between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader
patterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research
literature. Finally, we used a combination of topic modeling and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques to develop a model of multi-article fields
within JHB. We found evidence for directional changes in the representation of
fields on multiple scales. The diversity of JHB with regard to the
representation of thematic fields has increased overall, with most of that
diversification occurring in recent years. Drawing on the dataset generated in
the course of this analysis, as well as web services in the emerging digital
history and philosophy of science ecosystem, we have developed an interactive
web platform for exploring the content of JHB, and we provide a brief overview
of the platform in this article. As a whole, the data and analyses presented
here provide a starting-place for further critical reflection on the evolution
of the history of biology over the past half-century.

players want to evaluate a function $F : X_1 \times\cdots\times X_k\rightarrow
Y$ on some input $(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ by broadcasting bits according to a

cannot speak to each other but instead send information to a referee. The
referee does not know the players' input, and cannot give any information back.
At the end, the referee must be able to recover $F(x_1,\dots,x_k)$ from what
she obtained.
  A central open question, called the $\log n$ barrier, is to find a function
which is hard to compute for $polylog(n)$ or more players (where the $x_i$'s
have size $poly(n)$) in the simultaneous NOF model. This has important
applications in circuit complexity, as it could help to separate $ACC^0$ from
other complexity classes. One of the candidates belongs to the family of
composed functions. The input to these functions is represented by a $k\times
(t\cdot n)$ boolean matrix $M$, whose row $i$ is the input $x_i$ and $t$ is a
block-width parameter. A symmetric composed function acting on $M$ is specified
by two symmetric $n$- and $kt$-variate functions $f$ and $g$, that output
$f\circ g(M)=f(g(B_1),\dots,g(B_n))$ where $B_j$ is the $j$-th block of width
$t$ of $M$. As the majority function $MAJ$ is conjectured to be outside of
$ACC^0$, Babai et. al. suggested to study $MAJ\circ MAJ_t$, with $t$ large
enough.
  So far, it was only known that $t=1$ is not enough for $MAJ\circ MAJ_t$ to
break the $\log n$ barrier in the simultaneous deterministic NOF model. In this
paper, we extend this result to any constant block-width $t&gt;1$, by giving a
protocol of cost $2^{O(2^t)}\log^{2^{t+1}}(n)$ for any symmetric composed
function when there are $2^{\Omega(2^t)}\log n$ players.

 <dc:description>  Clickbait (headlines) make use of misleading titles that hide critical
information from or exaggerate the content on the landing target pages to
entice clicks. As clickbaits often use eye-catching wording to attract viewers,
target contents are often of low quality. Clickbaits are especially widespread
on social media such as Twitter, adversely impacting user experience by causing
immense dissatisfaction. Hence, it has become increasingly important to put
forward a widely applicable approach to identify and detect clickbaits. In this
paper, we make use of a dataset from the clickbait challenge 2017
(clickbait-challenge.com) comprising of over 21,000 headlines/titles, each of
which is annotated by at least five judgments from crowdsourcing on how
clickbait it is. We attempt to build an effective computational clickbait
detection model on this dataset. We first considered a total of 331 features,
filtered out many features to avoid overfitting and improve the running time of
learning, and eventually selected the 60 most important features for our final
model. Using these features, Random Forest Regression achieved the following
results: MSE=0.035 MSE, Accuracy=0.82, and F1-sore=0.61 on the clickbait class.

 <dc:description>  Many data sources can be interpreted as time-series, and a key problem is to
identify which pairs out of a large collection of signals are highly
correlated. We expect that there will be few, large, interesting correlations,
while most signal pairs do not have any strong correlation. We abstract this as
the problem of identifying the highly correlated pairs in a collection of n
mostly pairwise uncorrelated random variables, where observations of the
variables arrives as a stream. Dimensionality reduction can remove dependence
on the number of observations, but further techniques are required to tame the
quadratic (in n) cost of a search through all possible pairs.
  We develop a new algorithm for rapidly finding large correlations based on
sketch techniques with an added twist: we quickly generate sketches of random
combinations of signals, and use these in concert with ideas from coding theory
to decode the identity of correlated pairs. We prove correctness and compare
performance and effectiveness with the best LSH (locality sensitive hashing)
based approach.

 <dc:description>  High Performance Computing is often performed on scarce and shared computing
resources. To ensure computers are used to their full capacity, administrators
often incentivize large workloads that are not possible on smaller systems.
Measurements in Lattice QCD frequently do not scale to machine-size workloads.
By bundling tasks together we can create large jobs suitable for gigantic
partitions. We discuss METAQ and mpi_jm, software developed to dynamically
group computational tasks together, that can intelligently backfill to consume
idle time without substantial changes to users' current workflows or
executables.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There has been recent growing interest in graph theoretical properties known
as r- and (r,s)-robustness. These properties serve as sufficient conditions
guaranteeing the success of certain consensus algorithms in networks with
misbehaving agents present. Due to the complexity of determining the robustness
for an arbitrary graph, several methods have previously been proposed for
identifying the robustness of specific classes of graphs or constructing graphs
with specified robustness levels. The majority of such approaches have focused
on undirected graphs. In this paper we identify a class of scalable directed
graphs whose edge set is determined by a parameter k and prove that the
robustness of these graphs is also determined by k. We support our results
through computer simulations.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks have recently demonstrated high-quality
reconstruction for single image super-resolution. However, existing methods
often require a large number of network parameters and entail heavy
computational loads at runtime for generating high-accuracy super-resolution
results. In this paper, we propose the deep Laplacian Pyramid Super-Resolution
Network for fast and accurate image super-resolution. The proposed network
progressively reconstructs the sub-band residuals of high-resolution images at
multiple pyramid levels. In contrast to existing methods that involve the
bicubic interpolation for pre-processing (which results in large feature maps),
the proposed method directly extracts features from the low-resolution input
space and thereby entails low computational loads. We train the proposed
network with deep supervision using the robust Charbonnier loss functions and
achieve high-quality image reconstruction. Furthermore, we utilize the
recursive layers to share parameters across as well as within pyramid levels,
and thus drastically reduce the number of parameters. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed
algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
run-time and image quality.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyses the performance benefits of a user-centric scheduling
approach, exploiting the flexibility of both dynamic time division duplex (TDD)
and a variable transmission time interval (TTI), where the downlink to uplink
ratio and TTI duration can be adapted to the traffic load. The formulation of
the joint optimisation problem takes into consideration the individual
requirements of each single user in terms of sustainable latency and desired
throughput, thus implementing a real user-centric scheduling approach.
Moreover, the developed solution is evaluated in a scenario with mixed traffic
types, mobile broadband (MBB) and mission critical communications (MCC),
showing remarkable performance enhancement of the proposed scheme over baseline
dynamic TDD schemes with a fixed TTI in terms of both achievable throughput of
the MBB users and guaranteed latency for the MCC users.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, the availability of large-scale data in disparate application
domains urges the deployment of sophisticated tools for extracting valuable
knowledge out of this huge bulk of information. In that vein, low-rank
representations (LRRs) which seek low-dimensional embeddings of data have
naturally appeared. In an effort to reduce computational complexity and improve
estimation performance, LRR has been viewed via a matrix factorization (MF)
perspective. Recently, low-rank MF (LRMF) approaches have been proposed for
tackling the inherent weakness of MF i.e., the unawareness of the dimension of
the low-dimensional space where data reside. Herein, inspired by the merits of
iterative reweighted schemes for rank minimization, we come up with a generic
low-rank promoting regularization function. Then, focusing on a specific
instance of it, we propose a regularizer that imposes column-sparsity jointly
on the two matrix factors that result from MF, thus promoting low-rankness on
the optimization problem. The problems of denoising, matrix completion and
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) are redefined according to the new LRMF
formulation and solved via efficient Newton-type algorithms with proven
theoretical guarantees as to their convergence and rates of convergence to
stationary points. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is verified in
diverse simulated and real data experiments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the complexity of the edge monitoring problem. A
vertex $v$ monitors an edge $e$ if both extremities together with $v$ form a
triangle in the graph. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a weight function on edges
$c$ where $c(e)$ is the number of monitors that needs the edge $e$, the problem
is to seek a minimum subset of monitors $S$ such that every edge $e$ in the
graph is monitored by at least $c(e)$ vertices in $S$. In this paper, we study
the edge monitoring problem on several graph classes such as complete graphs,
block graphs, cographs, split graphs, interval graphs and planar graphs. We
also generalize the problem by adding weights on vertices.

 <dc:description>  On-line privacy is of major public concern. Unfortunately, for the average
consumer, there is no simple mechanism to browse the Internet privately on
multiple devices. Most available Internet privacy mechanisms are either
expensive, not readily available, untrusted, or simply provide trivial
information masking. We propose that the simplest, most effective and
inexpensive way of gaining privacy, without sacrificing unnecessary amounts of
functionality and speed, is to mask the user's IP address while also encrypting
all data. We hypothesized that the Tor protocol is aptly suited to address
these needs. With this in mind we implemented a Tor router using a single board
computer and the open-source Tor protocol code. We found that our proposed
solution was able to meet five of our six goals soon after its implementation:
cost effectiveness, immediacy of privacy, simplicity of use, ease of execution,
and unimpaired functionality. Our final criterion of speed was sacrificed for
greater privacy but it did not fall so low as to impair day-to-day
functionality. With a total cost of roughly $100.00 USD and a speed cap of
around 2 Megabits per second we were able to meet our goal of an affordable,
convenient, and usable solution to increased on-line privacy for the average
consumer.

 <dc:description>  Split manufacturing is a promising technique to defend against fab-based
malicious activities such as IP piracy, overbuilding, and insertion of hardware
Trojans. However, a network flow-based proximity attack, proposed by Wang et
al. (DAC'16) [1], has demonstrated that most prior art on split manufacturing
is highly vulnerable. Here in this work, we present two practical layout
techniques towards secure split manufacturing: (i) gate-level graph coloring
and (ii) clustering of same-type gates. Our approach shows promising results
against the advanced proximity attack, lowering its success rate by 5.27x,
3.19x, and 1.73x on average compared to the unprotected layouts when splitting
at metal layers M1, M2, and M3, respectively. Also, it largely outperforms
previous defense efforts; we observe on average 8x higher resilience when
compared to representative prior art. At the same time, extensive simulations
on ISCAS'85 and MCNC benchmarks reveal that our techniques incur an acceptable
layout overhead. Apart from this empirical study, we provide---for the first
time---a theoretical framework for quantifying the layout-level resilience
against any proximity-induced information leakage. Towards this end, we
leverage the notion of mutual information and provide extensive results to
validate our model.

 <dc:description>  Increasingly, Internet of Things (IoT) domains, such as sensor networks,
smart cities, and social networks, generate vast amounts of data. Such data are
not only unbounded and rapidly evolving. Rather, the content thereof
dynamically evolves over time, often in unforeseen ways. These variations are
due to so-called concept drifts, caused by changes in the underlying data
generation mechanisms. In a classification setting, concept drift causes the
previously learned models to become inaccurate, unsafe and even unusable.
Accordingly, concept drifts need to be detected, and handled, as soon as
possible. In medical applications and emergency response settings, for example,
change in behaviours should be detected in near real-time, to avoid potential
loss of life. To this end, we introduce the McDiarmid Drift Detection Method
(MDDM), which utilizes McDiarmid's inequality in order to detect concept drift.
The MDDM approach proceeds by sliding a window over prediction results, and
associate window entries with weights. Higher weights are assigned to the most
recent entries, in order to emphasize their importance. As instances are
processed, the detection algorithm compares a weighted mean of elements inside
the sliding window with the maximum weighted mean observed so far. A
significant difference between the two weighted means, upper-bounded by the
McDiarmid inequality, implies a concept drift. Our extensive experimentation
against synthetic and real-world data streams show that our novel method
outperforms the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MDDM yields shorter detection
delays as well as lower false negative rates, while maintaining high
classification accuracies.

 <dc:title>Weight = nonlinearity for all small weight Boolean functions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cusick, Thomas W.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>94A60 06E30</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given a Boolean function f, the (Hamming) weight wt(f) and the nonlinearity
N(f) are well known to be important in designing functions that are useful in
cryptography. The nonlinearity is expensive to compute, in general, so any
shortcuts for doing that for particular functions f are significant. It is
clear from the definitions that wt(f) \leq N(f). We give a useful and practical
sufficient condition for the weight and nonlinearity to be equal, namely wt(f)
\leq (2 to the power n-2) if f has n variables. It is shown that this
inequality cannot be improved, in general. This condition can also be used to
actually compute the nonlinearity in some cases. As an application, we give a
simple proof for the value of the nonlinearity of the well known majority
function. Previous proofs relied on many detailed results for the Krawtchouk
polynomials.

 <dc:description>  Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) is an infrastructure-less network formed
between a set of mobile nodes. The discovery of services in MANET is a
challenging job due to the unique properties of network. In this paper, a novel
service discovery framework called Hybrid Association Rules Based Network Layer
Discovery of Services for Ad hoc Networks (HANDY) has been proposed. HANDY
provides three major research contributions. At first, it adopts a cross-layer
optimized design for discovery of services that is based on simultaneous
discovery of services and corresponding routes. Secondly, it provides a
multi-level ontology-based approach to describe the services. This resolves the
issue of semantic interoperability among the service consumers in a scalable
fashion. Finally, to further optimize the performance of the discovery process,
HANDY recommends exploiting the inherent associations present among the
services. These associations are used in two ways. First, periodic service
advertisements are performed based on these associations. In addition, when a
response of a service discovery request is generated, correlated services are
also attached with the response. The proposed service discovery scheme has been
implemented in JIST/SWANS simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed
modifications give rise to improvement in hit ratio of the service consumers
and latency of discovery process.

 <dc:title>Computational Differential Privacy from Lattice-based Cryptography</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The emerging technologies for large scale data analysis raise new challenges
to the security and privacy of sensitive user data. In this work we investigate
the problem of private statistical analysis of time-series data in the
distributed and semi-honest setting. In particular, we study some properties of
Private Stream Aggregation (PSA), first introduced by Shi et al. 2017. This is
a computationally secure protocol for the collection and aggregation of data in
a distributed network and has a very small communication cost. In the
non-adaptive query model, a secure PSA scheme can be built upon any
key-homomorphic weak pseudo-random function as shown by Valovich 2017, yielding
security guarantees in the standard model which is in contrast to Shi et. al.
We show that every mechanism which preserves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential
privacy in effect preserves computational $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential
privacy when it is executed through a secure PSA scheme. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel perturbation mechanism based on the symmetric Skellam
distribution that is suited for preserving differential privacy in the
distributed setting, and find that its performances in terms of privacy and
accuracy are comparable to those of previous solutions. On the other hand, we
leverage its specific properties to construct a computationally efficient
prospective post-quantum protocol for differentially private time-series data
analysis in the distributed model. The security of this protocol is based on
the hardness of a new variant of the Decisional Learning with Errors (DLWE)
problem. In this variant the errors are taken from the symmetric Skellam
distribution. We show that this new variant is hard based on the hardness of
the standard Learning with Errors (LWE) problem where the errors are taken from
the discrete Gaussian distribution. Thus, we provide a variant of the LWE
problem that is hard...

 <dc:description>  The aspect ratio variation frequently appears in visual tracking and has a
severe influence on performance. Although many correlation filter (CF)-based
trackers have also been suggested for scale adaptive tracking, few studies have
been given to handle the aspect ratio variation for CF trackers. In this paper,
we make the first attempt to address this issue by introducing a family of 1D
boundary CFs to localize the left, right, top, and bottom boundaries in videos.
This allows us cope with the aspect ratio variation flexibly during tracking.
Specifically, we present a novel tracking model to integrate 1D Boundary and 2D
Center CFs (IBCCF) where boundary and center filters are enforced by a
near-orthogonality regularization term. To optimize our IBCCF model, we develop
an alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on several datasets
show that IBCCF can effectively handle aspect ratio variation, and achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and robustness.

 <dc:description>  Civil Asset Forfeiture (CAF) is a longstanding and controversial legal
process viewed on the one hand as a powerful tool for combating drug crimes and
on the other hand as a violation of the rights of US citizens. Data used to
support both sides of the controversy to date has come from government sources
representing records of the events at the time of occurrence. Court dockets
represent litigation events initiated following the forfeiture, however, and
can thus provide a new perspective on the CAF legal process. This paper will
show new evidence supporting existing claims about the growth of the practice
and bias in its application based on the quantitative analysis of data derived
from these court cases.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a fundamental problem in modern digital
communications known as multi-input multi-output (MIMO) detection, which can be
formulated as a complex quadratic programming problem subject to unit-modulus
and discrete argument constraints. Various semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based
algorithms have been proposed to solve the problem in the literature. In this
paper, we first show that the conventional SDR is generically not tight for the
problem. Then, we propose a new and enhanced SDR and show its tightness under
an easily checkable condition, which essentially requires the level of the
noise to be below a certain threshold. The above results have answered an open
question posed by So in [22]. Numerical simulation results show that our
proposed SDR significantly outperforms the conventional SDR in terms of the
relaxation gap.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of verifying anonymity and
unlinkability in the symbolic model, where protocols are represented as
processes in a variant of the applied pi calculus, notably used in the ProVerif
tool. Existing tools and techniques do not allow to verify directly these
properties, expressed as behavioral equivalences. We propose a different
approach: we design two conditions on protocols which are sufficient to ensure
anonymity and unlinkability, and which can then be effectively checked
automatically using ProVerif. Our two conditions correspond to two broad
classes of attacks on unlinkability, i.e. data and control-flow leaks. This
theoretical result is general enough that it applies to a wide class of
protocols based on a variety of cryptographic primitives. In particular, using
our tool, UKano, we provide the first formal security proofs of protocols such
as BAC and PACE (e-passport), Hash-Lock (RFID authentication), etc. Our work
has also lead to the discovery of new attacks, including one on the LAK
protocol (RFID authentication) which was previously claimed to be unlinkable
(in a weak sense).

 <dc:description>  Most modern HVAC systems suffer from two intrinsic problems. First, inability
to meet diverse comfort requirements of the occupants. Second, heat or cool an
entire zone even when the zone is only partially occupied. Both issues can be
mitigated by using personal comfort systems (PCS) which bridge the comfort gap
between what is provided by a central HVAC system and the personal preferences
of the occupants. In recent work, we have proposed and deployed such a system,
called SPOT.
  We address the question, &quot;How should an existing HVAC system modify its
operation to benefit the availability of PCS like SPOT?&quot; For example, energy
consumption could be reduced during sparse occupancy by choosing appropriate
thermal set backs, with the PCS providing the additional offset in thermal
comfort required for each occupant. Our control strategy based on Model
Predictive Control (MPC), employs a bi-linear thermal model, and has two
time-scales to accommodate the physical constraints that limit certain
components of the central HVAC system from frequently changing their set
points.
  We compare the energy consumption and comfort offered by our SPOT-aware HVAC
system with that of a state-of-the-art MPC-based central HVAC system in
multiple settings including different room layouts and partial deployment of
PCS. Numerical evaluations show that our system obtains, in average, 45% (15%)
savings in energy in summer (winter), compared with the benchmark system for
the case of homogeneous comfort requirements. For heterogeneous comfort
requirements, we observe 51% (29%) improvement in comfort in summer (winter) in
addition to significant savings in energy.

 <dc:description>  This paper applies a recently developed geometric PID controller to stabilize
a three-link planar bipedal hybrid dynamic walking model. The three links
represent the robot torso and two kneeless legs, with an independent control
torque available at each hip joint. The geometric PID controller is derived for
fully actuated mechanical systems, however in the swing phase the three-link
biped robot has three degrees of freedom and only two controls. Following the
bipedal walking literature, underactuation is addressed by choosing two
&quot;virtual constraints&quot; to enforce, and verifying the stability of the resulting
two-dimensional zero dynamics. The resulting controlled dynamics do not have
the structure of a mechanical system, however this structure is restored using
&quot;feedback regularization,&quot; following which geometric PID control is used to
provide robust asymptotic regulation of the virtual constraints. The proposed
method can tolerate significantly greater variations in inclination, showing
the value of the geometric methods, and the benefit of integral action.

 <dc:description>  Embedded controllers for cyber-physical systems are often parameterized by
look-up maps representing discretizations of continuous functions on metric
spaces. For example, a non-linear control action may be represented as a table
of pre-computed values, and the output action of the controller for a given
input is computed by using interpolation. For industrial-scale control systems,
several man-hours of effort is spent in tuning the values within the look-up
maps, and sub-optimal performance is often associated with inappropriate values
in look-up maps. Suppose that during testing, the controller code is found to
have sub-optimal performance. The parameter fault localization problem asks
which parameter values in the code are potential causes of the sub-optimal
behavior. We present a statistical parameter fault localization approach based
on binary similarity coefficients and set spectra methods. Our approach extends
previous work on software fault localization to a quantitative setting where
the parameters encode continuous functions over a metric space and the program
is reactive.
  We have implemented our approach in a simulation workflow for automotive
control systems in Simulink. Given controller code with parameters (including
look-up maps), our framework bootstraps the simulation workflow to return a
ranked list of map entries which are deemed to have most impact on the
performance. On a suite of industrial case studies with seeded errors, our tool
was able to precisely identify the location of the errors.

 <dc:title>On the Effective Use of Pretraining for Natural Language Inference</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Neural networks have excelled at many NLP tasks, but there remain open
questions about the performance of pretrained distributed word representations
and their interaction with weight initialization and other hyperparameters. We
address these questions empirically using attention-based sequence-to-sequence
models for natural language inference (NLI). Specifically, we compare three
types of embeddings: random, pretrained (GloVe, word2vec), and retrofitted
(pretrained plus WordNet information). We show that pretrained embeddings
outperform both random and retrofitted ones in a large NLI corpus. Further
experiments on more controlled data sets shed light on the contexts for which
retrofitted embeddings can be useful. We also explore two principled approaches
to initializing the rest of the model parameters, Gaussian and orthogonal,
showing that the latter yields gains of up to 2.9% in the NLI task.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study data from financial markets using an
information-theory tool that we call the normalised Mutual Information Rate and
show how to use it to infer the underlying network structure of interrelations
in foreign currency exchange rates and stock indices of 14 countries world-wide
and the European Union. We first present the mathematical method and discuss
about its computational aspects, and then apply it to artificial data from
chaotic dynamics and to correlated random variates. Next, we apply the method
to infer the network structure of the financial data. Particularly, we study
and reveal the interrelations among the various foreign currency exchange rates
and stock indices in two separate networks for which we also perform an
analysis to identify their structural properties. Our results show that both
are small-world networks sharing similar properties but also having distinct
differences in terms of assortativity. Finally, the consistent relationships
depicted among the 15 economies are further supported by a discussion from the
economics view point.

 <dc:description>  Recent direct visual odometry and SLAM algorithms have demonstrated
impressive levels of precision. However, they require a photometric camera
calibration in order to achieve competitive results. Hence, the respective
algorithm cannot be directly applied to an off-the-shelf-camera or to a video
sequence acquired with an unknown camera. In this work we propose a method for
online photometric calibration which enables to process auto exposure videos
with visual odometry precisions that are on par with those of photometrically
calibrated videos. Our algorithm recovers the exposure times of consecutive
frames, the camera response function, and the attenuation factors of the sensor
irradiance due to vignetting. Gain robust KLT feature tracks are used to obtain
scene point correspondences as input to a nonlinear optimization framework. We
show that our approach can reliably calibrate arbitrary video sequences by
evaluating it on datasets for which full photometric ground truth is available.
We further show that our calibration can improve the performance of a
state-of-the-art direct visual odometry method that works solely on pixel
intensities, calibrating for photometric parameters in an online fashion in
realtime.

 <dc:description>  Graph theory has provided a very useful tool, called topological indices
which are a number obtained from the graph $G$ with the property that every

$G$ and $H$. In this article, we present exact expressions for some topological
indices of k-th subdivision graph and semi total point graphs respectively,
which are a generalization of ordinary subdivision and semi total graph for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Being less resource languages, Indian-Indian and English-Indian language MT
system developments faces the difficulty to translate various lexical
phenomena. In this paper, we present our work on a comparative study of 440
phrase-based statistical trained models for 110 language pairs across 11 Indian
languages. We have developed 110 baseline Statistical Machine Translation
systems. Then we have augmented the training corpus with Indowordnet synset
word entries of lexical database and further trained 110 models on top of the
baseline system. We have done a detailed performance comparison using various
evaluation metrics such as BLEU score, METEOR and TER. We observed significant
improvement in evaluations of translation quality across all the 440 models
after using the Indowordnet. These experiments give a detailed insight in two
ways : (1) usage of lexical database with synset mapping for resource poor
languages (2) efficient usage of Indowordnet sysnset mapping. More over, synset
mapped lexical entries helped the SMT system to handle the ambiguity to a great
extent during the translation.

 <dc:title>Compression of data streams down to their information content</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Barmpalias, George</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  According to Kolmogorov complexity, every finite binary string is
compressible to a shortest code -- its information content -- from which it is
effectively recoverable. We investigate the extent to which this holds for
infinite binary sequences (streams). We devise a new coding method which
uniformly codes every stream $X$ into an algorithmically random stream $Y$, in
such a way that the first $n$ bits of $X$ are recoverable from the first
$I(X\upharpoonright_n)$ bits of $Y$, where $I$ is any partial computable
information content measure which is defined on all prefixes of $X$, and where
$X\restr_n$ is the initial segment of $X$ of length $n$. As a consequence, if
$g$ is any computable upper bound on the initial segment prefix-free complexity
of $X$, then $X$ is computable from an algorithmically random $Y$ with
oracle-use at most $g$. Alternatively (making no use of such a computable bound
$g$) one can achieve an oracle-use bounded above by $K(X\upharpoonright_n)+\log
n$. This provides a strong analogue of Shannon's source coding theorem for
algorithmic information theory.

 <dc:description>  When translating into morphologically rich languages, Statistical MT
approaches face the problem of data sparsity. The severity of the sparseness
problem will be high when the corpus size of morphologically richer language is
less. Even though we can use factored models to correctly generate
morphological forms of words, the problem of data sparseness limits their
performance. In this paper, we describe a simple and effective solution which
is based on enriching the input corpora with various morphological forms of
words. We use this method with the phrase-based and factor-based experiments on
two morphologically rich languages: Hindi and Marathi when translating from
English. We evaluate the performance of our experiments both in terms automatic
evaluation and subjective evaluation such as adequacy and fluency. We observe
that the morphology injection method helps in improving the quality of
translation. We further analyze that the morph injection method helps in
handling the data sparseness problem to a great level.

 <dc:description>  We used neural networks in ~3,000 sleep recordings from over 10 locations to
automate sleep stage scoring, producing a probability distribution called an
hypnodensity graph. Accuracy was validated in 70 subjects scored by six
technicians (gold standard). Our best model performed better than any
individual scorer, reaching an accuracy of 0.87 (and 0.95 when predictions are
weighed by scorer agreement). It also scores sleep stages down to 5-second
instead of the conventional 30-second scoring-epochs. Accuracy did not vary by
sleep disorder except for narcolepsy, suggesting scoring difficulties by
machine and/or humans. A narcolepsy biomarker was extracted and validated in
105 type-1 narcoleptics versus 331 controls producing a specificity of 0.96 and
a sensitivity of 0.91. Similar performances were obtained against a high
pretest probability sample of type-2 narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia
patients. Addition of HLA-DQB1*06:02 increased specificity to 0.99. Our method
streamlines scoring and diagnoses narcolepsy accurately.

 <dc:description>  We present a framework for machine translation evaluation using neural
networks in a pairwise setting, where the goal is to select the better
translation from a pair of hypotheses, given the reference translation. In this
framework, lexical, syntactic and semantic information from the reference and
the two hypotheses is embedded into compact distributed vector representations,
and fed into a multi-layer neural network that models nonlinear interactions
between each of the hypotheses and the reference, as well as between the two
hypotheses. We experiment with the benchmark datasets from the WMT Metrics
shared task, on which we obtain the best results published so far, with the
basic network configuration. We also perform a series of experiments to analyze
and understand the contribution of the different components of the network. We
evaluate variants and extensions, including fine-tuning of the semantic
embeddings, and sentence-based representations modeled with convolutional and
recurrent neural networks. In summary, the proposed framework is flexible and
generalizable, allows for efficient learning and scoring, and provides an MT
evaluation metric that correlates with human judgments, and is on par with the
state of the art.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present our work on the creation of lexical resources for
the Machine Translation between English and Hindi. We describes the development
of phrase pair mappings for our experiments and the comparative performance
evaluation between different trained models on top of the baseline Statistical
Machine Translation system. We focused on augmenting the parallel corpus with
more vocabulary as well as with various inflected forms by exploring different
ways. We have augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources such
as lexical words, synset words, function words and verb phrases. We have
described the case studies, automatic and subjective evaluations, detailed
error analysis for both the English to Hindi and Hindi to English machine
translation systems. We further analyzed that, there is an incremental growth
in the quality of machine translation with the usage of various lexical
resources. Thus lexical resources do help uplift the translation quality of
resource poor langugaes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we have derived a set of sufficient conditions for reliable
clustering of data produced by Bernoulli Mixture Models (BMM), when the number
of clusters is unknown. A BMM refers to a random binary vector whose components
are independent Bernoulli trials with cluster-specific frequencies. The problem
of clustering BMM data arises in many real-world applications, most notably in
population genetics where researchers aim at inferring the population structure
from multilocus genotype data. Our findings stipulate a minimum dataset size
and a minimum number of Bernoulli trials (or genotyped loci) per sample, such
that the existence of a clustering algorithm with a sufficient accuracy is
guaranteed. Moreover, the mathematical intuitions and tools behind our work can
help researchers in designing more effective and theoretically-plausible
heuristic methods for similar problems.

 <dc:description>  A current challenge for data management systems is to support the
construction and maintenance of machine learning models over data that is
large, multi-dimensional, and evolving. While systems that could support these
tasks are emerging, the need to scale to distributed, streaming data requires
new models and algorithms. In this setting, as well as computational
scalability and model accuracy, we also need to minimize the amount of
communication between distributed processors, which is the chief component of
latency. We study Bayesian networks, the workhorse of graphical models, and
present a communication-efficient method for continuously learning and
maintaining a Bayesian network model over data that is arriving as a
distributed stream partitioned across multiple processors. We show a strategy
for maintaining model parameters that leads to an exponential reduction in
communication when compared with baseline approaches to maintain the exact MLE
(maximum likelihood estimation). Meanwhile, our strategy provides similar
prediction errors for the target distribution and for classification tasks.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Tiered Sampling, a novel technique for approximate counting
sparse motifs in massive graphs whose edges are observed in a stream. Our
technique requires only a single pass on the data and uses a memory of fixed
size $M$, which can be magnitudes smaller than the number of edges.
  Our methods addresses the challenging task of counting sparse motifs -
sub-graph patterns that have low probability to appear in a sample of $M$ edges
in the graph, which is the maximum amount of data available to the algorithms
in each step. To obtain an unbiased and low variance estimate of the count we
partition the available memory to tiers (layers) of reservoir samples. While
the base layer is a standard reservoir sample of edges, other layers are
reservoir samples of sub-structures of the desired motif. By storing more
frequent sub-structures of the motif, we increase the probability of detecting
an occurrence of the sparse motif we are counting, thus decreasing the variance
and error of the estimate.
  We demonstrate the advantage of our method in the specific applications of
counting sparse 4 and 5-cliques in massive graphs. We present a complete
analytical analysis and extensive experimental results using both synthetic and
real-world data. Our results demonstrate the advantage of our method in
obtaining high-quality approximations for the number of 4 and 5-cliques for
large graphs using a very limited amount of memory, significantly outperforming
the single edge sample approach for counting sparse motifs in large scale
graphs.

 <dc:title>Anatomical Pattern Analysis for decoding visual stimuli in human brains</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Background: A universal unanswered question in neuroscience and machine
learning is whether computers can decode the patterns of the human brain.
Multi-Voxels Pattern Analysis (MVPA) is a critical tool for addressing this
question. However, there are two challenges in the previous MVPA methods, which
include decreasing sparsity and noise in the extracted features and increasing
the performance of prediction.
  Methods: In overcoming mentioned challenges, this paper proposes Anatomical
Pattern Analysis (APA) for decoding visual stimuli in the human brain. This
framework develops a novel anatomical feature extraction method and a new
imbalance AdaBoost algorithm for binary classification. Further, it utilizes an
Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) method for multiclass prediction. APA can
automatically detect active regions for each category of the visual stimuli.
Moreover, it enables us to combine homogeneous datasets for applying advanced
classification.
  Results and Conclusions: Experimental studies on 4 visual categories (words,
consonants, objects and scrambled photos) demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Grasping Unknown Objects in Clutter by Superquadric Representation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a quick and efficient method is presented for grasping unknown
objects in clutter. The grasping method relies on real-time superquadric (SQ)
representation of partial view objects and incomplete object modelling, well
suited for unknown symmetric objects in cluttered scenarios which is followed
by optimized antipodal grasping. The incomplete object models are processed
through a mirroring algorithm that assumes symmetry to first create an
approximate complete model and then fit for SQ representation. The grasping
algorithm is designed for maximum force balance and stability, taking advantage
of the quick retrieval of dimension and surface curvature information from the
SQ parameters. The pose of the SQs with respect to the direction of gravity is
calculated and used together with the parameters of the SQs and specification
of the gripper, to select the best direction of approach and contact points.
The SQ fitting method has been tested on custom datasets containing objects in
isolation as well as in clutter. The grasping algorithm is evaluated on a PR2
and real time results are presented. Initial results indicate that though the
method is based on simplistic shape information, it outperforms other learning
based grasping algorithms that also work in clutter in terms of time-efficiency
and accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel multiframe scene flow approach that jointly optimizes
the consistency of the patch appearances and their local rigid motions from
RGB-D image sequences. In contrast to the competing methods, we take advantage
of an oversegmentation of the reference frame and robust optimization
techniques. We formulate scene flow recovery as a global non-linear least
squares problem which is iteratively solved by a damped Gauss-Newton approach.
As a result, we obtain a qualitatively new level of accuracy in RGB-D based
scene flow estimation which can potentially run in real-time. Our method can
handle challenging cases with rigid, piecewise rigid, articulated and moderate
non-rigid motion, and does not rely on prior knowledge about the types of
motions and deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>A monolithic fluid-structure interaction formulation for solid and

 <dc:description>  A unified fluid-structure interaction (FSI) formulation is presented for
solid, liquid and mixed membranes. Nonlinear finite elements (FE) and the
generalized-alpha scheme are used for the spatial and temporal discretization.
The membrane discretization is based on curvilinear surface elements that can
describe large deformations and rotations, and also provide a straightforward
description for contact. The fluid is described by the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations, and its discretization is based on stabilized
Petrov-Galerkin FE. The coupling between fluid and structure uses a conforming
sharp interface discretization, and the resulting non-linear FE equations are
solved monolithically within the Newton-Raphson scheme. An arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation is used for the fluid in order to account for
the mesh motion around the structure. The formulation is very general and
admits diverse applications that include contact at free surfaces. This is
demonstrated by two analytical and three numerical examples. They include
balloon inflation, droplet rolling and flapping flags. They span a
Reynolds-number range from 0.001 to 2000. One of the examples considers the
extension to rotation-free shells using isogeometric FE.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The benefits of legged locomotion shown in nature overcome challenges such as
obstacles or terrain smoothness typically encountered with wheeled vehicles.
This paper evaluates the benefits of using optimal control on a single leg
hopper during the entire hopping motion. Basic control without considering
physical constraints is implemented through hand-tuned PD controllers following
the Raibert control framework. The differential flatness of the first-order
equations of motion and the Liouvillian property for the second-order equations
for the hopper system are proved, enabling flat outputs for control. A
two-point boundary value problem (BVP) is then used to minimize jerk in the
flat system to gain implicit smoothness in the output controls. This smoothness
ensures that the planned trajectories are feasible, allowing for given
waypoints to be reached.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate a compact and easy-to-build computational camera for
single-shot 3D imaging. Our lensless system consists solely of a diffuser
placed in front of a standard image sensor. Every point within the volumetric
field-of-view projects a unique pseudorandom pattern of caustics on the sensor.
By using a physical approximation and simple calibration scheme, we solve the
large-scale inverse problem in a computationally efficient way. The caustic
patterns enable compressed sensing, which exploits sparsity in the sample to
solve for more 3D voxels than pixels on the 2D sensor. Our 3D voxel grid is
chosen to match the experimentally measured two-point optical resolution across
the field-of-view, resulting in 100 million voxels being reconstructed from a
single 1.3 megapixel image. However, the effective resolution varies
significantly with scene content. Because this effect is common to a wide range
of computational cameras, we provide new theory for analyzing resolution in
such systems.

 <dc:description>  Multi-face tracking in unconstrained videos is a challenging problem as faces
of one person often appear drastically different in multiple shots due to
significant variations in scale, pose, expression, illumination, and make-up.
Existing multi-target tracking methods often use low-level features which are
not sufficiently discriminative for identifying faces with such large
appearance variations. In this paper, we tackle this problem by learning
discriminative, video-specific face representations using convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Unlike existing CNN-based approaches which are only trained on
large-scale face image datasets offline, we use the contextual constraints to
generate a large number of training samples for a given video, and further
adapt the pre-trained face CNN to specific videos using discovered training
samples. Using these training samples, we optimize the embedding space so that
the Euclidean distances correspond to a measure of semantic face similarity via
minimizing a triplet loss function. With the learned discriminative features,
we apply the hierarchical clustering algorithm to link tracklets across
multiple shots to generate trajectories. We extensively evaluate the proposed
algorithm on two sets of TV sitcoms and YouTube music videos, analyze the
contribution of each component, and demonstrate significant performance
improvement over existing techniques.

 <dc:description>  In a social network, influence maximization is the problem of identifying a
set of users that own the maximum {\it influence ability} across the network.
In this paper, a novel credit distribution (CD) based model, termed as the
multi-action CD (mCD) model, is introduced to quantify the influence ability of
each user, which works with practical datasets where one type of action could
be recorded for multiple times. Based on this model, influence maximization is
formulated as a submodular maximization problem under a general knapsack
constraint, which is NP-hard. An efficient streaming algorithm with one-round
scan over the user set is developed to find a suboptimal solution.
Specifically, we first solve a special case of knapsack constraints, i.e., a
cardinality constraint, and show that the developed streaming algorithm can
achieve ($\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon$)-approximation of the optimality. Furthermore,
for the general knapsack case, we show that the modified streaming algorithm
can achieve ($\frac{1}{3}-\epsilon$)-approximation of the optimality. Finally,
experiments are conducted over real Twitter dataset and demonstrate that the
mCD model enjoys high accuracy compared to the conventional CD model in
estimating the total number of people who get influenced in a social network.
Moreover, through the comparison to the conventional CD, non-CD models, and the
mCD model with the greedy algorithm on the performance of the influence
maximization problem, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
mCD model with the streaming algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We study preferential attachment mechanisms in random graphs that are
parameterized by (i) a constant bias affecting the degree-biased distribution
on the vertex set and (ii) the distribution of times at which new vertices are
created by the model. The class of random graphs so defined admits a
representation theorem reminiscent of residual allocation, or &quot;stick-breaking&quot;
schemes. We characterize how the vertex arrival times affect the asymptotic
degree distribution, and relate the latter to neutral-to-the-left processes.
Our random graphs generate edges &quot;one end at a time&quot;, which sets up a
one-to-one correspondence between random graphs and random partitions of
natural numbers; via this map, our representation induces a result on (not
necessarily exchangeable) random partitions that generalizes a theorem of
Griffiths and Span\'o. A number of examples clarify how the class intersects
with several known random graph models.

at the roots of a suitable trace function. We give conditions for

 <dc:description>  While clustering is one of the most popular methods for data mining, analysts
lack adequate tools for quick, iterative clustering analysis, which is
essential for hypothesis generation and data reasoning. We introduce
Clustrophile, an interactive tool for iteratively computing discrete and
continuous data clusters, rapidly exploring different choices of clustering
parameters, and reasoning about clustering instances in relation to data
dimensions. Clustrophile combines three basic visualizations -- a table of raw
datasets, a scatter plot of planar projections, and a matrix diagram (heatmap)
of discrete clusterings -- through interaction and intermediate visual
encoding. Clustrophile also contributes two spatial interaction techniques,
$\textit{forward projection}$ and $\textit{backward projection}$, and a
visualization method, $\textit{prolines}$, for reasoning about two-dimensional
projections obtained through dimensionality reductions.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Thompson Sampling algorithm is a well known Bayesian algorithm for solving
stochastic multi-armed bandit. At each time step the algorithm chooses each arm
with probability proportional to it being the current best arm. We modify the
strategy by introducing a paramter h which alters the importance of the
probability of an arm being the current best arm. We show that the optimality
of Thompson sampling is robust to this perturbation within a range of parameter
values for two arm bandits.

 <dc:description>  Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) could potentially be coordinated to
safely attain the maximum traffic flow on roadways under dynamic traffic
patterns, such as those engendered by the merger of two strings of vehicles due
a lane drop. Strings of vehicles have to be shaped correctly in terms of the
inter-vehicular time-gap and velocity to ensure that such operation is
feasible. However, controllers that can achieve such traffic shaping over the
multiple dimensions of target time-gap and velocity over a region of space are
unknown. The objective of this work is to design such a controller, and to show
that we can design candidate time-gap and velocity profiles such that it can
stabilize the string of vehicles in attaining the target profiles. Our analysis
is based on studying the system in the spacial rather than the time domain,
which enables us to study stability as in terms of minimizing errors from the
target profile and across vehicles as a function of location. Finally, we
conduct numeral simulations in the context of shaping two platoons for merger,
which we use to illustrate how to select time-gap and velocity profiles for
maximizing flow and maintaining safety.

 <dc:title>Ground Edge based LIDAR Localization without a Reflectivity Calibration
  for Autonomous Driving</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Castorena, Juan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Agarwal, Siddharth</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we propose an alternative formulation to the problem of ground
reflectivity grid based localization involving laser scanned data from multiple
LIDARs mounted on autonomous vehicles. The driving idea of our localization
formulation is an alternative edge reflectivity grid representation which is
invariant to laser source, angle of incidence, range and robot surveying
motion. Such property eliminates the need of the post-factory reflectivity
calibration whose time requirements are infeasible in mass produced
robots/vehicles. Our experiments demonstrate that we can achieve better
performance than state of the art on ground reflectivity inference-map based
localization at no additional computational burden.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural networks have been used prominently in several machine learning and
statistics applications. In general, the underlying optimization of neural
networks is non-convex which makes their performance analysis challenging. In
this paper, we take a novel approach to this problem by asking whether one can
constrain neural network weights to make its optimization landscape have good
theoretical properties while at the same time, be a good approximation for the
unconstrained one. For two-layer neural networks, we provide affirmative
answers to these questions by introducing Porcupine Neural Networks (PNNs)
whose weight vectors are constrained to lie over a finite set of lines. We show
that most local optima of PNN optimizations are global while we have a
characterization of regions where bad local optimizers may exist. Moreover, our
theoretical and empirical results suggest that an unconstrained neural network
can be approximated using a polynomially-large PNN.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports on the QBF solver QFUN that has won the non-CNF track in
the recent QBF evaluation. The solver is motivated by the fact that it is easy
to construct Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBFs) with short winning strategies
(Skolem/Herbrand functions) but are hard to solve by nowadays solvers. This
paper argues that a solver benefits from generalizing a set of individual wins
into a strategy. This idea is realized on top of the competitive RAReQS
algorithm by utilizing machine learning. The results of the implemented
prototype are highly encouraging.

 <dc:title>Exploration in Feature Space for Reinforcement Learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sasikumar, Suraj Narayanan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The infamous exploration-exploitation dilemma is one of the oldest and most
important problems in reinforcement learning (RL). Deliberate and effective
exploration is necessary for RL agents to succeed in most environments.
However, until very recently even very sophisticated RL algorithms employed
simple, undirected exploration strategies in large-scale RL tasks.
  We introduce a new optimistic count-based exploration algorithm for RL that
is feasible in high-dimensional MDPs. The success of RL algorithms in these
domains depends crucially on generalization from limited training experience.
Function approximation techniques enable RL agents to generalize in order to
estimate the value of unvisited states, but at present few methods have
achieved generalization about the agent's uncertainty regarding unvisited
states. We present a new method for computing a generalized state visit-count,
which allows the agent to estimate the uncertainty associated with any state.
  In contrast to existing exploration techniques, our
$\phi$-$\textit{pseudocount}$ achieves generalization by exploiting the feature
representation of the state space that is used for value function
approximation. States that have less frequently observed features are deemed
more uncertain. The resulting $\phi$-$\textit{Exploration-Bonus}$ algorithm
rewards the agent for exploring in feature space rather than in the original
state space. This method is simpler and less computationally expensive than
some previous proposals, and achieves near state-of-the-art results on
high-dimensional RL benchmarks. In particular, we report world-class results on
several notoriously difficult Atari 2600 video games, including Montezuma's
Revenge.

 <dc:description>  Video denoising refers to the problem of removing &quot;noise&quot; from a video
sequence. Here the term &quot;noise&quot; is used in a broad sense to refer to any
corruption or outlier or interference that is not the quantity of interest. In
this work, we develop a novel approach to video denoising that is based on the
idea that many noisy or corrupted videos can be split into three parts - the
&quot;low-rank layer&quot;, the &quot;sparse layer&quot;, and a small residual (which is small and
bounded). We show, using extensive experiments, that our denoising approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art denoising algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Lifted Relational Neural Networks (LRNNs) describe relational domains using
weighted first-order rules which act as templates for constructing feed-forward
neural networks. While previous work has shown that using LRNNs can lead to
state-of-the-art results in various ILP tasks, these results depended on
hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we extend the framework of LRNNs with
structure learning, thus enabling a fully automated learning process. Similarly
to many ILP methods, our structure learning algorithm proceeds in an iterative
fashion by top-down searching through the hypothesis space of all possible Horn
clauses, considering the predicates that occur in the training examples as well
as invented soft concepts entailed by the best weighted rules found so far. In
the experiments, we demonstrate the ability to automatically induce useful
hierarchical soft concepts leading to deep LRNNs with a competitive predictive
power.

 <dc:description>  Learning with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on long sequences is a
notoriously difficult task. There are three major challenges: 1) complex
dependencies, 2) vanishing and exploding gradients, and 3) efficient
parallelization. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective RNN
connection structure, the DilatedRNN, which simultaneously tackles all of these
challenges. The proposed architecture is characterized by multi-resolution
dilated recurrent skip connections and can be combined flexibly with diverse
RNN cells. Moreover, the DilatedRNN reduces the number of parameters needed and
enhances training efficiency significantly, while matching state-of-the-art
performance (even with standard RNN cells) in tasks involving very long-term
dependencies. To provide a theory-based quantification of the architecture's
advantages, we introduce a memory capacity measure, the mean recurrent length,
which is more suitable for RNNs with long skip connections than existing
measures. We rigorously prove the advantages of the DilatedRNN over other
recurrent neural architectures. The code for our method is publicly available
at https://github.com/code-terminator/DilatedRNN

 <dc:description>  We present LOOM (Line-Ordering Optimized Maps), a fully automatic generator
of geographically accurate transit maps. The input to LOOM is data about the
lines of a given transit network, namely for each line, the sequence of
stations it serves and the geographical course the vehicles of this line take.
We parse this data from GTFS, the prevailing standard for public transit data.
LOOM proceeds in three stages: (1) construct a so-called line graph, where
edges correspond to segments of the network with the same set of lines
following the same course; (2) construct an ILP that yields a line ordering for
each edge which minimizes the total number of line crossings and line
separations; (3) based on the line graph and the ILP solution, draw the map. As
a naive ILP formulation is too demanding, we derive a new custom-tailored
formulation which requires significantly fewer constraints. Furthermore, we
present engineering techniques which use structural properties of the line
graph to further reduce the ILP size. For the subway network of New York, we
can reduce the number of constraints from 229,000 in the naive ILP formulation
to about 4,500 with our techniques, enabling solution times of less than a
second. Since our maps respect the geography of the transit network, they can
be used for tiles and overlays in typical map services. Previous research work
either did not take the geographical course of the lines into account, or was
concerned with schematic maps without optimizing line crossings or line
separations.

a broad range of chemistry research problems. Recently, we reported on the
development of Chemception, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture for general-purpose small molecule property prediction. In this
work, we investigate the effects of systematically removing and adding basic
chemical information to the image channels of the 2D images used to train
Chemception. By augmenting images with only 3 additional basic chemical
information, we demonstrate that Chemception now outperforms contemporary deep
learning models trained on more sophisticated chemical representations
(molecular fingerprints) for the prediction of toxicity, activity, and
solvation free energy, as well as physics-based free energy simulation methods.
Thus, our work demonstrates that a firm grasp of first-principles chemical
knowledge is not a pre-requisite for deep learning models to accurately predict
chemical properties. Lastly, by altering the chemical information content in
the images, and examining the resulting performance of Chemception, we also
identify two different learning patterns in predicting toxicity/activity as
compared to solvation free energy, and these patterns suggest that Chemception
is learning about its tasks in the manner that is consistent with established
knowledge.

 <dc:description>  We solve a system of ordinary differential equations with an unknown
functional form of a sink (reaction rate) term. We assume that the measurements
(time series) of state variables are partially available, and we use recurrent
neural network to &quot;learn&quot; the reaction rate from this data. This is achieved by
including a discretized ordinary differential equations as part of a recurrent
neural network training problem. We extend TensorFlow's recurrent neural
network architecture to create a simple but scalable and effective solver for
the unknown functions, and apply it to a fedbatch bioreactor simulation
problem. Use of techniques from recent deep learning literature enables
training of functions with behavior manifesting over thousands of time steps.
Our networks are structurally similar to recurrent neural networks, but
differences in design and function require modifications to the conventional
wisdom about training such networks.

 <dc:description>  The recurrent temporal restricted Boltzmann machine (RTRBM) has been
successful in modelling very high dimensional sequences. However, there exists
an unsolved question of how such model can be useful for discrimination tasks.
The key issue of this is that learning is difficult due to the intractable
log-likelihood. In this paper we propose the discriminative variant of RTRBM.
We show that discriminative learning is easier than its generative counterparts
where exact gradient can be computed analytically. In the experiments we
evaluate RTDRBM on sequence modelling and sequence labelling which outperforms
other baselines, notably the recurrent neural networks, hidden Markov models,
and conditional random fields. More interestingly, the model is comparable to
recurrent neural networks with complex memory gates while requiring less
parameters.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study two aspects of the variational autoencoder (VAE): the
prior distribution over the latent variables and its corresponding posterior.
First, we decompose the learning of VAEs into layerwise density estimation, and
argue that having a flexible prior is beneficial to both sample generation and
inference. Second, we analyze the family of inverse autoregressive flows
(inverse AF) and show that with further improvement, inverse AF could be used
as universal approximation to any complicated posterior. Our analysis results
in a unified approach to parameterizing a VAE, without the need to restrict
ourselves to use factorial Gaussians in the latent real space.

 <dc:description>  Networks often exhibit structure at disparate scales. We propose a method for
identifying community structure at different scales based on multiresolution
modularity and consensus clustering. Our contribution consists of two parts.
First, we propose a strategy for sampling the entire range of possible
resolutions for the multiresolution modularity quality function. Our approach
is directly based on the properties of modularity and, in particular, provides
a natural way of avoiding the need to increase the resolution parameter by
several orders of magnitude to break a few remaining small communities,
necessitating the introduction of ad-hoc limits to the resolution range with
standard sampling approaches. Second, we propose a hierarchical consensus
clustering procedure, based on a modified modularity, that allows one to
construct a hierarchical consensus structure given a set of input partitions.
While here we are interested in its application to partitions sampled using
multiresolution modularity, this consensus clustering procedure can be applied
to the output of any clustering algorithm. As such, we see many potential
applications of the individual parts of our multiresolution consensus
clustering procedure in addition to using the procedure itself to identify
hierarchical structure in networks.

 <dc:description>  The problem of network function computation over a directed acyclic network
is investigated in this paper. In such a network, a sink node desires to
compute with zero error a {\em target function}, of which the inputs are
generated at multiple source nodes. The edges in the network are assumed to be
error-free and have limited capacity. The nodes in the network are assumed to
have unbounded computing capability and be able to perform network coding. The
{\em computing rate} of a network code that can compute the target function
over the network is the average number of times that the target function is
computed with zero error for one use of the network. In this paper, we obtain
an improved upper bound on the computing capacity, which is applicable to
arbitrary target functions and arbitrary network topologies. This improved
upper bound not only is an enhancement of the previous upper bounds but also is
the first tight upper bound on the computing capacity for computing an
arithmetic sum over a certain non-tree network, which has been widely studied
in the literature. We also introduce a multi-dimensional array approach that
facilitates evaluation of the improved upper bound. Furthermore, we apply this
bound to the problem of computing a vector-linear function over a network. With
this bound, we are able to not only enhance a previous result on computing a
vector-linear function over a network but also simplify the proof
significantly. Finally, we prove that for computing the binary maximum function
over the reverse butterfly network, our improved upper bound is not achievable.
This result establishes that in general our improved upper bound is non
achievable, but whether it is asymptotically achievable or not remains open.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks have shown remarkable success in modeling
sequences. However low resource situations still adversely affect the
generalizability of these models. We introduce a new family of models, called
Lattice Recurrent Units (LRU), to address the challenge of learning deep
multi-layer recurrent models with limited resources. LRU models achieve this
goal by creating distinct (but coupled) flow of information inside the units: a
first flow along time dimension and a second flow along depth dimension. It
also offers a symmetry in how information can flow horizontally and vertically.
We analyze the effects of decoupling three different components of our LRU
model: Reset Gate, Update Gate and Projected State. We evaluate this family on
new LRU models on computational convergence rates and statistical efficiency.
Our experiments are performed on four publicly-available datasets, comparing
with Grid-LSTM and Recurrent Highway networks. Our results show that LRU has
better empirical computational convergence rates and statistical efficiency
values, along with learning more accurate language models.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method for effective retrieval of multi-agent
spatiotemporal tracking data. Retrieval of spatiotemporal tracking data offers
several unique challenges compared to conventional text-based retrieval
settings. Most notably, the data is fine-grained meaning that the specific
location of agents is important in describing behavior. Additionally, the data
often contains tracks of multiple agents (e.g., multiple players in a sports
game), which generally leads to a permutational alignment problem when
performing relevance estimation. Due to the frequent position swap of agents,
it is difficult to maintain the correspondence of agents, and such issues make
the pairwise comparison problematic for multi-agent spatiotemporal data. To
address this issue, we propose a tree-based method to estimate the relevance
between multi-agent spatiotemporal tracks. It uses a hierarchical structure to
perform multi-agent data alignment and partitioning in a coarse-to-fine
fashion. We validate our approach via user studies with domain experts. Our
results show that our method boosts performance in retrieving similar sports
plays -- especially in interactive situations where the user selects a subset
of trajectories compared to current state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Efficient and real time segmentation of color images has a variety of
importance in many fields of computer vision such as image compression, medical
imaging, mapping and autonomous navigation. Being one of the most
computationally expensive operation, it is usually done through software imple-
mentation using high-performance processors. In robotic systems, however, with
the constrained platform dimensions and the need for portability, low power
consumption and simultaneously the need for real time image segmentation, we
envision hardware parallelism as the way forward to achieve higher
acceleration. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are among the best suited
for this task as they provide high computing power in a small physical area.
They exceed the computing speed of software based implementations by breaking
the paradigm of sequential execution and accomplishing more per clock cycle
operations by enabling hardware level parallelization at an architectural
level. In this paper, we propose three novel architectures of a well known
Efficient Graph based Image Segmentation algorithm. These proposed
implementations optimizes time and power consumption when compared to software
implementations. The hybrid design proposed, has notable furtherance of
acceleration capabilities delivering atleast 2X speed gain over other implemen-
tations, which henceforth allows real time image segmentation that can be
deployed on Mobile Robotic systems.

 <dc:description>  Given sparse multi-dimensional data (e.g., (user, movie, time; rating) for
movie recommendations), how can we discover latent concepts/relations and
predict missing values? Tucker factorization has been widely used to solve such
problems with multi-dimensional data, which are modeled as tensors. However,
most Tucker factorization algorithms regard and estimate missing entries as
zeros, which triggers a highly inaccurate decomposition. Moreover, few methods
focusing on an accuracy exhibit limited scalability since they require huge
memory and heavy computational costs while updating factor matrices. In this
paper, we propose P-Tucker, a scalable Tucker factorization method for sparse
tensors. P-Tucker performs an alternating least squares with a gradient-based
update rule in a fully parallel way, which significantly reduces memory
requirements for updating factor matrices. Furthermore, we offer two variants
of P-Tucker: a caching algorithm P-Tucker-CACHE and an approximation algorithm
P-Tucker-APPROX, both of which accelerate the update process. Experimental
results show that P-Tucker exhibits 1.7-14.1x speed-up and 1.4-4.8x less error
compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, P-Tucker scales near linearly
with the number of non-zeros in a tensor and number of threads. Thanks to
P-Tucker, we successfully discover hidden concepts and relations in a
large-scale real-world tensor, while existing methods cannot reveal latent
features due to their limited scalability or low accuracy.

closest vector problem in lattices. Specifically, we construct lattices based
on properties of polynomials for which the closest vector problem is hard to
solve unless some trapdoor information is revealed. We thoroughly analyze the
security of our proposed functions using state-of-the-art attacks and results
on lattice reductions. Finally, we describe how our functions can be used to
design quantum-safe encryption schemes with reasonable public key sizes. In
particular, our scheme can offer around $106$ bits of security with a public
key size of around $6.4$ $\texttt{KB}$. Our encryption schemes are efficient
with respect to key generation, encryption and decryption.

 <dc:description>  We develop a method for comparing hierarchical image representations in terms
of their ability to explain perceptual sensitivity in humans. Specifically, we
utilize Fisher information to establish a model-derived prediction of
sensitivity to local perturbations of an image. For a given image, we compute
the eigenvectors of the Fisher information matrix with largest and smallest
eigenvalues, corresponding to the model-predicted most- and least-noticeable
image distortions, respectively. For human subjects, we then measure the amount
of each distortion that can be reliably detected when added to the image, and
compare these thresholds to the predictions of the corresponding model. We use
this method to test the ability of a variety of representations to mimic human
perceptual sensitivity. We find that the early layers of VGG16, a deep neural
network optimized for object recognition, provide a better match to human
perception than later layers, and a better match than a 4-stage convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained on a database of human ratings of distorted image
quality. On the other hand, we find that simple models of early visual
processing, incorporating one or more stages of local gain control, trained on
the same database of distortion ratings, provide substantially better
predictions of human sensitivity than both the CNN and all layers of VGG16.

 <dc:description>  The classification of time series data is a challenge common to all
data-driven fields. However, there is no agreement about which are the most
efficient techniques to group unlabeled time-ordered data. This is because a
successful classification of time series patterns depends on the goal and the
domain of interest, i.e. it is application-dependent.
  In this article, we study free-to-play game data. In this domain, clustering
similar time series information is increasingly important due to the large
amount of data collected by current mobile and web applications. We evaluate
which methods cluster accurately time series of mobile games, focusing on
player behavior data. We identify and validate several aspects of the
clustering: the similarity measures and the representation techniques to reduce
the high dimensionality of time series. As a robustness test, we compare
various temporal datasets of player activity from two free-to-play video-games.
  With these techniques we extract temporal patterns of player behavior
relevant for the evaluation of game events and game-business diagnosis. Our
experiments provide intuitive visualizations to validate the results of the
clustering and to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, we
assess the common characteristics of the players belonging to the same group.
This study allows us to improve the understanding of player dynamics and churn
behavior.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the automated categorization and extraction of scientific
concepts from titles of scientific articles, in order to gain a deeper
understanding of their key contributions and facilitate the construction of a
generic academic knowledgebase. Towards this goal, we propose an unsupervised,
domain-independent, and scalable two-phase algorithm to type and extract key
concept mentions into aspects of interest (e.g., Techniques, Applications,
etc.). In the first phase of our algorithm we propose PhraseType, a
probabilistic generative model which exploits textual features and limited POS
tags to broadly segment text snippets into aspect-typed phrases. We extend this
model to simultaneously learn aspect-specific features and identify academic
domains in multi-domain corpora, since the two tasks mutually enhance each
other. In the second phase, we propose an approach based on adaptor grammars to
extract fine grained concept mentions from the aspect-typed phrases without the
need for any external resources or human effort, in a purely data-driven
manner. We apply our technique to study literature from diverse scientific
domains and show significant gains over state-of-the-art concept extraction
techniques. We also present a qualitative analysis of the results obtained.

 <dc:title>Capacity of a Full-Duplex Wirelessly Powered Communication System with
  Self-Interference and Processing Cost</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the capacity of a point-to-point, full-duplex
(FD), wirelessly powered communication system impaired by self-interference.
This system is comprised of an energy transmitter (ET) and an energy harvesting
user (EHU), both operating in a FD mode. The ET transmits energy towards the
EHU. The EHU harvests this energy and uses it to transmit information back to
the ET. As a result of the FD mode, both nodes are affected by
self-interference. The self-interference has a different effect at the two
nodes: it impairs the decoding of the received signal at the ET, however, it
provides an additional source of energy for the EHU. This paper derives the
capacity of this communication system assuming a processing cost at the EHU and
additive white Gaussian noise channel with block fading. Thereby, we show that
the capacity achieving scheme is relatively simple and therefore applicable to
devices with limited resources. Moreover, our numerical results show
significant improvements in terms of data rate when the capacity achieving
strategy is employed compared to half-duplex transmission. Moreover, we show
the positive and negative effects of the self-interference at the EHU and the
ET, respectively. Furthermore, we show the crippling effect of the processing
cost and demonstrate that failing to take it into consideration gives a false
impression in terms of achievable rate.

 <dc:description>  Rumor spreading has been studied for decades, but its underlying mechanism is
still under debate, especially for those ones based on internet. By focusing on
the spreading data of six typical events on Sina Weibo, we surprisingly find
that the spreading of modern news shows some new features, i.e. either
explosively fast or slow, depending on the individual events. To understand its
mechanism, we present a Susceptible-Accepted-Recovered (SAR) model with both
information sensitivity and social reinforcement. By numerical simulations we
show that the model can reproduce the main spreading patterns of the six
typical events and the spreading speed can be promoted by increasing either the
strength of information sensitivity or the social reinforcement. Moreover, we
find that the dependence of final accepted size on some key parameters, such as
the transmission probability and information sensitivity, can change from
continuous to discontinuous when the strength of the social reinforcement is
large. An edge-based theory analysis is presented to explain the explosive
spreading by information sensitivity and social reinforcement.

 <dc:description>  Feature representations from pre-trained deep neural networks have been known
to exhibit excellent generalization and utility across a variety of related
tasks. Fine-tuning is by far the simplest and most widely used approach that
seeks to exploit and adapt these feature representations to novel tasks with
limited data. Despite the effectiveness of fine-tuning, itis often sub-optimal
and requires very careful optimization to prevent severe over-fitting to small
datasets. The problem of sub-optimality and over-fitting, is due in part to the
large number of parameters used in a typical deep convolutional neural network.
To address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective regularization
method for fine-tuning pre-trained deep networks for the task of k-shot
learning. To prevent overfitting, our key strategy is to cluster the model
parameters while ensuring intra-cluster similarity and inter-cluster diversity
of the parameters, effectively regularizing the dimensionality of the parameter
search space. In particular, we identify groups of neurons within each layer of
a deep network that shares similar activation patterns. When the network is to
be fine-tuned for a classification task using only k examples, we propagate a
single gradient to all of the neuron parameters that belong to the same group.
The grouping of neurons is non-trivial as neuron activations depend on the
distribution of the input data. To efficiently search for optimal groupings
conditioned on the input data, we propose a reinforcement learning search
strategy using recurrent networks to learn the optimal group assignments for
each network layer. Experimental results show that our method can be easily
applied to several popular convolutional neural networks and improve upon other
state-of-the-art fine-tuning based k-shot learning strategies by more than10%

 <dc:description>  We present a hybrid neural network and rule-based system that generates pop
music. Music produced by pure rule-based systems often sounds mechanical. Music
produced by machine learning sounds better, but still lacks hierarchical
temporal structure. We restore temporal hierarchy by augmenting machine
learning with a temporal production grammar, which generates the music's
overall structure and chord progressions. A compatible melody is then generated
by a conditional variational recurrent autoencoder. The autoencoder is trained
with eight-measure segments from a corpus of 10,000 MIDI files, each of which
has had its melody track and chord progressions identified heuristically. The
autoencoder maps melody into a multi-dimensional feature space, conditioned by
the underlying chord progression. A melody is then generated by feeding a
random sample from that space to the autoencoder's decoder, along with the
chord progression generated by the grammar. The autoencoder can make musically
plausible variations on an existing melody, suitable for recurring motifs. It
can also reharmonize a melody to a new chord progression, keeping the rhythm
and contour. The generated music compares favorably with that generated by
other academic and commercial software designed for the music-as-a-service
industry.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a methodology for simulating the Internet of Things (IoT)
using multi-level simulation models. With respect to conventional simulators,
this approach allows us to tune the level of detail of different parts of the
model without compromising the scalability of the simulation. As a use case, we
have developed a two-level simulator to study the deployment of smart services
over rural territories. The higher level is base on a coarse grained,
agent-based adaptive parallel and distributed simulator. When needed, this
simulator spawns OMNeT++ model instances to evaluate in more detail the issues
concerned with wireless communications in restricted areas of the simulated
world. The performance evaluation confirms the viability of multi-level
simulations for IoT environments.

 <dc:description>  Recognizing objects in natural images is an intricate problem involving
multiple conflicting objectives. Deep convolutional neural networks, trained on
large datasets, achieve convincing results and are currently the
state-of-the-art approach for this task. However, the long time needed to train
such deep networks is a major drawback. We tackled this problem by reusing a
previously trained network. For this purpose, we first trained a deep
convolutional network on the ILSVRC2012 dataset. We then maintained the learned
convolution kernels and only retrained the classification part on different
datasets. Using this approach, we achieved an accuracy of 67.68 % on CIFAR-100,
compared to the previous state-of-the-art result of 65.43 %. Furthermore, our
findings indicate that convolutional networks are able to learn generic feature
extractors that can be used for different tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we develop a converse bound on the asymptotic load threshold
of coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) schemes with K-multi packet reception capabilities
at the receiver. Density evolution is used to track the average probability of
packet segment loss and an area matching condition is applied to obtain the
converse. For any given CSA rate, the converse normalized to K increases with
K, which is in contrast with the results obtained so far for slotted ALOHA
schemes based on successive interference cancellation. We show how the derived
bound can be approached using spatially-coupled CSA.

 <dc:description>  Composed of a large variety of technologies and applications with
unprecedented complexity, the smart grid, as a cyber-physical energy system,
needs careful investigation of the interactions between the various domains
involved, especially the coupling between the power and information systems. In
this paper, two modern ways of modeling and simulating complex cyber-physical
energy systems are considered: Co-simulation and Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop
experiments. An analysis of these two approaches shows that a complementary and
joint setup with realistic behaviors of hardware equipment under a variety of
complex environments, co-simulated by several simulators from different
domains, create a complete and high performance environment to achieve a
holistic approach for smart grid validation and roll out. In the scope of
coupling these two techniques, major technical challenges are identified and
advanced solutions are outlined.

 <dc:description>  The deep reinforcement learning community has made several independent
improvements to the DQN algorithm. However, it is unclear which of these
extensions are complementary and can be fruitfully combined. This paper
examines six extensions to the DQN algorithm and empirically studies their
combination. Our experiments show that the combination provides
state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 2600 benchmark, both in terms of data
efficiency and final performance. We also provide results from a detailed
ablation study that shows the contribution of each component to overall
performance.

 <dc:description>  Seymour's decomposition theorem for regular matroids is a fundamental result
with a number of combinatorial and algorithmic applications. In this work we
demonstrate how this theorem can be used in the design of parameterized
algorithms on regular matroids. We consider the problem of covering a set of
vectors of a given finite dimensional linear space (vector space) by a subspace
generated by a set of vectors of minimum size. Specifically, in the Space Cover
problem, we are given a matrix M and a subset of its columns T; the task is to
find a minimum set F of columns of M disjoint with T such that that the linear
span of F contains all vectors of T. For graphic matroids this problem is
essentially Stainer Forest and for cographic matroids this is a generalization
of Multiway Cut. Our main result is the algorithm with running time
2^{O(k)}||M|| ^{O(1)} solving Space Cover in the case when M is a totally
unimodular matrix over rationals, where k is the size of F. In other words, we
show that on regular matroids the problem is fixed-parameter tractable
parameterized by the rank of the covering subspace.

 <dc:description>  The integration of distributed renewable energy sources and the multi-domain
behaviours inside the cyber-physical energy system (smart grids) draws up major
challenges. Their validation and roll out requires careful assessment, in term
of modelling, simulation and testing. The traditional approach focusing on a
particular object, actual hardware or a detailed model, while drastically
simplifying the remainder of the system under test, is no longer sufficient.
Real-time simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) techniques emerge as
indispensable tools for validating the behaviour of renewable sources as well
as their impact/interaction to with the cyber-physical energy system. This
paper aims to provide an overview of the present status-quo of real-time and
HIL approaches used for smart grids and their readiness for cyber-physical
experiments. We investigate the current limitations of HIL techniques and point
out necessary future developments. Subsequently, the paper highlights
challenges that need specific attention as well as ongoing actions and further
research directions.

 <dc:description>  Action completion detection is the problem of modelling the action's
progression towards localising the moment of completion - when the action's
goal is confidently considered achieved. In this work, we assess the ability of
two temporal models, namely Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long-Short Term
Memory (LSTM), to localise completion for six object interactions: switch,
plug, open, pull, pick and drink. We use a supervised approach, where
annotations of pre-completion and post-completion frames are available per
action, and fine-tuned CNN features are used to train temporal models. Tested
on the Action-Completion-2016 dataset, we detect completion within 10 frames of
annotations for ~75% of completed action sequences using both temporal models.
Results show that fine-tuned CNN features outperform hand-crafted features for
localisation, and that observing incomplete instances is necessary when
incomplete sequences are also present in the test set.

 <dc:description>  Renewables are key enablers in the plight to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
and cope with anthropogenic global warming. The intermittent nature and limited
storage capabilities of renewables culminate in new challenges that power
system operators have to deal with in order to regulate power quality and
ensure security of supply. At the same time, the increased availability of
advanced automation and communication technologies provides new opportunities
for the derivation of intelligent solutions to tackle the challenges. Previous
work has shown various new methods of operating highly interconnected power
grids, and their corresponding components, in a more effective way. As a
consequence of these developments, the traditional power system is being
transformed into a cyber-physical energy system, a smart grid. Previous and
ongoing research have tended to mainly focus on how specific aspects of smart
grids can be validated, but until there exists no integrated approach for the
analysis and evaluation of complex cyber-physical systems configurations. This
paper introduces integrated research infrastructure that provides methods and
tools for validating smart grid systems in a holistic, cyber-physical manner.
The corresponding concepts are currently being developed further in the
European project ERIGrid.

 <dc:description>  Smart grid systems are characterized by high complexity due to interactions
between a traditional passive network and active power electronic components,
coupled using communication links. Additionally, automation and information
technology plays an important role in order to operate and optimize such
cyber-physical energy systems with a high(er) penetration of fluctuating
renewable generation and controllable loads. As a result of these developments
the validation on the system level becomes much more important during the whole
engineering and deployment process, today. In earlier development stages and
for larger system configurations laboratory-based testing is not always an
option. Due to recent developments, simulation-based approaches are now an
appropriate tool to support the development, implementation, and roll-out of
smart grid solutions. This paper discusses the current state of
simulation-based approaches and outlines the necessary future research and
development directions in the domain of power and energy systems.

 <dc:title>Enumeration Problems for Regular Path Queries</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Evaluation of regular path queries (RPQs) is a central problem in graph
databases. We investigate the corresponding enumeration problem, that is, given
a graph and an RPQ, enumerate all paths in the graph that match the RPQ. We
consider several versions of this problem, corresponding to different semantics
of RPQs that have recently been considered: arbitrary paths, shortest paths,
simple paths, and trails. Whereas arbitrary and shortest paths can be
enumerated in polynomial delay, the situation is much more intricate for simple
paths and trails. For instance, already the question if a given graph contains
a simple path or trail of a certain length has cases with highly non-trivial
solutions and cases that are long-standing open problems. In this setting, we
study RPQ evaluation from a parameterized complexity perspective. We define a
class of simple transitive expressions that is prominent in practice and for
which we can prove two dichotomy-like results: one for simple paths and one for
trails paths. We observe that, even though simple path semantics and trail
semantics are intractable for RPQs in general, they are feasible for the vast
majority of the kinds of RPQs that users use in practice. At the heart of this
study is a result of independent interest on the parameterized complexity of
finding disjoint paths in graphs: the two disjoint paths problem is W[1]-hard
if parameterized by the length of one of the two paths.

 <dc:title>A Semantic Relevance Based Neural Network for Text Summarization and

 <dc:creator>Ma, Shuming</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Text summarization and text simplification are two major ways to simplify the
text for poor readers, including children, non-native speakers, and the
functionally illiterate. Text summarization is to produce a brief summary of
the main ideas of the text, while text simplification aims to reduce the
linguistic complexity of the text and retain the original meaning. Recently,
most approaches for text summarization and text simplification are based on the
sequence-to-sequence model, which achieves much success in many text generation
tasks. However, although the generated simplified texts are similar to source
texts literally, they have low semantic relevance. In this work, our goal is to
improve semantic relevance between source texts and simplified texts for text
summarization and text simplification. We introduce a Semantic Relevance Based
neural model to encourage high semantic similarity between texts and summaries.
In our model, the source text is represented by a gated attention encoder,
while the summary representation is produced by a decoder. Besides, the
similarity score between the representations is maximized during training. Our
experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art
systems on two benchmark corpus.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable regression approach for

function to convert feature maps directly to joint coordinates, resulting in a
fully differentiable framework. Our method is able to learn heat maps
representations indirectly, without additional steps of artificial ground truth
generation. Consequently, contextual information can be included to the pose
predictions in a seamless way. We evaluated our method on two very challenging
datasets, the Leeds Sports Poses (LSP) and the MPII Human Pose datasets,
reaching the best performance among all the existing regression methods and
comparable results to the state-of-the-art detection based approaches.

 <dc:title>Five-Nines Reliable Downward Routing in RPL</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  After a decade of research in low-power data collection, reaching arbitrary
nodes has received comparatively little attention. The leading protocol for
low-power IPv6 routing, RPL, is no exception, as it is often studied in
multipoint-to-point scenarios. As a result, downward routing (from root to
node) is still notoriously difficult, holding back the emergence of Internet of
Things applications that involve actuation. In this paper, we focus on
achieving industrial-grade reliability levels (1e-5 failure rate) in downward
routing with RPL. We make every packet count, and classify the different causes
of packet loss. We show how to mitigate each source of packet loss, by (1)
introducing a gradient metric that favors reliable links, (2) increasing
neighborhood awareness for accurate link selection, and (3) ensuring a robust
routing state maintenance and packet forwarding. We demonstrate RPL downward
routing with loss rates in the order of 1e-5 in four different testbeds up to
352 nodes, in both sparse and dense settings. We also validate our solution on
top of a low-power TSCH scheduler, and achieve sub-percent low duty cycles and
a channel utilization of 0.07% at every node, spread over 16 channels.

 <dc:title>Synchronizing Data Words for Register Automata</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Quaas, Karin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shirmohammadi, Mahsa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Register automata (RAs) are finite automata extended with a finite set of
registers to store and compare data from an infinite domain. We study the
concept of synchronizing data words in RAs: Does there exist a data word that
sends all states of the RA to a single state?
  For deterministic RAs with k registers (k-DRAs), we prove that inputting data
words with 2k+1 distinct data, from the infinite data domain, is sufficient to
synchronize. We show that the synchronizing problem for DRAs is in general
PSPACE-complete, and is NLOGSPACE-complete for 1-DRAs. For nondeterministic RAs
(NRAs), we show that Ackermann(n) distinct data (where n is the size of the RA)
might be necessary to synchronize. The synchronizing problem for NRAs is in
general undecidable, however, we establish Ackermann-completeness of the
problem for 1-NRAs. Our most substantial achievement is proving
NEXPTIME-completeness of the length-bounded synchronizing problem for NRAs
(length encoded in binary). A variant of this last construction allows to prove
that the bounded universality problem for NRAs is coNEXPTIME-complete.

associate a specification game where Eve plays for the Code, and Adam for the
Environment. The purpose of Eve and Adam is to decompose every intermediate
machine state of the execution trace into three pieces: one piece for the Code,
one piece for the Environment, and one piece for the available shared
resources. We establish the soundness of concurrent separation logic by
interpreting every derivation tree of the logic as a winning strategy of this
specification game.

 <dc:description>  Optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) often suffers from the ill-conditioned
problem. We observe that the scaling-based weight space symmetry property in
rectified nonlinear network will cause this negative effect. Therefore, we
propose to constrain the incoming weights of each neuron to be unit-norm, which
is formulated as an optimization problem over Oblique manifold. A simple yet
efficient method referred to as projection based weight normalization (PBWN) is
also developed to solve this problem. PBWN executes standard gradient updates,
followed by projecting the updated weight back to Oblique manifold. This
proposed method has the property of regularization and collaborates well with
the commonly used batch normalization technique. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on several widely-used image datasets including CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, SVHN and ImageNet for supervised learning over the state-of-the-art
convolutional neural networks, such as Inception, VGG and residual networks.
The results show that our method is able to improve the performance of DNNs
with different architectures consistently. We also apply our method to Ladder
network for semi-supervised learning on permutation invariant MNIST dataset,
and our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods: we obtain test errors
as 2.52%, 1.06%, and 0.91% with only 20, 50, and 100 labeled samples,
respectively.

 <dc:description>  Building upon previous work on the relation between secrecy and channel
resolvability, we revisit a secrecy proof for the multiple-access channel (MAC)
from the perspective of resolvability. In particular, we refine and extend the
proof to obtain novel results on the second-order achievable rates. Then we
characterize the resolvability region of the memoryless MAC by establishing a
conceptually simple converse proof for resolvability that relies on the uniform
continuity of Shannon's entropy with respect to the variational distance. We
discuss the operational meaning of the information theoretic concept of
semantic security from the viewpoint of Ahlswede's General Theory of
Information Transfer and show interesting implications on the resilience
against a large class of attacks even if no assumption can be made about the
distributions of the transmitted messages. Finally we provide details on how
the resolvability results can be used to construct a wiretap code that achieves
semantic security.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces &quot;Czech Text Document Corpus v 2.0&quot;, a collection of
text documents for automatic document classification in Czech language. It is
composed of 11,955 text documents provided by the Czech News Agency and is
freely available for research purposes at http://home.zcu.cz/~pkral/sw.This
corpus was created in order to facilitate a~straightforward comparison of the
document classification approaches on Czech data. It is particularly dedicated
for evaluation of multi-label document classification approaches, because one
document is usually labelled with more than one label. Besides the information
about the document classes, the corpus is annotated at morphological layer.
This paper further shows the results of selected state-of-the-art methods on
this corpus to offer the possibility of an easy comparison with these
approaches.

 <dc:description>  This work addresses the instability in asynchronous data parallel
optimization. It does so by introducing a novel distributed optimizer which is
able to efficiently optimize a centralized model under communication
constraints. The optimizer achieves this by pushing a normalized sequence of
first-order gradients to a parameter server. This implies that the magnitude of
a worker delta is smaller compared to an accumulated gradient, and provides a
better direction towards a minimum compared to first-order gradients, which in
turn also forces possible implicit momentum fluctuations to be more aligned
since we make the assumption that all workers contribute towards a single
minima. As a result, our approach mitigates the parameter staleness problem
more effectively since staleness in asynchrony induces (implicit) momentum, and
achieves a better convergence rate compared to other optimizers such as
asynchronous EASGD and DynSGD, which we show empirically.

 <dc:description>  Recently several end-to-end speaker verification systems based on deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been proposed. These systems have been proven to be
competitive for text-dependent tasks as well as for text-independent tasks with
short utterances. However, for text-independent tasks with longer utterances,
end-to-end systems are still outperformed by standard i-vector + PLDA systems.
In this work, we develop an end-to-end speaker verification system that is
initialized to mimic an i-vector + PLDA baseline. The system is then further
trained in an end-to-end manner but regularized so that it does not deviate too
far from the initial system. In this way we mitigate overfitting which normally
limits the performance of end-to-end systems. The proposed system outperforms
the i-vector + PLDA baseline on both long and short duration utterances.

 <dc:title>Active Attack on User Load Achieving Pilot Design in Massive MIMO

 <dc:creator>Akbar, Noman</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an active attacking strategy on a massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, where the pilot sequences are
obtained using the user load-achieving pilot sequence design. The user
load-achieving design ensures that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) requirements of all the users in the massive MIMO networks are
guaranteed even in the presence of pilot contamination. However, this design
has some vulnerabilities, such as one known pilot sequence and the correlation
among the pilot sequences, that may be exploited by active attackers. In this
work, we first identify the potential vulnerabilities in the user
load-achieving pilot sequence design and then, accordingly, develop an active
attacking strategy on the network. In the proposed attacking strategy, the
active attackers transmit known pilot sequences in the uplink training and
artificial noise in the downlink data transmission. Our examination
demonstrates that the per-cell user load region is significantly reduced by the
proposed attacking strategy. As a result of the reduced per-cell user load
region, the SINR requirements of all the users are no longer guaranteed in the
presence of the active attackers. Specifically, for the worst affected users
the SINR requirements may not be ensured even with infinite antennas at the
base station.

 <dc:description>  The unmanned air-vehicle (UAV) or mini-drones equipped with sensors are
becoming increasingly popular for various commercial, industrial, and
public-safety applications. However, drones with uncontrolled deployment poses
challenges for highly security-sensitive areas such as President house, nuclear
plants, and commercial areas because they can be used unlawfully. In this
article, to cope with security-sensitive challenges, we propose point-to-point
and flying ad-hoc network (FANET) architectures to assist the efficient
deployment of monitoring drones (MDr). To capture amateur drone (ADr), MDr must
have the capability to efficiently and timely detect, track, jam, and hunt the
ADr. We discuss the capabilities of the existing detection, tracking,
localization, and routing schemes and also present the limitations in these
schemes as further research challenges. Moreover, the future challenges related
to co-channel interference, channel model design, and cooperative schemes are
discussed. Our findings indicate that MDr deployment is necessary for caring of
ADr, and intensive research and development is required to fill the gaps in the
existing technologies.

 <dc:description>  We introduce new techniques to the analysis of neural spatiotemporal dynamics
via applying $\epsilon$-machine reconstruction to electroencephalography (EEG)
microstate sequences. Microstates are short duration quasi-stable states of the
dynamically changing electrical field topographies recorded via an array of
electrodes from the human scalp, and cluster into four canonical classes. The
sequence of microstates observed under particular conditions can be considered
an information source with unknown underlying structure. $\epsilon$-machines
are discrete dynamical system automata with state-dependent probabilities on
different future observations (in this case the next measured EEG microstate).
They artificially reproduce underlying structure in an optimally predictive
manner as generative models exhibiting dynamics emulating the behaviour of the
source. Here we present experiments using both simulations and empirical data
supporting the value of associating these discrete dynamical systems with
mental states (e.g. mind-wandering, focused attention, etc.) and with clinical
populations. The neurodynamics of mental states and clinical populations can
then be further characterized by properties of these dynamical systems,
including: i) statistical complexity (determined by the number of states of the
corresponding $\epsilon$-automaton); ii) entropy rate; iii) characteristic
sequence patterning (syntax, probabilistic grammars); iv) duration, persistence
and stability of dynamical patterns; and v) algebraic measures such as
Krohn-Rhodes complexity or holonomy length of the decompositions of these. The
potential applications include the characterization of mental states in
neurodynamic terms for mental health diagnostics, well-being interventions,
human-machine interface, and others on both subject-specific and
group/population-level.

 <dc:description>  Lack of proper linguistic resources is the major challenges faced by the
Machine Translation system developments when dealing with the resource poor
languages. In this paper, we describe effective ways to utilize the lexical
resources to improve the quality of statistical machine translation. Our
research on the usage of lexical resources mainly focused on two ways, such as;
augmenting the parallel corpus with more vocabulary and to provide various word
forms. We have augmented the training corpus with various lexical resources
such as lexical words, function words, kridanta pairs and verb phrases. We have
described the case studies, evaluations and detailed error analysis for both
Marathi to Hindi and Hindi to Marathi machine translation systems. From the
evaluations we observed that, there is an incremental growth in the quality of
machine translation as the usage of various lexical resources increases.
Moreover, usage of various lexical resources helps to improve the coverage and
quality of machine translation where limited parallel corpus is available.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an approach towards disaster management based on
cognitive radio ad hoc network. Despite the growing interests on cognitive
radio ad hoc networks, not much work has been reported on using them for
disaster management. This paper discusses opportunities for disaster management
based on cognitive radio ad hoc networks. In this direction, the paper presents
a novel technique for disaster detection based on Artificial Neural Network
(ANN). The ANN is trained using backward propagation algorithm. An ANN-based
spectrum sensing scheme is also presented. Finally, a service discovery scheme
is presented for coordination during the time of disaster. The simulation of
proposed approach has been performed in NS-2 simulator. The proposed approach
shows very low false negative alarm rate using the proposed disaster detection
system. The spectrum switching time of spectrum sensing scheme is also analyzed
along with an analysis of latency of proposed service discovery scheme

 <dc:description>  Deep networks trained on demonstrations of human driving have learned to
follow roads and avoid obstacles. However, driving policies trained via
imitation learning cannot be controlled at test time. A vehicle trained
end-to-end to imitate an expert cannot be guided to take a specific turn at an
upcoming intersection. This limits the utility of such systems. We propose to
condition imitation learning on high-level command input. At test time, the
learned driving policy functions as a chauffeur that handles sensorimotor
coordination but continues to respond to navigational commands. We evaluate
different architectures for conditional imitation learning in vision-based
driving. We conduct experiments in realistic three-dimensional simulations of
urban driving and on a 1/5 scale robotic truck that is trained to drive in a
residential area. Both systems drive based on visual input yet remain
responsive to high-level navigational commands. Experimental results
demonstrate that the presented approach significantly outperforms a number of
baselines. The supplementary video can be viewed at

 <dc:description>  Refining a classical proof of Whitney, we show that any $4$-connected planar
triangulation can be decomposed into a Hamiltonian path and two trees.
  Therefore, every $4$-connected planar graph decomposes into three forests,
one having maximum degree at most $2$.
  We use this result to show that any Hamiltonian planar triangulation can be
decomposed into two trees and one spanning tree of maximum degree at most $3$.
  These decompositions improve the result of Gon\c{c}alves [Covering planar
graphs with forests, one having bounded maximum degree. J. Comb. Theory, Ser.
B, 100(6):729--739, 2010] that every planar graph can be decomposed into three
forests, one of maximum degree at most $4$.
  We also show that our results are best-possible.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Power System Simulation Using the Adomian Decomposition
  Method</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For dynamic security assessment considering uncertainties in grid operations,
this paper proposes an approach for time-domain simulation of a power system
having stochastic loads. The proposed approach solves a stochastic differential
equation model of the power system in a semi-analytical way using the Adomian
decomposition method. The approach generates semi-analytical solutions
expressing both deterministic and stochastic variables explicitly as symbolic
variables so as to embed stochastic processes directly into the solutions for
efficient simulation and analysis. The proposed approach is tested on the New
England 10-machine 39-bus system with different levels of stochastic loads. The
approach is also benchmarked with a traditional stochastic simulation approach
based on the Euler-Maruyama method. The results show that the new approach has
better time performance and a comparable accuracy.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a grasp planner which integrates two sources of
information to generate robust grasps for a robotic hand. First, the
topological information of the object model is incorporated by building the
mean curvature skeleton and segmenting the object accordingly in order to
identify object regions which are suitable for applying a grasp. Second, the
local surface structure is investigated to construct feasible and robust
grasping poses by aligning the hand according to the local object shape. We
show how this information can be used to derive different grasping strategies,
which also allows to distinguish between precision and power grasps. We applied
the approach to a wide variety of object models of the KIT and the YCB
real-world object model databases and evaluated the approach with several
robotic hands. The results show that the skeleton-based grasp planner is
capable to autonomously generate high-quality grasps in an efficient manner. In
addition, we evaluate how robust the planned grasps are against hand
positioning errors as they occur in real-world applications due to perception
and actuation inaccuracies. The evaluation shows that the majority of the
generated grasps are of high quality since they can be successfully applied
even when the hand is not exactly positioned.

 <dc:title>Learning Word Embeddings for Hyponymy with Entailment-Based
  Distributional Semantics</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Henderson, James</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Lexical entailment, such as hyponymy, is a fundamental issue in the semantics
of natural language. This paper proposes distributional semantic models which
efficiently learn word embeddings for entailment, using a recently-proposed
framework for modelling entailment in a vector-space. These models postulate a
latent vector for a pseudo-phrase containing two neighbouring word vectors. We
investigate both modelling words as the evidence they contribute about this
phrase vector, or as the posterior distribution of a one-word phrase vector,
and find that the posterior vectors perform better. The resulting word
embeddings outperform the best previous results on predicting hyponymy between
words, in unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments.

 <dc:title>Structure and properties of large intersecting families</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We say that a family of $k$-subsets of an $n$-element set is intersecting, if
any two of its sets intersect. In this paper we study different extremal
properties of intersecting families, as well as the structure of large
intersecting families. We also give some results on $k$-uniform families
without $s$ pairwise disjoint sets, related to the Erd\H{o}s Matching
Conjecture.
  We prove a conclusive version of Frankl's theorem on intersecting families
with bounded maximal degree. This theorem, along with its generalizations to
cross-intersecting families, implies many results on the topic, obtained by
Frankl, Frankl and Tokushige, Kupavskii and Zakharov and others.
  We study the structure of large intersecting families, obtaining some general
structural theorems which generalize the results of Han and Kohayakawa, as well
as Kostochka and Mubayi.
  We give degree and subset degree version of the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado and the
Hilton--Milner theorems, extending the results of Huang and Zhao, and Frankl,
Han, Huang and Zhao. We also extend the range in which the degree version of
the Erd\H{o}s Matching conjecture holds.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of designing spoofing signals to corrupt and mislead the
output of a Kalman filter. Unlike existing works that focus on detection and
filtering algorithms for the observer, we study the problem from the attacker's
point-of-view. In our model, the attacker can corrupt the measurements by
adding spoofing signals. The attacker seeks to create a separation between the
estimate of the Kalman filter with and without spoofing signals. We present a
number of results on how to generate such spoofing signals, while minimizing
the signal magnitude. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through
simulations along with theoretical proofs.

 <dc:description>  This project explores public opinion on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP) in news and social media outlets, and tracks elected
representatives' voting records on issues relating to SNAP and food insecurity.
We used machine learning, sentiment analysis, and text mining to analyze
national and state level coverage of SNAP in order to gauge perceptions of the
program over time across these outlets. Results indicate that the majority of
news coverage has negative sentiment, more partisan news outlets have more
extreme sentiment, and that clustering of negative reporting on SNAP occurs in
the Midwest. Our final results and tools will be displayed in an on-line
application that the ACFB Advocacy team can use to inform their communication
to relevant stakeholders.

students from a wide range of disciplines while helping community members
execute social good projects, often with an urban focus.
  We present observations and deliberations of one such project, the DSSG 2017
'Equitable Futures' project, which investigates the ongoing gentrification
process and the increasingly inequitable access to opportunities in Seattle.
Similar processes can be observed in many major cities. The project connects

 <dc:description>  Cities across the United States are implementing information communication
technologies in an effort to improve government services. One such innovation
in e-government is the creation of 311 systems, offering a centralized platform
where citizens can request services, report non-emergency concerns, and obtain
information about the city via hotline, mobile, or web-based applications. The
NYC 311 service request system represents one of the most significant links
between citizens and city government, accounting for more than 8,000,000
requests annually. These systems are generating massive amounts of data that,
when properly managed, cleaned, and mined, can yield significant insights into
the real-time condition of the city. Increasingly, these data are being used to
develop predictive models of citizen concerns and problem conditions within the
city. However, predictive models trained on these data can suffer from biases
in the propensity to make a request that can vary based on socio-economic and
demographic characteristics of an area, cultural differences that can affect
citizens' willingness to interact with their government, and differential
access to Internet connectivity. Using more than 20,000,000 311 requests -
together with building violation data from the NYC Department of Buildings and
the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development; property data from
NYC Department of City Planning; and demographic and socioeconomic data from
the U.S. Census American Community Survey - we develop a two-step methodology
to evaluate the propensity to complain: (1) we predict, using a gradient
boosting regression model, the likelihood of heating and hot water violations
for a given building, and (2) we then compare the actual complaint volume for
buildings with predicted violations to quantify discrepancies across the City.

 <dc:description>  As the rate of incarceration in the United States continues to grow, a large
body of research has been primarily focused on understanding the determinants
and drivers of federal and state prison growth. However, local jail systems,
with 11 million admissions each year, have generated less research attention
even though they have a far broader impact on communities. Preliminary time
trend analysis conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) uncovered
disparities in county jail incarceration rates by geography. Contrary to
assumptions that incarceration is an urban phenomenon, Vera discovered that
during the past few decades, pretrial jail rates have declined in many urban
areas whereas rates have grown or remained flat in rural counties. In an effort
to uncover the factors contributing to continued jail growth in rural areas,
Vera joined forces with Two Sigma's Data Clinic, a volunteer-based program that
leverages employees' data science expertise. Using county jail data from 2000 -
2013 and county-specific demographic, political, socioeconomic, jail and prison
population variables, a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was
specified to account for correlations within counties over time. The results
revealed that county-level poverty, police expenditures, and spillover effects
from other county and state authorities are all significant predictors of local
jail rates. In addition, geographic investigation of model residuals revealed
clusters of counties where observed rates were much higher (and much lower)
than expected conditioned upon county variables.

 <dc:description>  Cities across the United States are undergoing great transformation and urban
growth. Data and data analysis has become an essential element of urban
planning as cities use data to plan land use and development. One great
challenge is to use the tools of data science to promote equity along with
growth. The city of Atlanta is an example site of large-scale urban renewal
that aims to engage in development without displacement. On the Westside of
downtown Atlanta, the construction of the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium and the
conversion of an underutilized rail-line into a multi-use trail may result in
increased property values. In response to community residents' concerns and a
commitment to development without displacement, the city and philanthropic
partners announced an Anti-Displacement Tax Fund to subsidize future property
tax increases of owner occupants for the next twenty years. To achieve greater
transparency, accountability, and impact, residents expressed a desire for a
tool that would help them determine eligibility and quantify this commitment.
In support of this goal, we use machine learning techniques to analyze
historical tax assessment and predict future tax assessments. We then apply
eligibility estimates to our predictions to estimate the total cost for the
first seven years of the program. These forecasts are also incorporated into an
interactive tool for community residents to determine their eligibility for the
fund and the expected increase in their home value over the next seven years.

 <dc:description>  We describe two recently proposed machine learning approaches for discovering
emerging trends in fatal accidental drug overdoses. The Gaussian Process Subset
Scan enables early detection of emerging patterns in spatio-temporal data,
accounting for both the non-iid nature of the data and the fact that detecting
subtle patterns requires integration of information across multiple spatial
areas and multiple time steps. We apply this approach to 17 years of
county-aggregated data for monthly opioid overdose deaths in the New York City
metropolitan area, showing clear advantages in the utility of discovered
patterns as compared to typical anomaly detection approaches.
  To detect and characterize emerging overdose patterns that differentially
affect a subpopulation of the data, including geographic, demographic, and
behavioral patterns (e.g., which combinations of drugs are involved), we apply
the Multidimensional Tensor Scan to 8 years of case-level overdose data from
Allegheny County, PA. We discover previously unidentified overdose patterns
which reveal unusual demographic clusters, show impacts of drug legislation,
and demonstrate potential for early detection and targeted intervention. These
approaches to early detection of overdose patterns can inform prevention and
response efforts, as well as understanding the effects of policy changes.

 <dc:description>  Adaptive video streaming over HTTP is becoming omnipresent in our daily life.
In the past, dozens of research papers have proposed novel approaches to
address different aspects of adaptive streaming and a decent amount of player
implementations (commercial and open source) are available. However, state of
the art evaluations are sometimes superficial as many proposals only
investigate a certain aspect of the problem or focus on a specific platform -
player implementations used in actual services are rarely considered. HTML5 is
now available on many platforms and foster the deployment of adaptive media
streaming applications. We propose a common evaluation framework for adaptive
HTML5 players and demonstrate its applicability by evaluating eight different
players which are actually deployed in real-world services.

 <dc:description>  Predicting individual-level mobility patterns is an imperative part of
ubiquitous computing, in growing real-world applications like transport
management and disease spread. While data sources such as GPS trackers or Call
Data Records are temporally-rich, they are expensive, often not publicly
available, or garnered only in select locations, restricting their wide use.
Conversely, geo-located social media data are publicly and freely available,
but present challenges due to their sparse nature. Further, much existing work
has focused on predicting next location only, though knowledge of an entire
movement timeline is relevant for emerging applications. Accordingly, we
propose a stochastic framework, Intermediate Location Computing (ILC) which
combines approaches from several existing mobility prediction methods,
alongside community behavior, to predict every missing location from an
individual's social media timeline. We compare ILC with several
state-of-the-art approaches. For three major cities, ILC predicts at 1 and
2-hour resolution with up to 86% accuracy, 19% better than compared methods. We
show how amount of community data improves prediction, and that community
movement improves prediction of an individual's movement more on weekends
versus weekdays. Overall this work presents a new algorithm to predict
practical and continuous individual-level mobility patterns with sparse but
readily available social media data.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Measuring the performance of solar energy and heat transfer systems requires
a lot of time, economic cost and manpower. Meanwhile, directly predicting their
performance is challenging due to the complicated internal structures.
Fortunately, a knowledge-based machine learning method can provide a promising
prediction and optimization strategy for the performance of energy systems. In
this Chapter, the authors will show how they utilize the machine learning
models trained from a large experimental database to perform precise prediction
and optimization on a solar water heater (SWH) system. A new energy system
optimization strategy based on a high-throughput screening (HTS) process is
proposed. This Chapter consists of: i) Comparative studies on varieties of
machine learning models (artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector
machine (SVM) and extreme learning machine (ELM)) to predict the performances
of SWHs; ii) Development of an ANN-based software to assist the quick
prediction and iii) Introduction of a computational HTS method to design a
high-performance SWH system.

 <dc:description>  Modern robotics is gravitating toward increasingly collaborative human robot
interaction. Tools such as acceleration policies can naturally support the
realization of reactive, adaptive, and compliant robots. These tools require us
to model the system dynamics accurately -- a difficult task. The fundamental
problem remains that simulation and reality diverge--we do not know how to
accurately change a robot's state. Thus, recent research on improving inverse
dynamics models has been focused on making use of machine learning techniques.
Traditional learning techniques train on the actual realized accelerations,
instead of the policy's desired accelerations, which is an indirect data
source. Here we show how an additional training signal -- measured at the
desired accelerations -- can be derived from a feedback control signal. This
effectively creates a second data source for learning inverse dynamics models.
Furthermore, we show how both the traditional and this new data source, can be
used to train task-specific models of the inverse dynamics, when used
independently or combined. We analyze the use of both data sources in
simulation and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real-world robotic platform.
We show that our system incrementally improves the learned inverse dynamics
model, and when using both data sources combined converges more consistently
and faster.

 <dc:description>  With the proliferation of social media over the last decade, determining
people's attitude with respect to a specific topic, document, interaction or
events has fueled research interest in natural language processing and
introduced a new channel called sentiment and emotion analysis. For instance,
businesses routinely look to develop systems to automatically understand their
customer conversations by identifying the relevant content to enhance marketing
their products and managing their reputations. Previous efforts to assess
people's sentiment on Twitter have suggested that Twitter may be a valuable
resource for studying political sentiment and that it reflects the offline
political landscape. According to a Pew Research Center report, in January 2016
44 percent of US adults stated having learned about the presidential election
through social media. Furthermore, 24 percent reported use of social media
posts of the two candidates as a source of news and information, which is more
than the 15 percent who have used both candidates' websites or emails combined.
The first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary was the most tweeted
debate ever with 17.1 million tweets.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Deciding Detectability in Discrete Event Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Detectability of discrete event systems (DESs) is a question whether the
current and subsequent states can be determined based on observations. Shu and
Lin designed a polynomial-time algorithm to check strong (periodic)
detectability and an exponential-time (polynomial-space) algorithm to check
weak (periodic) detectability. Zhang showed that checking weak (periodic)
detectability is PSpace-complete. This intractable complexity opens a question
whether there are structurally simpler DESs for which the problem is tractable.
In this paper, we show that it is not the case by considering DESs represented
as deterministic finite automata without non-trivial cycles, which are
structurally the simplest deadlock-free DESs. We show that even for such very
simple DESs, checking weak (periodic) detectability remains intractable. On the
contrary, we show that strong (periodic) detectability of DESs can be
efficiently verified on a parallel computer.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Image captioning, a popular topic in computer vision, has achieved
substantial progress in recent years. However, the distinctiveness of natural
descriptions is often overlooked in previous work. It is closely related to the
quality of captions, as distinctive captions are more likely to describe images
with their unique aspects. In this work, we propose a new learning method,
Contrastive Learning (CL), for image captioning. Specifically, via two
constraints formulated on top of a reference model, the proposed method can
encourage distinctiveness, while maintaining the overall quality of the
generated captions. We tested our method on two challenging datasets, where it
improves the baseline model by significant margins. We also showed in our
studies that the proposed method is generic and can be used for models with
various structures.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach for mobile robots to learn to navigate in
pedestrian-rich environments via raw depth inputs, in a social-compliant
manner. To achieve this, we adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning
(GAIL) strategy for motion planning, which improves upon a supervised policy
model pre-trained via behavior cloning. Our approach overcomes the
disadvantages of previous methods, as they heavily depend on the full knowledge
of the location and velocity information of nearby pedestrians, which not only
requires specific sensors but also consumes much computation time for
extracting such state information from raw sensor input. In this paper, our
proposed GAIL-based model performs directly on raw depth inputs and plans in
real-time. Experiments show that our GAIL-based approach greatly improves the
behavior of mobile robots from pure behavior cloning both safely and
efficiently. Real-world implementation also shows that our method is capable of
guiding autonomous vehicles to navigate in a social-compliant manner directly
through raw depth inputs.

 <dc:description>  The increasing illegal parking has become more and more serious. Nowadays the
methods of detecting illegally parked vehicles are based on background
segmentation. However, this method is weakly robust and sensitive to
environment. Benefitting from deep learning, this paper proposes a novel
illegal vehicle parking detection system. Illegal vehicles captured by camera
are firstly located and classified by the famous Single Shot MultiBox Detector
(SSD) algorithm. To improve the performance, we propose to optimize SSD by
adjusting the aspect ratio of default box to accommodate with our dataset
better. After that, a tracking and analysis of movement is adopted to judge the
illegal vehicles in the region of interest (ROI). Experiments show that the
system can achieve a 99% accuracy and real-time (25FPS) detection with strong
robustness in complex environments.

 <dc:title>Centralized Congestion Control and Scheduling in a Datacenter</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shah, Devavrat</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Xie, Qiaomin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of designing a packet-level congestion control and
scheduling policy for datacenter networks. Current datacenter networks
primarily inherit the principles that went into the design of Internet, where
congestion control and scheduling are distributed. While distributed
architecture provides robustness, it suffers in terms of performance. Unlike
Internet, data center is fundamentally a &quot;controlled&quot; environment. This raises
the possibility of designing a centralized architecture to achieve better
performance. Recent solutions such as Fastpass and Flowtune have provided the
proof of this concept. This raises the question: what is theoretically optimal
performance achievable in a data center?
  We propose a centralized policy that guarantees a per-flow end-to-end flow
delay bound of $O$(#hops $\times$ flow-size $/$ gap-to-capacity). Effectively
such an end-to-end delay will be experienced by flows even if we removed
congestion control and scheduling constraints as the resulting queueing
networks can be viewed as the classical reversible multi-class queuing network,
which has a product-form stationary distribution. In the language of Harrison
et al., we establish that baseline performance for this model class is
achievable.
  Indeed, as the key contribution of this work, we propose a method to emulate
such a reversible queuing network while satisfying congestion control and
scheduling constraints. Precisely, our policy is an emulation of
Store-and-Forward (SFA) congestion control in conjunction with
Last-Come-First-Serve Preemptive-Resume (LCFS-PR) scheduling policy.

 <dc:description>  For many tasks, predictive path-following control can significantly improve
the performance and robustness of autonomous robots over traditional trajectory
tracking control. It does this by prioritizing closeness to the path over timed
progress along the path and by looking ahead to account for changes in the
path. We propose a novel predictive path-following approach that couples
feedforward linearization with path-based model predictive control. Our
approach has a few key advantages. By utilizing the differential flatness
property, we reduce the path-based model predictive control problem from a
nonlinear to a convex optimization problem. Robustness to disturbances is
achieved by a dynamic path reference, which adjusts its speed based on the
robot's progress. We also account for key system constraints. We demonstrate
these advantages in experiment on a quadrotor. We show improved performance
over a baseline trajectory tracking controller by keeping the quadrotor closer
to the desired path under nominal conditions, with an initial offset and under
a wind disturbance.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces the contents and the possible usage of the
DIRHA-ENGLISH multi-microphone corpus, recently realized under the EC DIRHA
project. The reference scenario is a domestic environment equipped with a large
number of microphones and microphone arrays distributed in space.
  The corpus is composed of both real and simulated material, and it includes
12 US and 12 UK English native speakers. Each speaker uttered different sets of
phonetically-rich sentences, newspaper articles, conversational speech,
keywords, and commands. From this material, a large set of 1-minute sequences
was generated, which also includes typical domestic background noise as well as
inter/intra-room reverberation effects. Dev and test sets were derived, which
represent a very precious material for different studies on multi-microphone
speech processing and distant-speech recognition. Various tasks and
corresponding Kaldi recipes have already been developed.
  The paper reports a first set of baseline results obtained using different
techniques, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), aligned with the
state-of-the-art at international level.

 <dc:description>  Action recognition, motion classification, gait analysis and synthesis are
fundamental problems in a number of fields such as computer graphics,
bio-mechanics and human computer interaction that generate a large body of
research. This type of data is complex because it is inherently
multidimensional and has multiple modalities such as video, motion capture
data, accelerometer data, etc. While some of this data, such as monocular video
are easy to acquire, others are much more difficult and expensive such as
motion capture data or multi-view video. This creates a large barrier of entry
in the research community for data driven research. We have embarked on
creating a new large repository of motion and action data (CAMREP) consisting
of several motion and action databases. What makes this database unique is that
we use a variety of modalities, enabling multi-modal analysis. Presently, the
size of datasets varies with some having a large number of subjects while
others having smaller numbers. We have also acquired long capture sequences in
a number of cases, making some datasets rather large.

 <dc:description>  Gigabit-per-second connectivity among vehicles is expected to be a key
enabling technology for sensor information sharing, in turn, resulting in safer
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). Recently proposed millimeter-wave
(mmWave) systems appear to be the only solution capable of meeting the data
rate demand imposed by future ITS services. In this poster, we assess the
performance of a mmWave device-to-device (D2D) vehicular network by
investigating the impact of system and communication parameters on end-users.

 <dc:title>Low-resource bilingual lexicon extraction using graph based word

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we focus on the task of automatically extracting bilingual
lexicon for the language pair Spanish-Nahuatl. This is a low-resource setting
where only a small amount of parallel corpus is available. Most of the
downstream methods do not work well under low-resources conditions. This is
specially true for the approaches that use vectorial representations like
Word2Vec. Our proposal is to construct bilingual word vectors from a graph.
This graph is generated using translation pairs obtained from an unsupervised
word alignment method.
  We show that, in a low-resource setting, these type of vectors are successful
in representing words in a bilingual semantic space. Moreover, when a linear
transformation is applied to translate words from one language to another, our
graph based representations considerably outperform the popular setting that
uses Word2Vec.

 <dc:title>An optimization approach to learning falling rule lists</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Chaofan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rudin, Cynthia</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A falling rule list is a probabilistic decision list for binary
classification, consisting of a series of if-then rules with antecedents in the
if clauses and probabilities of the desired outcome (&quot;1&quot;) in the then clauses.
Just as in a regular decision list, the order of rules in a falling rule list
is important -- each example is classified by the first rule whose antecedent
it satisfies. Unlike a regular decision list, a falling rule list requires the
probabilities of the desired outcome (&quot;1&quot;) to be monotonically decreasing down
the list. We propose an optimization approach to learning falling rule lists
and &quot;softly&quot; falling rule lists, along with Monte-Carlo search algorithms that
use bounds on the optimal solution to prune the search space.

 <dc:description>  A model-based windowed chi-squared procedure is proposed for identifying
falsified sensor measurements. We employ the widely-used static chi-squared and
the dynamic cumulative sum (CUSUM) fault/attack detection procedures as
benchmarks to compare the performance of the windowed chi-squared detector. In
particular, we characterize the state degradation that a class of attacks can
induce to the system while enforcing that the detectors do not raise alarms
(zero-alarm attacks). We quantify the advantage of using dynamic detectors
(windowed chi-squared and CUSUM detectors), which leverages the history of the
state, over a static detector (chi-squared) which uses a single measurement at
a time. Simulations using a chemical reactor are presented to illustrate the
performance of our tools.

 <dc:description>  Computer simulations and real-world car trials are essential to investigate
the performance of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. However, simulations
are imperfect models of the physical reality and can be trusted only when they
indicate agreement with the real-world. On the other hand, trials lack
reproducibility and are subject to uncertainties and errors. In this paper, we
will illustrate a case study where the interrelationship between trials,
simulation, and the reality-of-interest is presented. Results are then compared
in a holistic fashion. Our study will describe the procedure followed to
macroscopically calibrate a full-stack network simulator to conduct
high-fidelity full-stack computer simulations.

 <dc:description>  For LTI control systems, we provide mathematical tools - in terms of Linear
Matrix Inequalities - for computing outer ellipsoidal bounds on the reachable
sets that attacks can induce in the system when they are subject to the
physical limits of the actuators. Next, for a given set of dangerous states,
states that (if reached) compromise the integrity or safe operation of the
system, we provide tools for designing new artificial limits on the actuators
(smaller than their physical bounds) such that the new ellipsoidal bounds (and
thus the new reachable sets) are as large as possible (in terms of volume)
while guaranteeing that the dangerous states are not reachable. This guarantees
that the new bounds cut as little as possible from the original reachable set
to minimize the loss of system performance. Computer simulations using a
platoon of vehicles are presented to illustrate the performance of our tools.

 <dc:title>Exponential Quantum Speed-ups for Semidefinite Programming with

 <dc:description>  We give semidefinite program (SDP) quantum solvers with an exponential
speed-up over classical ones. Specifically, we consider SDP instances with $m$
constraint matrices of dimension $n$, each of rank at most $r$, and assume that
the input matrices of the SDP are given as quantum states (after a suitable
normalization). Then we show there is a quantum algorithm that solves the SDP
feasibility problem with accuracy $\epsilon$ by using $\sqrt{m}\log
m\cdot\text{poly}(\log n,r,\epsilon^{-1})$ quantum gates. The dependence on $n$
provides an exponential improvement over the work of Brand\~ao and Svore and
the work of van Apeldoorn et al., and demonstrates an exponential quantum
speed-up when $m$ and $r$ are small.
  We apply the SDP solver to the problem of learning a good description of a
quantum state with respect to a set of measurements: Given $m$ measurements and
a supply of copies of an unknown state $\rho$, we show we can find in time
$\sqrt{m}\log m\cdot\text{poly}(\log n,r,\epsilon^{-1})$ a description of the
state as a quantum circuit preparing a density matrix which has the same
expectation values as $\rho$ on the $m$ measurements up to error $\epsilon$.
The density matrix obtained is an approximation to the maximum entropy state
consistent with the measurement data considered in Jaynes' principle.
  As in previous work, we obtain our algorithm by &quot;quantizing&quot; classical SDP
solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight update method. One of our
main technical contributions is a quantum Gibbs state sampler for low-rank
Hamiltonians with a poly-logarithmic dependence on its dimension based on the
techniques developed in quantum principal component analysis, which could be of
independent interest.

 <dc:description>  A growing number of applications, e.g. video surveillance and medical image
analysis, require training recognition systems from large amounts of weakly
annotated data while some targeted interactions with a domain expert are
allowed to improve the training process. In such cases, active learning (AL)
can reduce labeling costs for training a classifier by querying the expert to
provide the labels of most informative instances. This paper focuses on AL
methods for instance classification problems in multiple instance learning
(MIL), where data is arranged into sets, called bags, that are weakly labeled.
Most AL methods focus on single instance learning problems. These methods are
not suitable for MIL problems because they cannot account for the bag structure
of data. In this paper, new methods for bag-level aggregation of instance
informativeness are proposed for multiple instance active learning (MIAL). The
\textit{aggregated informativeness} method identifies the most informative
instances based on classifier uncertainty, and queries bags incorporating the
most information. The other proposed method, called \textit{cluster-based
aggregative sampling}, clusters data hierarchically in the instance space. The
informativeness of instances is assessed by considering bag labels, inferred
instance labels, and the proportion of labels that remain to be discovered in
clusters. Both proposed methods significantly outperform reference methods in
extensive experiments using benchmark data from several application domains.
Results indicate that using an appropriate strategy to address MIAL problems
yields a significant reduction in the number of queries needed to achieve the
same level of performance as single instance AL methods.

 <dc:description>  The Paulsen problem is a basic open problem in operator theory: Given vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_n \in \mathbb R^d$ that are $\epsilon$-nearly satisfying the
Parseval's condition and the equal norm condition, is it close to a set of
vectors $v_1, \ldots, v_n \in \mathbb R^d$ that exactly satisfy the Parseval's
condition and the equal norm condition? Given $u_1, \ldots, u_n$, the squared
distance (to the set of exact solutions) is defined as $\inf_{v} \sum_{i=1}^n
\| u_i - v_i \|_2^2$ where the infimum is over the set of exact solutions.
Previous results show that the squared distance of any $\epsilon$-nearly
solution is at most $O({\rm{poly}}(d,n,\epsilon))$ and there are
$\epsilon$-nearly solutions with squared distance at least $\Omega(d\epsilon)$.
The fundamental open question is whether the squared distance can be
independent of the number of vectors $n$.
  We answer this question affirmatively by proving that the squared distance of
any $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{13/2} \epsilon)$. Our approach is based
on a continuous version of the operator scaling algorithm and consists of two
parts. First, we define a dynamical system based on operator scaling and use it
to prove that the squared distance of any $\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^2
n \epsilon)$. Then, we show that by randomly perturbing the input vectors, the
dynamical system will converge faster and the squared distance of an
$\epsilon$-nearly solution is $O(d^{5/2} \epsilon)$ when $n$ is large enough
and $\epsilon$ is small enough. To analyze the convergence of the dynamical
system, we develop some new techniques in lower bounding the operator capacity,
a concept introduced by Gurvits to analyze the operator scaling algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Multireference alignment (MRA) is the problem of estimating a signal from
many noisy and cyclically shifted copies of itself. In this paper, we consider
an extension called heterogeneous MRA, where $K$ signals must be estimated, and
each observation comes from one of those signals, unknown to us. This is a
simplified model for the heterogeneity problem notably arising in cryo-electron
microscopy. We propose an algorithm which estimates the $K$ signals without
estimating either the shifts or the classes of the observations. It requires
only one pass over the data and is based on low-order moments that are
invariant under cyclic shifts. Given sufficiently many measurements, one can
estimate these invariant features averaged over the $K$ signals. We then design
a smooth, non-convex optimization problem to compute a set of signals which are
consistent with the estimated averaged features. We find that, in many cases,
the proposed approach estimates the set of signals accurately despite
non-convexity, and conjecture the number of signals $K$ that can be resolved as
a function of the signal length $L$ is $\sim \sqrt{L}$.

 <dc:title>Fibred Computational Effects</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ahman, Danel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dependent types provide a lightweight and modular means to integrate
programming and formal program verification. In particular, the types of
programs written in dependently typed programming languages (Agda, Idris, F*,
etc.) can be used to express specifications of program correctness. These
specifications can vary from being as simple as requiring the divisor in the
division function to be non-zero, to as complex as specifying the correctness
of compilers of industrial-strength languages. Successful compilation of a
program then guarantees that it satisfies its type-based specification.
  While dependent types allow many runtime errors to be eliminated by rejecting
erroneous programs at compile-time, dependently typed languages are yet to gain
popularity in the wider programming community. One reason for this is their
limited support for computational effects, an integral part of all widely used
programming languages, ranging from imperative languages, such as C, to
functional languages, such as ML and Haskell. For example, in addition to
simply turning their inputs to outputs, programs written in these programming
languages can raise exceptions, access computer's memory, communicate over a
network, render images on a screen, etc.
  Therefore, if dependently typed programming languages are to truly live up to
their promise of seamlessly integrating programming and formal program
verification, we must first understand how to properly account for
computational effects in such languages. While there already exists work on
this topic, ingredients needed for a comprehensive theory are generally
missing. For example, foundations are often not settled; available effects may
be limited; or effects may not be treated systematically.
  In this thesis we address these shortcomings by providing a comprehensive
treatment of the combination of dependent types and general computational
effects.

 <dc:description>  Poor road conditions are a public nuisance, causing passenger discomfort,
damage to vehicles, and accidents. In the U.S., road-related conditions are a
factor in 22,000 of the 42,000 traffic fatalities each year. Although we often
complain about bad roads, we have no way to detect or report them at scale. To
address this issue, we developed a system to detect potholes and assess road
conditions in real-time. Our solution is a mobile application that captures
data on a car's movement from gyroscope and accelerometer sensors in the phone.
To assess roads using this sensor data, we trained SVM models to classify road
conditions with 93% accuracy and potholes with 92% accuracy, beating the base
rate for both problems. As the user drives, the models use the sensor data to
classify whether the road is good or bad, and whether it contains potholes.
Then, the classification results are used to create data-rich maps that
illustrate road conditions across the city. Our system will empower civic
officials to identify and repair damaged roads which inconvenience passengers
and cause accidents. This paper details our data science process for collecting
training data on real roads, transforming noisy sensor data into useful
signals, training and evaluating machine learning models, and deploying those
models to production through a real-time classification app. It also highlights
how cities can use our system to crowdsource data and deliver road repair
resources to areas in need.

 <dc:description>  As more attention is paid to security in the context of control systems and
as attacks occur to real control systems throughout the world, it has become
clear that some of the most nefarious attacks are those that evade detection.
The term stealthy has come to encompass a variety of techniques that attackers
can employ to avoid detection. Here we show how the states of the system (in
particular, the reachable set corresponding to the attack) can be manipulated
under two important types of stealthy attacks. We employ the chi-squared fault
detection method and demonstrate how this imposes a constraint on the attack
sequence either to generate no alarms (zero-alarm attack) or to generate alarms
at a rate indistinguishable from normal operation (hidden attack).

 <dc:title>Rotation Blurring: Use of Artificial Blurring to Reduce Cybersickness in

 <dc:description>  Users of Virtual Reality (VR) systems often experience vection, the
perception of self-motion in the absence of any physical movement. While
vection helps to improve presence in VR, it often leads to a form of motion
sickness called cybersickness. Cybersickness is a major deterrent to large
scale adoption of VR.
  Prior work has discovered that changing vection (changing the perceived speed
or moving direction) causes more severe cybersickness than steady vection
(walking at a constant speed or in a constant direction). Based on this idea,
we try to reduce the cybersickness caused by character movements in a First
Person Shooter (FPS) game in VR. We propose Rotation Blurring (RB), uniformly
blurring the screen during rotational movements to reduce cybersickness. We
performed a user study to evaluate the impact of RB in reducing cybersickness.
We found that the blurring technique led to an overall reduction in sickness
levels of the participants and delayed its onset. Participants who experienced
acute levels of cybersickness benefited significantly from this technique.

 <dc:title>Low-Rank RNN Adaptation for Context-Aware Language Modeling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jaech, Aaron</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ostendorf, Mari</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A context-aware language model uses location, user and/or domain metadata
(context) to adapt its predictions. In neural language models, context
information is typically represented as an embedding and it is given to the RNN
as an additional input, which has been shown to be useful in many applications.
We introduce a more powerful mechanism for using context to adapt an RNN by
letting the context vector control a low-rank transformation of the recurrent
layer weight matrix. Experiments show that allowing a greater fraction of the
model parameters to be adjusted has benefits in terms of perplexity,
classification, and generation for several different types of context.

 <dc:description>  The complexity of Philip Wolfe's method for the minimum Euclidean-norm point
problem over a convex polytope has remained unknown since he proposed the
method in 1974. The method is important because it is used as a subroutine for
one of the most practical algorithms for submodular function minimization. We
present the first example that Wolfe's method takes exponential time.
Additionally, we improve previous results to show that linear programming
reduces in strongly-polynomial time to the minimum norm point problem over a
simplex.

 <dc:description>  The wide adoption of smartphones and mobile applications has brought
significant changes to not only how individuals behave in the real world, but
also how groups of users interact with each other when organizing group events.
Understanding how users make event decisions as a group and identifying the
contributing factors can offer important insights for social group studies and
more effective system and application design for group event scheduling.
  In this work, we have designed a new mobile application called
OutWithFriendz, which enables users of our mobile app to organize group events,
invite friends, suggest and vote on event time and venue. We have deployed
OutWithFriendz at both Apple App Store and Google Play, and conducted a
large-scale user study spanning over 500 users and 300 group events. Our
analysis has revealed several important observations regarding group event
planning process including the importance of user mobility, individual
preferences, host preferences, and group voting process.

 <dc:description>  Studying snake robot locomotion in a cluttered environment has been a
complicated task because the motion model is discontinuous due to the physical
contact with obstacles, and the contact force cannot be determined solely by
contact positions. We present a unique mathematical model of the robot
interacting with obstacles in which the contact forces are mapped on the basis
of a viscous friction model. Also a motion planning strategy has been
introduced which helps deriving the simplest path that ensures sufficient
number of contacts of the robot with the obstacles required to reach a goal
position. Numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to
validate the theoretical approach.

 <dc:description>  Service Function Chaining (SFC) allows the forwarding of a traffic flow along
a chain of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs, e.g., IDS, firewall, and NAT).
Software Defined Networking (SDN) solutions can be used to support SFC reducing
the management complexity and the operational costs. One of the most critical
issues for the service and network providers is the reduction of energy
consumption, which should be achieved without impact to the quality of
services. In this paper, we propose a novel resource (re)allocation
architecture which enables energy-aware SFC for SDN-based networks. To this
end, we model the problems of VNF placement, allocation of VNFs to flows, and
flow routing as optimization problems. Thereafter, heuristic algorithms are
proposed for the different optimization problems, in order find near-optimal
solutions in acceptable times. The performance of the proposed algorithms are
numerically evaluated over a real-world topology and various network traffic
patterns. The results confirm that the proposed heuristic algorithms provide
near optimal solutions while their execution time is applicable for real-life
networks.

 <dc:title>A Transfer-Learning Approach for Accelerated MRI using Deep Neural

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural network based architectures have recently been proposed for
reconstruction of undersampled MR acquisitions. A deep network containing many
free parameters is typically trained using a relatively large set of
fully-sampled MRI data, and later used for on-line reconstruction of
undersampled data. Ideally network performance should be optimized by drawing
the training and testing data from the same domain. In practice, however, large
datasets comprising hundreds of subjects scanned under a common protocol are
rare. Here, we propose a transfer-learning approach to address the problem of
data scarcity in training deep networks for accelerated MRI. The proposed
approach trains neural networks using thousands of samples from a public
dataset of natural images (ImageNet). The network is then fine-tuned using only
few tens of MR images acquired in the testing domain (T1- or T2-weighted MRI).
The ImageNet-trained network yields nearly identical reconstructions to
networks trained directly in the testing domain using thousands of MR images,
and it outperforms conventional compressed sensing reconstructions in terms of
image quality. The proposed approach might facilitate the use of neural
networks for MRI reconstruction without the need for collection of extensive
imaging datasets.

 <dc:description>  Under a Bayesian framework, we formulate the fully sequential sampling and
selection decision in statistical ranking and selection as a stochastic control
problem, and derive the associated Bellman equation. Using value function
approximation, we derive an approximately optimal allocation policy. We show
that this policy is not only computationally efficient but also possesses both
one-step-ahead and asymptotic optimality for independent normal sampling
distributions. Moreover, the proposed allocation policy is easily generalizable
in the approximate dynamic programming paradigm.

 <dc:title>A scalable variational inequality approach for flow through porous media
  models with pressure-dependent viscosity</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Mathematical models for flow through porous media typically enjoy the
so-called maximum principles, which place bounds on the pressure field. It is
highly desirable to preserve these bounds on the pressure field in predictive
numerical simulations, that is, one needs to satisfy discrete maximum
principles (DMP). Unfortunately, many of the existing formulations for flow
through porous media models do not satisfy DMP. This paper presents a robust,
scalable numerical formulation based on variational inequalities (VI), to model
non-linear flows through heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media without
violating DMP. VI is an optimization technique that places bounds on the
numerical solutions of partial differential equations. To crystallize the
ideas, a modification to Darcy equations by taking into account
pressure-dependent viscosity will be discretized using the lowest-order
Raviart-Thomas (RT0) and Variational Multi-scale (VMS) finite element
formulations. It will be shown that these formulations violate DMP, and, in
fact, these violations increase with an increase in anisotropy. It will be
shown that the proposed VI-based formulation provides a viable route to enforce
DMP. Moreover, it will be shown that the proposed formulation is scalable, and
can work with any numerical discretization and weak form. Parallel scalability
on modern computational platforms will be illustrated through strong-scaling
studies, which will prove the efficiency of the proposed formulation in a
parallel setting. Algorithmic scalability as the problem size is scaled up will
be demonstrated through novel static-scaling studies. The performed
static-scaling studies can serve as a guide for users to be able to select an
appropriate discretization for a given problem size.

 <dc:description>  With the growing scale and complexity of high-performance computing (HPC)
systems, resilience solutions that ensure continuity of service despite
frequent errors and component failures must be methodically designed to balance
the reliability requirements with the overheads to performance and power.
Design patterns enable a structured approach to the development of resilience
solutions, providing hardware and software designers with the building block
elements for the rapid development of novel solutions and for adapting existing
technologies for emerging, extreme-scale HPC environments. In this paper, we
develop analytical models that enable designers to evaluate the reliability and
performance characteristics of the design patterns. These models are
particularly useful in building a unified framework that analyzes and compares
various resilience solutions built using a combination of patterns.

 <dc:description>  Superfluidity is a special state of matter exhibiting macroscopic quantum
phenomena and acting like a fluid with zero viscosity. In such a state,
superfluid vortices exist as phase singularities of the model equation with
unique distributions. This paper presents novel techniques to aid the visual
understanding of superfluid vortices based on the state-of-the-art non-linear
Klein-Gordon equation, which evolves a complex scalar field, giving rise to
special vortex lattice/ring structures with dynamic vortex formation,
reconnection, and Kelvin waves, etc. By formulating a numerical model with
theoretical physicists in superfluid research, we obtain high-quality
superfluid flow data sets without noise-like waves, suitable for vortex
visualization. By further exploring superfluid vortex properties, we develop a
new vortex identification and visualization method: a novel mechanism with
velocity circulation to overcome phase singularity and an orthogonal-plane
strategy to avoid ambiguity. Hence, our visualizations can help reveal various
superfluid vortex structures and enable domain experts for related visual
analysis, such as the steady vortex lattice/ring structures, dynamic vortex
string interactions with reconnections and energy radiations, where the famous
Kelvin waves and decaying vortex tangle were clearly observed. These
visualizations have assisted physicists to verify the superfluid model, and
further explore its dynamic behavior more intuitively.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we implement hybrid Woodward-Lawson-Neural Networks and
weighted Fourier method to synthesize antenna arrays. The neural networks (NN)
is applied here to simplify the modeling of MIMO antenna arrays by assessing
phases. The main problem is obviously to find optimal weights of the linear
antenna array elements giving radiation pattern with minimum sidelobe level
(SLL) and hence ameliorating the antenna array performance. To attain this
purpose, an antenna array for reliable Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
applications with frequency at 2.45 GHz is implemented. To validate the
suggested method, many examples of uniformly excited array patterns with the
main beam are put in the direction of the useful signal. The
Woodward-Lawson-Neural Networks synthesis method permits to find out
interesting analytical equations for the synthesis of an antenna array and
highlights the flexibility between the system parameters in input and those in
output. The performance of this hybrid optimization underlines how well the
system is suitable for a wireless communication and how it participates in
reducing interference, as well.

 <dc:description>  Small-cell architecture is widely adopted by cellular network operators to
increase network capacity. By reducing the size of cells, operators can pack
more (low-power) base stations in an area to better serve the growing demands,
without causing extra interference. However, this approach suffers from low
spectrum temporal efficiency. When a cell becomes smaller and covers fewer
users, its total traffic fluctuates significantly due to insufficient traffic
aggregation and exhibiting a large &quot;peak-to-mean&quot; ratio. As operators
customarily provision spectrum for peak traffic, large traffic temporal
fluctuation inevitably leads to low spectrum temporal efficiency. In this
paper, we advocate device-to-device (D2D) load-balancing as a useful mechanism
to address the fundamental drawback of small-cell architecture. The idea is to
shift traffic from a congested cell to its adjacent under-utilized cells by
leveraging inter-cell D2D communication, so that the traffic can be served
without using extra spectrum, effectively improving the spectrum temporal
efficiency. We provide theoretical modeling and analysis to characterize the
benefit of D2D load balancing, in terms of total spectrum requirements of all
individual cells. We also derive the corresponding cost, in terms of incurred
D2D traffic overhead. We carry out empirical evaluations based on real-world 4G
data traces to gauge the benefit and cost of D2D load balancing under practical
settings. The results show that D2D load balancing can reduce the spectrum
requirement by 25% as compared to the standard scenario without D2D load
balancing, at the expense of negligible 0.7% D2D traffic overhead.

 <dc:description>  The future of main memory appears to lie in the direction of new technologies
that provide strong capacity-to-performance ratios, but have write operations
that are much more expensive than reads in terms of latency, bandwidth, and
energy. Motivated by this trend, we propose sequential and parallel algorithms
to solve graph connectivity problems using significantly fewer writes than
conventional algorithms. Our primary algorithmic tool is the construction of an
$o(n)$-sized &quot;implicit decomposition&quot; of a bounded-degree graph $G$ on $n$
nodes, which combined with read-only access to $G$ enables fast answers to
connectivity and biconnectivity queries on $G$. The construction breaks the
linear-write &quot;barrier&quot;, resulting in costs that are asymptotically lower than
conventional algorithms while adding only a modest cost to querying time. For
general non-sparse graphs on $m$ edges, we also provide the first $o(m)$ writes
and $O(m)$ operations parallel algorithms for connectivity and biconnectivity.
These algorithms provide insight into how applications can efficiently process
computations on large graphs in systems with read-write asymmetry.

 <dc:description>  Current topic models often suffer from discovering topics not matching human
intuition, unnatural switching of topics within documents and high
computational demands. We address these concerns by proposing a topic model and
an inference algorithm based on automatically identifying characteristic
keywords for topics. Keywords influence topic-assignments of nearby words. Our
algorithm learns (key)word-topic scores and it self-regulates the number of
topics. Inference is simple and easily parallelizable. Qualitative analysis
yields comparable results to state-of-the-art models (eg. LDA), but with
different strengths and weaknesses. Quantitative analysis using 9 datasets
shows gains in terms of classification accuracy, PMI score, computational
performance and consistency of topic assignments within documents, while most
often using less topics.

 <dc:description>  The characterization and understanding of online social network behavior is
of importance from both the points of view of fundamental research and
realistic utilization. In this manuscript, we propose a stochastic differential
equation to describe the online microblogging behavior. Our analysis is based
on the microblog data collected from Sina Weibo which is one of the most
popular microblogging platforms in China. Especially, we focus on the
collective nature of the microblogging behavior reflecting itself in the
analyzed data as the characters of the periodic pattern, the stochastic
fluctuation around the baseline, and the extraordinary jumps. Compared with
existing works, we use in our model time dependent parameters to facilitate the
periodic feature of the microblogging behavior and incorporate a compound
Poisson process to describe the extraordinary spikes in the Sina Weibo volume.
Such distinct merits lead to significant improvement in the prediction
performance, thus justifying the validity of our model. This work may offer
potential application in the future detection of the anomalous behavior in
online social network platforms.

 <dc:title>Increasing Availability in Distributed Storage Systems via Clustering</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce the Fixed Cluster Repair System (FCRS) as a novel architecture
for Distributed Storage Systems (DSS) that achieves a small repair bandwidth
while guaranteeing a high availability. Specifically we partition the set of
servers in a DSS into $s$ clusters and allow a failed server to choose any
cluster other than its own as its repair group. Thereby, we guarantee an
availability of $s-1$. We characterize the repair bandwidth vs. storage
trade-off for the FCRS under functional repair and show that the minimum repair
bandwidth can be improved by an asymptotic multiplicative factor of $2/3$
compared to the state of the art coding techniques that guarantee the same
availability. We further introduce cubic codes designed to minimize the repair
bandwidth of the FCRS under the exact repair model. We prove an asymptotic
multiplicative improvement of $0.79$ in the minimum repair bandwidth compared
to the existing exact repair coding techniques that achieve the same
availability. In addition, we show that cubic codes are
information-theoretically optimal for the FCRS with 2 and 3 complete clusters.

 <dc:description>  In wireless communication networks, interference models are routinely used
for tasks such as performance analysis, optimization, and protocol design.
These tasks are heavily affected by the accuracy and tractability of the
interference models. Yet, quantifying the accuracy of these models remains a
major challenge. In this paper, we propose a new index for assessing the
accuracy of any interference model under any network scenario. Specifically, it
is based on a new index that quantifies the ability of any interference model
in correctly predicting harmful interference events, that is, link outages. We
consider a specific wireless scenario of both conventional sub-6~GHz and
millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks and demonstrate how our index yields insights
into the possibility of simplifying the set of dominant interferers, replacing
a Nakagami or Rayleigh random fading by an equivalent deterministic channel,
and ignoring antenna sidelobes. Our analysis reveals that in highly directional
antenna settings with obstructions, even simple interference models (such as
the classical protocol model) are accurate, while with omnidirectional
antennas, more sophisticated and complex interference models (such as the
classical physical model) are necessary. We further use the proposed index to
develop a simple interference model for mmWave networks that can significantly
simplify design principles of the important procedures for wireless
communication, such as beamforming, interference management, scheduling, and
topology control. Our new approach makes it possible to adopt the simplest
interference model of adequate accuracy for every wireless network.

 <dc:title>On Mitigation of Side-Channel Attacks in 3D ICs: Decorrelating Thermal
  Patterns from Power and Activity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Knechtel, Johann</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Various side-channel attacks (SCAs) on ICs have been successfully
demonstrated and also mitigated to some degree. In the context of 3D ICs,
however, prior art has mainly focused on efficient implementations of classical
SCA countermeasures. That is, SCAs tailored for up-and-coming 3D ICs have been
overlooked so far. In this paper, we conduct such a novel study and focus on
one of the most accessible and critical side channels: thermal leakage of
activity and power patterns. We address the thermal leakage in 3D ICs early on
during floorplanning, along with tailored extensions for power and thermal
management. Our key idea is to carefully exploit the specifics of material and
structural properties in 3D ICs, thereby decorrelating the thermal behaviour
from underlying power and activity patterns. Most importantly, we discuss
powerful SCAs and demonstrate how our open-source tool helps to mitigate them.

 <dc:description>  Entity resolution identifies and removes duplicate entities in large, noisy
databases and has grown in both usage and new developments as a result of
increased data availability. Nevertheless, entity resolution has tradeoffs
regarding assumptions of the data generation process, error rates, and
computational scalability that make it a difficult task for real applications.
In this paper, we focus on a related problem of unique entity estimation, which
is the task of estimating the unique number of entities and associated standard
errors in a data set with duplicate entities. Unique entity estimation shares
many fundamental challenges of entity resolution, namely, that the
computational cost of all-to-all entity comparisons is intractable for large
databases. To circumvent this computational barrier, we propose an efficient
(near-linear time) estimation algorithm based on locality sensitive hashing.
Our estimator, under realistic assumptions, is unbiased and has provably low
variance compared to existing random sampling based approaches. In addition, we
empirically show its superiority over the state-of-the-art estimators on three
real applications. The motivation for our work is to derive an accurate
estimate of the documented, identifiable deaths in the ongoing Syrian conflict.
Our methodology, when applied to the Syrian data set, provides an estimate of
$191,874 \pm 1772$ documented, identifiable deaths, which is very close to the
Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) estimate of 191,369. Our work provides
an example of challenges and efforts involved in solving a real, noisy
challenging problem where modeling assumptions may not hold.

 <dc:description>  Automobiles are equipped with Electronic Control Units (ECU) that communicate
via in-vehicle network protocol standards such as Controller Area Network
(CAN). These protocols are designed under the assumption that separating
in-vehicle communications from external networks is sufficient for protection
against cyber attacks. This assumption, however, has been shown to be invalid
by recent attacks in which adversaries were able to infiltrate the in-vehicle
network. Motivated by these attacks, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have
been proposed for in-vehicle networks that attempt to detect attacks by making
use of device fingerprinting using properties such as clock skew of an ECU. In
this paper, we propose the cloaking attack, an intelligent masquerade attack in
which an adversary modifies the timing of transmitted messages in order to
match the clock skew of a targeted ECU. The attack leverages the fact that,
while the clock skew is a physical property of each ECU that cannot be changed
by the adversary, the estimation of the clock skew by other ECUs is based on
network traffic, which, being a cyber component only, can be modified by an
adversary. We implement the proposed cloaking attack and test it on two IDSs,
namely, the current state-of-the-art IDS and a new IDS that we develop based on
the widely-used Network Time Protocol (NTP). We implement the cloaking attack
on two hardware testbeds, a prototype and a real connected vehicle, and show
that it can always deceive both IDSs. We also introduce a new metric called the
Maximum Slackness Index to quantify the effectiveness of the cloaking attack
even when the adversary is unable to precisely match the clock skew of the
targeted ECU.

 <dc:title>Rudder Augmented Trajectory Correction for Small UAV to Minimize Lateral
  Image Errors</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fisher, Thomas</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Civil applications for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have increased rapidly
over the last few years. In the realm of civil applications, many aircraft
carry cameras that are physically fixed to the airframe. While this yields a
simple and robust remote sensing platform, the imagery quality diminishes with
increasing attitude errors. A rudder augmented trajectory correction method for
small unmanned aerial vehicles is discussed in this paper. The goal of this
type of controller is to minimize the lateral image errors of body fixed
non-gimbaled cameras. We present a comparison to current aileron only
trajectory correction autopilots. Simulation and flight test results are
presented that show significant reduction in the roll angle present during
trajectory correction resulting in a large effect on total flight line image
deviations.

 <dc:title>Properties of Syndrome Distribution for Blind Reconstruction of Cyclic

 <dc:creator>Yardi, Arti D.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the problem of blind reconstruction of channel codes, the receiver does
not have the knowledge of the channel code used at the transmitter and the aim
is to identify this unknown channel code corresponding to the given received
sequence. In this paper, we study this blind reconstruction problem for binary
cyclic codes. In the literature, several researchers have proposed blind
reconstruction algorithms that make use of the distribution of the syndromes
(remainders) of the received polynomials with respect to a candidate polynomial
for the generator polynomial of the cyclic code. However, very limited analysis
is available for the syndrome distribution and its properties. In this paper,
we study the syndrome structure of the received polynomials. Specifically, we
prove that the syndrome distribution of the noise-free sequence can either be
uniform or restricted uniform. We also provide the necessary and sufficient
conditions for it to be of the either type. For the noise-affected received
sequence we prove that, finding the syndrome distribution is in general
computationally intractable. We also apply these results to analyze the
performance of the existing methods and verify some of the assumptions made in
the literature for blind reconstruction.

 <dc:description>  One significant simplification in most previous work on robot learning is the
closed-world assumption where the robot is assumed to know ahead of time a
complete set of predicates describing the state of the physical world. However,
robots are not likely to have a complete model of the world especially when
learning a new task. To address this problem, this extended abstract gives a
brief introduction to our on-going work that aims to enable the robot to
acquire new state representations through language communication with humans.

 <dc:description>  Question classification is an important task with wide applications. However,
traditional techniques treat questions as general sentences, ignoring the
corresponding answer data. In order to consider answer information into
question modeling, we first introduce novel group sparse autoencoders which
refine question representation by utilizing group information in the answer
set. We then propose novel group sparse CNNs which naturally learn question
representation with respect to their answers by implanting group sparse
autoencoders into traditional CNNs. The proposed model significantly outperform
strong baselines on four datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes Oregon State University's submissions to the shared
WMT'17 task &quot;multimodal translation task I&quot;. In this task, all the sentence
pairs are image captions in different languages. The key difference between
this task and conventional machine translation is that we have corresponding
images as additional information for each sentence pair. In this paper, we
introduce a simple but effective system which takes an image shared between
different languages, feeding it into the both encoding and decoding side. We
report our system's performance for English-French and English-German with
Flickr30K (in-domain) and MSCOCO (out-of-domain) datasets. Our system achieves
the best performance in TER for English-German for MSCOCO dataset.

 <dc:description>  Integrated Model of Distributed Systems (IMDS) is developed for specification
and verification of distributed systems, and verification against deadlocks. On
the basis of IMDS, Dedan verification environment was prepared. Universal
deadlock detection formulas allow for automatic verification, without any
knowledge of a temporal logic, which simplifies the verification process.
However, the input language, following the rules of IMDS, seems to be exotic
for many users. For this reason Rybu preprocessor was created. Its purpose is
to build large models in imperative-style language, on much higher abstraction
level.

 <dc:description>  We give a concise presentation of the Univalent Foundations of mathematics
underlining the main ideas (section 1), followed by a discussion of the
large-scale UniMath library of formalized mathematics implementing the ideas of
the Univalent Foundations, and the challenges one faces in designing such a
library (section 2). This leads us to a general discussion about the links
between architecture and mathematics where a meeting of minds is revealed
between architects and mathematicians (section 3). Last, we show how the
Univalent Foundations enforces a structuralist view of mathematics embodied in
the so-called \emph{Structure Identity Principle} (section 4). On the way our
odyssey from foundations to the &quot;horizon&quot; of mathematics will lead us to meet
the mathematicians David Hilbert and Nicolas Bourbaki as well as the architect
Christopher Alexander and the philosopher Paul Benacerraf.

 <dc:description>  Fast and robust image matching is a very important task with various
applications in computer vision and robotics. In this paper, we compare the
performance of three different image matching techniques, i.e., SIFT, SURF, and
ORB, against different kinds of transformations and deformations such as
scaling, rotation, noise, fish eye distortion, and shearing. For this purpose,
we manually apply different types of transformations on original images and
compute the matching evaluation parameters such as the number of key points in
images, the matching rate, and the execution time required for each algorithm
and we will show that which algorithm is the best more robust against each kind
of distortion. Index Terms-Image matching, scale invariant feature transform
(SIFT), speed up robust feature (SURF), robust independent elementary features
(BRIEF), oriented FAST, rotated BRIEF (ORB).

 <dc:description>  We propose a slightly revised Miller-Hagberg (MH) algorithm that efficiently
generates a random network from a given expected degree sequence. The revision
was to replace the approximated edge probability between a pair of nodes with a
combinatorically calculated edge probability that better captures the
likelihood of edge presence especially where edges are dense. The computational
complexity of this combinatorial MH algorithm is still in the same order as the
original one. We evaluated the proposed algorithm through several numerical
experiments. The results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm was
particularly good at accurately representing high-degree nodes in dense,
heterogeneous networks. This algorithm may be a useful alternative of other
more established network randomization methods, given that the data are
increasingly becoming larger and denser in today's network science research.

 <dc:title>Beyond Log-concavity: Provable Guarantees for Sampling Multi-modal

 <dc:description>  A key task in Bayesian statistics is sampling from distributions that are
only specified up to a partition function (i.e., constant of proportionality).
However, without any assumptions, sampling (even approximately) can be #P-hard,
and few works have provided &quot;beyond worst-case&quot; guarantees for such settings.
  For log-concave distributions, classical results going back to Bakry and
\'Emery (1985) show that natural continuous-time Markov chains called Langevin
diffusions mix in polynomial time. The most salient feature of log-concavity
violated in practice is uni-modality: commonly, the distributions we wish to
sample from are multi-modal. In the presence of multiple deep and
well-separated modes, Langevin diffusion suffers from torpid mixing.
  We address this problem by combining Langevin diffusion with simulated
tempering. The result is a Markov chain that mixes more rapidly by
transitioning between different temperatures of the distribution. We analyze
this Markov chain for the canonical multi-modal distribution: a mixture of
gaussians (of equal variance). The algorithm based on our Markov chain provably
samples from distributions that are close to mixtures of gaussians, given
access to the gradient of the log-pdf. For the analysis, we use a spectral
decomposition theorem for graphs (Gharan and Trevisan, 2014) and a Markov chain
decomposition technique (Madras and Randall, 2002).

 <dc:description>  Given a triangulation of a point set in the plane, a \emph{flip} deletes an
edge $e$ whose removal leaves a convex quadrilateral, and replaces $e$ by the
opposite diagonal of the quadrilateral. It is well known that any triangulation
of a point set can be reconfigured to any other triangulation by some sequence
of flips. We explore this question in the setting where each edge of a
triangulation has a label, and a flip transfers the label of the removed edge
to the new edge.
  It is not true that every labelled triangulation of a point set can be
reconfigured to every other labelled triangulation via a sequence of flips. We
characterize when this is possible by proving the \emph{Orbit Conjecture} of
Bose, Lubiw, Pathak and Verdonschot which states that \emph{all} labels can be
simultaneously mapped to their destination if and only if \emph{each} label
individually can be mapped to its destination.
  Furthermore, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to find a sequence of flips
to reconfigure one labelled triangulation to another, if such a sequence
exists, and we prove an upper bound of $O(n^7)$ on the length of the flip
sequence.
  Our proof uses the topological result that the sets of pairwise non-crossing
edges on a planar point set form a simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to a
high-dimensional ball (this follows from a result of Orden and Santos; we give
a different proof based on a shelling argument). The dual cell complex of this
simplicial ball, called the \emph{flip complex}, has the usual flip graph as
its $1$-skeleton. We use properties of the $2$-skeleton of the flip complex to
prove the Orbit Conjecture.

 <dc:description>  As the number of documents on the web is growing exponentially,
multi-document summarization is becoming more and more important since it can
provide the main ideas in a document set in short time. In this paper, we
present an unsupervised centroid-based document-level reconstruction framework
using distributed bag of words model. Specifically, our approach selects
summary sentences in order to minimize the reconstruction error between the
summary and the documents. We apply sentence selection and beam search, to
further improve the performance of our model. Experimental results show that
performance of our model is competitive against the state-of-the-art
unsupervised algorithms on standard benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Quadrotors with large thrust-to-weight ratios are able to track aggressive
trajectories with sharp turns and high accelerations. In this work, we develop
a search-based trajectory planning approach that exploits the quadrotor
maneuverability to generate sequences of motion primitives in cluttered
environments. We model the quadrotor body as an ellipsoid and compute its
flight attitude along trajectories in order to check for collisions against
obstacles. The ellipsoid model allows the quadrotor to pass through gaps that
are smaller than its diameter with non-zero pitch or roll angles. Without any
prior information about the location of gaps and associated attitude
constraints, our algorithm is able to find a safe and optimal trajectory that
guides the robot to its goal as fast as possible. To accelerate planning, we
first perform a lower dimensional search and use it as a heuristic to guide the
generation of a final dynamically feasible trajectory. We analyze critical
discretization parameters of motion primitive planning and demonstrate the
feasibility of the generated trajectories in various simulations and real-world
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Digital image segmentation is the process of assigning distinct labels to
different objects in a digital image, and the fuzzy segmentation algorithm has
been successfully used in the segmentation of images from a wide variety of
sources. However, the traditional fuzzy segmentation algorithm fails to segment
objects that are characterized by textures whose patterns cannot be
successfully described by simple statistics computed over a very restricted
area. In this paper, we propose an extension of the fuzzy segmentation
algorithm that uses adaptive textural affinity functions to perform the
segmentation of such objects on bidimensional images. The adaptive affinity
functions compute their appropriate neighborhood size as they compute the
texture descriptors surrounding the seed spels (spatial elements), according to
the characteristics of the texture being processed. The algorithm then segments
the image with an appropriate neighborhood for each object. We performed
experiments on mosaic images that were composed using images from the Brodatz
database, and compared our results with the ones produced by a recently
published texture segmentation algorithm, showing the applicability of our
method.

 <dc:description>  We present a new clustering algorithm that is based on searching for natural

popular methods (KMEANS, spectral-KMEANS, and an agglomerative method) in the
context of the Lancichinetti-Fortunato-Radicchi (LFR) Benchmark for undirected
weighted overlapping networks, we find that the new method outperforms the
other spectral methods considered in certain parameter regimes. Finally, in an
application to climate data involving one of the most important modes of
interannual climate variability, the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon,
we demonstrate the ability of the new algorithm to readily identify different
flavors of the phenomenon.

 <dc:description>  Over the last five years Deep Neural Nets have offered more accurate
solutions to many problems in speech recognition, and computer vision, and
these solutions have surpassed a threshold of acceptability for many
applications. As a result, Deep Neural Networks have supplanted other
approaches to solving problems in these areas, and enabled many new
applications. While the design of Deep Neural Nets is still something of an art
form, in our work we have found basic principles of design space exploration
used to develop embedded microprocessor architectures to be highly applicable
to the design of Deep Neural Net architectures. In particular, we have used
these design principles to create a novel Deep Neural Net called SqueezeNet
that requires as little as 480KB of storage for its model parameters. We have
further integrated all these experiences to develop something of a playbook for
creating small Deep Neural Nets for embedded systems.

 <dc:description>  Proteins are the main workhorses of biological functions in a cell, a tissue,
or an organism. Identification and quantification of proteins in a given
sample, e.g. a cell type under normal/disease conditions, are fundamental tasks
for the understanding of human health and disease. In this paper, we present
DeepNovo, a deep learning-based tool to address the problem of protein
identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. The idea was first proposed
in the context of de novo peptide sequencing [1] in which convolutional neural
networks and recurrent neural networks were applied to predict the amino acid
sequence of a peptide from its spectrum, a similar task to generating a caption
from an image. We further develop DeepNovo to perform sequence database search,
the main technique for peptide identification that greatly benefits from
numerous existing protein databases. We combine two modules de novo sequencing
and database search into a single deep learning framework for peptide
identification, and integrate de Bruijn graph assembly technique to offer a
complete solution to reconstruct protein sequences from tandem mass
spectrometry data. This paper describes a comprehensive protocol of DeepNovo
for protein identification, including training neural network models, dynamic
programming search, database querying, estimation of false discovery rate, and
de Bruijn graph assembly. Training and testing data, model implementations, and
comprehensive tutorials in form of IPython notebooks are available in our
GitHub repository (https://github.com/nh2tran/DeepNovo).

representation between multiple functions by an embedding in a shared latent
space. The proposed model allows for both arbitrary alignments of the inputs
and and also non-parametric output warpings to transform the observations. This
gives rise to multiple deep Gaussian process models connected via latent
generating processes. We derive an efficient variational approximation based on
nested variational compression and show how the model can be used to extract
shared information between dependent time series, recovering an interpretable
functional decomposition of the learning problem.

CREST workshop: addressing approaches to causal reasoning in engineering
complex embedded and safety-critical systems. Relevant approaches to causal
reasoning have been (usually independently) proposed by a variety of
communities: AI, concurrency, model-based diagnosis, software engineering,
security engineering, and formal methods. The goal of CREST is to bring
together researchers and practitioners from these communities to exchange
ideas, especially between communities, in order to advance the science of
determining root cause(s) for failures of critical systems. The growing
complexity of failures such as power grid blackouts, airplane crashes, security
and privacy violations, and malfunctioning medical devices or automotive
systems makes the goals of CREST more relevant than ever before.

 <dc:description>  Machine Comprehension (MC) is a challenging task in Natural Language
Processing field, which aims to guide the machine to comprehend a passage and
answer the given question. Many existing approaches on MC task are suffering
the inefficiency in some bottlenecks, such as insufficient lexical
understanding, complex question-passage interaction, incorrect answer
extraction and so on. In this paper, we address these problems from the
viewpoint of how humans deal with reading tests in a scientific way.
Specifically, we first propose a novel lexical gating mechanism to dynamically
combine the words and characters representations. We then guide the machines to
read in an interactive way with attention mechanism and memory network. Finally
we add a checking layer to refine the answer for insurance. The extensive
experiments on two popular datasets SQuAD and TriviaQA show that our method
exceeds considerable performance than most state-of-the-art solutions at the
time of submission.

 <dc:description>  Continuous mixtures of distributions are widely employed in the statistical
literature as models for phenomena with highly divergent outcomes; in
particular, many familiar heavy-tailed distributions arise naturally as
mixtures of light-tailed distributions (e.g., Gaussians), and play an important
role in applications as diverse as modeling of extreme values and robust
inference. In the case of social networks, continuous mixtures of graph
distributions can likewise be employed to model social processes with
heterogeneous outcomes, or as robust priors for network inference. Here, we
introduce some simple families of network models based on continuous mixtures
of baseline distributions. While analytically and computationally tractable,
these models allow more flexible modeling of cross-graph heterogeneity than is
possible with conventional baseline (e.g., Bernoulli or $U|man$ distributions).
We illustrate the utility of these baseline mixture models with application to
problems of multiple-network ERGMs, network evolution, and efficient network
inference. Our results underscore the potential ubiquity of network processes
with nontrivial mixture behavior in natural settings, and raise some
potentially disturbing questions regarding the adequacy of current network data
collection practices.

 <dc:description>  We define the entanglement-gradient routing scheme for quantum repeater
networks. The routing framework fuses the fundamentals of swarm intelligence
and quantum Shannon theory. Swarm intelligence provides nature-inspired
solutions for problem solving. Motivated by models of social insect behavior,
the routing is performed using parallel threads to determine the shortest path
via the entanglement gradient coefficient, which describes the feasibility of
the entangled links and paths of the network. The routing metrics are derived
from the characteristics of entanglement transmission and relevant measures of
entanglement distribution in quantum networks. The method allows a moderate
complexity decentralized routing in quantum repeater networks. The results can
be applied in experimental quantum networking, future quantum Internet, and
long-distance quantum communications.

 <dc:description>  Given a control system on a manifold that is embedded in Euclidean space, it
is sometimes convenient to use a single global coordinate system in the ambient
Euclidean space for controller design rather than to use multiple local charts
on the manifold or coordinate-free tools from differential geometry. In this
paper, we develop a theory about this and apply it to the fully actuated rigid
body system for stabilization and tracking. A noteworthy point in this theory
is that we legitimately modify the system dynamics outside its state-space
manifold before controller design so as to add attractiveness to the manifold
in the resulting dynamics.

 <dc:description>  We prove two related concentration inequalities concerning the number of
rational points of hyperelliptic curves over subsets of a finite field. In
particular, we investigate the probability of a large discrepancy between the
numbers of quadratic residues and non-residues in the image of such subsets
over uniformly random hyperelliptic curves of given degrees. We find a constant
probability of such a high difference and show the existence of sets with an
exceptionally large discrepancy.

of the morphism $\phi: (2i) \mapsto (2i)(2i+ 1),\ (2i+ 1) \mapsto (2i+ 2)$ over
all $i \in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper we investigate the occurrence of squares,

 <dc:description>  Generation of deviates from random graph models with non-trivial edge
dependence is an increasingly important problem. Here, we introduce a method
which allows perfect sampling from random graph models in exponential family
form (&quot;exponential family random graph&quot; models), using a variant of Coupling
From The Past. We illustrate the use of the method via an application to the
Markov graphs, a family that has been the subject of considerable research. We
also show how the method can be applied to a variant of the biased net models,
which are not exponentially parameterized.

that the axioms for CKA with bounded parallelism are complete for the semantics
proposed in the original paper; consequently, these semantics are the free

in particular, they allow us to establish pomset automata as an operational

 <dc:description>  Multireference alignment refers to the problem of estimating a signal from
its circularly translated copies in the presence of noise. Previous papers
showed that if the translations are drawn from the uniform distribution, then
the sample complexity of the problem scales as $1/\operatorname{SNR}^3$ in the
low SNR regime. In this work, we show that the sample complexity for any
aperiodic translation distribution scales as $1/\operatorname{SNR}^2$ in the
low SNR regime. This rate is achieved by a simple spectral algorithm. We
propose two additional algorithms based on non-convex optimization and
expectation-maximization. We also draw a connection between the multireference
alignment problem and the spiked covariance model.

 <dc:title>Vulnerabilities of Massive MIMO Systems Against Pilot Contamination

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a single-cell massive MIMO system in which a base station (BS)
with a large number of antennas transmits simultaneously to several
single-antenna users in the presence of an attacker.The BS acquires the channel
state information (CSI) based on uplink pilot transmissions. In this work, we
demonstrate the vulnerability of CSI estimation phase to malicious attacks. For
that purpose, we study two attack models. In the first model, the attacker aims
at minimizing the sum-rate of downlink transmissions by contaminating the
uplink pilots. In the second model, the attacker exploits its in-band
full-duplex capabilities to generate jamming signals in both the CSI estimation
and data transmission phases. We study these attacks under two downlink power
allocation strategies when the attacker knows and does not know the locations
of the BS and users. The formulated problems are solved using stochastic
optimization, Lagrangian minimization, and game-theoretic methods. A
closed-form solution for a special case of the problem is obtained.
Furthermore, we analyze the achievable individual secrecy rates under a pilot
contamination attack, and provide an upper bound on these rates. Our results
indicate that the proposed attacks degrade the throughput of a massive MIMO
system by more than half.

 <dc:title>DEBIT: Distributed Energy Beamforming and Information Transfer for
  Multiway Relay Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fang, Zhaoxi</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yuan, Xiaojun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new distributed energy beamforming and
information transfer (DEBIT) scheme for realizing simultaneous wireless
information and power transfer (SWIPT) in multiway relay networks (MWRNs),
where multiple single-antenna users exchange information via an
energy-constrained single-antenna relay node. We investigate the optimal
transceiver designs to maximize the achievable sum-rate or the harvested power.
The resultant sum-rate maximization problem is non-convex and the global
optimal solution can be obtained through a three-dimensional search in
combination with conventional convex optimization. To reduce the computation
complexity, a suboptimal DEBIT scheme is also proposed, for which the
optimization problem becomes linear programming. The achievable sum-rate
performance is analyzed and a closed-form lower bound is derived for the MWRN
with a large number of users. Furthermore, we consider the harvested-power
maximization problem under a target sum-rate constraint, and derive a lower
bound of the average harvested power for MWRNs with a large number of users.
Numerical results show that the DEBIT scheme significantly outperforms the
conventional SWIPT and the derived lower bounds are tight.

 <dc:description>  Writing requirements for embedded software is pointless unless they reflect
actual needs and the final software implements them. In usual approaches, the
use of different notations for requirements (often natural language) and code
(a programming language) makes both conditions elusive. To address the problem,
we propose to write requirements in the programming language itself. The
expected advantages of this seamless approach, called AutoReq include: avoiding
the potentially costly miss due to the use of different notations; facilitating
software change and evolution, by making it easier to update code when
requirements change and conversely; benefiting from the remarkable expressive
power of modern object-oriented programming languages, while retaining a level
of abstraction appropriate for requirements; leveraging, in both requirements
and code, the ideas of Design by Contract, including (as the article shows)
applying Hoare-style assertions to express temporal-logic-style properties and
timing constraints; and taking advantage of the powerful verification tools
that have been developed in recent years. The last goal, verification, is a
focus of this article. While the idea of verifying requirements is not widely
applied, the use of a precise formalism and a modern program prover (in our
case, AutoProof for Eiffel) makes it possible at a very early stage to identify
errors and inconsistencies which would, if not caught in the requirements,
contaminate the final code. Applying the approach to a well-documented
industrial example (a landing gear system) allowed a mechanical proof of
consistency and uncovered an error in a previously published discussion of the
problem.

 <dc:description>  Essentially, in a reversible programming language, for each forward
computation from state $S$ to state $S'$, there exists a constructive method to
go backwards from state $S'$ to state $S$. Besides its theoretical interest,
reversible computation is a fundamental concept which is relevant in many
different areas like cellular automata, bidirectional program transformation,
or quantum computing, to name a few.
  In this work, we focus on term rewriting, a computation model that underlies
most rule-based programming languages. In general, term rewriting is not
reversible, even for injective functions; namely, given a rewrite step $t_1
\rightarrow t_2$, we do not always have a decidable method to get $t_1$ from
$t_2$. Here, we introduce a conservative extension of term rewriting that
becomes reversible. Furthermore, we also define two transformations,
injectivization and inversion, to make a rewrite system reversible using
standard term rewriting. We illustrate the usefulness of our transformations in
the context of bidirectional program transformation.

 <dc:description>  An important step in the asynchronous multi-sensor registration problem is to
estimate sensor range and azimuth biases from their noisy asynchronous
measurements. The estimation problem is generally very challenging due to
highly nonlinear transformation between the global and local coordinate systems
as well as measurement asynchrony from different sensors. In this paper, we
propose a novel nonlinear least square (LS) formulation for the problem by only
assuming that a reference target moves with an unknown constant velocity. We
also propose a block coordinate decent (BCD) optimization algorithm, with a
judicious initialization, for solving the problem. The proposed BCD algorithm
alternately updates the range and azimuth bias estimates by solving linear
least square problems and semidefinite programs (SDPs). The proposed algorithm
is guaranteed to find the global solution of the problem and the true biases in
the noiseless case. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
significantly outperforms the existing approaches in terms of the root mean
square error (RMSE).

 <dc:description>  Pilot contamination, caused by the reuse of pilots among interfering cells,
remains as a significant obstacle that limits the performance of massive
multi-input multi-output antenna systems. To handle this problem, less
aggressive reuse of pilots involving allocation of additional pilots for
interfering users is closely examined in this paper. Hierarchical pilot reuse
methods are proposed, which effectively mitigate pilot contamination and
increase the net throughput of the system. Among the suggested hierarchical
pilot reuse schemes, the optimal way of assigning pilots to different users is
obtained in a closed-form solution which maximizes the net sum-rate in a given
coherence time. Simulation results confirm that when the ratio of the channel
coherence time to the number of users in each cell is sufficiently large, less
aggressive reuse of pilots yields significant performance advantage relative to
the case where all cells reuse the same pilot set.

 <dc:title>A Hierarchical Singular Value Decomposition Algorithm for Low Rank

 <dc:creator>Vasudevan, Vinita</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Ramakrishna, M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely used technique for
dimensionality reduction and computation of basis vectors. In many
applications, especially in fluid mechanics, the matrices are dense, but
low-rank matrices. In these cases, a truncated SVD corresponding to the most
significant singular values is sufficient. In this paper, we propose a tree
based merge-and-truncate algorithm to obtain an approximate truncated SVD of
the matrix. Unlike previous methods, our technique is not limited to &quot;tall and
skinny&quot; or &quot;short and fat&quot; matrices and it can be used for matrices of
arbitrary size. It is also an incremental algorithm, useful for online
streaming applications. The matrix is partitioned into blocks and a truncated
SVD of each block is used to obtain the final SVD. A comparison with existing
techniques shows that a 5-10x speedup is possible.

Dependencies (CFDs) and Edition Rules (ERs), etc. The stronger expressing
ability a dependency has, data with the better quality can be obtained. To the
best of our knowledge, all previous dependencies treat each attribute value as
a non-splittable whole. Actually however, in many applications, part of a value
may contains meaningful information, indicating that more powerful dependency
rules to handle data quality problems are possible. In this paper, we consider
of discovering such type of dependencies in which the left hand side is part of
a regular-expression-like paradigm, named Paradigm Dependencies (PDs). PDs tell
that if a string matches the paradigm, element at the specified position can
decides a certain other attribute's value. We propose a framework in which
strings with similar coding rules and different lengths are clustered together
and aligned vertically, from which PDs can be discovered directly. The aligning
problem is the key component of this framework and is proved in NP-Complete. A
greedy algorithm is introduced in which the clustering and aligning tasks can
be accomplished simultaneously. Because of the greedy algorithm's high time
complexity, several pruning strategies are proposed to reduce the running time.
In the experimental study, three real datasets as well as several synthetical
datasets are employed to verify our methods' effectiveness and efficiency.

 <dc:description>  Micro-expressions are rapid and involuntary facial expressions, which
indicate the suppressed or concealed emotions. Recently, the research on
automatic micro-expression (ME) spotting obtains increasing attention. ME
spotting is a crucial step prior to further ME analysis tasks. The spotting
results can be used as important cues to assist many other human-oriented tasks
and thus have many potential applications. In this paper, by investigating
existing ME spotting methods, we recognize the immediacy of standardizing the
performance evaluation of micro-expression spotting methods. To this end, we
construct a micro-expression spotting benchmark (MESB). Firstly, we set up a
sliding window based multi-scale evaluation framework. Secondly, we introduce a
series of protocols. Thirdly, we also provide baseline results of popular
methods. The MESB facilitates the research on ME spotting with fairer and more
comprehensive evaluation and also enables to leverage the cutting-edge machine
learning tools widely.

 <dc:description>  A new system model reflecting the clustered structure of distributed storage
is suggested to investigate bandwidth requirements for repairing failed storage
nodes. Large data centers with multiple racks/disks or local networks of
storage devices (e.g. sensor network) are good applications of the suggested
clustered model. In realistic scenarios involving clustered storage structures,
repairing storage nodes using intact nodes residing in other clusters is more
bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes based on information from
intra-cluster nodes. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between
intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth in modeling
distributed storage. Capacity of the suggested model is obtained as a function
of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems, namely, node storage
capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth.
The capacity is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to a monotonic decreasing
function of number of clusters, as the number of storage nodes increases
without bound. Based on the capacity expression, feasible sets of required
resources which enable reliable storage are obtained in a closed-form solution.
Specifically, it is shown that the cross-cluster traffic can be minimized to
zero (i.e., intra-cluster local repair becomes possible) by allowing extra
resources on storage capacity and intra-cluster repair bandwidth, according to
the law specified in the closed-form. The network coding schemes with zero
cross-cluster traffic are defined as intra-cluster repairable codes, which are
shown to be a class of the previously developed locally repairable codes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of classifying business process instances based on
structural features derived from event logs. The main motivation is to provide
machine learning based techniques with quick response times for interactive
computer assisted root cause analysis. In particular, we create structural
features from process mining such as activity and transition occurrence counts,
and ordering of activities to be evaluated as potential features for
classification. We show that adding such structural features increases the
amount of information thus potentially increasing classification accuracy.
However, there is an inherent trade-off as using too many features leads to too
long run-times for machine learning classification models. One way to improve
the machine learning algorithms' run-time is to only select a small number of
features by a feature selection algorithm. However, the run-time required by
the feature selection algorithm must also be taken into account. Also, the
classification accuracy should not suffer too much from the feature selection.
The main contributions of this paper are as follows: First, we propose and
compare six different feature selection algorithms by means of an experimental
setup comparing their classification accuracy and achievable response times.
Second, we discuss the potential use of feature selection results for computer
assisted root cause analysis as well as the properties of different types of
structural features in the context of feature selection.

 <dc:description>  The online sports gambling industry employs teams of data analysts to build
forecast models that turn the odds at sports games in their favour. While
several betting strategies have been proposed to beat bookmakers, from expert
prediction models and arbitrage strategies to odds bias exploitation, their
returns have been inconsistent and it remains to be shown that a betting
strategy can outperform the online sports betting market. We designed a
strategy to beat football bookmakers with their own numbers. Instead of
building a forecasting model to compete with bookmakers predictions, we
exploited the probability information implicit in the odds publicly available
in the marketplace to find bets with mispriced odds. Our strategy proved
profitable in a 10-year historical simulation using closing odds, a 6-month
historical simulation using minute to minute odds, and a 5-month period during
which we staked real money with the bookmakers (we made code, data and models
publicly available). Our results demonstrate that the football betting market
is inefficient - bookmakers can be consistently beaten across thousands of
games in both simulated environments and real-life betting. We provide a
detailed description of our betting experience to illustrate how the sports
gambling industry compensates these market inefficiencies with discriminatory
practices against successful clients.

 <dc:title>Beyond Worst-Case (In)approximability of Nonsubmodular Influence
  Maximization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of maximizing the spread of influence in a social
network by choosing a fixed number of initial seeds, formally referred to as
the influence maximization problem. It admits a $(1-1/e)$-factor approximation
algorithm if the influence function is submodular. Otherwise, in the worst
case, the problem is NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of
$N^{1-\varepsilon}$. This paper studies whether this worst-case hardness result
can be circumvented by making assumptions about either the underlying network
topology or the cascade model. All of our assumptions are motivated by many
real life social network cascades.
  First, we present strong inapproximability results for a very restricted
class of networks called the (stochastic) hierarchical blockmodel, a special
case of the well-studied (stochastic) blockmodel in which relationships between
blocks admit a tree structure. We also provide a dynamic-program based
polynomial time algorithm which optimally computes a directed variant of the
influence maximization problem on hierarchical blockmodel networks. Our
algorithm indicates that the inapproximability result is due to the
bidirectionality of influence between agent-blocks.
  Second, we present strong inapproximability results for a class of influence
functions that are &quot;almost&quot; submodular, called 2-quasi-submodular. Our
inapproximability results hold even for any 2-quasi-submodular $f$ fixed in
advance. This result also indicates that the &quot;threshold&quot; between submodularity
and nonsubmodularity is sharp, regarding the approximability of influence
maximization.

 <dc:description>  We have witnessed the discovery of many techniques for network representation
learning in recent years, ranging from encoding the context in random walks to
embedding the lower order connections, to finding latent space representations
with auto-encoders. However, existing techniques are looking mostly into the
local structures in a network, while higher-level properties such as global
community structures are often neglected. We propose a novel network
representations learning model framework called RUM (network Representation
learning throUgh Multi-level structural information preservation). In RUM, we
incorporate three essential aspects of a node that capture a network's
characteristics in multiple levels: a node's affiliated local triads, its
neighborhood relationships, and its global community affiliations. Therefore
the framework explicitly and comprehensively preserves the structural
information of a network, extending the encoding process both to the local end
of the structural information spectrum and to the global end. The framework is
also flexible enough to take various community discovery algorithms as its
preprocessor. Empirical results show that the representations learned by RUM
have demonstrated substantial performance advantages in real-life tasks.

 <dc:description>  This paper aims to develop a new and robust approach to feature
representation. Motivated by the success of Auto-Encoders, we first theoretical
summarize the general properties of all algorithms that are based on
traditional Auto-Encoders: 1) The reconstruction error of the input or
corrupted input can not be lower than a lower bound, which can be viewed as a
guiding principle for reconstructing the input or corrupted input. 2) The
reconstruction of a hidden representation achieving its ideal situation is the
necessary condition for the reconstruction of the input to reach the ideal
state. 3) Minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix has a deficiency
and may result in a much worse local optimum value. 4) Minimizing the
reconstruction error of the hidden representation is more robust than
minimizing the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix. Based on the above
analysis, we propose a new model termed Double Denoising Auto-Encoders (DDAEs),
which uses corruption and reconstruction on both the input and the hidden
representation. We demonstrate that the proposed model is highly flexible and
extensible. We also show that for handling inessential features, our model is
more robust than Denoising Auto-Encoders (DAEs). Comparative experiments
illustrate that our model is significantly better for representation learning
than the state-of-the-art models.

 <dc:description>  Fast polarization is crucial for the performance guarantees of polar codes.
In the memoryless setting, the rate of polarization is known to be exponential
in the square root of the block length. A complete characterization of the rate
of polarization for models with memory has been missing. We consider polar
codes for processes with memory that are characterized by an underlying ergodic
finite state Markov chain. We show that the rate of polarization for these
processes is the same as in the memoryless setting, both to the high and to the
low entropy sets. Thus, polar codes achieve the Markov capacity in many
infromation-theoretic applications.

 <dc:description>  Soft biometric modalities have shown their utility in different applications
including reducing the search space significantly. This leads to improved
recognition performance, reduced computation time, and faster processing of
test samples. Some common soft biometric modalities are ethnicity, gender, age,
hair color, iris color, presence of facial hair or moles, and markers. This
research focuses on performing ethnicity and gender classification on iris
images. We present a novel supervised autoencoder based approach, Deep
Class-Encoder, which uses class labels to learn discriminative representation
for the given sample by mapping the learned feature vector to its label. The
proposed model is evaluated on two datasets each for ethnicity and gender
classification. The results obtained using the proposed Deep Class-Encoder
demonstrate its effectiveness in comparison to existing approaches and
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Clickbait is a pejorative term describing web content that is aimed at
generating online advertising revenue, especially at the expense of quality or
accuracy, relying on sensationalist headlines or eye-catching thumbnail
pictures to attract click-throughs and to encourage forwarding of the material
over online social networks. We use distributed word representations of the
words in the title as features to identify clickbaits in online news media. We
train a machine learning model using linear regression to predict the cickbait
score of a given tweet. Our methods achieve an F1-score of 64.98\% and an MSE
of 0.0791. Compared to other methods, our method is simple, fast to train, does
not require extensive feature engineering and yet moderately effective.

 <dc:description>  Heterogeneous data pose serious challenges to data analysis tasks, including
exploration and visualization. Current techniques often utilize dimensionality
reductions, aggregation, or conversion to numerical values to analyze
heterogeneous data. However, the effectiveness of such techniques to find
subtle structures such as the presence of multiple modes or detection of
outliers is hindered by the challenge to find the proper subspaces or prior
knowledge to reveal the structures. In this paper, we propose a generic
similarity-based exploration technique that is applicable to a wide variety of
datatypes and their combinations, including heterogeneous ensembles. The
proposed concept of similarity has a close connection to statistical analysis
and can be deployed for summarization, revealing fine structures such as the
presence of multiple modes, and detection of anomalies or outliers. We then
propose a visual encoding framework that enables the exploration of a
heterogeneous dataset in different levels of detail and provides insightful
information about both global and local structures. We demonstrate the utility
of the proposed technique using various real datasets, including ensemble data.

 <dc:description>  Forensic application of automatically matching skull with face images is an
important research area linking biometrics with practical applications in
forensics. It is an opportunity for biometrics and face recognition researchers
to help the law enforcement and forensic experts in giving an identity to
unidentified human skulls. It is an extremely challenging problem which is
further exacerbated due to lack of any publicly available database related to
this problem. This is the first research in this direction with a two-fold
contribution: (i) introducing the first of its kind skull-face image pair
database, IdentifyMe, and (ii) presenting a preliminary approach using the
proposed semi-supervised formulation of transform learning. The experimental
results and comparison with existing algorithms showcase the challenging nature
of the problem. We assert that the availability of the database will inspire
researchers to build sophisticated skull-to-face matching algorithms.

 <dc:title>Using the Value of Information to Explore Stochastic, Discrete

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic exploration strategy for
stochastic, discrete multi-armed bandits that achieves optimal regret. Our
strategy is based on the value of information criterion. This criterion
measures the trade-off between policy information and obtainable rewards. High
amounts of policy information are associated with exploration-dominant searches
of the space and yield high rewards. Low amounts of policy information favor
the exploitation of existing knowledge. Information, in this criterion, is
quantified by a parameter that can be varied during search. We demonstrate that
a simulated-annealing-like update of this parameter, with a sufficiently fast
cooling schedule, leads to an optimal regret that is logarithmic with respect
to the number of episodes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of optimal path planning in different homotopy
classes in a given environment. Though important in robotics applications,
path-planning with reasoning about homotopy classes of trajectories has
typically focused on subsets of the Euclidean plane in the robotics literature.
The problem of finding optimal trajectories in different homotopy classes in
more general configuration spaces (or even characterizing the homotopy classes
of such trajectories) can be difficult. In this paper we propose automated
solutions to this problem in several general classes of configuration spaces by
constructing presentations of fundamental groups and giving algorithms for
solving the \emph{word problem} in such groups. We present explicit results
that apply to knot and link complements in 3-space, discuss how to extend to
cylindrically-deleted coordination spaces of arbitrary dimension, and also
present results in the coordination space of robots navigating on an Euclidean
plane.

 <dc:description>  Generalized Prolate Spheroidal Functions (GPSF) are the eigenfunctions of the
truncated Fourier transform, restricted to D-dimensional balls in the spatial
domain and frequency domain. Despite their useful properties in many
applications, GPSFs are often replaced by crude approximations. The purpose of
this paper is to review the elements of computing GPSFs and associated
eigenvalues. This paper is accompanied by open-source code.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Detectability, Opacity and A-Diagnosability for Modular

 <dc:description>  We study the complexity of deciding whether a modular discrete event system
is detectable (resp. opaque, A-diagnosable). Detectability arises in the state
estimation of discrete event systems, opacity is related to the privacy and
security analysis, and A-diagnosability appears in the fault diagnosis of
stochastic discrete event systems. Previously, deciding weak detectability
(opacity, A-diagnosability) for monolithic systems was shown to be
PSPACE-complete. In this paper, we study the complexity of deciding weak
detectability (opacity, A-diagnosability) for modular systems. We show that the
complexities of these problems are significantly worse than in the monolithic
case. Namely, we show that deciding modular weak detectability (opacity,
A-diagnosability) is EXPSPACE-complete. We further discuss a special case where
all unobservable events are private, and show that in this case the problems
are PSPACE-complete. Consequently, if the systems are all fully observable,
then deciding weak detectability (opacity) for modular systems is
PSPACE-complete.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the learning algorithm based on the Recurrent
Network-based Deterministic Policy Gradient. The Long-Short Term Memory is
utilized to enable the Partially Observed Markov Decision Process framework.
The novelty are improvements of LSTM networks: update of multi-step temporal
difference, removal of backpropagation through time on actor, initialisation of
hidden state using past trajectory scanning, and injection of external
experiences learned by other agents. Our methods benefit the reinforcement
learning agent on inferring the desirable action by referring the trajectories
of both past observations and actions. The proposed algorithm was implemented
to solve the Bipedal-Walker challenge in OpenAI virtual environment where only
partial state information is available. The validation on the extremely rugged
terrain demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by achieving a
new record of highest rewards in the challenge. The autonomous behaviors
generated by our agent are highly adaptive to a variety of obstacles as shown
in the simulation results.

 <dc:title>The space complexity of mirror games</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider a simple streaming game between two players Alice and Bob, which
we call the mirror game. In this game, Alice and Bob take turns saying numbers
belonging to the set $\{1, 2, \dots,2N\}$. A player loses if they repeat a
number that has already been said. Bob, who goes second, has a very simple (and
memoryless) strategy to avoid losing: whenever Alice says $x$, respond with
$2N+1-x$. The question is: does Alice have a similarly simple strategy to win
that avoids remembering all the numbers said by Bob?
  The answer is no. We prove a linear lower bound on the space complexity of
any deterministic winning strategy of Alice. Interestingly, this follows as a
consequence of the Eventown-Oddtown theorem from extremal combinatorics. We
additionally demonstrate a randomized strategy for Alice that wins with high
probability that requires only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt N)$ space (provided that Alice
has access to a random matching on $K_{2N}$).
  We also investigate lower bounds for a generalized mirror game where Alice
and Bob alternate saying $1$ number and $b$ numbers each turn (respectively).
When $1+b$ is a prime, our linear lower bounds continue to hold, but when $1+b$
is composite, we show that the existence of a $o(N)$ space strategy for Bob
implies the existence of exponential-sized matching vector families over
$\mathbb{Z}^N_{1+b}$.

 <dc:description>  In a recent note [8], the author provides a counterexample to the global
convergence of what his work refers to as &quot;the DSOS and SDSOS hierarchies&quot; for
polynomial optimization problems (POPs) and purports that this refutes claims
in our extended abstract [4] and slides in [3]. The goal of this paper is to
clarify that neither [4], nor [3], and certainly not our full paper [5], ever
defined DSOS or SDSOS hierarchies as it is done in [8]. It goes without saying
that no claims about convergence properties of the hierarchies in [8] were ever
made as a consequence. What was stated in [4,3] was completely different: we
stated that there exist hierarchies based on DSOS and SDSOS optimization that
converge. This is indeed true as we discuss in this response. We also emphasize
that we were well aware that some (S)DSOS hierarchies do not converge even if
their natural SOS counterparts do. This is readily implied by an example in our
prior work [5], which makes the counterexample in [8] superfluous. Finally, we
provide concrete counterarguments to claims made in [8] that aim to challenge
the scalability improvements obtained by DSOS and SDSOS optimization as
compared to sum of squares (SOS) optimization.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study principal components analysis in the regime of high
dimensionality and high noise. Our model of the problem is a rank-one
deformation of a Wigner matrix where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is of
constant order, and we are interested in the fundamental limits of detection of
the spike. Our main goal is to gain a fine understanding of the asymptotics for
the log-likelihood ratio process, also known as the free energy, as a function
of the SNR. Our main results are twofold. We first prove that the free energy
has a finite-size correction to its limit---the replica-symmetric
formula---which we explicitly compute. This provides a formula for the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the planted and null models. Second, we
prove that below the reconstruction threshold, where it becomes impossible to
reconstruct the spike, the log-likelihood ratio has fluctuations of constant
order and converges in distribution to a Gaussian under both the planted and
(under restrictions) the null model. As a consequence, we provide a general
proof of contiguity between these two distributions that holds up to the
reconstruction threshold, and is valid for an arbitrary separable prior on the
spike. Formulae for the total variation distance, and the Type-I and Type-II
errors of the optimal test are also given. Our proofs are based on Gaussian
interpolation methods and a rigorous incarnation of the cavity method, as
devised by Guerra and Talagrand in their study of the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick
spin-glass model.

and super-resolution should yield improvements by de-emphasizing noise and
increasing signal in an input image. But the historically divergent goals of
the computational photography and visual recognition communities have created a
significant need for more work in this direction. To facilitate new research,
we introduce a new benchmark dataset called UG^2, which contains three
difficult real-world scenarios: uncontrolled videos taken by UAVs and manned
gliders, as well as controlled videos taken on the ground. Over 160,000
annotated frames forhundreds of ImageNet classes are available, which are used
for baseline experiments that assess the impact of known and unknown image
artifacts and other conditions on common deep learning-based object
classification approaches. Further, current image restoration and enhancement
techniques are evaluated by determining whether or not theyimprove baseline
classification performance. Results showthat there is plenty of room for
algorithmic innovation, making this dataset a useful tool going forward.

 <dc:description>  Next-generation wireless networks must support ultra-reliable, low-latency
communication and intelligently manage a massive number of Internet of Things
(IoT) devices in real-time, within a highly dynamic environment. This need for
stringent communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements as well as mobile
edge and core intelligence can only be realized by integrating fundamental
notions of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning across the
wireless infrastructure and end-user devices. In this context, this paper
provides a comprehensive tutorial that introduces the main concepts of machine
learning, in general, and artificial neural networks (ANNs), in particular, and
their potential applications in wireless communications. For this purpose, we
present a comprehensive overview on a number of key types of neural networks
that include feed-forward, recurrent, spiking, and deep neural networks. For
each type of neural network, we present the basic architecture and training
procedure, as well as the associated challenges and opportunities. Then, we
provide an in-depth overview on the variety of wireless communication problems
that can be addressed using ANNs, ranging from communication using unmanned
aerial vehicles to virtual reality and edge caching.For each individual
application, we present the main motivation for using ANNs along with the
associated challenges while also providing a detailed example for a use case
scenario and outlining future works that can be addressed using ANNs. In a
nutshell, this article constitutes one of the first holistic tutorials on the
development of machine learning techniques tailored to the needs of future
wireless networks.

 <dc:description>  Face sketch to digital image matching is an important challenge of face
recognition that involves matching across different domains. Current research
efforts have primarily focused on extracting domain invariant representations
or learning a mapping from one domain to the other. In this research, we
propose a novel transform learning based approach termed as DeepTransformer,
which learns a transformation and mapping function between the features of two
domains. The proposed formulation is independent of the input information and
can be applied with any existing learned or hand-crafted feature. Since the
mapping function is directional in nature, we propose two variants of
DeepTransformer: (i) semi-coupled and (ii) symmetrically-coupled deep transform
learning. This research also uses a novel IIIT-D Composite Sketch with Age
(CSA) variations database which contains sketch images of 150 subjects along
with age-separated digital photos. The performance of the proposed models is
evaluated on a novel application of sketch-to-sketch matching, along with
sketch-to-digital photo matching. Experimental results demonstrate the
robustness of the proposed models in comparison to existing state-of-the-art
sketch matching algorithms and a commercial face recognition system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In Directed Self Assembly (DSA), poor printing of guiding templates can cause
misassembly resulting in high defect probability. Therefore, hotspots should be
avoided in the choice of the DSA groups. Accordingly, Directed Self-Assembly
(DSA) technologies which use Multiple Patterning (MP) to print the guiding
templates need to be aware of hotspots during the DSA grouping and MP
Decomposition. In this paper, we present a hotspot-aware heuristic for DSA
grouping and MP decomposition. Results show that that the proposed heuristic
eliminates 78% of the hotspots and conflicts that result from using a
hotspot-unaware grouping and decomposition algorithm. In comparison to the
optimal solution using Integer Linear Programming, the proposed heuristic
results in ~24% more violations.

 <dc:description>  The lack of transparency often makes the black-box models difficult to be
applied to many practical domains. For this reason, the current work, from the
black-box model input port, proposes to incorporate data-based prior
information into the black-box soft-margin SVM model to enhance its
transparency. The concept and incorporation mechanism of data-based prior
information are successively developed, based on which the transparent or
partly transparent SVM optimization model is designed and then solved through
handily rewriting the optimization problem as a nonlinear quadratic programming
problem. An algorithm for mining data-based linear prior information from data
set is also proposed, which generates a linear expression with respect to two
appropriate inputs identified from all inputs of system. At last, the proposed
transparency strategy is applied to eight benchmark examples and two real blast
furnace examples for effectiveness exhibition.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an algorithm and the implementation of a motor schema to
aid the visual localization subsystem of the ongoing EMILY project at Texas A
and M University. The EMILY project aims to team an Unmanned Surface Vehicle
(USV) with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to augment the search and rescue of
marine casualties during an emergency response phase. The USV is designed to
serve as a flotation device once it reaches the victims. A live video feed from
the UAV is provided to the casuality responders giving them a visual estimate
of the USVs orientation and position to help with its navigation. One of the
challenges involved with casualty response using a USV UAV team is to
simultaneously control the USV and track it. In this paper, we present an
implemented solution to automate the UAV camera movements to keep the USV in
view at all times. The motor schema proposed, uses the USVs coordinates from
the visual localization subsystem to control the UAVs camera movements and
track the USV with minimal camera movements such that the USV is always in the
cameras field of view.

 <dc:description>  This paper applies a recently developed power allocation game in Li and Morse
(2017) to study the countries' survival problem in networked international
environments. In the game, countries strategically allocate their power to
support the survival of themselves and their friends and to oppose that of
their foes, where by a country's survival is meant when the country's total
support equals or exceeds its total threats. This paper establishes conditions
that characterize different types of networked international environments in
which a country may survive, such as when all the antagonism among countries
makes up a complete or bipartite graph.

 <dc:description>  The widespread application of wireless services and dense devices access have
triggered huge energy consumption. Because of the environmental and financial
considerations, energy-efficient design in wireless networks becomes an
inevitable trend. To the best of the authors' knowledge, energy-efficient
orthogonal frequency division multiple access heterogeneous small cell
optimization comprehensively considering energy efficiency maximization, power
allocation, wireless backhaul bandwidth allocation, and user Quality of Service
is a novel approach and research direction, and it has not been investigated.
In this paper, we study the energy-efficient power allocation and wireless
backhaul bandwidth allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access
heterogeneous small cell networks. Different from the existing resource
allocation schemes that maximize the throughput, the studied scheme maximizes
energy efficiency by allocating both transmit power of each small cell base
station to users and bandwidth for backhauling, according to the channel state
information and the circuit power consumption. The problem is first formulated
as a non-convex nonlinear programming problem and then it is decomposed into
two convex subproblems. A near optimal iterative resource allocation algorithm
is designed to solve the resource allocation problem. A suboptimal
low-complexity approach is also developed by exploring the inherent structure
and property of the energy-efficient design. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms by comparing with the existing
schemes.

 <dc:description>  The most fundamental purpose of blockchain technology is to enable
persistent, consistent, distributed storage of information. Increasingly common
are authentication systems that leverage this property to allow users to carry
their personal data on a device while a hash of this data is signed by a
trusted authority and then put on a blockchain to be compared against. For
instance, in 2015, MIT introduced a schema for the publication of their
academic certificates based on this principle. In this work, we propose a way
for users to obtain assured identities based on face-to-face proofing that can
then be validated against a record on a blockchain. Moreover, in order to
provide anonymity, instead of storing a hash, we make use of a scheme of Brands
to store a commitment against which one can perform zero-knowledge proofs of
identity. We also enforce the confidentiality of the underlying data by letting
users control a secret of their own. We show how our schema can be implemented
on Bitcoin's blockchain and how to save bandwidth by grouping commitments using
Merkle trees to minimize the number of Bitcoin transactions that need to be
sent. Finally, we describe a system in which users can gain access to services
thanks to the identity records of our proposal.

 <dc:description>  We prove that, given a closure function the smallest preimage of a closed set
can be calculated in polynomial time in the number of closed sets. This
confirms a conjecture of Albenque and Knauer and implies that there is a
polynomial time algorithm to compute the convex hull-number of a graph, when
all its convex subgraphs are given as input. We then show that computing if the
smallest preimage of a closed set is logarithmic in the size of the ground set
is LOGSNP-complete if only the ground set is given. A special instance of this
problem is computing the dimension of a poset given its linear extension graph,
that was conjectured to be in P.
  The intent to show that the latter problem is LOGSNP-complete leads to
several interesting questions and to the definition of the isometric hull,
i.e., a smallest isometric subgraph containing a given set of vertices $S$.
While for $|S|=2$ an isometric hull is just a shortest path, we show that
computing the isometric hull of a set of vertices is NP-complete even if
$|S|=3$. Finally, we consider the problem of computing the isometric
hull-number of a graph and show that computing it is $\Sigma^P_2$ complete.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive survey of key trends and
innovations in the development of research-based and commercial micropayment
systems. Based on our study, we argue that past solutions have largely failed
because research has focused heavily on cryptographic and engineering
innovation, whereas fundamental issues pertaining to usability, psychology, and
economics have been neglected. We contextualize the range of existing
challenges for micropayments systems, discuss potential deployment strategies,
and identify critical stumbling blocks, some of which we believe researchers
and developers have yet to fully recognize. We hope this effort will motivate
and guide the development of micropayments systems.

 <dc:description>  The provision of reliable and efficient communication is a key requirement
for the deployment of autonomous cars as well as for future Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITSs) in smart cities. Novel communications
technologies will have to face highly-complex and extremely dynamic network
topologies in a Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X)-context and will require the
consideration of mobility information into decision processes for routing,
handover and resource allocation. Consequently, researches and developers
require simulation tools that are capable of providing realistic
representations for both components as well as means for leveraging the
convergence of mobility and communication. In this paper, we present a
lightweight framework for the simulation of vehicular mobility, which has a
communications-oriented perspective by design and is intended to be used in
combination with a network simulator. In contrast to existing approaches, it
works without requiring Interprocess Communication (IPC) using an integrated
approach and is therefore able to reduce the complexity of simulation setups
dramatically. Since mobility and communication share the same codebase, it is
able to model scenarios with a high level of interdependency between those two
components. In a proof-of-concept study, we evaluate the proposed simulator in
different example scenarios in an Long Term Evolution (LTE)- context using
real-world map data.

 <dc:description>  Since the invention of word2vec, the skip-gram model has significantly
advanced the research of network embedding, such as the recent emergence of the
DeepWalk, LINE, PTE, and node2vec approaches. In this work, we show that all of
the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix
factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that:
(1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a network's
normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk
when the size of vertices' context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE,
PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks' Laplacians;
(4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and
transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide
the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding
algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF
method as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding.
Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE for
conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation
for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better
understanding of latent network representation learning.

 <dc:description>  In this work we discuss the related challenges and describe an approach
towards the fusion of state-of-the-art technologies from the Spoken Dialogue
Systems (SDS) and the Semantic Web and Information Retrieval domains. We
envision a dialogue system named LD-SDS that will support advanced, expressive,
and engaging user requests, over multiple, complex, rich, and open-domain data
sources that will leverage the wealth of the available Linked Data.
Specifically, we focus on: a) improving the identification, disambiguation and
linking of entities occurring in data sources and user input; b) offering
advanced query services for exploiting the semantics of the data, with
reasoning and exploratory capabilities; and c) expanding the typical
information seeking dialogue model (slot filling) to better reflect real-world
conversational search scenarios.

 <dc:title>Linear Prediction based Data Detection of Convolutional Coded DQPSK in

 <dc:description>  Data detection of convolutional coded differential quaternary phase shift
keyed (DQPSK) signals using a predictive Viterbi algorithm (VA) based receiver,
is presented for single input, multiple output - orthogonal frequency division
multiplexed (OFDM) systems. The receiver has both error correcting capability
and also the ability to perform channel estimation (prediction). The predictive
VA operates on a supertrellis with just $S_{\mathrm{ST}}=S_{\mathrm{E}}\times
2^{P-1}$ states instead of $S_{\mathrm{ST}}=S_{\mathrm{E}}\times 2^{P}$ states,
where the complexity reduction is achieved by using the concept of isometry
(here $S_{\mathrm{E}}$ denotes the number of states in the encoder trellis and
$P$ denotes the prediction order). Though the linear prediction based data
detection in turbo coded OFDM and the bit interleaved coded (BIC) OFDM systems
perform better than the proposed approach in terms of bit error rate (BER) for
a given signal to noise ratio (SNR), the decoding delay of the proposed
approach is significantly lower than that of the BIC and the turbo coded OFDM
systems.

 <dc:description>  Manual segmentation of hepatic metastases in ultrasound images acquired from
patients suffering from pancreatic cancer is common practice. Semiautomatic
measurements promising assistance in this process are often assessed using a
small number of lesions performed by examiners who already know the algorithm.
In this work, we present the application of an algorithm for the segmentation
of liver metastases due to pancreatic cancer using a set of 105 different
images of metastases. The algorithm and the two examiners had never assessed
the images before. The examiners first performed a manual segmentation and,
after five weeks, a semiautomatic segmentation using the algorithm. They were
satisfied in up to 90% of the cases with the semiautomatic segmentation
results. Using the algorithm was significantly faster and resulted in a median
Dice similarity score of over 80%. Estimation of the inter-operator variability
by using the intra class correlation coefficient was good with 0.8. In
conclusion, the algorithm facilitates fast and accurate segmentation of liver
metastases, comparable to the current gold standard of manual segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Automatically predicting age group and gender from face images acquired in
unconstrained conditions is an important and challenging task in many
real-world applications. Nevertheless, the conventional methods with
manually-designed features on in-the-wild benchmarks are unsatisfactory because
of incompetency to tackle large variations in unconstrained images. This
difficulty is alleviated to some degree through Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) for its powerful feature representation. In this paper, we propose a new
CNN based method for age group and gender estimation leveraging Residual
Networks of Residual Networks (RoR), which exhibits better optimization ability
for age group and gender classification than other CNN architectures.Moreover,
two modest mechanisms based on observation of the characteristics of age group
are presented to further improve the performance of age estimation.In order to
further improve the performance and alleviate over-fitting problem, RoR model
is pre-trained on ImageNet firstly, and then it is fune-tuned on the
IMDB-WIKI-101 data set for further learning the features of face images,
finally, it is used to fine-tune on Adience data set. Our experiments
illustrate the effectiveness of RoR method for age and gender estimation in the
wild, where it achieves better performance than other CNN methods. Finally, the
RoR-152+IMDB-WIKI-101 with two mechanisms achieves new state-of-the-art results
on Adience benchmark.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we compare the performance of using binaural audio features in
place of single-channel features for sound event detection. Three different
binaural features are studied and evaluated on the publicly available TUT Sound
Events 2017 dataset of length 70 minutes. Sound event detection is performed
separately with single-channel and binaural features using stacked
convolutional and recurrent neural network and the evaluation is reported using
standard metrics of error rate and F-score. The studied binaural features are
seen to consistently perform equal to or better than the single-channel
features with respect to error rate metric.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a neural network architecture and training scheme to
learn the start and end time of sound events (strong labels) in an audio
recording given just the list of sound events existing in the audio without
time information (weak labels). We achieve this by using a stacked
convolutional and recurrent neural network with two prediction layers in
sequence one for the strong followed by the weak label. The network is trained
using frame-wise log mel-band energy as the input audio feature, and weak
labels provided in the dataset as labels for the weak label prediction layer.
Strong labels are generated by replicating the weak labels as many number of
times as the frames in the input audio feature, and used for strong label layer
during training. We propose to control what the network learns from the weak
and strong labels by different weighting for the loss computed in the two
prediction layers. The proposed method is evaluated on a publicly available
dataset of 155 hours with 17 sound event classes. The method achieves the best
error rate of 0.84 for strong labels and F-score of 43.3% for weak labels on
the unseen test split.

 <dc:description>  For digitization of paper files via OCR, preservation of document contexts of
single scanned images is a major requirement. Page stream segmentation (PSS) is
the task to automatically separate a stream of scanned images into multi-page
documents. This can be immensely helpful in the context of &quot;digital mailrooms&quot;
or retro-digitization of large paper archives. In a digitization project
together with a German federal archive, we developed a novel PSS approach based
on convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our approach combines image and text
features to achieve optimal document separation results. Evaluation shows that
our approach achieves accuracies up to 93 % which can be regarded as a new
state-of-the-art for this task.

 <dc:description>  Almost all existing visual saliency models focus on predicting a universal
saliency map across all observers. Yet psychology studies suggest that visual
attention of different observers can vary a lot under some specific
circumstances, especially when they view scenes with multiple salient objects.
However, few work explores this visual attention difference probably because of
lacking a proper dataset, as well as complex correlation between visual
attention, personal preferences, and image contents.
  In this paper, we set out to study this heterogenous visual attention pattern
between different observers and build the first dataset for personalized
saliency detection. Further, we propose to decompose a personalized saliency
map (referred to as PSM) into a universal saliency map (referred to as USM)
which can be predicted by any existing saliency detection models and a
discrepancy between them. Then personalized saliency detection is casted as the
task of discrepancy estimation between PSM and USM. To tackle this task we
propose two solutions: i) The discrepancy estimation for different observers
are casted as different but related tasks. Then we feed the image and its USM
into a multi-task convolutional neural network framework to estimate the
discrepancy between PSM and USM for each observer; ii) As the discrepancy is
related to both image contents and the observers' person-specific information,
we feed the image and its associated USM into a convolutional neural network
with person-specific information encoded filters to estimate the discrepancy.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for
PSM prediction as well their generalization capability for unseen observers.

 <dc:description>  Clustering samples according to an effective metric and/or vector space
representation is a challenging unsupervised learning task with a wide spectrum
of applications. Among several clustering algorithms, k-means and its
kernelized version have still a wide audience because of their conceptual
simplicity and efficacy. However, the systematic application of the kernelized
version of k-means is hampered by its inherent square scaling in memory with
the number of samples. In this contribution, we devise an approximate strategy
to minimize the kernel k-means cost function in which the trade-off between
accuracy and velocity is automatically ruled by the available system memory.
Moreover, we define an ad-hoc parallelization scheme well suited for hybrid
cpu-gpu state-of-the-art parallel architectures. We proved the effectiveness
both of the approximation scheme and of the parallelization method on standard
UCI datasets and on molecular dynamics (MD) data in the realm of computational
chemistry. In this applicative domain, clustering can play a key role for both
quantitively estimating kinetics rates via Markov State Models or to give
qualitatively a human compatible summarization of the underlying chemical
phenomenon under study. For these reasons, we selected it as a valuable
real-world application scenario.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This research in progress paper describes the role of cyber security measures
undertaken in an ICT system for integrating electric storage technologies into
the grid. To do so, it defines security requirements for a communications
gateway and gives detailed information and hands-on configuration advice on
node and communication line security, data storage, coping with backend M2M
communications protocols and examines privacy issues. The presented research
paves the road for developing secure smart energy communications devices that
allow enhancing energy efficiency. The described measures are implemented in an
actual gateway device within the HORIZON 2020 project STORY, which aims at
developing new ways to use storage and demonstrating these on six different
demonstration sites.

 <dc:description>  Stone-type duality theorems, which relate algebraic and
relational/topological models, are important tools in logic because they
strengthen soundness and completeness to a categorical equivalence, yielding a
framework through which both algebraic and topological methods can be brought
to bear on a logic. We give a systematic treatment of Stone-type duality for
the structures that interpret bunched logics, starting with the weakest
systems, recovering the familiar BI and Boolean BI, and extending to both
classical and intuitionistic Separation Logic. We demonstrate the uniformity of
this analysis by additionally capturing the bunched logics obtained by
extending BI and BBI with multiplicative connectives corresponding to
disjunction, negation and falsum: De Morgan BI, Classical BI, and the
sub-classical family of logics extending Bi-intuitionistic (B)BI. We
additionally recover soundness and completeness theorems for the specific
truth-functional models of these logics as presented in the literature, with
new results given for DMBI, the sub-classical logics extending BiBI and a new
bunched logic, CKBI, inspired by the interpretation of Concurrent Separation
Logic in concurrent Kleene algebra. This approach synthesises a variety of
techniques from modal, substructural and categorical logic and contextualizes
the `resource semantics' interpretation underpinning Separation Logic amongst
them. As a consequence, theory from those fields - as well as algebraic and
topological methods - can be applied to both Separation Logic and the systems
of bunched logics it is built upon. Conversely, the notion of indexed frame
(generalizing the standard memory model of Separation Logic) and its associated
completeness proof can easily be adapted to other non-classical predicate
logics.

 <dc:description>  Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a significant marker of atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular events. In this work we present a system for the automatic
quantification of calcium score in ECG-triggered non-contrast enhanced cardiac
computed tomography (CT) images. The proposed system uses a supervised deep
learning algorithm, i.e. convolutional neural network (CNN) for the
segmentation and classification of candidate lesions as coronary or not,
previously extracted in the region of the heart using a cardiac atlas. We
trained our network with 45 CT volumes; 18 volumes were used to validate the
model and 56 to test it. Individual lesions were detected with a sensitivity of
91.24%, a specificity of 95.37% and a positive predicted value (PPV) of 90.5%;
comparing calcium score obtained by the system and calcium score manually
evaluated by an expert operator, a Pearson coefficient of 0.983 was obtained. A
high agreement (Cohen's k = 0.879) between manual and automatic risk prediction
was also observed. These results demonstrated that convolutional neural
networks can be effectively applied for the automatic segmentation and
classification of coronary calcifications.

 <dc:description>  Thinning is the removal of contour pixels/points of connected components in
an image to produce their skeleton with retained connectivity and structural
properties. The output requirements of a thinning procedure often vary with
application. This paper proposes a sequential algorithm that is very easy to
understand and modify based on application to perform the thinning of
multi-dimensional binary patterns. The algorithm was tested on 2D and 3D
patterns and showed very good results. Moreover, comparisons were also made
with two of the state-of-the-art methods used for 2D patterns. The results
obtained prove the validity of the procedure.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory optimization and posture generation are hard problems in robot
locomotion, which can be non-convex and have multiple local optima. Progress on
these problems is further hindered by a lack of open benchmarks, since
comparisons of different solutions are difficult to make. In this paper we
introduce a new benchmark for trajectory optimization and posture generation of
legged robots, using a pre-defined scenario, robot and constraints, as well as
evaluation criteria. We evaluate state-of-the-art trajectory optimization
algorithms based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP) on the benchmark, as
well as new stochastic and incremental optimization methods borrowed from the
large-scale machine learning literature. Interestingly we show that some of
these stochastic and incremental methods, which are based on stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), achieve higher success rates than SQP on tough
initializations. Inspired by this observation we also propose a new incremental
variant of SQP which updates only a random subset of the costs and constraints
at each iteration. The algorithm is the best performing in both success rate
and convergence speed, improving over SQP by up to 30% in both criteria. The
benchmark's resources and a solution evaluation script are made openly
available.

 <dc:description>  Many real-world networks are complex dynamical systems, where both local
(e.g., changing node attributes) and global (e.g., changing network topology)
processes unfold over time. Local dynamics may provoke global changes in the
network, and the ability to detect such effects could have profound
implications for a number of real-world problems. Most existing techniques
focus individually on either local or global aspects of the problem or treat
the two in isolation from each other. In this paper we propose a novel network
model that simultaneously accounts for both local and global dynamics. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at modeling and detecting
local and global change points on dynamic networks via a unified generative
framework. Our model is built upon the popular mixed membership stochastic
blockmodels (MMSB) with sparse co-evolving patterns. We derive an efficient
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) sampler for our proposed model,
which allows it to scale to potentially very large networks. Finally, we
validate our model on both synthetic and real-world data and demonstrate its
superiority over several baselines.

 <dc:description>  Data science and machine learning algorithms running on big data
infrastructure are increasingly important in activities ranging from business
intelligence and analytics to cybersecurity, smart city management, and many
fields of science and engineering. As these algorithms are further integrated
into daily operations, understanding how long they take to run on a big data
infrastructure is paramount to controlling costs and delivery times. In this
paper we discuss the issues involved in understanding the run time of iterative
machine learning algorithms and provide a case study of such an algorithm -
including a statistical characterization and model of the run time of an
implementation of K-Means for the Spark big data engine using the Edward
probabilistic programming language.

 <dc:description>  Aharoni and Berger conjectured that in any bipartite multigraph that is
properly edge-coloured by $n$ colours with at least $n + 1$ edges of each

show that in any multigraph with edge multiplicities $o(n)$ that is properly
edge-coloured by $n$ colours with at least $n + o(n)$ edges of each colour
there must be a matching of size $n-O(1)$ that uses each colour at most once.

 <dc:description>  Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is recognized today as a most promising
technology for future 5G cellular networks and a large number of papers have
been published on the subject over the past few years. Interestingly, none of
these authors seems to be aware that the foundation of NOMA actually dates back
to the year 2000, when a series of papers introduced and investigated multiple
access schemes using two sets of orthogonal signal waveforms and iterative
interference cancellation at the receiver. The purpose of this paper is to shed
light on that early literature and to describe a practical scheme based on that
concept, which is particularly attractive for Machine-Type Communications (MTC)
in future 5G cellular networks. Using this approach, NOMA appears as a
convenient extension of orthogonal multiple access rather than a strictly
competing technology, and most important of all, the power imbalance between
the transmitted user signals that is required to make the receiver work in
other NOMA schemes is not required here.

 <dc:title>Learning Graph Representations with Embedding Propagation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Garcia-Duran, Alberto</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose Embedding Propagation (EP), an unsupervised learning framework for
graph-structured data. EP learns vector representations of graphs by passing
two types of messages between neighboring nodes. Forward messages consist of
label representations such as representations of words and other attributes
associated with the nodes. Backward messages consist of gradients that result
from aggregating the label representations and applying a reconstruction loss.
Node representations are finally computed from the representation of their
labels. With significantly fewer parameters and hyperparameters an instance of
EP is competitive with and often outperforms state of the art unsupervised and
semi-supervised learning methods on a range of benchmark data sets.

length and classical answers of constant length is NP-hard to approximate to
within constant factors. As a corollary, the inclusion
$\mathrm{NEXP}\subseteq\mathrm{MIP}^*$, first shown in [IV12] with three

analysis of the low-degree test Raz and Safra (STOC'97) against two entangled

 <dc:description>  This paper presents different possibilities of using mobile robots in
education. Through the application of mobile mechatronic robotic system
&quot;Robotino&quot; this paper shows the possibilities of developing interactive
lectures and exercises in order to raise the quality of education and to
provide new competencies for students. Application of robot as a real system
supports strengthening specific areas of knowledge and skills that the students
develop through design, creation, assembly and operating with the robot. This
way of learning contains a very important element and that is &quot;Playful

 <dc:description>  Trained recurrent networks are powerful tools for modeling dynamic neural
computations. We present a target-based method for modifying the full
connectivity matrix of a recurrent network to train it to perform tasks
involving temporally complex input/output transformations. The method
introduces a second network during training to provide suitable &quot;target&quot;
dynamics useful for performing the task. Because it exploits the full recurrent
connectivity, the method produces networks that perform tasks with fewer
neurons and greater noise robustness than traditional least-squares (FORCE)
approaches. In addition, we show how introducing additional input signals into
the target-generating network, which act as task hints, greatly extends the
range of tasks that can be learned and provides control over the complexity and
nature of the dynamics of the trained, task-performing network.

 <dc:description>  The problem of domain generalization is to learn from multiple training
domains, and extract a domain-agnostic model that can then be applied to an
unseen domain. Domain generalization (DG) has a clear motivation in contexts
where there are target domains with distinct characteristics, yet sparse data
for training. For example recognition in sketch images, which are distinctly
more abstract and rarer than photos. Nevertheless, DG methods have primarily
been evaluated on photo-only benchmarks focusing on alleviating the dataset
bias where both problems of domain distinctiveness and data sparsity can be
minimal. We argue that these benchmarks are overly straightforward, and show
that simple deep learning baselines perform surprisingly well on them. In this
paper, we make two main contributions: Firstly, we build upon the favorable
domain shift-robust properties of deep learning methods, and develop a low-rank
parameterized CNN model for end-to-end DG learning. Secondly, we develop a DG
benchmark dataset covering photo, sketch, cartoon and painting domains. This is
both more practically relevant, and harder (bigger domain shift) than existing
benchmarks. The results show that our method outperforms existing DG
alternatives, and our dataset provides a more significant DG challenge to drive
future research.

 <dc:description>  This research proposes Finger Based Technique (FBT) for non-visual touch
screen device interaction designed for blind users. Based on the proposed
technique, the blind user can access virtual keys based on finger holding
positions. Three different models have been proposed. They are Single Digit
Finger-Digit Input (FDI), Double Digit FDI for digital text entry, and
Finger-Text Input (FTI) for normal text entry. All the proposed models were
implemented with voice feedback while enabling touch as the input gesture. The
models were evaluated with 7 blind participants with Samsung Galaxy S2
apparatus. The results show that Single Digit FDI is substantially faster and
more accurate than Double Digit FDI and iPhone voice-over. FTI also looks
promising for text entry. Our study also reveals 11 accessible regions to place
widgets for quick access by blind users in flat touch screen based smartphones.
Identification of these accessible regions will promote dynamic interactions
for blind users and serve as a usability design framework for touch screen
applications.

 <dc:description>  Theoretical computer science discusses foundational issues about
computations. It asks and answers questions such as &quot;What is a computation?&quot;,
&quot;What is computable?&quot;, &quot;What is efficiently computable?&quot;,&quot;What is
information?&quot;, &quot;What is random?&quot;, &quot;What is an algorithm?&quot;, etc. We will present
many of the major themes and theorems with the basic language of category
theory. Surprisingly, many interesting theorems and concepts of theoretical
computer science are easy consequences of functoriality and composition when
you look at the right categories and functors connecting them.

 <dc:description>  We present a variant of the stable flow problem. Instead of the traditional
flow problem that obeys Kirchhoff's law, for each vertex, the outflow is
monotone and piecewise linear to the inflow. In a directed and capacitated
network, each vertex has strict preference over their incident edges. A stable
flow assignment does not allow a group of vertices to benefit from privately
rerouting along a path. In this paper, we first show the existence of flow
stability by reducing this variant of stable flow problem to Scarf's Lemma,
then introduce a path augmenting algorithm that runs in polynomial time to find
such a stable flow.

 <dc:description>  We report characteristics of in-text citations in over five million full text
articles from two large databases - the PubMed Central Open Access subset and
Elsevier journals - as functions of time, textual progression, and scientific
field. The purpose of this study is to understand the characteristics of
in-text citations in a detailed way prior to pursuing other studies focused on
answering more substantive research questions. As such, we have analyzed
in-text citations in several ways and report many findings here. Perhaps most
significantly, we find that there are large field-level differences that are
reflected in position within the text, citation interval (or reference age),
and citation counts of references. In general, the fields of Biomedical and
Health Sciences, Life and Earth Sciences, and Physical Sciences and Engineering
have similar reference distributions, although they vary in their specifics.
The two remaining fields, Mathematics and Computer Science and Social Science
and Humanities, have different reference distributions from the other three
fields and between themselves. We also show that in all fields the numbers of
sentences, references, and in-text mentions per article have increased over
time, and that there are field-level and temporal differences in the numbers of
in-text mentions per reference. A final finding is that references mentioned
only once tend to be much more highly cited than those mentioned multiple
times.

 <dc:description>  Enabling the integration of aerial mobile users into existing cellular
networks would make possible a number of promising applications. However,
current cellular networks have not been designed to serve aerial users, and
hence an exploration of design parameters is required in order to allow network
providers to modify their current infrastructure. As a first step in this
direction, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the coverage probability
of the downlink of a cellular network that serves both aerial and ground users.
We present an exact mathematical characterization of the coverage probability,
which includes the effect of base stations (BSs) height, antenna pattern and
drone altitude for various type of urban environments. Interestingly, our
results show that the favorable propagation conditions that aerial users enjoys
due to its altitude is also their strongest limiting factor, as it leaves them
vulnerable to interference. This negative effect can be substantially reduced
by optimizing the flying altitude, the base station height and antenna
down-tilt. Moreover, lowering the base station height and increasing down-tilt
angle are in general beneficial for both terrestrial and aerial users, pointing
out a possible path to enable their coexistence.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of formal verification of Binarized Neural Networks
(BNN), which have recently been proposed as a energy-efficient alternative to
traditional learning networks. The verification of BNNs, using the reduction to
hardware verification, can be even more scalable by factoring computations
among neurons within the same layer. By proving the NP-hardness of finding
optimal factoring as well as the hardness of PTAS approximability, we design
polynomial-time search heuristics to generate factoring solutions. The overall
framework allows applying verification techniques to moderately-sized BNNs for
embedded devices with thousands of neurons and inputs.

 <dc:title>Skew and linearized Reed-Solomon codes and maximum sum rank distance

 <dc:description>  Reed-Solomon codes and Gabidulin codes have maximum Hamming distance and
maximum rank distance, respectively. A general construction using skew
polynomials, called skew Reed-Solomon codes, has already been introduced in the
literature. In this work, we introduce a linearized version of such codes,
called linearized Reed-Solomon codes. We prove that they have maximum sum-rank
distance. Such distance is of interest in multishot network coding or in
singleshot multi-network coding. To prove our result, we introduce new metrics
defined by skew polynomials, which we call skew metrics, we prove that skew
Reed-Solomon codes have maximum skew distance, and then we translate this
scenario to linearized Reed-Solomon codes and the sum-rank metric. The theories
of Reed-Solomon codes and Gabidulin codes are particular cases of our theory,
and the sum-rank metric extends both the Hamming and rank metrics. We develop
our theory over any division ring (commutative or non-commutative field). We
also consider non-zero derivations, which give new maximum rank distance codes
over infinite fields not considered before.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural network (RNN) and connectionist temporal classification
(CTC) have showed successes in many sequence labeling tasks with the strong
ability of dealing with the problems where the alignment between the inputs and
the target labels is unknown. Residual network is a new structure of
convolutional neural network and works well in various computer vision tasks.
In this paper, we take advantage of the architectures mentioned above to create
a new network for handwritten digit string recognition. First we design a
residual network to extract features from input images, then we employ a RNN to
model the contextual information within feature sequences and predict
recognition results. At the top of this network, a standard CTC is applied to
calculate the loss and yield the final results. These three parts compose an
end-to-end trainable network. The proposed new architecture achieves the
highest performances on ORAND-CAR-A and ORAND-CAR-B with recognition rates
89.75% and 91.14%, respectively. In addition, the experiments on a generated
captcha dataset which has much longer string length show the potential of the
proposed network to handle long strings.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of high-dimensional data in various areas has brought new
challenges to the ensemble clustering research. To deal with the curse of
dimensionality, considerable efforts in ensemble clustering have been made by
incorporating various subspace-based techniques. Besides the emphasis on
subspaces, rather limited attention has been paid to the potential diversity in
similarity/dissimilarity metrics. It remains a surprisingly open problem in
ensemble clustering how to create and aggregate a large number of diversified
metrics, and furthermore, how to jointly exploit the multi-level diversity in
the large number of metrics, subspaces, and clusters, in a unified framework.
To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel multi-diversified ensemble
clustering approach. In particular, we create a large number of diversified
metrics by randomizing a scaled exponential similarity kernel, which are then
coupled with random subspaces to form a large set of metric-subspace pairs.
Based on the similarity matrices derived from these metric-subspace pairs, an
ensemble of diversified base clusterings can thereby be constructed. Further,
an entropy-based criterion is adopted to explore the cluster-wise diversity in
ensembles, based on which the consensus function is therefore presented.
Experimental results on twenty high-dimensional datasets have confirmed the
superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Recently, J. D. Lawson encouraged the domain theory community to consider the
scientific program of developing domain theory in the wider context of $T_0$
spaces instead of restricting to posets. In this paper, we respond to this
calling with an attempt to formulate a topological version of the Scott
Convergence Theorem, i.e., order-theoretic characterisation of those posets for
which the Scott-convergence, $\mathcal{S}$, is topological. To do this, we make
use of the so-called Zhao-Ho's replacement principle to create topological
analogues of well-known domain-theoretic concepts, e.g.,
$\operatorname{Irr}$-continuous space is to continuous poset, as
$\mathcal{I}$-convergence is to $\mathcal{S}$-convergence. In this paper, we
want to highlight the difficulties involved in our attempt because of the much
more general ambient environment (of $T_0$ spaces) we are working in. To tackle
each of these difficulties, we introduce a new type of $T_0$ spaces to overcome
it. In this paper, we consider two novel topological concepts, namely, the
balanced spaces and the nice spaces, and as a result we obtain some necessary
(respectively, sufficient) condition for which the new convergence structure,
$\mathcal{I}$, is topological.

 <dc:description>  For real numbers c,epsilon&gt;0, let G_{c,epsilon} denote the class of graphs G
such that each subgraph H of G has a balanced separator of order at most
c|V(H)|^{1-epsilon}. A class of graphs has strongly sublinear separators if it
is a subclass of G_{c,epsilon} for some c,epsilon&gt;0. We investigate properties
of such graph classes, leading in particular to an approximate algorithm to
determine membership in G_{c,epsilon}: there exist c'&gt;0 such that for each
input graph G, this algorithm in polynomial time determines either that G
belongs to G_{c',epsilon^2/160}, or that G does not belong to G_{c,epsilon}.

 <dc:description>  In 2007, the software and systems traceability community met at the first
Natural Bridge symposium on the Grand Challenges of Traceability to establish
and address research goals for achieving effective, trustworthy, and ubiquitous
traceability. Ten years later, in 2017, the community came together to evaluate
a decade of progress towards achieving these goals. These proceedings document
some of that progress. They include a series of short position papers,
representing current work in the community organized across four process axes
of traceability practice. The sessions covered topics from Trace Strategizing,
Trace Link Creation and Evolution, Trace Link Usage, real-world applications of
Traceability, and Traceability Datasets and benchmarks. Two breakout groups
focused on the importance of creating and sharing traceability datasets within
the research community, and discussed challenges related to the adoption of
tracing techniques in industrial practice. Members of the research community
are engaged in many active, ongoing, and impactful research projects. Our hope
is that ten years from now we will be able to look back at a productive decade
of research and claim that we have achieved the overarching Grand Challenge of
Traceability, which seeks for traceability to be always present, built into the
engineering process, and for it to have &quot;effectively disappeared without a
trace&quot;. We hope that others will see the potential that traceability has for
empowering software and systems engineers to develop higher-quality products at
increasing levels of complexity and scale, and that they will join the active
community of Software and Systems traceability researchers as we move forward
into the next decade of research.

 <dc:description>  Macro-management is an important problem in StarCraft, which has been studied
for a long time. Various datasets together with assorted methods have been
proposed in the last few years. But these datasets have some defects for
boosting the academic and industrial research: 1) There're neither standard
preprocessing, parsing and feature extraction procedures nor predefined
training, validation and test set in some datasets. 2) Some datasets are only
specified for certain tasks in macro-management. 3) Some datasets are either
too small or don't have enough labeled data for modern machine learning
algorithms such as deep neural networks. So most previous methods are trained
with various features, evaluated on different test sets from the same or
different datasets, making it difficult to be compared directly. To boost the
research of macro-management in StarCraft, we release a new dataset MSC based
on the platform SC2LE. MSC consists of well-designed feature vectors,
pre-defined high-level actions and final result of each match. We also split
MSC into training, validation and test set for the convenience of evaluation
and comparison. Besides the dataset, we propose a baseline model and present
initial baseline results for global state evaluation and build order
prediction, which are two of the key tasks in macro-management. Various
downstream tasks and analyses of the dataset are also described for the sake of
research on macro-management in StarCraft II. Homepage:

 <dc:description>  Online programming discussion platforms such as Stack Overflow serve as a
rich source of information for software developers. Available information
include vibrant discussions and oftentimes ready-to-use code snippets.
Anecdotes report that software developers copy and paste code snippets from
those information sources for convenience reasons. Such behavior results in a
constant flow of community-provided code snippets into production software. To
date, the impact of this behaviour on code security is unknown. We answer this
highly important question by quantifying the proliferation of security-related
code snippets from Stack Overflow in Android applications available on Google
Play. Access to the rich source of information available on Stack Overflow
including ready-to-use code snippets provides huge benefits for software
developers. However, when it comes to code security there are some caveats to
bear in mind: Due to the complex nature of code security, it is very difficult
to provide ready-to-use and secure solutions for every problem. Hence,
integrating a security-related code snippet from Stack Overflow into production
software requires caution and expertise. Unsurprisingly, we observed insecure
code snippets being copied into Android applications millions of users install
from Google Play every day. To quantitatively evaluate the extent of this
observation, we scanned Stack Overflow for code snippets and evaluated their
security score using a stochastic gradient descent classifier. In order to
identify code reuse in Android applications, we applied state-of-the-art static
analysis. Our results are alarming: 15.4% of the 1.3 million Android
applications we analyzed, contained security-related code snippets from Stack
Overflow. Out of these 97.9% contain at least one insecure code snippet.

 <dc:description>  Over the past few years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown
promise on facial expression recognition. However, the performance degrades
dramatically under real-world settings due to variations introduced by subtle
facial appearance changes, head pose variations, illumination changes, and
occlusions.
  In this paper, a novel island loss is proposed to enhance the discriminative
power of the deeply learned features. Specifically, the IL is designed to
reduce the intra-class variations while enlarging the inter-class differences
simultaneously. Experimental results on four benchmark expression databases
have demonstrated that the CNN with the proposed island loss (IL-CNN)
outperforms the baseline CNN models with either traditional softmax loss or the
center loss and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the
state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition.

 <dc:description>  General-valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) are generalisations
of CSPs dealing with homomorphisms between two valued structures. We study the
complexity of structural restrictions for VCSPs, that is, restrictions defined
by classes of admissible left-hand side valued structures. As our main result,
we show that for VCSPs of bounded arity the only tractable structural
restrictions are those of bounded treewidth modulo valued equivalence, thus
identifying the precise borderline of tractability. Our result generalises a
result of Dalmau, Kolaitis, and Vardi [CP'02] and Grohe [JACM'07] showing that
for CSPs of bounded arity the tractable restrictions are precisely those with
bounded treewidth modulo homomorphic equivalence.
  All the tractable restrictions we identify are solved by the well-known
Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy. We take a closer look into this hierarchy and study
the power of Sherali-Adams for solving VCSPs. Our second result is a precise
characterisation of the left-hand side valued structures solved to optimality
by the $k$-th level of the Sherali-Adams LP hierarchy.

 <dc:description>  The increasing popularity of jumbo frames means growing variance in the size
of packets transmitted in modern networks. Consequently, network monitoring
tools must maintain explicit traffic volume statistics rather than settle for
packet counting as before. We present constant time algorithms for volume
estimations in streams and sliding windows, which are faster than previous
work. Our solutions are formally analyzed and are extensively evaluated over
multiple real-world packet traces as well as synthetic ones. For streams, we
demonstrate a run-time improvement of up to 2.4X compared to the state of the
art. On sliding windows, we exhibit a memory reduction of over 100X on all
traces and an asymptotic runtime improvement to a constant. Finally, we apply
our approach to hierarchical heavy hitters and achieve an empirical 2.4-7X
speedup.

 <dc:description>  Mechanistic models in biology often involve numerous parameters about which
we do not have direct experimental information. The traditional approach is to
fit these parameters using extensive numerical simulations (e.g. by the
Monte-Carlo method), and eventually revising the model if the predictions do
not correspond to the actual measurements. In this work we propose a
methodology for hybrid automaton model revision, when new type of functions are
needed to capture time varying parameters. To this end, we formulate a hybrid
optimal control problem with intermediate points as successive
infinite-dimensional linear programs (LP) on occupation measures. Then, these
infinite-dimensional LPs are solved using a hierarchy of semidefinite
relaxations. The whole procedure is exposed on a recent model for haemoglobin
production in erythrocytes.

 <dc:description>  Random Projection is a foundational research topic that connects a bunch of
machine learning algorithms under a similar mathematical basis. It is used to
reduce the dimensionality of the dataset by projecting the data points
efficiently to a smaller dimensions while preserving the original relative
distance between the data points. In this paper, we are intended to explain
random projection method, by explaining its mathematical background and
foundation, the applications that are currently adopting it, and an overview on
its current research perspective.

 <dc:title>Optimal Vertex Fault Tolerant Spanners (for fixed stretch)</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A $k$-spanner of a graph $G$ is a sparse subgraph $H$ whose shortest path
distances match those of $G$ up to a multiplicative error $k$. In this paper we
study spanners that are resistant to faults. A subgraph $H \subseteq G$ is an
$f$ vertex fault tolerant (VFT) $k$-spanner if $H \setminus F$ is a $k$-spanner
of $G \setminus F$ for any small set $F$ of $f$ vertices that might &quot;fail.&quot; One
of the main questions in the area is: what is the minimum size of an $f$ fault
tolerant $k$-spanner that holds for all $n$ node graphs (as a function of $f$,
$k$ and $n$)? This question was first studied in the context of geometric
graphs [Levcopoulos et al. STOC '98, Czumaj and Zhao SoCG '03] and has more
recently been considered in general undirected graphs [Chechik et al. STOC '09,
Dinitz and Krauthgamer PODC '11].
  In this paper, we settle the question of the optimal size of a VFT spanner,
in the setting where the stretch factor $k$ is fixed. Specifically, we prove
that every (undirected, possibly weighted) $n$-node graph $G$ has a
$(2k-1)$-spanner resilient to $f$ vertex faults with $O_k(f^{1 - 1/k} n^{1 +
1/k})$ edges, and this is fully optimal (unless the famous Erdos Girth
Conjecture is false). Our lower bound even generalizes to imply that no data
structure capable of approximating $dist_{G \setminus F}(s, t)$ similarly can
beat the space usage of our spanner in the worst case. We also consider the
edge fault tolerant (EFT) model, defined analogously with edge failures rather
than vertex failures. We show that the same spanner upper bound applies in this
setting. Our data structure lower bound extends to the case $k=2$ (and hence we
close the EFT problem for $3$-approximations), but it falls to $\Omega(f^{1/2 -
1/(2k)} \cdot n^{1 + 1/k})$ for $k \ge 3$. We leave it as an open problem to
close this gap.

 <dc:description>  Integrated Model of Distributed Systems is used for specification and
verification of distributed systems. In the formalism, a system is modeled as a
set of servers' states and agents' messages. The operation of a system is
modeled as actions converting global system configuration (a set of states and
messages) to a new configuration. The formalism is used in Dedan verification
environment, in which specification and verification of distributed systems is
performed. Equivalent Petri nets are used for structural analysis. For the
graphical specification and simulation of distributed systems, Distributed
Autonomous and Asynchronous Automata (DA3) are invented. Such simulation does
not require calculation of global configuration space of a system. Two forms of
DA3 are shown: Server-DA3 (SDA3) for the server view and Agent-DA3 (ADA3) for
the agent view.

 <dc:description>  Broadcast is one of the fundamental network communication primitives. One
node of a network, called the $\mathit{source}$, has a message that has to be
learned by all other nodes. We consider the feasibility of deterministic
broadcast in radio networks. If nodes of the network do not have any labels,
deterministic broadcast is impossible even in the four-cycle. On the other
hand, if all nodes have distinct labels, then broadcast can be carried out,
e.g., in a round-robin fashion, and hence $O(\log n)$-bit labels are sufficient
for this task in $n$-node networks. In fact, $O(\log \Delta)$-bit labels, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum degree, are enough to broadcast successfully. Hence, it
is natural to ask if very short labels are sufficient for broadcast. Our main
result is a positive answer to this question. We show that every radio network
can be labeled using 2 bits in such a way that broadcast can be accomplished by
some universal deterministic algorithm that does not know the network topology
nor any bound on its size. Moreover, at the expense of an extra bit in the
labels, we get the additional strong property that there exists a common round
in which all nodes know that broadcast has been completed.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning algorithms for prediction are increasingly being used in
critical decisions affecting human lives. Various fairness formalizations, with
no firm consensus yet, are employed to prevent such algorithms from
systematically discriminating against people based on certain attributes
protected by law. The aim of this article is to survey how fairness is
formalized in the machine learning literature for the task of prediction and
present these formalizations with their corresponding notions of distributive
justice from the social sciences literature. We provide theoretical as well as
empirical critiques of these notions from the social sciences literature and
explain how these critiques limit the suitability of the corresponding fairness
formalizations to certain domains. We also suggest two notions of distributive
justice which address some of these critiques and discuss avenues for
prospective fairness formalizations.

 <dc:title>Optimization of Privacy-Utility Trade-offs under Informational
  Self-determination</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The pervasiveness of Internet of Things results in vast volumes of personal
data generated by smart devices of users (data producers) such as smart phones,
wearables and other embedded sensors. It is a common requirement, especially
for Big Data analytics systems, to transfer these large in scale and
distributed data to centralized computational systems for analysis.
Nevertheless, third parties that run and manage these systems (data consumers)
do not always guarantee users' privacy. Their primary interest is to improve
utility that is usually a metric related to the performance, costs and the
quality of service. There are several techniques that mask user-generated data
to ensure privacy, e.g. differential privacy. Setting up a process for masking
data, referred to in this paper as a `privacy setting', decreases on the one
hand the utility of data analytics, while, on the other hand, increases
privacy. This paper studies parameterizations of privacy-settings that regulate
the trade-off between maximum utility, minimum privacy and minimum utility,
maximum privacy, where utility refers to the accuracy in the approximations of
aggregation functions. Privacy settings can be universally applied as
system-wide parameterizations and policies (homogeneous data sharing).
Nonetheless they can also be applied autonomously by each user or decided under
the influence of (monetary) incentives (heterogeneous data sharing). This
latter diversity in data sharing by informational self-determination plays a
key role on the privacy-utility trajectories as shown in this paper both
theoretically and empirically. A generic and novel computational framework is
introduced for measuring privacy-utility trade-offs and their optimization. The
framework computes a broad spectrum of such trade-offs that form
privacy-utility trajectories under homogeneous and heterogeneous data sharing.

 <dc:description>  A smart grid can be considered as a complex network where each node
represents a generation unit or a consumer. Whereas links can be used to
represent transmission lines. One way to study complex systems is by using the
agent-based modeling (ABM) paradigm. An ABM is a way of representing a complex
system of autonomous agents interacting with each other. Previously, a number
of studies have been presented in the smart grid domain making use of the ABM
paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of these studies have
focused on the specification aspect of ABM. An ABM specification is important
not only for understanding but also for replication of the model. In this
study, we focus on development as well as specification of ABM for smart grid.
We propose an ABM by using a combination of agent-based and complex
network-based approaches. For ABM specification, we use ODD and DREAM
specification approaches. We analyze these two specification approaches
qualitatively as well as quantitatively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DREAM is a most useful approach as compared with ODD for modeling as well as
for replication of models for smart grid.

 <dc:description>  We evaluate the causal effect of hour-ahead price interventions on the
reduction of residential electricity consumption, using a large-scale
experiment on 7,000 households in California. In addition to this experimental
approach, we also develop a non-experimental framework that allows for an
estimation of the desired treatment effect on an individual level by estimating
user-level counterfactuals using time-series prediction. This approach
crucially eliminates the need for a randomized experiment. Both approaches
estimate a reduction of ~0.10 kWh (11%) per Demand Response event and
household. Using different incentive levels, we find a weak price elasticity of
reduction. We also evaluate the effect of an adaptive targeting scheme, which
discriminates users based on their estimated responses in order to increase the
per-dollar reduction ratio by 30%. Lastly, we find that households with smart
home automation devices reduce significantly more than households without,
namely 0.28 kWh (37%).

 <dc:title>Python Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (PyNUFFT): multi-dimensional

 <dc:description>  This paper reports the development of a Python Non-Uniform Fast Fourier
Transform (PyNUFFT) package, which accelerates non-Cartesian image
reconstruction on heterogeneous platforms. Scientific computing with Python
encompasses a mature and integrated environment. The NUFFT algorithm has been
extensively used for non-Cartesian image reconstruction but previously there
was no native Python NUFFT library. The current PyNUFFT software enables
multi-dimensional NUFFT on heterogeneous platforms. The PyNUFFT also provides
several solvers, including the conjugate gradient method, $\ell$1
total-variation regularized ordinary least square (L1TV-OLS) and $\ell$1
total-variation regularized least absolute deviation (L1TV-LAD).
Metaprogramming libraries were employed to accelerate PyNUFFT. The PyNUFFT
package has been tested on multi-core CPU and GPU, with acceleration factors of
6.3 - 9.5$\times$ on a 32 thread CPU platform and 5.4 - 13$\times$ on the GPU.

 <dc:title>Deep Learning Paradigm with Transformed Monolingual Word Embeddings for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The surge of social media use brings huge demand of multilingual sentiment
analysis (MSA) for unveiling cultural difference. So far, traditional methods
resorted to machine translation---translating texts in other languages to
English, and then adopt the methods once worked in English. However, this
paradigm is conditioned by the quality of machine translation. In this paper,
we propose a new deep learning paradigm to assimilate the differences between
languages for MSA. We first pre-train monolingual word embeddings separately,
then map word embeddings in different spaces into a shared embedding space, and
then finally train a parameter-sharing deep neural network for MSA. The
experimental results show that our paradigm is effective. Especially, our CNN
model outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline by around 2.1% in terms of
classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Music recommender systems (MRS) have experienced a boom in recent years,
thanks to the emergence and success of online streaming services, which
nowadays make available almost all music in the world at the user's fingertip.
While today's MRS considerably help users to find interesting music in these
huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges. In
particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation
strategies that integrate information beyond simple user--item interactions or
content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener
needs, preferences, and intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and
related publications quite sparse.
  The purpose of this trends and survey article is twofold. We first identify
and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research
is facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of
the art towards solving these challenges and discuss its limitations. Second,
we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further
evolution of the field. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving
the interested reader an overview of current challenges in MRS research and
providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet
under-researched, directions in the field.

 <dc:description>  We construct a joint coordination-channel polar coding scheme for strong
coordination of actions between two agents $\mathsf X$ and $\mathsf Y$, which
communicate over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) such that the joint
distribution of actions follows a prescribed probability distribution. We show
that polar codes are able to achieve our previously established inner bound to
the strong noisy coordination capacity region and thus provide a constructive
alternative to a random coding proof. Our polar coding scheme also offers a
constructive solution to a channel simulation problem where a DMC and shared
randomness are together employed to simulate another DMC. In particular, our
proposed solution is able to utilize the randomness of the DMC to reduce the
amount of local randomness required to generate the sequence of actions at
agent $\mathsf Y$. By leveraging our earlier random coding results for this
problem, we conclude that the proposed joint coordination-channel coding scheme
strictly outperforms a separate scheme in terms of achievable communication
rate for the same amount of injected randomness into both systems.

 <dc:title>Discovering the roots: Uniform closure results for algebraic classes

 <dc:description>  Newton iteration (NI) is an almost 350 years old recursive formula that
approximates a simple root of a polynomial quite rapidly. We generalize it to a
matrix recurrence (allRootsNI) that approximates all the roots simultaneously.
In this form, the process yields a better circuit complexity in the case when
the number of roots $r$ is small but the multiplicities are exponentially
large. Our method sets up a linear system in $r$ unknowns and iteratively
builds the roots as formal power series. For an algebraic circuit
$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ of size $s$ we prove that each factor has size at most a
polynomial in: $s$ and the degree of the squarefree part of $f$. Consequently,
if $f_1$ is a $2^{\Omega(n)}$-hard polynomial then any nonzero multiple
$\prod_{i} f_i^{e_i}$ is equally hard for arbitrary positive $e_i$'s, assuming
that $\sum_i \text{deg}(f_i)$ is at most $2^{O(n)}$.
  It is an old open question whether the class of poly($n$)-sized formulas
(resp. algebraic branching programs) is closed under factoring. We show that
given a polynomial $f$ of degree $n^{O(1)}$ and formula (resp. ABP) size
$n^{O(\log n)}$ we can find a similar size formula (resp. ABP) factor in
randomized poly($n^{\log n}$)-time. Consequently, if determinant requires
$n^{\Omega(\log n)}$ size formula, then the same can be said about any of its
nonzero multiples.
  As part of our proofs, we identify a new property of multivariate polynomial
factorization. We show that under a random linear transformation $\tau$,
$f(\tau\overline{x})$ completely factors via power series roots. Moreover, the
factorization adapts well to circuit complexity analysis. This with allRootsNI
are the techniques that help us make progress towards the old open problems,
supplementing the large body of classical results and concepts in algebraic
circuit factorization (eg. Zassenhaus, J.NT 1969, Kaltofen, STOC 1985-7 \&amp;
Burgisser, FOCS 2001).

 <dc:description>  We introduce and develop a new semi-algebraic proof system, called Stabbing
Planes that is in the style of DPLL-based modern SAT solvers. As with DPLL,
there is only one rule: the current polytope can be subdivided by branching on
an inequality and its &quot;integer negation.&quot; That is, we can (nondeterministically
choose) a hyperplane a x \geq b with integer coefficients, which partitions the
polytope into three pieces: the points in the polytope satisfying a x \geq b,
the points satisfying a x \leq b-1, and the middle slab b-1 &lt; a x &lt; b. Since
the middle slab contains no integer points it can be safely discarded, and the
algorithm proceeds recursively on the other two branches. Each path terminates
when the current polytope is empty, which is polynomial-time checkable. Among
our results, we show somewhat surprisingly that Stabbing Planes can efficiently
simulate Cutting Planes, and moreover, is strictly stronger than Cutting Planes
under a reasonable conjecture. We prove linear lower bounds on the rank of
Stabbing Planes refutations, by adapting a lifting argument in communication
complexity.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of Big Data, nowadays in many applications databases
containing large quantities of similar time series are available. Forecasting
time series in these domains with traditional univariate forecasting procedures
leaves great potentials for producing accurate forecasts untapped. Recurrent
neural networks, and in particular Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have
proven recently that they are able to outperform state-of-the-art univariate
time series forecasting methods in this context, when trained across all
available time series. However, if the time series database is heterogeneous
accuracy may degenerate, so that on the way towards fully automatic forecasting
methods in this space, a notion of similarity between the time series needs to
be built into the methods. To this end, we present a prediction model using
LSTMs on subgroups of similar time series, which are identified by time series
clustering techniques. The proposed methodology is able to consistently
outperform the baseline LSTM model, and it achieves competitive results on
benchmarking datasets, in particular outperforming all other methods on the
CIF2016 dataset.

 <dc:description>  People nowadays share large parts of their personal lives through social
media. Being able to automatically recognise people in personal photos may
greatly enhance user convenience by easing photo album organisation. For human
identification task, however, traditional focus of computer vision has been
face recognition and pedestrian re-identification. Person recognition in social
media photos sets new challenges for computer vision, including non-cooperative
subjects (e.g. backward viewpoints, unusual poses) and great changes in
appearance. To tackle this problem, we build a simple person recognition
framework that leverages convnet features from multiple image regions (head,
body, etc.). We propose new recognition scenarios that focus on the time and
appearance gap between training and testing samples. We present an in-depth
analysis of the importance of different features according to time and
viewpoint generalisability. In the process, we verify that our simple approach
achieves the state of the art result on the PIPA benchmark, arguably the
largest social media based benchmark for person recognition to date with
diverse poses, viewpoints, social groups, and events.
  Compared the conference version of the paper, this paper additionally
presents (1) analysis of a face recogniser (DeepID2+), (2) new method naeil2
that combines the conference version method naeil and DeepID2+ to achieve state
of the art results even compared to post-conference works, (3) discussion of
related work since the conference version, (4) additional analysis including
the head viewpoint-wise breakdown of performance, and (5) results on the
open-world setup.

 <dc:description>  Bidirectional transformations between different data representations occur
frequently in modern software systems. They appear as serializers and
deserializers, as database views and view updaters, and more. Manually building
bidirectional transformations---by writing two separate functions that are
intended to be inverses---is tedious and error prone. A better approach is to
use a domain-specific language in which both directions can be written as a
single expression. However, these domain-specific languages can be difficult to
program in, requiring programmers to manage fiddly details while working in a
complex type system.
  To solve this, we present Optician, a tool for type-directed synthesis of
bijective string transformers. The inputs to Optician are two ordinary regular
expressions representing two data formats and a few concrete examples for
disambiguation. The output is a well-typed program in Boomerang (a
bidirectional language based on the theory of lenses). The main technical
challenge involves navigating the vast program search space efficiently enough.
Unlike most prior work on type-directed synthesis, our system operates in the
context of a language with a rich equivalence relation on types (the theory of
regular expressions). We synthesize terms of a equivalent language and convert
those generated terms into our lens language. We prove the correctness of our
synthesis algorithm. We also demonstrate empirically that our new language
changes the synthesis problem from one that admits intractable solutions to one
that admits highly efficient solutions. We evaluate Optician on a benchmark
suite of 39 examples including both microbenchmarks and realistic examples
derived from other data management systems including Flash Fill, a tool for
synthesizing string transformations in spreadsheets, and Augeas, a tool for
bidirectional processing of Linux system configuration files.

 <dc:title>Low Complexity Fair Scheduling in LTE Uplink Involving Different Traffic

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Long term evolution (LTE) has already been accepted as the de-facto 4G
wireless technology. However, the bulk of the research on LTE packet scheduling
is concentrated in the downlink and the uplink is comparatively less explored.
In uplink, mostly channel aware scheduling with throughput maximization has
been studied. Further, channel aware scheduling requires an infinitely
backlogged buffer model. This makes the investigations unrealistic. Therefore,
in this work, we propose an LTE uplink packet scheduling procedure with a
realistic traffic source. Firstly, we advocate a joint channel and buffer aware
algorithm, which seeks to maximize the actual number of bits transmitted once a
user is scheduled. Thereafter, we modify our algorithm to support traffic types
with delay constraints. Next, we enhance our algorithm to support multiple
classes of traffic. Finally, we have introduced priority flipping to minimize
bandwidth starvation of lower priority traffics in presence of higher
percentage of high priority traffic. In all the proposals, we have replaced the
delay constraint by minimizing the packet drop due to delay violation. This
further helps in reducing the problems to a well-known assignment problem.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of automatic American Sign Language fingerspelling
recognition from video. Prior work has largely relied on frame-level labels,
hand-crafted features, or other constraints, and has been hampered by the
scarcity of data for this task. We introduce a model for fingerspelling
recognition that addresses these issues. The model consists of an
auto-encoder-based feature extractor and an attention-based neural
encoder-decoder, which are trained jointly. The model receives a sequence of
image frames and outputs the fingerspelled word, without relying on any
frame-level training labels or hand-crafted features. In addition, the
auto-encoder subcomponent makes it possible to leverage unlabeled data to
improve the feature learning. The model achieves 11.6% and 4.4% absolute letter
accuracy improvement respectively in signer-independent and signer- adapted
fingerspelling recognition over previous approaches that required frame-level
training labels.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a function space approach to Representation Learning
and the analysis of the representation layers in deep learning architectures.
We show how to compute a weak-type Besov smoothness index that quantifies the
geometry of the clustering in the feature space. This approach was already
applied successfully to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms
such as the Random Forest and tree-based Gradient Boosting. Our experiments
demonstrate that in well-known and well-performing trained networks, the Besov
smoothness of the training set, measured in the corresponding hidden layer
feature map representation, increases from layer to layer. We also contribute
to the understanding of generalization by showing how the Besov smoothness of
the representations, decreases as we add more mis-labeling to the training
data. We hope this approach will contribute to the de-mystification of some
aspects of deep learning.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation systems form the center piece of a rapidly growing trillion
dollar online advertisement industry. Even with optimizations/approximations,
collaborative filtering (CF) approaches require real-time computations
involving very large vectors.Curating and storing such related profile
information vectors on web portals seriously breaches the user's privacy. While
achieving private recommendations in this setup further requires communication
of long encrypted vectors, making the whole process inefficient. We present a
more efficient recommendation system alternative, in which user profiles are
maintained entirely on their device, and appropriate recommendations are
fetched from web portals in an efficient privacy preserving manner. We base
this approach on association rules.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present the checkpoint ensembles method that can learn ensemble models on
a single training process. Although checkpoint ensembles can be applied to any
parametric iterative learning technique, here we focus on neural networks.
Neural networks' composable and simple neurons make it possible to capture many
individual and interaction effects among features. However, small sample sizes
and sampling noise may result in patterns in the training data that are not
representative of the true relationship between the features and the outcome.
As a solution, regularization during training is often used (e.g. dropout).
However, regularization is no panacea -- it does not perfectly address
overfitting. Even with methods like dropout, two methodologies are commonly
used in practice. First is to utilize a validation set independent to the
training set as a way to decide when to stop training. Second is to use
ensemble methods to further reduce overfitting and take advantage of local
optima (i.e. averaging over the predictions of several models). In this paper,
we explore checkpoint ensembles -- a simple technique that combines these two
ideas in one training process. Checkpoint ensembles improve performance by
averaging the predictions from &quot;checkpoints&quot; of the best models within single
training process. We use three real-world data sets -- text, image, and
electronic health record data -- using three prediction models: a vanilla
neural network, a convolutional neural network, and a long short term memory
network to show that checkpoint ensembles outperform existing methods: a method
that selects a model by minimum validation score, and two methods that average
models by weights. Our results also show that checkpoint ensembles capture a
portion of the performance gains that traditional ensembles provide.

 <dc:description>  Many applications infer the structure of a probabilistic graphical model from
data to elucidate the relationships between variables. But how can we train
graphical models on a massive data set? In this paper, we show how to construct
coresets -compressed data sets which can be used as proxy for the original data
and have provably bounded worst case error- for Gaussian dependency networks
(DNs), i.e., cyclic directed graphical models over Gaussians, where the parents
of each variable are its Markov blanket. Specifically, we prove that Gaussian
DNs admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set.
Unfortunately, this does not extend to DNs over members of the exponential
family in general. As we will prove, Poisson DNs do not admit small coresets.
Despite this worst-case result, we will provide an argument why our coreset
construction for DNs can still work well in practice on count data. To
corroborate our theoretical results, we empirically evaluated the resulting
Core DNs on real data sets. The results

and for small enough accuracy $\delta$, $m\sim \delta^{-4} s\log(N/s\delta)$
measurements suffice to reconstruct the direction of any $s$-sparse vector up
to accuracy $\delta$ via an efficient program. We derive this result by proving
that partial Gaussian circulant matrices satisfy an $\ell_1/\ell_2$
RIP-property. Under a slightly worse dependence on $\delta$, we establish
stability with respect to approximate sparsity, as well as full vector recovery
results.

 <dc:title>Efficient mining of maximal biclusters in mixed-attribute datasets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Veroneze, Rosana</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Von Zuben, Fernando J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel enumerative biclustering algorithm to directly
mine all maximal biclusters in mixed-attribute datasets (containing both
numerical and categorical attributes), with or without missing values. The
proposal is an extension of RIn-Close_CVC, which was originally conceived to
mine perfect or perturbed biclusters with constant values on columns solely
from numerical datasets, and without missing values. Even endowed with
additional and more general features, the extended RIn-Close_CVC retains four
key properties: (1) efficiency, (2) completeness, (3) correctness, and (4)
non-redundancy. Our proposal is the first one to deal with mixed-attribute
datasets without requiring any pre-processing step, such as discretization and
itemization of real-valued attributes. This is a decisive aspect, because
discretization and itemization implies a priori decisions, with information
loss and no clear control over the consequences. On the other hand, even having
to specify a priori an individual threshold for each numerical attribute, that
will be used to indicate internal consistency per attribute, each threshold
will be applied during the construction of the biclusters, shaping the
peculiarities of the data distribution. We also explore the strong connection
between biclustering and frequent pattern mining to (1) provide filters to
select a compact bicluster set that exhibits high relevance and low redundancy,
and (2) in the case of labeled datasets, automatically present the biclusters
in a user-friendly and intuitive form, by means of quantitative class
association rules. Our experimental results showed that the biclusters yield a
parsimonious set of relevant rules, providing useful and interpretable models
for five mixed-attribute labeled datasets.

 <dc:description>  While all kinds of mixed data -from personal data, over panel and scientific
data, to public and commercial data- are collected and stored, building
probabilistic graphical models for these hybrid domains becomes more difficult.
Users spend significant amounts of time in identifying the parametric form of
the random variables (Gaussian, Poisson, Logit, etc.) involved and learning the
mixed models. To make this difficult task easier, we propose the first
trainable probabilistic deep architecture for hybrid domains that features
tractable queries. It is based on Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) with piecewise
polynomial leave distributions together with novel nonparametric decomposition
and conditioning steps using the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-R\'enyi Maximum
Correlation Coefficient. This relieves the user from deciding a-priori the
parametric form of the random variables but is still expressive enough to
effectively approximate any continuous distribution and permits efficient
learning and inference. Our empirical evidence shows that the architecture,
called Mixed SPNs, can indeed capture complex distributions across a wide range
of hybrid domains.

 <dc:description>  In the paper we analyze 26 communities across the United States with the
objective to understand what attaches people to their community and how this
attachment differs among communities. How different are attached people from
unattached? What attaches people to their community? How different are the
communities? What are key drivers behind emotional attachment? To address these
questions, graphical, supervised and unsupervised learning tools were used and
information from the Census Bureau and the Knight Foundation were combined.
Using the same pre-processed variables as Knight (2010) most likely will drive
the results towards the same conclusions than the Knight foundation, so this
paper does not use those variables.

 <dc:description>  The advent of the digital pathology has introduced new avenues of diagnostic
medicine. Among them, crowdsourcing has attracted researchers' attention in the
recent years, allowing them to engage thousands of untrained individuals in
research and diagnosis. While there exist several articles in this regard,
prior works have not collectively documented them. We, therefore, aim to review
the applications of crowdsourcing in human pathology in a semi-systematic
manner. We firstly, introduce a novel method to do a systematic search of the
literature. Utilizing this method, we, then, collect hundreds of articles and
screen them against a pre-defined set of criteria. Furthermore, we crowdsource
part of the screening process, to examine another potential application of
crowdsourcing. Finally, we review the selected articles and characterize the
prior uses of crowdsourcing in pathology.

 <dc:title>Design of an SI Engine Cold Start Controller based on Dynamic Coupling
  Analysis</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Amini, Mohammad Reza</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Shahbakhti, Mahdi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the dynamic couplings among different inputs and outputs of a
highly nonlinear spark ignition (SI) engine control problem during the cold
start phase are evaluated by using relative gain array (RGA) technique. First,
based on the experimental data, a multi-input multi-output model is developed
to represent the engine dynamics. Second, the coupling among different inputs
and outputs of the model is evaluated by using RGA technique in both open-loop
and closed-loop structures. The results show that although there is an internal
coupling within the engine dynamics in the open-loop framework, the closed-loop
engine controller can be designed using a decentralized structure without
significantly affecting the system performance. In the next step, based on a
nonlinear physics-based model of the engine, a set of single-input
single-output (SISO) adaptive second order discrete sliding mode controllers
(DSMC) are designed to drive the states of the engine model to their
pre-defined desired trajectories and minimize the tailpipe HC emission, under
modelling and implementation (data sampling and quantization) uncertainties.
The real-time test results on an actual engine control unit (ECU) show that the
proposed SISO adaptive second order DSMC provides accurate and fast tracking
performance for the highly nonlinear and internally coupled engine dynamics,
and can meet the HC emission limit by controlling the engine-out emissions and
exhaust catalytic converter efficiency.

 <dc:title>Blind Deconvolution by a Steepest Descent Algorithm on a Quotient
  Manifold</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Wen</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hand, Paul</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a Riemannian steepest descent method for solving a
blind deconvolution problem. We prove that the proposed algorithm with an
appropriate initialization will recover the exact solution with high
probability when the number of measurements is, up to log-factors, the
information-theoretical minimum scaling. The quotient structure in our
formulation yields a simpler penalty term in the cost function compared to
[LLSW16], which eases the convergence analysis and yields a natural
implementation. Empirically, the proposed algorithm has better performance than
the Wirtinger gradient descent algorithm and an alternating minimization
algorithm in the sense that i) it needs fewer operations, such as DFTs and
matrix-vector multiplications, to reach a similar accuracy, and ii) it has a
higher probability of successful recovery in synthetic tests. An image
deblurring problem is also used to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  D. Grigoriev-G. Koshevoy recently proved that tropical Schur polynomials have
(at worst) polynomial tropical semiring complexity. They also conjectured
tropical skew Schur polynomials have at least exponential complexity; we
establish a polynomial complexity upper bound. Our proof uses results about

Jockusch-R. P. Stanley, together with a sufficient condition for polynomial
complexity that is connected to the saturated Newton polytope property.

 <dc:description>  We explore further the hardness of the non-dual discrete variant of the

Gauss sums to deduce the likely failure of these attacks for 2-power cyclotomic
rings and unramified moduli.

 <dc:description>  Research use of sensitive information -- personally identifiable information
(PII), protected health information (PHI), commercial or proprietary data, and
the like -- is increasing as researchers' skill with &quot;big data&quot; matures. Duke
University's Protected Network is an environment with technical controls in
place that provide research groups with essential pieces of security measures
needed for studies using sensitive information. The environment uses
virtualization and authorization groups extensively to isolate data, provide
elasticity of resources, and flexibly meet a range of computational
requirements within tightly controlled network boundaries. Since its beginning
in 2011, the environment has supported about 200 research projects and groups
and has served as a foundation for specialized and protected IT infrastructures
in the social sciences, population studies, and medical research. This article
lays out key features of the development of the Protected Network and outlines
the IT infrastructure design and organizational features that Duke has used in
establishing this resource for researchers. It consists of four sections: 1.
Context, 2. Infrastructure, 3. Authentication and identity management, and 4.
The infrastructure as a &quot;platform.&quot;

 <dc:description>  This research overviews and iterates on a Spectrum of Audience Interactivity,
a tool to help designers and artists consider the dimensions and range of
audience interactivity characteristics. Previous research has introduced a
spectrum of audience participation in live performances based on children's
co-design sessions. We expand on these findings with a review of literature in
theater, games, and theme parks paired with expert interviews in those domains.
From this work, we present a framework describing the spheres of audience
influence, a new spectrum of audience interactivity, and a set of orthogonal
spectrum dimensions that collectively describe audience interactivity. We pair
our new framework with design considerations for practitioners; interactivity
should be thoughtfully designed, should anticipate audience challenges, and can
support multiple levels of the audience interactivity.

constant error from the ground truth while each data owner submits multiple
contradictory responses, achieves scalable non-attributable (privatized)

attempts to corrupt (e.g., pollution attacks). We show an optimization of a
square root reduction fewer required PRG seed initializations which provides 1
order of magnitude improvement in the number of private writes from the default

 <dc:title>Massive Open Online Courses Temporal Profiling for Dropout Prediction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are attracting the attention of people
all over the world. Regardless the platform, numbers of registrants for online
courses are impressive but in the same time, completion rates are
disappointing. Understanding the mechanisms of dropping out based on the
learner profile arises as a crucial task in MOOCs, since it will allow
intervening at the right moment in order to assist the learner in completing
the course. In this paper, the dropout behaviour of learners in a MOOC is
thoroughly studied by first extracting features that describe the behavior of
learners within the course and then by comparing three classifiers (Logistic
Regression, Random Forest and AdaBoost) in two tasks: predicting which users
will have dropped out by a certain week and predicting which users will drop
out on a specific week. The former has showed to be considerably easier, with
all three classifiers performing equally well. However, the accuracy for the
second task is lower, and Logistic Regression tends to perform slightly better
than the other two algorithms. We found that features that reflect an active
attitude of the user towards the MOOC, such as submitting their assignment,
posting on the Forum and filling their Profile, are strong indicators of
persistence.

 <dc:description>  The World Wide Web (WWW) has fundamentally changed the ways billions of
people are able to access information. Thus, understanding how people seek
information online is an important issue of study. Wikipedia is a hugely
important part of information provision on the web, with hundreds of millions
of users browsing and contributing to its network of knowledge. The study of
navigational behaviour on Wikipedia, due to the site's popularity and breadth
of content, can reveal more general information seeking patterns that may be
applied beyond Wikipedia and the Web. Our work addresses the relative
shortcomings of existing literature in relating how information structure
influences patterns of navigation online. We study aggregated clickstream data
for articles on the English Wikipedia in the form of a weighted, directed
navigational network. We introduce two parameters that describe how articles
act to source and spread traffic through the network, based on their in/out
strength and entropy. From these, we construct a navigational phase space where
different article types occupy different, distinct regions, indicating how the
structure of information online has differential effects on patterns of
navigation. Finally, we go on to suggest applications for this analysis in
identifying and correcting deficiencies in the Wikipedia page network that may
also be adapted to more general information networks.

  Does social media use have a positive or negative impact on civic engagement?
The &quot;slacktivism hypothesis&quot; holds that if citizens use social media for
political conversation, those conversations will be fleeting and vapid. Most
attempts to answer this question involve public opinion data from the United
States, so we offer an examination of an important case from Mexico, where an
independent candidate used social media to communicate with the public and
eschewed traditional media outlets. He won the race for state governor,
defeating candidates from traditional parties and triggering sustained public
engagement beyond election day. In our investigation, we analyze over 750,000

wrong label when presented to a system at test time. If adversarial examples
existed that could fool a detector, they could be used to (for example) wreak
havoc on roads populated with smart vehicles. Recently, we described our
difficulties creating physical adversarial stop signs that fool a detector.
More recently, Evtimov et al. produced a physical adversarial stop sign that
fools a proxy model of a detector. In this paper, we show that these physical
adversarial stop signs do not fool two standard detectors (YOLO and Faster
RCNN) in standard configuration. Evtimov et al.'s construction relies on a crop
of the image to the stop sign; this crop is then resized and presented to a
classifier. We argue that the cropping and resizing procedure largely
eliminates the effects of rescaling and of view angle. Whether an adversarial
attack is robust under rescaling and change of view direction remains moot. We
argue that attacking a classifier is very different from attacking a detector,
and that the structure of detectors - which must search for their own bounding
box, and which cannot estimate that box very accurately - likely makes it
difficult to make adversarial patterns. Finally, an adversarial pattern on a
physical object that could fool a detector would have to be adversarial in the
face of a wide family of parametric distortions (scale; view angle; box shift
inside the detector; illumination; and so on). Such a pattern would be of great
theoretical and practical interest. There is currently no evidence that such
patterns exist.

 <dc:description>  PET image reconstruction is challenging due to the ill-poseness of the
inverse problem and limited number of detected photons. Recently deep neural
networks have been widely and successfully used in computer vision tasks and
attracted growing interests in medical imaging. In this work, we trained a deep
residual convolutional neural network to improve PET image quality by using the
existing inter-patient information. An innovative feature of the proposed
method is that we embed the neural network in the iterative reconstruction
framework for image representation, rather than using it as a post-processing
tool. We formulate the objective function as a constraint optimization problem
and solve it using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Both simulation data and hybrid real data are used to evaluate the
proposed method. Quantification results show that our proposed iterative neural
network method can outperform the neural network denoising and conventional
penalized maximum likelihood methods.

 <dc:description>  Natural language place descriptions in everyday communication provide a rich
source of spatial knowledge about places. An important step to utilize such
knowledge in information systems is geo-referencing all the places referred to
in these descriptions. Current techniques for geo-referencing places from text
documents are using place name recognition and disambiguation; however, place
descriptions often contain place references that are not known by gazetteers,
or that are expressed in other, more flexible ways. Hence, the approach for
geo-referencing presented in this paper starts from a place graph that contains
the place references as well as spatial relationships extracted from place
descriptions. Spatial relationships are used to constrain the locations of
places and allow the later best-matching process for geo-referencing. The novel
geo-referencing process results in higher precision and recall compared to
state-of-art toponym resolution approaches on several tested place description
datasets.

 <dc:title>What does Attention in Neural Machine Translation Pay Attention to?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Attention in neural machine translation provides the possibility to encode
relevant parts of the source sentence at each translation step. As a result,
attention is considered to be an alignment model as well. However, there is no
work that specifically studies attention and provides analysis of what is being
learned by attention models. Thus, the question still remains that how
attention is similar or different from the traditional alignment. In this
paper, we provide detailed analysis of attention and compare it to traditional
alignment. We answer the question of whether attention is only capable of
modelling translational equivalent or it captures more information. We show
that attention is different from alignment in some cases and is capturing
useful information other than alignments.

 <dc:description>  One essential component in the construction of patent landscapes in
biomedical research and development (R&amp;D) is identifying the most seminal
patents. Hitherto, the identification of seminal patents required subject
matter experts within biomedical areas. In this brief communication, we report
an analytical method and tool, Patent Citation Spectroscopy (PCS), for rapidly
identifying landmark patents in user-specified areas of biomedical innovation.
PCS mines the cited references within large sets of patents and provides an
estimate of the most historically impactful prior work. The efficacy of PCS is
shown in two case studies of biomedical innovation with clinical relevance: (1)
RNA interference and (2) cholesterol. PCS mined and analyzed 4,065 cited
references related to patents on RNA interference and correctly identified the
foundational patent of this technology, as independently reported by subject
matter experts on RNAi intellectual property. Secondly, PCS was applied to a
broad set of patents dealing with cholesterol - a case study chosen to reflect
a more general, as opposed to expert, patent search query. PCS mined through
11,326 cited references and identified the seminal patent as that for Lipitor,
the groundbreaking medication for treating high cholesterol as well as the pair
of patents underlying Repatha. These cases suggest that PCS provides a useful
method for identifying seminal patents in areas of biomedical innovation and
therapeutics. The interactive tool is free-to-use at: www.leydesdorff.net/pcs/.

 <dc:title>A synchronous program algebra: a basis for reasoning about shared-memory

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This research started with an algebra for reasoning about rely/guarantee
concurrency for a shared memory model. The approach taken led to a more
abstract algebra of atomic steps, in which atomic steps synchronise (rather
than interleave) when composed in parallel. The algebra of rely/guarantee
concurrency then becomes an instantiation of the more abstract algebra. Many of
the core properties needed for rely/guarantee reasoning can be shown to hold in
the abstract algebra where their proofs are simpler and hence allow a higher
degree of automation. The algebra has been encoded in Isabelle/HOL to provide a
basis for tool support for program verification.
  In rely/guarantee concurrency, programs are specified to guarantee certain
behaviours until assumptions about the behaviour of their environment are
violated. When assumptions are violated, program behaviour is unconstrained
(aborting), and guarantees need no longer hold. To support these guarantees a
second synchronous operator, weak conjunction, was introduced: both processes
in a weak conjunction must agree to take each atomic step, unless one aborts in
which case the whole aborts. In developing the laws for parallel and weak
conjunction we found many properties were shared by the operators and that the
proofs of many laws were essentially the same. This insight led to the idea of
generalising synchronisation to an abstract operator with only the axioms that
are shared by the parallel and weak conjunction operator, so that those two
operators can be viewed as instantiations of the abstract synchronisation
operator. The main differences between parallel and weak conjunction are how
they combine individual atomic steps; that is left open in the axioms for the
abstract operator.

 <dc:description>  Trajectory interpolation, the process of filling-in the gaps and removing
noise from observed agent trajectories, is an essential task for the motion
inference in multi-agent setting. A desired trajectory interpolation method
should be robust to noise, changes in environments or agent densities, while
also being yielding realistic group movement behaviors. Such realistic
behaviors are, however, challenging to model as they require avoidance of
agent-agent or agent-environment collisions and, at the same time, seek
computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel framework composed
of data-driven priors (local, global or combined) and an efficient optimization
strategy for multi-agent trajectory interpolation. The data-driven priors
implicitly encode the dependencies of movements of multiple agents and the
collision-avoiding desiderata, enabling elimination of costly pairwise
collision constraints and resulting in reduced computational complexity and
often improved estimation. Various combinations of priors and optimization
algorithms are evaluated in comprehensive simulated experiments. Our
experimental results reveal important insights, including the significance of
the global flow prior and the lesser-than-expected influence of data-driven
collision priors.

 <dc:title>An Extension of Deep Pathway Analysis: A Pathway Route Analysis
  Framework Incorporating Multi-dimensional Cancer Genomics Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Recent breakthroughs in cancer research have come via the up-and-coming field
of pathway analysis. By applying statistical methods to prior known gene and
protein regulatory information, pathway analysis provides a meaningful way to
interpret genomic data. While many gene/protein regulatory relationships have
been studied, never before has such a significant amount data been made
available in organized forms of gene/protein regulatory networks and pathways.
However, pathway analysis research is still in its infancy, especially when
applying it to solve practical problems.
  In this paper we propose a new method of studying biological pathways, one
that cross analyzes mutation information, transcriptome and proteomics data.
Using this outcome, we identify routes of aberrant pathways potentially
responsible for the etiology of disease. Each pathway route is encoded as a
bayesian network which is initialized with a sequence of conditional
probabilities specifically designed to encode directionality of regulatory
relationships encoded in the pathways. Far more complex interactions, such as
phosphorylation and methylation, among others, in the pathways can be modeled
using this approach. The effectiveness of our model is demonstrated through its
ability to distinguish real pathways from decoys on TCGA mRNA-seq, mutation,
Copy Number Variation and phosphorylation data for both Breast cancer and
Ovarian cancer study. The majority of pathways distinguished can be confirmed
by biological literature. Moreover, the proportion of correctly indentified
pathways is \% higher than previous work where only mRNA-seq mutation data is
incorporated for breast cancer patients. Consequently, such an in-depth pathway
analysis incorporating more diverse data can give rise to the accuracy of
perturbed pathway detection.

 <dc:description>  The automatic verification of programs that maintain unbounded low-level data
structures is a critical and open problem. Analyzers and verifiers developed in
previous work can synthesize invariants that only describe data structures of
heavily restricted forms, or require an analyst to provide predicates over
program data and structure that are used in a synthesized proof of correctness.
  In this work, we introduce a novel automatic safety verifier of programs that
maintain low-level data structures, named LTTP. LTTP synthesizes proofs of
program safety represented as a grammar of a given program's control paths,
annotated with invariants that relate program state at distinct points within
its path of execution. LTTP synthesizes such proofs completely automatically,
using a novel inductive-synthesis algorithm.
  We have implemented LTTP as a verifier for JVM bytecode and applied it to
verify the safety of a collection of verification benchmarks. Our results
demonstrate that LTTP can be applied to automatically verify the safety of
programs that are beyond the scope of previously-developed verifiers.

 <dc:description>  We propose a method for redistricting, decomposing a geographical area into
subareas, called districts, so that the populations of the districts are as
close as possible and the districts are compact and contiguous. Each district
is the intersection of a polygon with the geographical area. The polygons are
convex and the average number of sides per polygon is less than six. The
polygons tend to be quite compact. With each polygon is associated a center.
The center is the centroid of the locations of the residents associated with
the polygon. The algorithm can be viewed as a heuristic for finding centers and
a balanced assignment of residents to centers so as to minimize the sum of
squared distances of residents to centers; hence the solution can be said to
have low dispersion.

 <dc:description>  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is endemic in people who inject drugs
(PWID), with prevalence estimates above 60 percent for PWID in the United
States. Previous modeling studies suggest that direct acting antiviral (DAA)
treatment can lower overall prevalence in this population, but treatment is
often delayed until the onset of advanced liver disease (fibrosis stage 3 or
later) due to cost. Lower cost interventions featuring syringe access (SA) and
medically assisted treatment (MAT) for addiction are known to be less costly,
but have shown mixed results in lowering HCV rates below current levels. Little
is known about the potential synergistic effects of combining DAA and MAT
treatment, and large-scale tests of combined interventions are rare. While
simulation experiments can reveal likely long-term effects, most prior
simulations have been performed on closed populations of model agents--a
scenario quite different from the open, mobile populations known to most health
agencies. This paper uses data from the Centers for Disease Control's National
HIV Behavioral Surveillance project, IDU round 3, collected in New York City in
2012 by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to
parameterize simulations of open populations. Our results show that, in an open
population, SA/MAT by itself has only small effects on HCV prevalence, while
DAA treatment by itself can significantly lower both HCV and HCV-related
advanced liver disease prevalence. More importantly, the simulation experiments
suggest that cost effective synergistic combinations of the two strategies can
dramatically reduce HCV incidence. We conclude that adopting SA/MAT
implementations alongside DAA interventions can play a critical role in
reducing the long-term consequences of ongoing infection.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have been remarkable successful in various AI tasks but
often cast high computation and energy cost for energy-constrained applications
such as mobile sensing. We address this problem by proposing a novel framework
that optimizes the prediction accuracy and energy cost simultaneously, thus
enabling effective cost-accuracy trade-off at test time. In our framework, each
data instance is pushed into a cascade of deep neural networks with increasing
sizes, and a selection module is used to sequentially determine when a
sufficiently accurate classifier can be used for this data instance. The
cascade of neural networks and the selection module are jointly trained in an
end-to-end fashion by the REINFORCE algorithm to optimize a trade-off between
the computational cost and the predictive accuracy. Our method is able to
simultaneously improve the accuracy and efficiency by learning to assign easy
instances to fast yet sufficiently accurate classifiers to save computation and
energy cost, while assigning harder instances to deeper and more powerful
classifiers to ensure satisfiable accuracy. With extensive experiments on
several image classification datasets using cascaded ResNet classifiers, we
demonstrate that our method outperforms the standard well-trained ResNets in
accuracy but only requires less than 20% and 50% FLOPs cost on the CIFAR-10/100

 <dc:description>  In recent years, visual question answering (VQA) has become topical as a
long-term goal to drive computer vision and multi-disciplinary AI research. The
premise of VQA's significance, is that both the image and textual question need
to be well understood and mutually grounded in order to infer the correct
answer. However, current VQA models perhaps `understand' less than initially
hoped, and instead master the easier task of exploiting cues given away in the
question and biases in the answer distribution.
  In this paper we propose the inverse problem of VQA (iVQA), and explore its
suitability as a benchmark for visuo-linguistic understanding. The iVQA task is
to generate a question that corresponds to a given image and answer pair. Since
the answers are less informative than the questions, and the questions have
less learnable bias, an iVQA model needs to better understand the image to be
successful. We pose question generation as a multi-modal dynamic inference
process and propose an iVQA model that can gradually adjust its focus of
attention guided by both a partially generated question and the answer. For
evaluation, apart from existing linguistic metrics, we propose a new ranking
metric. This metric compares the ground truth question's rank among a list of
distractors, which allows the drawbacks of different algorithms and sources of
error to be studied. Experimental results show that our model can generate
diverse, grammatically correct and content correlated questions that match the
given answer.

 <dc:description>  Cloud storage systems generally add redundancy in storing content files such
that $K$ files are replicated or erasure coded and stored on $N &gt; K$ nodes. In
addition to providing reliability against failures, the redundant copies can be
used to serve a larger volume of content access requests. A request for one of
the files can be either be sent to a systematic node, or one of the repair
groups. In this paper, we seek to maximize the service capacity region, that
is, the set of request arrival rates for the $K$ files that can be supported by
a coded storage system. We explore two aspects of this problem: 1) for a given
erasure code, how to optimally split incoming requests between systematic nodes
and repair groups, and 2) choosing an underlying erasure code that maximizes
the achievable service capacity region. In particular, we consider MDS and
Simplex codes. Our analysis demonstrates that erasure coding makes the system
more robust to skews in file popularity than simply replicating a file at
multiple servers, and that coding and replication together can make the
capacity region larger than either alone.

 <dc:description>  When we say a person is texting, can you tell the person is walking or
sitting? Emphatically, no. In order to solve this incomplete representation
problem, this paper presents a sub-action descriptor for detailed action
detection. The sub-action descriptor consists of three levels: the posture, the
locomotion, and the gesture level. The three levels give three sub-action
categories for one action to address the representation problem. The proposed
action detection model simultaneously localizes and recognizes the actions of
multiple individuals in video surveillance using appearance-based temporal
features with multi-CNN. The proposed approach achieved a mean average
precision (mAP) of 76.6% at the frame-based and 83.5% at the video-based
measurement on the new large-scale ICVL video surveillance dataset that the
authors introduce and make available to the community with this paper.
Extensive experiments on the benchmark KTH dataset demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieved better performance, which in turn boosts the action
recognition performance over the state-of-the-art. The action detection model
can run at around 25 fps on the ICVL and more than 80 fps on the KTH dataset,
which is suitable for real-time surveillance applications.

 <dc:title>On Preemption and Overdetermination in Formal Theories of Causality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dyrkolbotn, Sjur K</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  One of the key challenges when looking for the causes of a complex event is
to determine the causal status of factors that are neither individually
necessary nor individually sufficient to produce that event. In order to reason
about how such factors should be taken into account, we need a vocabulary to
distinguish different cases. In philosophy, the concept of overdetermination
and the concept of preemption serve an important purpose in this regard,
although their exact meaning tends to remain elusive. In this paper, I provide
theory-neutral definitions of these concepts using structural equations in the
Halpern-Pearl tradition. While my definitions do not presuppose any particular
causal theory, they take such a theory as a variable parameter. This enables us
to specify formal constraints on theories of causality, in terms of a
pre-theoretic understanding of what preemption and overdetermination actually
mean. I demonstrate the usefulness of this by presenting and arguing for what I
call the principle of presumption. Roughly speaking, this principle states that
a possible cause can only be regarded as having been preempted if there is
independent evidence to support such an inference. I conclude by showing that
the principle of presumption is violated by the two main theories of causality
formulated in the Halpern-Pearl tradition. The paper concludes by defining the
class of empirical causal theories, characterised in terms of a fixed-point of
counterfactual reasoning about difference-making. It is argued that theories of
actual causality ought to be empirical.

 <dc:description>  Model checking is usually based on a comprehensive traversal of the state
space. Causality-based model checking is a radically different approach that
instead analyzes the cause-effect relationships in a program. We give an
overview on a new class of model checking algorithms that capture the causal
relationships in a special data structure called concurrent traces. Concurrent
traces identify key events in an execution history and link them through their
cause-effect relationships. The model checker builds a tableau of concurrent
traces, where the case splits represent different causal explanations of a
hypothetical error. Causality-based model checking has been implemented in the
ARCTOR tool, and applied to previously intractable multi-threaded benchmarks.

 <dc:title>Causality and Temporal Dependencies in the Design of Fault Management
  Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bozzano, Marco</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reasoning about causes and effects naturally arises in the engineering of
safety-critical systems. A classical example is Fault Tree Analysis, a
deductive technique used for system safety assessment, whereby an undesired
state is reduced to the set of its immediate causes. The design of fault
management systems also requires reasoning on causality relationships. In
particular, a fail-operational system needs to ensure timely detection and
identification of faults, i.e. recognize the occurrence of run-time faults
through their observable effects on the system. Even more complex scenarios
arise when multiple faults are involved and may interact in subtle ways.
  In this work, we propose a formal approach to fault management for complex
systems. We first introduce the notions of fault tree and minimal cut sets. We
then present a formal framework for the specification and analysis of
diagnosability, and for the design of fault detection and identification (FDI)
components. Finally, we review recent advances in fault propagation analysis,
based on the Timed Failure Propagation Graphs (TFPG) formalism.

 <dc:title>Incorporating Epistemic Uncertainty into the Safety Assurance of

 <dc:description>  In system development, epistemic uncertainty is an ever-present possibility
when reasoning about the causal factors during hazard analysis. Such
uncertainty is common when complicated systems interact with one another, and
it is dangerous because it impairs hazard analysis and thus increases the
chance of overlooking unsafe situations. Uncertainty around causation thus
needs to be managed well. Unfortunately, existing hazard analysis techniques
tend to ignore unknown uncertainties, and system stakeholders rarely track
known uncertainties well through the system lifecycle. In this paper, we
outline an approach to managing epistemic uncertainty in existing hazard
analysis techniques by focusing on known and unknown uncertainty. We have
created a reference populated with a wide range of safety-critical causal
relationships to recognise unknown uncertainty, and we have developed a model
to systematically capture and track known uncertainty around such factors. We
have also defined a process for using the reference and model to assess
possible causal factors that are suspected during hazard analysis. To assess
the applicability of our approach, we have analysed the widely-used MoDAF
architectural model and determined that there is potential for our approach to
identify additional causal factors that are not apparent from individual MoDAF
views. We have also reviewed an existing safety assessment example (the ARP4761
Aircraft System analysis) and determined that our approach could indeed be
incorporated into that process. We have also integrated our approach into the
STPA hazard analysis technique to demonstrate its feasibility to incorporate
into existing techniques. It is therefore plausible that our approach can
increase safety assurance provided by hazard analysis in the face of epistemic
uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  The dictionary matching is a task to find all occurrences of pattern strings
in a set $D$ (called a dictionary) on a text string $T$. The
Aho-Corasick-automaton (AC-automaton) is a data structure which enables us to
solve the dictionary matching problem in $O(d\log\sigma)$ preprocessing time
and $O(n\log\sigma+occ)$ matching time, where $d$ is the total length of the
patterns in $D$, $n$ is the length of the text, $\sigma$ is the alphabet size,
and $occ$ is the total number of occurrences of all the patterns in the text.
The dynamic dictionary matching is a variant where patterns may dynamically be
inserted into and deleted from $D$. This problem is called semi-dynamic
dictionary matching if only insertions are allowed. In this paper, we propose
two efficient algorithms. For a pattern of length $m$, our first algorithm
supports insertions in $O(m\log\sigma+\log d/\log\log d)$ time and pattern
matching in $O(n\log\sigma+occ)$ time for the semi-dynamic setting and supports
both insertions and deletions in $O(\sigma m+\log d/\log\log d)$ time and
pattern matching in $O(n(\log d/\log\log d+\log\sigma)+occ(\log d/\log\log d))$
time for the dynamic setting by some modifications. This algorithm is based on
the directed acyclic word graph. Our second algorithm, which is based on the
AC-automaton, supports insertions in $O(m\log \sigma+u_f+u_o)$ time for the
semi-dynamic setting and supports both insertions and deletions in $O(\sigma
m+u_f+u_o)$ time for the dynamic setting, where $u_f$ and $u_o$ respectively
denote the numbers of states of which the failure function and the output
function need to be updated. This algorithm performs pattern matching in
$O(n\log\sigma+occ)$ time for both settings. Our algorithm achieves optimal
update time for AC-automaton based methods, since any algorithm which
explicitly maintains the AC-automaton requires $\Omega(u_f+u_o)$ update time.

 <dc:description>  How do we determine the mutational effects in exome sequencing data with
little or no statistical evidence? Can protein structural information fill in
the gap of not having enough statistical evidence? In this work, we answer the
two questions with the goal towards determining pathogenic effects of rare
variants in rare disease. We take the approach of determining the importance of
point mutation loci focusing on protein structure features. The proposed
structure-based features contain information about geometric, physicochemical,
and functional information of mutation loci and those of structural neighbors
of the loci. The performance of the structure-based features trained on 80\% of
HumDiv and tested on 20\% of HumDiv and on ClinVar datasets showed high levels
of discernibility in the mutation's pathogenic or benign effects: F score of
0.71 and 0.68 respectively using multi-layer perceptron. Combining structure-
and sequence-based feature further improve the accuracy: F score of 0.86
(HumDiv) and 0.75 (ClinVar). Also, careful examination of the rare variants in
rare diseases cases showed that structure-based features are important in
discerning importance of variant loci.

between codes over $B_k$ and codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}.$ We consider
Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual codes, MacWilliams relations, as well as
Singleton-type bounds for these codes. Further, we characterize cyclic and
quasi-cyclic codes using their images under the Gray map, and give the
generators for these type of codes.

 <dc:description>  We describe a class of systems theory based neural networks called &quot;Network
Of Recurrent neural networks&quot; (NOR), which introduces a new structure level to
RNN related models. In NOR, RNNs are viewed as the high-level neurons and are
used to build the high-level layers. More specifically, we propose several
methodologies to design different NOR topologies according to the theory of
system evolution. Then we carry experiments on three different tasks to
evaluate our implementations. Experimental results show our models outperform
simple RNN remarkably under the same number of parameters, and sometimes
achieve even better results than GRU and LSTM.

 <dc:description>  Solar energy generation requires efficient monitoring and management in
moving towards technologies for net-zero energy buildings. This paper presents
a dependable control system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to control
and manage the energy flow of renewable energy collected by solar panels within
a microgrid. Data for optimal control include not only measurements from local
sensors but also meteorological information retrieved in real-time from online
sources. For system fault tolerance across the whole distributed control system
featuring multiple controllers, dependable controllers are developed to control
and optimise the tracking performance of photovoltaic arrays to maximally
capture solar radiation and maintain system resilience and reliability in real
time despite failures of one or more redundant controllers due to a problem
with communication, hardware or cybersecurity. Experimental results have been
obtained to evaluate the validity of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Recognizing text in the wild is a really challenging task because of complex
backgrounds, various illuminations and diverse distortions, even with deep
neural networks (convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks).
In the end-to-end training procedure for scene text recognition, the outputs of
deep neural networks at different iterations are always demonstrated with
diversity and complementarity for the target object (text). Here, a simple but
effective deep learning method, an adaptive ensemble of deep neural networks
(AdaDNNs), is proposed to simply select and adaptively combine classifier
components at different iterations from the whole learning system. Furthermore,
the ensemble is formulated as a Bayesian framework for classifier weighting and
combination. A variety of experiments on several typical acknowledged
benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR Robust Reading Competition (Challenge 1, 2 and 4)
datasets, verify the surprised improvement from the baseline DNNs, and the
effectiveness of AdaDNNs compared with the recent state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural architecture for ranking
answers from candidates that adapts a hierarchical recurrent neural network and
a latent topic clustering module. With our proposed model, a text is encoded to
a vector representation from an word-level to a chunk-level to effectively
capture the entire meaning. In particular, by adapting the hierarchical
structure, our model prevents performance degradations in longer text
comprehension while other recurrent neural networks suffer from it.
Additionally, the latent topic clustering module extracts semantic information
from target samples. This clustering module is useful for any text related
tasks by allowing each data sample to find its nearest topic cluster, thus
helping the neural network model analyze the entire data. We evaluate our
models on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and consumer electronic domain question
answering dataset, which is related to Samsung products. The proposed model
shows better performances than conventional architectures, resulting in
state-of-the-art results for ranking question-answer pairs.

data structure has been used in several applications and shown to be
practically relevant, it is theoretically not yet well understood. The purpose
of this paper is to present a polynomial-time algorithm to build the data

 <dc:description>  An ever increasing number of configuration parameters are provided to system
users. But many users have used one configuration setting across different
workloads, leaving untapped the performance potential of systems. A good
configuration setting can greatly improve the performance of a deployed system
under certain workloads. But with tens or hundreds of parameters, it becomes a
highly costly task to decide which configuration setting leads to the best
performance. While such task requires the strong expertise in both the system
and the application, users commonly lack such expertise.
  To help users tap the performance potential of systems, we present
BestConfig, a system for automatically finding a best configuration setting
within a resource limit for a deployed system under a given application
workload. BestConfig is designed with an extensible architecture to automate
the configuration tuning for general systems. To tune system configurations
within a resource limit, we propose the divide-and-diverge sampling method and
the recursive bound-and-search algorithm. BestConfig can improve the throughput
of Tomcat by 75%, that of Cassandra by 63%, that of MySQL by 430%, and reduce
the running time of Hive join job by about 50% and that of Spark join job by
about 80%, solely by configuration adjustment.

 <dc:description>  Monotonic policy improvement and off-policy learning are two main desirable
properties for reinforcement learning algorithms. In this paper, by lower
bounding the performance difference of two policies, we show that the monotonic
policy improvement is guaranteed from on- and off-policy mixture samples. An
optimization procedure which applies the proposed bound can be regarded as an
off-policy natural policy gradient method. In order to support the theoretical
result, we provide a trust region policy optimization method using experience
replay as a naive application of our bound, and evaluate its performance in two
classical benchmark problems.

 <dc:description>  In several domains obtaining class annotations is expensive while at the same
time unlabelled data are abundant. While most semi-supervised approaches
enforce restrictive assumptions on the data distribution, recent work has
managed to learn semi-supervised models in a non-restrictive regime. However,
so far such approaches have only been proposed for linear models. In this work,
we introduce semi-supervised parameter learning for Sum-Product Networks
(SPNs). SPNs are deep probabilistic models admitting inference in linear time
in number of network edges. Our approach has several advantages, as it (1)
allows generative and discriminative semi-supervised learning, (2) guarantees
that adding unlabelled data can increase, but not degrade, the performance
(safe), and (3) is computationally efficient and does not enforce restrictive
assumptions on the data distribution. We show on a variety of data sets that
safe semi-supervised learning with SPNs is competitive compared to
state-of-the-art and can lead to a better generative and discriminative
objective value than a purely supervised approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the comparison of two non-linear model-based control
strategies for autonomous cars. A control oriented model of vehicle based on a
bicycle model is used. The two control strategies use a model reference
approach. Using this approach, the error dynamics model is developed. Both
controllers receive as input the longitudinal, lateral and orientation errors
generating as control outputs the steering angle and the velocity of the
vehicle. The first control approach is based on a non-linear control law that
is designed by means of the Lyapunov direct approach. The second approach is
based on a sliding mode-control that defines a set of sliding surfaces over
which the error trajectories will converge. The main advantage of the
sliding-control technique is the robustness against non-linearities and
parametric uncertainties in the model. However, the main drawback of first
order sliding mode is the chattering, so it has been implemented a high order
sliding mode control. To test and compare the proposed control strategies,
different path following scenarios are used in simulation.

 <dc:title>SoAx: A generic C++ Structure of Arrays for handling Particles in HPC

 <dc:description>  The numerical study of physical problems often require integrating the
dynamics of a large number of particles evolving according to a given set of
equations. Particles are characterized by the information they are carrying
such as an identity, a position other. There are generally speaking two
different possibilities for handling particles in high performance computing
(HPC) codes. The concept of an Array of Structures (AoS) is in the spirit of
the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in that the particle information
is implemented as a structure. Here, an object (realization of the structure)
represents one particle and a set of many particles is stored in an array. In
contrast, using the concept of a Structure of Arrays (SoA), a single structure
holds several arrays each representing one property (such as the identity) of
the whole set of particles.
  The AoS approach is often implemented in HPC codes due to its handiness and
flexibility. For a class of problems, however, it is know that the performance
of SoA is much better than that of AoS. We confirm this observation for our
particle problem. Using a benchmark we show that on modern Intel Xeon
processors the SoA implementation is typically several times faster than the
AoS one. On Intel's MIC co-processors the performance gap even attains a factor
of ten. The same is true for GPU computing, using both computational and
multi-purpose GPUs.
  Combining performance and handiness, we present the library SoAx that has
optimal performance (on CPUs, MICs, and GPUs) while providing the same
handiness as AoS. For this, SoAx uses modern C++ design techniques such
template meta programming that allows to automatically generate code for user
defined heterogeneous data structures.

 <dc:description>  Domain shift refers to the well known problem that a model trained in one
source domain performs poorly when applied to a target domain with different
statistics. {Domain Generalization} (DG) techniques attempt to alleviate this
issue by producing models which by design generalize well to novel testing
domains. We propose a novel {meta-learning} method for domain generalization.
Rather than designing a specific model that is robust to domain shift as in
most previous DG work, we propose a model agnostic training procedure for DG.
Our algorithm simulates train/test domain shift during training by synthesizing
virtual testing domains within each mini-batch. The meta-optimization objective
requires that steps to improve training domain performance should also improve
testing domain performance. This meta-learning procedure trains models with
good generalization ability to novel domains. We evaluate our method and
achieve state of the art results on a recent cross-domain image classification
benchmark, as well demonstrating its potential on two classic reinforcement

 <dc:description>  Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is being realized as a promising
approach to accomplish the shortcomings of current IP-address based networking.
ICN models are based on naming the content to get rid of address-space
scarcity, accessing the content via name-based-routing, caching the content at
intermediate nodes to provide reliable, efficient data delivery and
self-certifying contents to ensure better security. Obvious benefits of ICN in
terms of fast and efficient data delivery and improved reliability raises ICN
as highly promising networking model for Internet of Things (IoTs) like
environments. IoT aims to connect anyone and/or anything at any time by any
path on any place but some IoTs like smart phones may not. From last decade,
IoTs attracts both industry and research communities. IoTs is an emerging
research field and still in its infancy. IoTs foremost target is to connect
efficiently billions of things in a way to reduce human involvement in the
operation of machines. While IoT wild-deployment puts many challenges, among
others, one challenge is how to address efficiently so many heterogeneous and
constraint-oriented devices. Thus, this paper presents the promise of ICN for
IoTs by providing state-of-the-art literature in this context. We provide IoTs
major components involved during its life-cycle and list required features for
IoT network architecture. We present major ICN architectures and their
applicability for IoTs. We survey ICN based naming and caching approaches for
IoTs with appropriate classification and furthermore present OSs and simulators
for ICN-IoT. We also provide important research challenges and issues faced by
ICN for IoTs.

 <dc:title>DocEmul: a Toolkit to Generate Structured Historical Documents</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Capobianco, Samuele</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Marinai, Simone</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a toolkit to generate structured synthetic documents emulating the
actual document production process. Synthetic documents can be used to train
systems to perform document analysis tasks. In our case we address the record
counting task on handwritten structured collections containing a limited number
of examples. Using the DocEmul toolkit we can generate a larger dataset to
train a deep architecture to predict the number of records for each page. The
toolkit is able to generate synthetic collections and also perform data
augmentation to create a larger trainable dataset. It includes one method to
extract the page background from real pages which can be used as a substrate
where records can be written on the basis of variable structures and using
cursive fonts. Moreover, it is possible to extend the synthetic collection by
adding random noise, page rotations, and other visual variations. We performed
some experiments on two different handwritten collections using the toolkit to
generate synthetic data to train a Convolutional Neural Network able to count
the number of records in the real collections.

 <dc:title>MoNoise: Modeling Noise Using a Modular Normalization System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van der Goot, Rob</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and
efficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is
the task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical
domain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed
model is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is
responsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important
generation modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings
module. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup
list can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to
rank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of
normaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the
generation modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an
important source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the
state-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,
which all define the task of normalization slightly different.

 <dc:description>  The paper reports on some results concerning Aqvist's dyadic logic known as
system G, which is one of the most influential logics for reasoning with dyadic
obligations (&quot;it ought to be the case that ... if it is the case that ...&quot;).
Although this logic has been known in the literature for a while, many of its
properties still await in-depth consideration. In this short paper we show:
that any formula in system G including nested modal operators is equivalent to
some formula with no nesting; that the universal modality introduced by Aqvist
in the first presentation of the system is definable in terms of the deontic
modality.

 <dc:description>  Two emerging architectural paradigms, i.e., Software Defined Networking (SDN)
and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), enable the deployment and management
of Service Function Chains (SFCs). A SFC is an ordered sequence of abstract
Service Functions (SFs), e.g., firewalls, VPN-gateways,traffic monitors, that
packets have to traverse in the route from source to destination. While this
appealing solution offers significant advantages in terms of flexibility, it
also introduces new challenges such as the correct configuration and ordering
of SFs in the chain to satisfy overall security requirements. This paper
presents a formal model conceived to enable the verification of correct policy
enforcements in SFCs. Software tools based on the model can then be designed to
cope with unwanted network behaviors (e.g., security flaws) deriving from
incorrect interactions of SFs in the same SFC.

 <dc:description>  Dropout is a simple yet effective algorithm for regularizing neural networks
by randomly dropping out units through Bernoulli multiplicative noise, and for
some restricted problem classes, such as linear or logistic regression, several
theoretical studies have demonstrated the equivalence between dropout and a
fully deterministic optimization problem with data-dependent Tikhonov
regularization. This work presents a theoretical analysis of dropout for matrix
factorization, where Bernoulli random variables are used to drop a factor,
thereby attempting to control the size of the factorization. While recent work
has demonstrated the empirical effectiveness of dropout for matrix
factorization, a theoretical understanding of the regularization properties of
dropout in this context remains elusive. This work demonstrates the equivalence
between dropout and a fully deterministic model for matrix factorization in
which the factors are regularized by the sum of the product of the norms of the
columns. While the resulting regularizer is closely related to a variational
form of the nuclear norm, suggesting that dropout may limit the size of the
factorization, we show that it is possible to trivially lower the objective
value by doubling the size of the factorization. We show that this problem is
caused by the use of a fixed dropout rate, which motivates the use of a rate
that increases with the size of the factorization. Synthetic experiments
validate our theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  Access control (AC) is the core of every architectural solution for
information security. Indeed, no effective protection scheme can abstract from
the careful design of access control policies, and infrastructures underlying
modern Industrial Networked Systems (INSs) are not exceptions from this point
of view. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for INS access control.
The proposed approach enables the description of both positive and negative AC
policies, by applying the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) paradigm to typical
INS implementations, while taking into account different levels of abstraction.
Suitable techniques are adopted to check whether or not policies are correctly
implemented in the system (verification). When conflicts are detected, possible
(re)assignments of credentials to the system users are automatically computed,
that can be adopted to correct anomalies (conflict resolution).

 <dc:description>  Most speech and language technologies are trained with massive amounts of
speech and text information. However, most of the world languages do not have
such resources or stable orthography. Systems constructed under these almost
zero resource conditions are not only promising for speech technology but also
for computational language documentation. The goal of computational language
documentation is to help field linguists to (semi-)automatically analyze and
annotate audio recordings of endangered and unwritten languages. Example tasks
are automatic phoneme discovery or lexicon discovery from the speech signal.
This paper presents a speech corpus collected during a realistic language
documentation process. It is made up of 5k speech utterances in Mboshi (Bantu
C25) aligned to French text translations. Speech transcriptions are also made
available: they correspond to a non-standard graphemic form close to the
language phonology. We present how the data was collected, cleaned and
processed and we illustrate its use through a zero-resource task: spoken term
discovery. The dataset is made available to the community for reproducible
computational language documentation experiments and their evaluation.

 <dc:description>  We apply the reduced Google matrix method to analyse interactions between 95
terrorist groups and determine their relationships and influence on 64 world
countries. This is done on the basis of the Google matrix of the English
Wikipedia (2017) composed of 5416537 articles which accumulate a great part of
global human knowledge. The reduced Google matrix takes into account the direct
and hidden links between a selection of 159 nodes (articles) appearing due to
all paths of a random surfer moving over the whole network. As a result we
obtain the network structure of terrorist groups and their relations with
selected countries. Using the sensitivity of PageRank to a weight variation of
specific links we determine the geopolitical sensitivity and influence of
specific terrorist groups on world countries. We argue that this approach can
find useful application for more extensive and detailed data bases analysis.

 <dc:description>  The robustness of complex networks under targeted attacks is deeply connected
to the resilience of complex systems, i.e., the ability to make appropriate
responses to the attacks. In this article, we investigated the state-of-the-art
targeted node attack algorithms and demonstrate that they become very
inefficient when the cost of the attack is taken into consideration. In this
paper, we made explicit assumption that the cost of removing a node is
proportional to the number of adjacent links that are removed, i.e., higher
degree nodes have higher cost. Finally, for the case when it is possible to
attack links, we propose a simple and efficient edge removal strategy named
Hierarchical Power Iterative Normalized cut (HPI-Ncut).The results on real and
artificial networks show that the HPI-Ncut algorithm outperforms all the node
removal and link removal attack algorithms when the cost of the attack is taken
into consideration. In addition, we show that on sparse networks, the
complexity of this hierarchical power iteration edge removal algorithm is only
$O(n\log^{2+\epsilon}(n))$.

immersive media with point cloud compression (PCC) as one key corner stone. In
this work, we introduce a new binary tree based point cloud content partition
and explore the graph signal processing tools, especially the graph transform
with optimized Laplacian sparsity, to achieve better energy compaction and
compression efficiency. The resulting rate-distortion operating points are
convex-hull optimized over the existing Lagrangian solutions. Simulation
results with the latest high quality point cloud content captured from the MPEG
PCC demonstrated the transform efficiency and rate-distortion (R-D) optimal
potential of the proposed solutions.

 <dc:description>  Despite the significant progress made in the last years, state-of-the-art
speech recognition technologies provide a satisfactory performance only in the
close-talking condition. Robustness of distant speech recognition in adverse
acoustic conditions, on the other hand, remains a crucial open issue for future
applications of human-machine interaction. To this end, several advances in
speech enhancement, acoustic scene analysis as well as acoustic modeling, have
recently contributed to improve the state-of-the-art in the field. One of the
most effective approaches to derive a robust acoustic modeling is based on
using contaminated speech, which proved helpful in reducing the acoustic
mismatch between training and testing conditions.
  In this paper, we revise this classical approach in the context of modern
DNN-HMM systems, and propose the adoption of three methods, namely, asymmetric
context windowing, close-talk based supervision, and close-talk based
pre-training. The experimental results, obtained using both real and simulated
data, show a significant advantage in using these three methods, overall
providing a 15% error rate reduction compared to the baseline systems. The same
trend in performance is confirmed either using a high-quality training set of
small size, and a large one.

 <dc:description>  The timely provision of traffic sign information to drivers is essential for
the drivers to respond, to ensure safe driving, and to avoid traffic accidents
in a timely manner. We proposed a timely visual recognizability quantitative
evaluation method for traffic signs in large-scale transportation environments.
To achieve this goal, we first address the concept of a visibility field to
reflect the visible distribution of three-dimensional (3D) space and construct
a traffic sign Visibility Evaluation Model (VEM) to measure the traffic sign
visibility for a given viewpoint. Then, based on the VEM, we proposed the
concept of the Visual Recognizability Field (VRF) to reflect the visual
recognizability distribution in 3D space and established a Visual
Recognizability Evaluation Model (VREM) to measure a traffic sign visual
recognizability for a given viewpoint. Next, we proposed a Traffic Sign Timely
Visual Recognizability Evaluation Model (TSTVREM) by combining VREM, the actual
maximum continuous visual recognizable distance, and traffic big data to
measure a traffic sign visual recognizability in different lanes. Finally, we
presented an automatic algorithm to implement the TSTVREM model through traffic
sign and road marking detection and classification, traffic sign environment
point cloud segmentation, viewpoints calculation, and TSTVREM model
realization. The performance of our method for traffic sign timely visual
recognizability evaluation is tested on three road point clouds acquired by a
mobile laser scanning system (RIEGL VMX-450) according to Road Traffic Signs
and Markings (GB 5768-1999 in China), showing that our method is feasible and
efficient.

 <dc:description>  Web browsing is an activity that billions of mobile users perform on a daily
basis. Battery life is a primary concern to many mobile users who often find
their phone has died at most inconvenient times. The heterogeneous multi-core
architecture is a solution for energy-efficient processing. However, the
current mobile web browsers rely on the operating system to exploit the
underlying hardware, which has no knowledge of individual web contents and
often leads to poor energy efficiency. This paper describes an automatic
approach to render mobile web workloads for performance and energy efficiency.
It achieves this by developing a machine learning based approach to predict
which processor to use to run the web rendering engine and at what frequencies
the processors should operate. Our predictor learns offline from a set of
training web workloads. The built predictor is then integrated into the browser
to predict the optimal processor configuration at runtime, taking into account
the web workload characteristics and the optimisation goal: whether it is load
time, energy consumption or a trade-off between them. We evaluate our approach
on a representative ARM big.LITTLE mobile architecture using the hottest 500
webpages. Our approach achieves 80% of the performance delivered by an ideal
predictor. We obtain, on average, 45%, 63.5% and 81% improvement respectively
for load time, energy consumption and the energy delay product, when compared
to the Linux heterogeneous multi-processing scheduler.

 <dc:description>  The goal of this paper is to advance an extensible theory of living systems
using an approach to biomathematics and biocomputation that suitably addresses
self-organized, self-referential and anticipatory systems with multi-temporal
multi-agents. Our first step is to provide foundations for modelling of
emergent and evolving dynamic multi-level organic complexes and their
sustentative processes in artificial and natural life systems. Main
applications are in life sciences, medicine, ecology and astrobiology, as well
as robotics, industrial automation and man-machine interface. Since 2011 over
100 scientists from a number of disciplines have been exploring a substantial
set of theoretical frameworks for a comprehensive theory of life known as
Integral Biomathics. That effort identified the need for a robust core model of
organisms as dynamic wholes, using advanced and adequately computable
mathematics. The work described here for that core combines the advantages of a
situation and context aware multivalent computational logic for active
self-organizing networks, Wandering Logic Intelligence (WLI), and a multi-scale
dynamic category theory, Memory Evolutive Systems (MES), hence WLIMES. This is
presented to the modeller via a formal augmented reality language as a first
step towards practical modelling and simulation of multi-level living systems.
Initial work focuses on the design and implementation of this visual language
and calculus (VLC) and its graphical user interface. The results will be
integrated within the current methodology and practices of theoretical biology
and (personalized) medicine to deepen and to enhance the holistic understanding
of life.

 <dc:title>A Multi-Objective DIRECT Algorithm Towards Structural Damage
  Identification with Limited Dynamic Response Information</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A major challenge in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is to accurately
identify both the location and severity of damage using the dynamic response
information acquired. While in theory the vibration-based and impedance-based
methods may facilitate damage identification with the assistance of a credible
baseline finite element model since the changes of stationary wave responses
are used in these methods, the response information is generally limited and
the measurements may be heterogeneous, making an inverse analysis using
sensitivity matrix difficult. Aiming at fundamental advancement, in this
research we cast the damage identification problem into an optimization problem
where possible changes of finite element properties due to damage occurrence
are treated as unknowns. We employ the multiple damage location assurance
criterion (MDLAC), which characterizes the relation between measurements and
predictions (under sampled elemental property changes), as the vector-form
objective function. We then develop an enhanced, multi-objective version of the
DIRECT approach to solve the optimization problem. The underlying idea of the
multi-objective DIRECT approach is to branch and bound the unknown parametric
space to converge to a set of optimal solutions. A new sampling scheme is
established, which significantly increases the efficiency in minimizing the
error between measurements and predictions. The enhanced DIRECT algorithm is
particularly suitable to solving for unknowns that are sparse, as in practical
situations structural damage affect only a small number of finite elements. A
number of test cases using vibration response information are executed to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.

 <dc:title>Meta Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Maximum Reward Sharing for Human

 <dc:creator>Li, Kun</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Burdick, Joel W.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work handles the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem where only
a small number of demonstrations are available from a demonstrator for each
high-dimensional task, insufficient to estimate an accurate reward function.
Observing that each demonstrator has an inherent reward for each state and the
task-specific behaviors mainly depend on a small number of key states, we
propose a meta IRL algorithm that first models the reward function for each
task as a distribution conditioned on a baseline reward function shared by all
tasks and dependent only on the demonstrator, and then finds the most likely
reward function in the distribution that explains the task-specific behaviors.
We test the method in a simulated environment on path planning tasks with
limited demonstrations, and show that the accuracy of the learned reward
function is significantly improved. We also apply the method to analyze the
motion of a patient under rehabilitation.

 <dc:description>  Proportional - Integral - Derivative (PID) Controller is a primary component
in industrial control systems nowadays. Its gain parameters have a powerful
effect on its transient response criteria such as integral squared error (ISE),
settling time, rise time and overshooting. Tuning gain parameters of PID to
reach the optimal transient response of control systems is a hard problem. The
standard method is Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) method that initially computes the
values of the parameters which produce reasonable response but can be enhanced.
In this paper Egyptian Vulture Optimization Algorithm (EVOA) is used to tune
the parameters of PID controller by minimizing the ISE function more than that
using ZN. The results show that using EVOA enhanced the performance of the
controller response better than ZN method when implemented to liquid level
control system. The ISE was reduced from 32 to 8.9 and the settling time from
189 to 81 second.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the online learning algorithm without explicit
regularization terms. This algorithm is essentially a stochastic gradient
descent scheme in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The polynomially
decaying step size in each iteration can play a role of regularization to
ensure the generalization ability of online learning algorithm. We develop a
novel capacity dependent analysis on the performance of the last iterate of
online learning algorithm. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First,
our nice analysis can lead to the convergence rate in the standard mean square
distance which is the best so far. Second, we establish, for the first time,
the strong convergence of the last iterate with polynomially decaying step
sizes in the RKHS norm. We demonstrate that the theoretical analysis
established in this paper fully exploits the fine structure of the underlying
RKHS, and thus can lead to sharp error estimates of online learning algorithm.

 <dc:description>  How can we find patterns and anomalies in a tensor, or multi-dimensional
array, in an efficient and directly interpretable way? How can we do this in an
online environment, where a new tensor arrives each time step? Finding patterns
and anomalies in a tensor is a crucial problem with many applications,
including building safety monitoring, patient health monitoring, cyber
security, terrorist detection, and fake user detection in social networks.
Standard PARAFAC and Tucker decomposition results are not directly
interpretable. Although a few sampling-based methods have previously been
proposed towards better interpretability, they need to be made faster, more
memory efficient, and more accurate.
  In this paper, we propose CTD, a fast, accurate, and directly interpretable
tensor decomposition method based on sampling. CTD-S, the static version of
CTD, provably guarantees a high accuracy that is 17 ~ 83x more accurate than
that of the state-of-the-art method. Also, CTD-S is made 5 ~ 86x faster, and 7
~ 12x more memory-efficient than the state-of-the-art method by removing
redundancy. CTD-D, the dynamic version of CTD, is the first interpretable
dynamic tensor decomposition method ever proposed. Also, it is made 2 ~ 3x
faster than already fast CTD-S by exploiting factors at previous time step and
by reordering operations. With CTD, we demonstrate how the results can be
effectively interpreted in the online distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack detection.

 <dc:description>  Spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes are sparse graph
codes that have recently become of interest due to their capacity-approaching
performance on memoryless binary input channels. In this paper, we unify all
existing SC-LDPC code construction methods under a new generalized description
of SC-LDPC codes based on algebraic lifts of graphs. We present an improved
low-complexity counting method for the special case of $(3,3)$-absorbing sets
for array-based SC-LDPC codes, which we then use to optimize permutation
assignments in SC-LDPC code construction. We show that codes constructed in
this way are able to outperform previously published constructions, in terms of

 <dc:description>  This paper describes wideband (1 GHz) base station diversity and coordinated
multipoint (CoMP)-style large-scale measurements at 73 GHz in an urban
microcell open square scenario in downtown Brooklyn, New York on the NYU
campus. The measurements consisted of ten random receiver locations at
pedestrian level (1.4 meters) and ten random transmitter locations at lamppost
level (4.0 meters) that provided 36 individual transmitter-receiver (TX-RX)
combinations. For each of the 36 radio links, extensive directional
measurements were made to give insights into small-cell base station diversity
at millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands. High-gain steerable horn antennas with
7-degree and 15-degree half-power beamwidths (HPBW) were used at the
transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX), respectively. For each TX-RX combination,
the TX antenna was scanned over a 120-degree sector and the RX antenna was
scanned over the entire azimuth plane at the strongest RX elevation plane and
two other elevation planes on both sides of the strongest elevation angle,
separated by the 15-degree HPBW. Directional and omnidirectional path loss
models were derived and match well with the literature. Signal reception
probabilities derived from the measurements for one to five base stations that
served a single RX location show significant coverage improvement over all
potential beamformed RX antenna pointing angles. CDFs for nearest neighbor and
Best-N omnidirectional path loss and cell outage probabilities for directional
antennas provide insights into coverage and interference for future mmWave
small-cells that will exploit macro-diversity and CoMP.

 <dc:description>  The detection of landmarks or patterns is of interest for extracting features
in biological images. Hence, algorithms for finding these keypoints have been
extensively investigated in the literature, and their localization and
detection properties are well known. In this paper, we study the complementary
topic of local orientation estimation, which has not received similar
attention. Simply stated, the problem that we address is the following:
estimate the angle of rotation of a pattern with steerable filters centered at
the same location, where the image is corrupted by colored isotropic Gaussian
noise. For this problem, we use a statistical framework based on the
Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) that sets a fundamental limit on the accuracy
of the corresponding class of estimators. We propose a scheme to measure the
performance of estimators based on steerable filters (as a lower bound), while
considering the connection to maximum likelihood estimation. Beyond the general
results, we analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the lower bound in terms of the
order of steerablility and propose an optimal subset of components that
minimizes the bound. We define a mechanism for selecting optimal subspaces of
the span of the detectors. These are characterized by the most relevant angular
frequencies. Finally, we project our template to a basis of steerable functions
and experimentally show that the prediction accuracy achieves the predicted
CRLB. As an extension, we also consider steerable wavelet detectors.

 <dc:description>  XGBoost is often presented as the algorithm that wins every ML competition.
Surprisingly, this is true even though predictions are piecewise constant. This
might be justified in high dimensional input spaces, but when the number of
features is low, a piecewise linear model is likely to perform better. XGBoost
was extended into LinXGBoost that stores at each leaf a linear model. This
extension, equivalent to piecewise regularized least-squares, is particularly
attractive for regression of functions that exhibits jumps or discontinuities.
Those functions are notoriously hard to regress. Our extension is compared to
the vanilla XGBoost and Random Forest in experiments on both synthetic and
real-world data sets.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication has attracted increasing attention as
a promising technology for 5G networks. One of the key architectural features
of mmWave is the use of massive antenna arrays at both the transmitter and the
receiver sides. Therefore, by employing directional beamforming (BF), both
mmWave base stations (MBSs) and mmWave users (MUEs) are capable of supporting
multi-beam simultaneous transmissions. However, most researches have only
considered a single beam, which means that they do not make full potential of
mmWave. In this context, in order to improve the performance of short-range
indoor mmWave networks with multiple reflections, we investigate the challenges
and potential solutions of downlink multi-user multi-beam transmission, which
can be described as a high-dimensional (i.e., beamspace) multi-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) technique, including multi-user BF
training, simultaneous users' grouping, and multi-user multibeam power
allocation. Furthermore, we present the theoretical and numerical results to
demonstrate that beamspace MU-MIMO compared with single beam transmission can
largely improve the rate performance of mmWave systems.

 <dc:description>  Ability to continuously learn and adapt from limited experience in
nonstationary environments is an important milestone on the path towards
general intelligence. In this paper, we cast the problem of continuous
adaptation into the learning-to-learn framework. We develop a simple
gradient-based meta-learning algorithm suitable for adaptation in dynamically
changing and adversarial scenarios. Additionally, we design a new multi-agent
competitive environment, RoboSumo, and define iterated adaptation games for
testing various aspects of continuous adaptation strategies. We demonstrate
that meta-learning enables significantly more efficient adaptation than
reactive baselines in the few-shot regime. Our experiments with a population of
agents that learn and compete suggest that meta-learners are the fittest.

 <dc:title>Optimized Frameless ALOHA for Cooperative Base Stations with Overlapped

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of cooperative multi-access in the presence of
overlapped coverage areas. Assuming a frameless ALOHA transmission scheme, we
derive exact analytical expressions for the throughput in the aforementioned
scenarios as a function of the frame length of the system and for arbitrary
target degrees. In possession of these original expressions, we then formulate
a utility function whose maximization (obtained, e.g., through genetic
algorithms) yields unequal and optimum target degrees to be employed by the
users of each group in order to maximize the peak-throughput of the whole
system, while satisfying a given prescribed outage. The comparison of the
resulting cooperative multiple base station (BS) multi-access scheme against
optimized single-BS frameless ALOHA systems - which presume the perfect
isolation of users at each BS and an equal optimum target degree for all users
- indicates a significant gain in overall throughput, revealing that a
&quot;multi-access diversity gain&quot; can be reaped by allowing groups of users from
different BSs to overlap. Numerical results verify that the proposed frameless
ALOHA with the optimized target degrees outperforms a state-of-the-art multiple
BS random access scheme.

 <dc:description>  Quantitative games, where quantitative objectives are defined on weighted
game arenas, provide natural tools for designing faithful models of embedded
controllers. Instances of these games that recently gained interest are the so
called Energy Games. The fast-known algorithm solves Energy Games in O(EVW)
where W is the maximum weight. Starting from a sequential baseline
implementation, we investigate the use of massively data computation
capabilities supported by modern Graphics Processing Units to solve the
`initial credit problem' for Energy Games. We present four different parallel
implementations on multi-core CPU and GPU systems. Our solution outperforms the
baseline implementation by up to 36x speedup and obtains a faster convergence
time on real-world graphs.

 <dc:description>  The next generation of many-core enabled large-scale computing systems relies
on thousands of billions of heterogeneous processing cores connected to form a
single computing unit. In such large-scale computing environments, resource
management is one of the most challenging, and complex issues for efficient
resource sharing and utilization, particularly as we move toward Future
ManyCore Systems (FMCS). This work proposes a novel resource management scheme
for future peta-scale many-core-enabled computing systems, based on hybrid
adaptive resource discovery, called ElCore. The proposed architecture contains
a set of modules which will dynamically be instantiated on the nodes in the
distributed system on demand. Our approach provides flexibility to allocate the
required set of resources for various types of processes/applications. It can
also be considered as a generic solution (with respect to the general
requirements of large scale computing environments) which brings a set of
interesting features (such as auto-scaling, multitenancy, multi-dimensional
mapping, etc,.) to facilitate its easy adaptation to any distributed technology
(such as SOA, Grid and HPC many-core). The achieved evaluation results assured
the significant scalability and the high quality resource mapping of the
proposed resource discovery and management over highly heterogeneous,
hierarchical and dynamic computing environments with respect to several
scalability and efficiency aspects while supporting flexible and complex
queries with guaranteed discovery results accuracy. The simulation results
prove that, using our approach, the mapping between processes and resources can
be done with high level of accuracy which potentially leads to a significant
enhancement in the overall system performance.

 <dc:description>  Smartwatches enable many novel applications and are fast gaining popularity.
However, the presence of a diverse set of on-board sensors provides an
additional attack surface to malicious software and services on these devices.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of key press inference attacks on
handheld numeric touchpads by using smartwatch motion sensors as a
side-channel. We consider different typing scenarios, and propose multiple
attack approaches to exploit the characteristics of the observed wrist
movements for inferring individual key presses. Experimental evaluation using
commercial off-the-shelf smartwatches and smartphones show that key press
inference using smartwatch motion sensors is not only fairly accurate, but also
comparable with similar attacks using smartphone motion sensors. Additionally,
hand movements captured by a combination of both smartwatch and smartphone
motion sensors yields better inference accuracy than either device considered
individually.

 <dc:description>  Structured reversible flowchart languages is a class of imperative reversible
programming languages allowing for a simple diagrammatic representation of
control flow built from a limited set of control flow structures. This class
includes the reversible programming language Janus (without recursion), as well
as more recently developed reversible programming languages such as R-CORE and
R-WHILE. In the present paper, we develop a categorical foundation for this
class of languages based on inverse categories with joins. We generalize the
notion of extensivity of restriction categories to one that may be accommodated
by inverse categories, and use the resulting decision maps to give a reversible
representation of predicates and assertions. This leads to a categorical
semantics for structured reversible flowcharts, which we show to be both sound,
adequate, and fully abstract with respect to the operational semantics under
certain conditions.

 <dc:description>  We perform an average case analysis of the generalization dynamics of large
neural networks trained using gradient descent. We study the
practically-relevant &quot;high-dimensional&quot; regime where the number of free
parameters in the network is on the order of or even larger than the number of
examples in the dataset. Using random matrix theory and exact solutions in
linear models, we derive the generalization error and training error dynamics
of learning and analyze how they depend on the dimensionality of data and
signal to noise ratio of the learning problem. We find that the dynamics of
gradient descent learning naturally protect against overtraining and
overfitting in large networks. Overtraining is worst at intermediate network
sizes, when the effective number of free parameters equals the number of
samples, and thus can be reduced by making a network smaller or larger.
Additionally, in the high-dimensional regime, low generalization error requires
starting with small initial weights. We then turn to non-linear neural
networks, and show that making networks very large does not harm their
generalization performance. On the contrary, it can in fact reduce
overtraining, even without early stopping or regularization of any sort. We
identify two novel phenomena underlying this behavior in overcomplete models:
first, there is a frozen subspace of the weights in which no learning occurs
under gradient descent; and second, the statistical properties of the
high-dimensional regime yield better-conditioned input correlations which
protect against overtraining. We demonstrate that naive application of
worst-case theories such as Rademacher complexity are inaccurate in predicting
the generalization performance of deep neural networks, and derive an
alternative bound which incorporates the frozen subspace and conditioning
effects and qualitatively matches the behavior observed in simulation.

 <dc:description>  In this work we introduce the concept of an Underestimate Sequence (UES),
which is a natural extension of Nesterov's estimate sequence. Our definition of
a UES utilizes three sequences, one of which is a lower bound (or
under-estimator) of the objective function. The question of how to construct an
appropriate sequence of lower bounds is also addressed, and we present lower
bounds for strongly convex smooth functions and for strongly convex composite
functions, which adhere to the UES framework. Further, we propose several first
order methods for minimizing strongly convex functions in both the smooth and
composite cases. The algorithms, based on efficiently updating lower bounds on
the objective functions, have natural stopping conditions, which provides the
user with a certificate of optimality. Convergence of all algorithms is
guaranteed through the UES framework, and we show that all presented algorithms
converge linearly, with the accelerated variants enjoying the optimal linear
rate of convergence.

 <dc:description>  Wireless access points on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are being
considered for mobile service provisioning in commercial networks. To be able
to efficiently use these devices in cellular networks it is necessary to first
have a qualitative and quantitative understanding of how their design
parameters reflect on the service quality experienced by the end user. In this
paper we model a network of UAVs operating at a certain height above ground to
provide wireless service within coverage areas shaped by their directional
antennas, with the UAVs using the existing terrestrial base station network for
wireless backhaul. We provide an analytical expression for the coverage
probability experienced by a typical user as a function of the UAV parameters.
Using our derivations we demonstrate the existence of an optimum UAV height
which maximises the end user coverage probability. We then explore a scenario
where the UAVs adjust their individual heights to meet their backhaul
requirements while at the same time attempting to maximise the coverage
probability of the end user on the ground.

 <dc:title>Representations and evaluation strategies for feasibly approximable

 <dc:description>  A famous result due to Ko and Friedman (1982) asserts that the problems of
integration and maximisation of a univariate real function are computationally
hard in a well-defined sense. Yet, both functionals are routinely computed at
great speed in practice. We aim to resolve this apparent paradox by studying
classes of functions which can be feasibly integrated and maximised, together
with representations for these classes of functions which encode the
information which is necessary to uniformly compute integral and maximum in
polynomial time. The theoretical framework for this is the second-order
complexity theory for operators in analysis which was recently introduced by
Kawamura and Cook (2012). The representations we study are based on rigorous
approximation by polynomials, piecewise polynomials, and rational functions. We
compare these representations with respect to polytime reducibility as well as
with respect to their ability to quickly evaluate symbolic expressions in a
given language. We show that the representation based on rigorous approximation
by piecewise polynomials is polytime equivalent to the representation based on
rigorous approximation by rational functions. With this representation, all
terms in a certain language, which is expressive enough to contain the maximum
and integral of most functions of practical interest, can be evaluated in
polynomial time. By contrast, both the representation based on polynomial
approximation and the standard representation based on function evaluation,
which implicitly underlies the Ko-Friedman result, require exponential time to
evaluate certain terms in this language. We confirm our theoretical results by
an implementation in Haskell, which provides some evidence that second-order
polynomial time computability is similarly closely tied with practical
feasibility as its first-order counterpart.

 <dc:description>  Online social media are information resources that can have a transformative
power in society. While the Web was envisioned as an equalizing force that
allows everyone to access information, the digital divide prevents large
amounts of people from being present online. Online social media in particular
are prone to gender inequality, an important issue given the link between
social media use and employment. Understanding gender inequality in social
media is a challenging task due to the necessity of data sources that can
provide unbiased measurements across multiple countries. Here we show how the
Facebook Gender Divide (FGD), a metric based on a dataset including more than
1.4 Billion users in 217 countries, explains various aspects of worldwide
gender inequality. Our analysis shows that the FGD encodes gender equality
indices in education, health, and economic opportunity. We find network effects
that suggest that using social media has an added value for women. Furthermore,
we find that low values of the FGD precede the approach of countries towards
economic gender equality. Our results suggest that online social networks,
while suffering evident gender imbalance, may lower the barriers that women
have to access informational resources and help to narrow the economic gender
gap.

 <dc:description>  LaSalle invariance principle was originally proposed in the 1950's and has
become a fundamental mathematical tool in the area of dynamical systems and
control. In both theoretical research and engineering practice, discrete-time
dynamical systems have been at least as extensively studied as continuous-time
systems. For example, model predictive control is typically studied in
discrete-time via Lyapunov methods. However, there is a peculiar absence in the
standard literature of standard treatments of Lyapunov functions and LaSalle
invariance principle for discrete-time nonlinear systems. Most of the textbooks
on nonlinear dynamical systems focus only on continuous-time systems. In
Chapter 1 of the book by LaSalle [11], the author establishes the LaSalle
invariance principle for difference equation systems. However, all the useful
lemmas in [11] are given in the form of exercises with no proof provided. In
this document, we provide the proofs of all the lemmas proposed in [11] that
are needed to derive the main theorem on the LaSalle invariance principle for
discrete-time dynamical systems. We organize all the materials in a
self-contained manner. We first introduce some basic concepts and definitions
in Section 1, such as dynamical systems, invariant sets, and limit sets. In
Section 2 we present and prove some useful lemmas on the properties of
invariant sets and limit sets. Finally, we establish the original LaSalle
invariance principle for discrete-time dynamical systems and a simple extension
in Section~3. In Section 4, we provide some references on extensions of LaSalle
invariance principles for further reading. This document is intended for
educational and tutorial purposes and contains lemmas that might be useful as a
reference for researchers.

 <dc:description>  Integer overflows in commodity software are a main source for software bugs,
which can result in exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities and may
eventually contribute to powerful software based exploits, i.e., code reuse
attacks (CRAs).
  In this paper, we present IntGuard , a tool that can repair integer overflows
with high-quality source code repairs. Specifically, given the source code of a
program, IntGuard first discovers the location of an integer overflow error by
using static source code analysis and satisfiability modulo theories (SMT)
solving. IntGuard then generates integer multi-precision code repairs based on
modular manipulation of SMT constraints as well as an extensible set of
customizable code repair patterns.
  We have implemented and evaluated IntGuard with 2052 C programs (approx. 1
Mil. LOC) available in the currently largest open- source test suite for C/C++
programs and with a benchmark containing large and complex programs. The
evaluation results show that IntGuard can precisely (i.e., no false positives
are accidentally repaired), with low computational and runtime overhead repair
programs with very small binary and source code blow-up. In a controlled
experiment, we show that IntGuard is more time-effective and achieves a higher
repair success rate than manually generated code repairs.

 <dc:description>  Backstepping design for boundary linear PDE is formulated as a convex
optimization problem. Some classes of parabolic PDEs and a first-order
hyperbolic PDE are studied, with particular attention to non-strict feedback
structures. Based on the compactness of the Volterra and Fredholm type
operators involved, their Kernels are approximated via polynomial functions.
The resulting Kernel-PDEs are optimized using Sum-of-Squares(SOS) decomposition
and solved via semidefinite programming, with sufficient precision to guarantee
the stability of the system in the L2-norm. The effectiveness and limitations
of the approach proposed are illustrated by numerical solutions of some
Kernel-PDEs.

 <dc:description>  One of the barriers to adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the anxiety
around the limited driving range. Recent proposals have explored charging EVs
on the move, using dynamic wireless charging which enables power exchange
between the vehicle and the grid while the vehicle is moving. In this article,
we focus on the intelligent routing of EVs in need of charging so that they can
make most efficient use of the so-called {\it Mobile Energy Disseminators}
(MEDs) which operates as mobile charging stations. We present a method for
routing EVs around MEDs on the road network, which is based on constraint logic
programming and optimisation using a graph-based shortest path algorithm. The
proposed method exploits Inter-Vehicle (IVC) communications in order to
eco-route electric vehicles. We argue that combining modern communications
between vehicles and state of the art technologies on energy transfer, the
driving range of EVs can be extended without the need for larger batteries or
overtly costly infrastructure. We present extensive simulations in city
conditions that show the driving range and consequently the overall travel time
of electric vehicles is improved with intelligent routing in the presence of
MEDs.

 <dc:title>RLT2-based Parallel Algorithms for Solving Large Quadratic Assignment
  Problems on Graphics Processing Unit Clusters</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Date, Ketan</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses efficient parallel algorithms for obtaining strong lower
bounds and exact solutions for large instances of the Quadratic Assignment
Problem (QAP). Our parallel architecture is comprised of both multi-core
processors and Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) enabled NVIDIA
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on the Blue Waters Supercomputing Facility at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We propose novel
parallelization of the Lagrangian Dual Ascent algorithm on the GPUs, which is
used for solving a QAP formulation based on Level-2 Refactorization
Linearization Technique (RLT2). The Linear Assignment sub-problems (LAPs) in
this procedure are solved using our accelerated Hungarian algorithm [Date,
Ketan, Rakesh Nagi. 2016. GPU-accelerated Hungarian algorithms for the Linear
Assignment Problem. Parallel Computing 57 52-72]. We embed this accelerated
dual ascent algorithm in a parallel branch-and-bound scheme and conduct
extensive computational experiments on single and multiple GPUs, using problem
instances with up to 42 facilities from the QAPLIB. The experiments suggest
that our GPU-based approach is scalable and it can be used to obtain tight
lower bounds on large QAP instances. Our accelerated branch-and-bound scheme is
able to comfortably solve Nugent and Taillard instances (up to 30 facilities)
from the QAPLIB, using modest number of GPUs.

 <dc:description>  The Ring Learning-With-Errors (RLWE) problem shows great promise for
post-quantum cryptography and homomorphic encryption. We describe a new attack
on the non-dual search RLWE problem with small error widths, using ring
homomorphisms to finite fields and the chi-squared statistical test. In
particular, we identify a &quot;subfield vulnerability&quot; (Section 5.2) and give a new
attack which finds this vulnerability by mapping to a finite field extension
and detecting non-uniformity with respect to the number of elements in the
subfield. We use this attack to give examples of vulnerable RLWE instances in
Galois number fields. We also extend the well-known search-to-decision
reduction result to Galois fields with any unramified prime modulus q,
regardless of the residue degree f of q, and we use this in our attacks. The
time complexity of our attack is O(nq2f), where n is the degree of K and f is
the residue degree of q in K. We also show an attack on the non-dual (resp.
dual) RLWE problem with narrow error distributions in prime cyclotomic rings
when the modulus is a ramified prime (resp. any integer). We demonstrate the
attacks in practice by finding many vulnerable instances and successfully
attacking them. We include the code for all attacks.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have enabled progress in a wide variety of applications.
Growing the size of the neural network typically results in improved accuracy.
As model sizes grow, the memory and compute requirements for training these
models also increases. We introduce a technique to train deep neural networks
using half precision floating point numbers. In our technique, weights,
activations and gradients are stored in IEEE half-precision format.
Half-precision floating numbers have limited numerical range compared to
single-precision numbers. We propose two techniques to handle this loss of
information. Firstly, we recommend maintaining a single-precision copy of the
weights that accumulates the gradients after each optimizer step. This
single-precision copy is rounded to half-precision format during training.
Secondly, we propose scaling the loss appropriately to handle the loss of
information with half-precision gradients. We demonstrate that this approach
works for a wide variety of models including convolution neural networks,
recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. This technique
works for large scale models with more than 100 million parameters trained on
large datasets. Using this approach, we can reduce the memory consumption of
deep learning models by nearly 2x. In future processors, we can also expect a
significant computation speedup using half-precision hardware units.

 <dc:description>  Attention distributions of the generated translations are a useful bi-product
of attention-based recurrent neural network translation models and can be
treated as soft alignments between the input and output tokens. In this work,
we use attention distributions as a confidence metric for output translations.
We present two strategies of using the attention distributions: filtering out
bad translations from a large back-translated corpus, and selecting the best
translation in a hybrid setup of two different translation systems. While
manual evaluation indicated only a weak correlation between our confidence
score and human judgments, the use-cases showed improvements of up to 2.22 BLEU
points for filtering and 0.99 points for hybrid translation, tested on
English&lt;-&gt;German and English&lt;-&gt;Latvian translation.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning algorithms can train agents that solve problems in
complex, interesting environments. Normally, the complexity of the trained
agent is closely related to the complexity of the environment. This suggests
that a highly capable agent requires a complex environment for training. In
this paper, we point out that a competitive multi-agent environment trained
with self-play can produce behaviors that are far more complex than the
environment itself. We also point out that such environments come with a
natural curriculum, because for any skill level, an environment full of agents
of this level will have the right level of difficulty. This work introduces
several competitive multi-agent environments where agents compete in a 3D world
with simulated physics. The trained agents learn a wide variety of complex and
interesting skills, even though the environment themselves are relatively
simple. The skills include behaviors such as running, blocking, ducking,
tackling, fooling opponents, kicking, and defending using both arms and legs. A
highlight of the learned behaviors can be found here: https://goo.gl/eR7fbX

 <dc:description>  This article expands on research that has been done to develop a recurrent
neural network (RNN) capable of predicting aircraft engine vibrations using
long short-term memory (LSTM) neurons. LSTM RNNs can provide a more
generalizable and robust method for prediction over analytical calculations of
engine vibration, as analytical calculations must be solved iteratively based
on specific empirical engine parameters, making this approach ungeneralizable
across multiple engines. In initial work, multiple LSTM RNN architectures were
proposed, evaluated and compared. This research improves the performance of the
most effective LSTM network design proposed in the previous work by using a
promising neuroevolution method based on ant colony optimization (ACO) to
develop and enhance the LSTM cell structure of the network. A parallelized
version of the ACO neuroevolution algorithm has been developed and the evolved
LSTM RNNs were compared to the previously used fixed topology. The evolved
networks were trained on a large database of flight data records obtained from
an airline containing flights that suffered from excessive vibration. Results
were obtained using MPI (Message Passing Interface) on a high performance
computing (HPC) cluster, evolving 1000 different LSTM cell structures using 168
cores over 4 days. The new evolved LSTM cells showed an improvement of 1.35%,
reducing prediction error from 5.51% to 4.17% when predicting excessive engine
vibrations 10 seconds in the future, while at the same time dramatically
reducing the number of weights from 21,170 to 11,810.

 <dc:description>  Pedestrian safety continues to be a significant concern in urban communities
and pedestrian distraction is emerging as one of the main causes of grave and
fatal accidents involving pedestrians. The advent of sophisticated mobile and
wearable devices, equipped with high-precision on-board sensors capable of
measuring fine-grained user movements and context, provides a tremendous
opportunity for designing effective pedestrian safety systems and applications.
Accurate and efficient recognition of pedestrian distractions in real-time
given the memory, computation and communication limitations of these devices,
however, remains the key technical challenge in the design of such systems.
Earlier research efforts in pedestrian distraction detection using data
available from mobile and wearable devices have primarily focused only on
achieving high detection accuracy, resulting in designs that are either
resource intensive and unsuitable for implementation on mainstream mobile
devices, or computationally slow and not useful for real-time pedestrian safety
applications, or require specialized hardware and less likely to be adopted by
most users. In the quest for a pedestrian safety system that achieves a
favorable balance between computational efficiency, detection accuracy, and
energy consumption, this paper makes the following main contributions: (i)
design of a novel complex activity recognition framework which employs motion
data available from users' mobile and wearable devices and a lightweight
frequency matching approach to accurately and efficiently recognize complex
distraction related activities, and (ii) a comprehensive comparative evaluation
of the proposed framework with well-known complex activity recognition
techniques in the literature with the help of data collected from human subject
pedestrians and prototype implementations on commercially-available mobile and
wearable devices.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for localization and classification of masses in
breast ultrasound (BUS) images. In particular, we simultaneously use a weakly
annotated dataset and a relatively small strongly annotated dataset to train a
convolutional neural network detector. We have experimentally found that mass
detectors trained with small, strongly annotated datasets are easily
overfitted, whereas those trained with large, weakly annotated datasets present
a non-trivial problem. To overcome these problems, we jointly use datasets with
different characteristics in a hybrid manner. Consequently, a sophisticated
weakly and semi-supervised training scenario is introduced with appropriate
training loss selection. Experimental results show that the proposed method
successfully localizes and classifies masses while requiring less effort in
annotation work. The influences of each component in the proposed framework are
also validated by conducting an ablative analysis. Although the proposed method
is intended for masses in BUS images, it can also be applied as a general
framework to train computer-aided detection and diagnosis systems for a wide
variety of image modalities, target organs, and diseases.

 <dc:description>  Providing consistently high wireless capacity is becoming increasingly
important to support the applications required by future digital enterprises.
In this paper, we propose Eigen-direction-aware ZF (EDA-ZF) with partial
coordination among base stations (BSs) and distributed interference suppression
as a practical approach to achieve this objective. We compare our solution with
Zero Forcing (ZF), entailing neither BS coordination or inter-cell interference
mitigation, and Network MIMO (NeMIMO), where full BS coordination enables
centralized inter-cell interference management. We also evaluate the
performance of said schemes for three sub-6 GHz deployments with varying BS
densities -- sparse, intermediate, and dense -- all with fixed total number of
antennas and radiated power. Extensive simulations show that: (i) indoor
massive MIMO implementing the proposed EDA-ZF provides uniformly good rates for
all users; (ii) indoor network densification is detrimental unless full
coordination is implemented; (iii) deploying NeMIMO pays off under strong
outdoor interference, especially for cell-edge users.

 <dc:description>  Body Sensor Network (BSN) is a typical Internet-of-Things (IoT) application
for personalized health care. It consists of economically powered, wireless and
implanted medical monitoring sensor nodes, which are designed to continually
collect the medical information of the target patients. Multichannel is often
used in BSNs to reduce the spectrum competition of the tremendous sensor nodes
and the problem of channel assignment has attracted much research attention.
The health sensing data in BSNs is often required to be delivered to a sink
node (or server) before a certain deadline for real time monitoring or health
emergency alarm. Therefore, deadline is of significant importance for
multichannel allocation and scheduling. The existing works, though designed to
meet the deadline, often overlook the impact of the unreliable wireless links.
As a result, the health sensing data can still be overdue because of the
scheduled lossy links. Besides, potential collisions in the schedules also
incur considerable delay in delivering the sensing data. In this paper, we
propose a novel deadline- driven Link quality Aware Channel Assignment scheme
(LACA), where link quality, deadlines and collisions are jointly considered.
LACA prioritizes links with urgent deadlines and heavy collisions. Besides,
LACA allows the exploition of the spare slots for retransmissions on lossy
links, which can further reduce the retransmission delay. Extensive simulation
experiments show that compared to the existing approaches, LACA can better
utilize the wireless spectrum and achieve higher packet delivery ratio before
the deadline.

 <dc:description>  Computing technology has gotten cheaper and more powerful, allowing users to
have a growing number of personal computing devices at their disposal. While
this trend is beneficial for the user, it also creates a growing management
burden for the user. Each device must be managed independently and users must
repeat the same management tasks on the each device, such as updating software,
changing configurations, backup, and replicating data for availability. To
prevent the management burden from increasing with the number of devices, we
propose that all devices run a single system image called a personal computing
image. Personal computing images export a device-specific user interface on
each device, but provide a consistent view of application and operating state
across all devices. As a result, management tasks can be performed once on any
device and will be automatically propagated to all other devices belonging to
the user. We discuss evolutionary steps that can be taken to achieve personal
computing images for devices and elaborate on challenges that we believe
building such systems will face.

 <dc:title>Hybrid Vector Perturbation Precoding: The Blessing of Approximate

 <dc:creator>Lyu, Shanxiang</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Vector perturbation (VP) precoding is a promising technique for multiuser
communication systems operating in the downlink. In this work, we introduce a
hybrid framework to improve the performance of lattice reduction (LR) aided
(LRA) VP. Firstly, we perform a simple precoding using zero forcing (ZF) or
successive interference cancellation (SIC) based on a reduced lattice basis.
Since the signal space after LR-ZF or LR-SIC precoding can be shown to be
bounded to a small range, then along with sufficient orthogonality of the
lattice basis guaranteed by LR, they collectively pave the way for the
subsequent application of an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, which
further boosts the performance of any suboptimal precoder. Our work shows that
the AMP algorithm in compressed sensing can be beneficial for a lattice
decoding problem whose signal constraint lies in \mathbb{Z} and entries of the
input lattice basis not necessarily being i.i.d. Gaussian. Numerical results
show that the developed hybrid scheme can provide performance enhancement with
negligible increase in the complexity.

 <dc:description>  The recent breakthroughs of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique in
Alpha Go and playing Atari have set a good example in handling large state and
actions spaces of complicated control problems. The DRL technique is comprised
of (i) an offline deep neural network (DNN) construction phase, which derives
the correlation between each state-action pair of the system and its value
function, and (ii) an online deep Q-learning phase, which adaptively derives
the optimal action and updates value estimates. In this paper, we first present
the general DRL framework, which can be widely utilized in many applications
with different optimization objectives. This is followed by the introduction of
three specific applications: the cloud computing resource allocation problem,
the residential smart grid task scheduling problem, and building HVAC system
optimal control problem. The effectiveness of the DRL technique in these three
cyber-physical applications have been validated. Finally, this paper
investigates the stochastic computing-based hardware implementations of the DRL
framework, which consumes a significant improvement in area efficiency and
power consumption compared with binary-based implementation counterparts.

 <dc:description>  The growing proliferation in solar deployment, especially at distribution
level, has made the case for power system operators to develop more accurate
solar forecasting models. This paper proposes a solar photovoltaic (PV)
generation forecasting model based on multi-level solar measurements and
utilizing a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) model to
improve the training and achieve better forecasts. The proposed model consists
of four stages of data preparation, establishment of fitting model, model
training, and forecasting. The model is tested under different weather
conditions. Numerical simulations exhibit the acceptable performance of the
model when compared to forecasting results obtained from two-level and
single-level studies.

 <dc:description>  Steering a car through traffic is a complex task that is difficult to cast
into algorithms. Therefore, researchers turn to training artificial neural
networks from front-facing camera data stream along with the associated
steering angles. Nevertheless, most existing solutions consider only the visual
camera frames as input, thus ignoring the temporal relationship between frames.
In this work, we propose a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent
Neural Network (C-LSTM), that is end-to-end trainable, to learn both visual and
dynamic temporal dependencies of driving. Additionally, We introduce posing the
steering angle regression problem as classification while imposing a spatial
relationship between the output layer neurons. Such method is based on learning
a sinusoidal function that encodes steering angles. To train and validate our
proposed methods, we used the publicly available Comma.ai dataset. Our solution
improved steering root mean square error by 35% over recent methods, and led to
a more stable steering by 87%.

 <dc:description>  Impact of soiling on solar panels is an important and well-studied problem in
renewable energy sector. In this paper, we present a novel approach based on
fully convolutional networks which takes an RGB image of solar panel and
environmental factors (optional) as inputs to predict power loss, soiling
localization, and soiling type. In computer vision, predicting localization is
a complex task which typically requires human labeled data such as bounding
boxes or segmentation masks. Our proposed approach consists of specialized four
stages which completely avoids human labeled localization data and only needs
panel images with power loss for training. The region of impact area obtained
from the localization masks are then classified into soiling types using the
webly supervised learning. For superior localization capabilities of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we introduce a novel bi-directional
input-aware fusion (BiDIAF) block that reinforces the input at different levels
of CNN to learn input-specific feature maps. Our empirical study shows that
BiDIAF improves the power loss prediction accuracy and the localization Jaccard
index of ResNet by about 3% and 4% respectively. Our end-to-end model yields
further improvement of about 24% on localization task when learned in a weakly
supervised manner. Our approach is generalizable and showed promising results
on web crawled solar panel images. Additionally, we collected first of it's
kind dataset for solar panel image analysis consisting 45,000+ images.

 <dc:title>Application of Deep Learning in Neuroradiology: Automated Detection of
  Basal Ganglia Hemorrhage using 2D-Convolutional Neural Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Background: Deep learning techniques have achieved high accuracy in image
classification tasks, and there is interest in applicability to neuroimaging
critical findings. This study evaluates the efficacy of 2D deep convolutional
neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting basal ganglia (BG) hemorrhage on
noncontrast head CT.
  Materials and Methods: 170 unique de-identified HIPAA-compliant noncontrast
head CTs were obtained, those with and without BG hemorrhage. 110 cases were
held-out for test, and 60 were split into training (45) and validation (15),
consisting of 20 right, 20 left, and 20 no BG hemorrhage. Data augmentation was
performed to increase size and variation of the training dataset by 48-fold.
Two DCNNs were used to classify the images-AlexNet and GoogLeNet-using
untrained networks and those pre-trained on ImageNet. Area under the curves
(AUC) for the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated,
using the DeLong method for statistical comparison of ROCs.
  Results: The best performing model was the pre-trained augmented GoogLeNet,
which had an AUC of 1.00 in classification of hemorrhage. Preprocessing
augmentation increased accuracy for all networks (p&lt;0.001), and pretrained
networks outperformed untrained ones (p&lt;0.001) for the unaugmented models. The
best performing GoogLeNet model (AUC 1.00) outperformed the best performing
AlexNet model (AUC 0.95)(p=0.01).
  Conclusion: For this dataset, the best performing DCNN identified BG
hemorrhage on noncontrast head CT with an AUC of 1.00. Pretrained networks and
data augmentation increased classifier accuracy. Future prospective research
would be important to determine if the accuracy can be maintained on a larger
cohort of patients and for very small hemorrhages.

 <dc:description>  Given a sample of bids from independent auctions, this paper examines the
question of inference on auction fundamentals (e.g. valuation distributions,
welfare measures) under weak assumptions on information structure. The question
is important as it allows us to learn about the valuation distribution in a
robust way, i.e., without assuming that a particular information structure
holds across observations. We leverage recent contributions in the robust
mechanism design literature that exploit the link between Bayesian Correlated
Equilibria and Bayesian Nash Equilibria in incomplete information games to
construct an econometrics framework for learning about auction fundamentals
using observed data on bids. We showcase our construction of identified sets in
private value and common value auctions. Our approach for constructing these
sets inherits the computational simplicity of solving for correlated
equilibria: checking whether a particular valuation distribution belongs to the
identified set is as simple as determining whether a linear program is
feasible. A similar linear program can be used to construct the identified set
on various welfare measures and counterfactual objects. For inference and to
summarize statistical uncertainty, we propose novel finite sample methods using
tail inequalities that are used to construct confidence regions on sets. We
also highlight methods based on Bayesian bootstrap and subsampling. A set of
Monte Carlo experiments show adequate finite sample properties of our inference
procedures. We also illustrate our methods using data from OCS auctions.

 <dc:title>A Lambda Calculus for Transfinite Arrays: Unifying Arrays and Streams</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sinkarovs, Artjoms</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Scholz, Sven-Bodo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Array programming languages allow for concise and generic formulations of
numerical algorithms, thereby providing a huge potential for program
optimisation such as fusion, parallelisation, etc. One of the restrictions that
these languages typically have is that the number of elements in every array
has to be finite. This means that implementing streaming algorithms in such
languages requires new types of data structures, with operations that are not
immediately compatible with existing array operations or compiler
optimisations.
  In this paper, we propose a design for a functional language that natively
supports infinite arrays. We use ordinal numbers to introduce the notion of
infinity in shapes and indices. By doing so, we obtain a calculus that
naturally extends existing array calculi and, at the same time, allows for
recursive specifications as they are found in stream- and list-based settings.
Furthermore, the main language construct that can be thought of as an $n$-fold
cons operator gives rise to expressing transfinite recursion in data, something
that lists or streams usually do not support. This makes it possible to treat
the proposed calculus as a unifying theory of arrays, lists and streams. We
give an operational semantics of the proposed language, discuss design choices
that we have made, and demonstrate its expressibility with several examples. We
also demonstrate that the proposed formalism preserves a number of well-known
universal equalities from array/list/stream theories, and discuss
implementation-related challenges.

 <dc:title>The Galactic Dependencies Treebanks: Getting More Data by Synthesizing

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We release Galactic Dependencies 1.0---a large set of synthetic languages not
found on Earth, but annotated in Universal Dependencies format. This new
resource aims to provide training and development data for NLP methods that aim
to adapt to unfamiliar languages. Each synthetic treebank is produced from a
real treebank by stochastically permuting the dependents of nouns and/or verbs
to match the word order of other real languages. We discuss the usefulness,
realism, parsability, perplexity, and diversity of the synthetic languages. As
a simple demonstration of the use of Galactic Dependencies, we consider
single-source transfer, which attempts to parse a real target language using a
parser trained on a &quot;nearby&quot; source language. We find that including synthetic
source languages somewhat increases the diversity of the source pool, which
significantly improves results for most target languages.

 <dc:description>  Scientists often seek simplified representations of complex systems to
facilitate prediction and understanding. If the factors comprising a
representation allow us to make accurate predictions about our system, but
obscuring any subset of the factors destroys our ability to make predictions,
we say that the representation exhibits informational synergy. We argue that
synergy is an undesirable feature in learned representations and that
explicitly minimizing synergy can help disentangle the true factors of
variation underlying data. We explore different ways of quantifying synergy,
deriving new closed-form expressions in some cases, and then show how to modify
learning to produce representations that are minimally synergistic. We
introduce a benchmark task to disentangle separate characters from images of
words. We demonstrate that Minimally Synergistic (MinSyn) representations
correctly disentangle characters while methods relying on statistical
independence fail.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge transfer between tasks can improve the performance of learned
models, but requires an accurate estimate of the inter-task relationships to
identify the relevant knowledge to transfer. These inter-task relationships are
typically estimated based on training data for each task, which is inefficient
in lifelong learning settings where the goal is to learn each consecutive task
rapidly from as little data as possible. To reduce this burden, we develop a
lifelong learning method based on coupled dictionary learning that utilizes
high-level task descriptions to model the inter-task relationships. We show
that using task descriptors improves the performance of the learned task
policies, providing both theoretical justification for the benefit and
empirical demonstration of the improvement across a variety of learning
problems. Given only the descriptor for a new task, the lifelong learner is
also able to accurately predict a model for the new task through zero-shot
learning using the coupled dictionary, eliminating the need to gather training
data before addressing the task.

 <dc:description>  We consider a practical top-k route problem: given a collection of points of
interest (POIs) with rated features and traveling costs between POIs, a user
wants to find k routes from a source to a destination, that maximally match her
needs on feature preferences and can be completed within a travel cost budget.
One challenge is dealing with the personalized diversity requirement where each
user has a different trade-off between quantity (the number of POIs with a
specified feature) and variety (the coverage of specified features). Another
challenge is the large scale of the POI network and the great many alternative
routes to search. We model the personalized diversity requirement by the whole
class of submodular functions, and present an optimal solution to the top-k
route problem through an index structure for retrieving relevant POIs in both
feature and route spaces and various strategies for pruning the search space
using user preferences and constraints. We also present heuristic solutions and
evaluate all the solutions on real life POI network data.

 <dc:title>The power of A/B testing under interference</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the fundamental statistical question: how can you
assess the power of an A/B test when the units in the study are exposed to
interference? This question is germane to many scientific and industrial
practitioners that rely on A/B testing in environments where control over
interference is limited. We begin by proving that interference has a measurable
effect on its sensitivity, or power. We quantify the power of an A/B test of
equality of means as a function of the number of exposed individuals under any
interference mechanism. We further derive a central limit theorem for the
number of exposed individuals under a simple Bernoulli switching interference
mechanism. Based on these results, we develop a strategy to estimate the power
of an A/B test when actors experience interference according to an observed
network model. We demonstrate how to leverage this theory to estimate the power
of an A/B test on units sharing any network relationship, and highlight the
utility of our method on two applications - a Facebook friendship network as
well as a large Twitter follower network. These results yield, for the first
time, the capacity to understand how to design an A/B test to detect, with a
specified confidence, a fixed measurable treatment effect when the A/B test is
conducted under interference driven by networks.

 <dc:description>  Although adverse effects of attacks have been acknowledged in many
cyber-physical systems, there is no system-theoretic comprehension of how a
compromised agent can leverage communication capabilities to maximize the
damage in distributed multi-agent systems. A rigorous analysis of
cyber-physical attacks enables us to increase the system awareness against
attacks and design more resilient control protocols. To this end, we will take
the role of the attacker to identify the worst effects of attacks on root nodes
and non-root nodes in a distributed control system. More specifically, we show
that a stealthy attack on root nodes can mislead the entire network to a wrong
understanding of the situation and even destabilize the synchronization
process. This will be called the internal model principle for the attacker and
will intensify the urgency of designing novel control protocols to mitigate
these types of attacks.

 <dc:description>  While personal cloud storage services such as Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive
and iCloud have become very popular in recent years, these services offer few
security guarantees to users. These cloud services are aimed at end users,
whose applications often assume a local file system storage, and thus require
strongly consistent data. In addition, users usually access these services
using personal computers and portable devices such as phones and tablets, which
are upload bandwidth constrained and in many cases battery powered. Unity is a
system that provides confidentiality, integrity, durability and strong
consistency while minimizing the upload bandwidth of its clients. We find that
Unity consumes minimal upload bandwidth for compute-heavy workload compared to
NFS and Dropbox, while uses similar amount of upload bandwidth for write-heavy
workload relative to NBD. Although read-heavy workload tends to consume more
upload bandwidth with Unity, it is no more than an eighth of the size of blocks
replicated and there is much room for optimization. Moreover, Unity provides
flexibility to maintain multiple DEs to provide scalability for multiple
devices to concurrently access the data with the minimal lease switch cost.

 <dc:description>  We provide a complete picture of asymptotically minimax estimation of
$L_r$-norms (for any $r\ge 1$) of the mean in Gaussian white noise model over
Nikolskii-Besov spaces. In this regard, we complement the work of Lepski,
Nemirovski and Spokoiny (1999), who considered the cases of $r=1$ (with
poly-logarithmic gap between upper and lower bounds) and $r$ even (with
asymptotically sharp upper and lower bounds) over H\&quot;{o}lder spaces. We
additionally consider the case of asymptotically adaptive minimax estimation
and demonstrate a difference between even and non-even $r$ in terms of an
investigator's ability to produce asymptotically adaptive minimax estimators
without paying a penalty.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of planning a collision-free path for a
high-dimensional robot. Specifically, we suggest a planning framework where a
motion-planning algorithm can obtain guidance from a user. In contrast to
existing approaches, we suggest to seek user guidance only when the planner
identifies that it ceases to make significant progress towards the goal. User
guidance is given in the form of an intermediate configuration $\hat{q}$ which,
in turn, is used to bias the planner to go through $\hat{q}$. We demonstrate
our approach for the case where the planning algorithm is Multi-Heuristic A*
(MHA*) and the robot is a 34-DOF humanoid. We show that using this general
approach allows to compute highly-constrained paths such as climbing stairs
with little domain knowledge. Without our approach, solving such problems
require carefully-crafted domain-dependent heuristics.

 <dc:description>  Learning from expert demonstrations has received a lot of attention in
artificial intelligence and machine learning. The goal is to infer the
underlying reward function that an agent is optimizing given a set of
observations of the agent's behavior over time in a variety of circumstances,
the system state trajectories, and a plant model specifying the evolution of
the system state for different agent's actions. The system is often modeled as
a Markov decision process, that is, the next state depends only on the current
state and agent's action, and the the agent's choice of action depends only on
the current state. While the former is a Markovian assumption on the evolution
of system state, the later assumes that the target reward function is itself
Markovian. In this work, we explore learning a class of non-Markovian reward
functions, known in the formal methods literature as specifications. These
specifications offer better composition, transferability, and interpretability.
We then show that inferring the specification can be done efficiently without
unrolling the transition system. We demonstrate on a 2-d grid world example.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We show how to predict the basic word-order facts of a novel language given
only a corpus of part-of-speech (POS) sequences. We predict how often direct
objects follow their verbs, how often adjectives follow their nouns, and in
general the directionalities of all dependency relations. Such typological
properties could be helpful in grammar induction. While such a problem is
usually regarded as unsupervised learning, our innovation is to treat it as
supervised learning, using a large collection of realistic synthetic languages
as training data. The supervised learner must identify surface features of a
language's POS sequence (hand-engineered or neural features) that correlate
with the language's deeper structure (latent trees). In the experiment, we
show: 1) Given a small set of real languages, it helps to add many synthetic
languages to the training data. 2) Our system is robust even when the POS
sequences include noise. 3) Our system on this task outperforms a grammar
induction baseline by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a robust adaptive backstepping-based controller is developed
for positioning the spool valve of Electro-Hydraulic Servo System (EHSS) with
parameter fluctuations. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm is utilized to
drive the parameters of the proposed controller to a good neighbourhood of the
solution space. The optimization problem is formulated such that both the
tracking error and control signal are minimized concurrently. The results show
that the proposed controller guarantees the uniform ultimate boundedness of the
tracking error and control signal. Moreover, illustrative simulations validate
the potentials and robustness of the proposed schemes in the presence of
uncertainties. The proposed controller is also compared with sliding mode
control.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new and unified bit error rates performance analysis
of space-time block codes (STBC) deployed in wireless systems with spatial
diversity in generalized shadowed fading and noise scenarios. Specifically, we
derive a simple and a very accurate approximate expressions for the average
error rates of coherent modulation schemes in generalized $\eta-\mu$ and
$\kappa-\mu$ shadowed fading channels with multiple input multiple output
(MIMO) systems. The noise in the network is assumed to be modeled using the
additive white generalized Gaussian noise (AWGGN), which encompasses the
classical Laplacian and the Gaussian noise environments as special cases. The
derived results obviate the need to re-derive the error rates for MIMO STBC
systems under many multipath fading and noise conditions while avoiding any
special functions with high computational complexity. Published results from
the literature, as well as numerical evaluations, corroborate the accuracy of
our derived generalized expressions.

 <dc:description>  When using security questions most users still trade-off security for the
convenience of memorability. This happens because most users find strong
answers to security questions difficult to remember. Previous research in
security education was successful in motivating users to change their behaviour
towards security issues, through the use of serious games (i.e. games designed
for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment). Hence, in this paper we
evaluate the design of a serious game, to investigate the features and
functionalities that users would find desirable in a game that aims to educate
them to provide strong and memorable answers to security questions. Our
findings reveal that: (1) even for security education games, rewards seem to
motivate users to have a better learning experience; (2) functionalities which
contain a social element (e.g. getting help from other players) do not seem
appropriate for serious games related to security questions, because users fear
that their acquaintances could gain access to their security questions; (3)
even users who do not usually play games would seem to prefer to play security
education games on a mobile device.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method to implement an optical see-through head mounted
display which renders real aerial images with a wide viewing angle, called an
Air Mounted Eyepiece (AME). To achieve the AMD design, we employ an
off-the-shelf head mounted display and Transmissive Mirror Device (TMD) which
is usually used in aerial real imaging systems. In the proposed method, we
replicate the function of the head mounted display (HMD) itself, which is used
in the air by using the TMD and presenting a real image of eyepiece in front of
the eye. Moreover, it can realize a wide viewing angle 3D display by placing a
virtual lens in front of the eye without wearing an HMD. In addition to
enhancing the experience of mixed reality and augmented reality, our proposed
method can be used as a 3D imaging method for use in other applications such as
in automobiles and desktop work. We aim to contribute to the field of
human-computer interaction and the research on eyepiece interfaces by
discussing the advantages and the limitations of this near-eye optical system.

 <dc:description>  End user privacy is a critical concern for all organizations that collect,
process and store user data as a part of their business. Privacy concerned
users, regulatory bodies and privacy experts continuously demand organizations
provide users with privacy protection. Current research lacks an understanding
of organizational characteristics that affect an organization's motivation
towards user privacy. This has resulted in a &quot;one solution fits all&quot; approach,
which is incapable of providing sustainable solutions for organizational issues
related to user privacy. In this work, we have empirically investigated 40
diverse organizations on their motivations and approaches towards user privacy.
Resources such as newspaper articles, privacy policies and internal privacy
reports that display information about organizational motivations and
approaches towards user privacy were used in the study. We could observe
organizations to have two primary motivations to provide end users with privacy
as voluntary driven inherent motivation, and risk driven compliance motivation.
Building up on these findings we developed a taxonomy of organizational privacy
approaches and further explored the taxonomy through limited exclusive
interviews. With his work, we encourage authorities and scholars to understand
organizational characteristics that define an organization's approach towards
privacy, in order to effectively communicate regulations that enforce and
encourage organizations to consider privacy within their business practices.

 <dc:description>  Calculi of string diagrams are increasingly used to present the syntax and
algebraic structure of various families of circuits, including signal flow
graphs, electrical circuits and quantum processes. In many such approaches, the
semantic interpretation for diagrams is given in terms of relations or
corelations (generalised equivalence relations) of some kind. In this paper we
show how semantic categories of both relations and corelations can be
characterised as colimits of simpler categories. This modular perspective is
important as it simplifies the task of giving a complete axiomatisation for
semantic equivalence of string diagrams. Moreover, our general result unifies
various theorems that are independently found in literature and are relevant
for program semantics, quantum computation and control theory.

 <dc:description>  In order to avoid well-know paradoxes associated with self-referential
definitions, higher-order dependent type theories stratify the theory using a
countably infinite hierarchy of universes (also known as sorts), Type$_0$ :
Type$_1$ : $\cdots$ . Such type systems are called cumulative if for any type
$A$ we have that $A$ : Type$_{i}$ implies $A$ : Type$_{i+1}$. The predicative
calculus of inductive constructions (pCIC) which forms the basis of the Coq
proof assistant, is one such system.
  In this paper we present and establish the soundness of the predicative
calculus of cumulative inductive constructions (pCuIC) which extends the
cumulativity relation to inductive types.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes Deep Hyperalignment (DHA) as a regularized, deep
extension, scalable Hyperalignment (HA) method, which is well-suited for
applying functional alignment to fMRI datasets with nonlinearity,
high-dimensionality (broad ROI), and a large number of subjects. Unlink
previous methods, DHA is not limited by a restricted fixed kernel function.
Further, it uses a parametric approach, rank-$m$ Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD), and stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Therefore, DHA has a
suitable time complexity for large datasets, and DHA does not require the
training data when it computes the functional alignment for a new subject.
Experimental studies on multi-subject fMRI analysis confirm that the DHA method
achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art HA algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the concept of community trees that summarizes topological
structures within a network. A community tree is a tree structure representing
clique communities from the clique percolation method (CPM). The community tree
also generates a persistent diagram. Community trees and persistent diagrams
reveal topological structures of the underlying networks and can be used as
visualization tools. We study the stability of community trees and derive a
quantity called the total star number (TSN) that presents an upper bound on the
change of community trees. Our findings provide a topological interpretation
for the stability of communities generated by the CPM.

 <dc:description>  A number of high-level languages and libraries have been proposed that offer
novel and simple to use abstractions for concurrent, asynchronous, and
distributed programming. The execution models that realise them, however, often
change over time---whether to improve performance, or to extend them to new
language features---potentially affecting behavioural and safety properties of
existing programs. This is exemplified by SCOOP, a message-passing approach to
concurrent object-oriented programming that has seen multiple changes proposed
and implemented, with demonstrable consequences for an idiomatic usage of its
core abstraction. We propose a semantics comparison workbench for SCOOP with
fully and semi-automatic tools for analysing and comparing the state spaces of
programs with respect to different execution models or semantics. We
demonstrate its use in checking the consistency of properties across semantics
by applying it to a set of representative programs, and highlighting a
deadlock-related discrepancy between the principal execution models of SCOOP.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the extensibility of the workbench by generalising
the formalisation of an execution model to support recently proposed extensions
for distributed programming. Our workbench is based on a modular and
parameterisable graph transformation semantics implemented in the GROOVE tool.
We discuss how graph transformations are leveraged to atomically model
intricate language abstractions, how the visual yet algebraic nature of the
model can be used to ascertain soundness, and highlight how the approach could
be applied to similar languages.

 <dc:title>Continuous-time DC kernel --- a stable generalized first-order spline
  kernel</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Tianshi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The stable spline (SS) kernel and the diagonal correlated (DC) kernel are two
kernels that have been applied and studied extensively for kernel-based
regularized LTI system identification. In this note, we show that similar to
the derivation of the SS kernel, the continuous-time DC kernel can be derived
by applying the same &quot;stable&quot; coordinate change to a &quot;generalized&quot; first-order
spline kernel, and thus can be interpreted as a stable generalized first-order
spline kernel. This interpretation provides new facets to understand the
properties of the DC kernel. In particular, we derive a new orthonormal basis
expansion of the DC kernel, and the explicit expression of the norm of the RKHS
associated with the DC kernel. Moreover, for the non-uniformly sampled DC
kernel, we derive its maximum entropy property and show that its kernel matrix
has tridiagonal inverse.

 <dc:description>  We present PRM-RL, a hierarchical method for long-range navigation task
completion that combines sampling-based path planning with reinforcement
learning (RL) agents. The RL agents learn short-range, point-to-point
navigation policies that capture robot dynamics and task constraints without
knowledge of the large-scale topology, while the sampling-based planners
provide an approximate map of the space of possible configurations of the robot
from which collision-free trajectories feasible for the RL agents can be
identified. The same RL agents are used to control the robot under the
direction of the planning, enabling long-range navigation. We use the
Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs) for the sampling-based planner. The RL agents are
constructed using feature-based and deep neural net policies in continuous
state and action spaces. We evaluate PRM-RL on two navigation tasks with
non-trivial robot dynamics: end-to-end differential drive indoor navigation in
office environments, and aerial cargo delivery in urban environments with load
displacement constraints. These evaluations included both simulated
environments and on-robot tests. Our results show improvement in navigation
task completion over both RL agents on their own and traditional sampling-based
planners. In the indoor navigation task, PRM-RL successfully completes up to
215 meters long trajectories under noisy sensor conditions, and the aerial
cargo delivery completes flights over 1000 meters without violating the task
constraints in an environment 63 million times larger than used in training.

 <dc:description>  The paper proposes a combination of the subdomain deflation method and local
algebraic multigrid as a scalable distributed memory preconditioner that is
able to solve large linear systems of equations. The implementation of the
algorithm is made available for the community as part of an open source AMGCL
library. The solution targets both homogeneous (CPU-only) and heterogeneous
(CPU/GPU) systems, employing hybrid MPI/OpenMP approach in the former and a
combination of MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA in the latter cases. The use of OpenMP
minimizes the number of MPI processes, thus reducing the communication overhead
of the deflation method and improving both weak and strong scalability of the
preconditioner. The examples of scalar, Poisson-like, systems as well as
non-scalar problems, stemming out of the discretization of the Navier-Stokes
equations, are considered in order to estimate performance of the implemented
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A recently proposed learning algorithm for massive network-structured data
sets (big data over networks) is the network Lasso (nLasso), which extends the
well- known Lasso estimator from sparse models to network-structured datasets.
Efficient implementations of the nLasso have been presented using modern convex
optimization methods. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions on the
network structure and available label information such that nLasso accurately
learns a vector-valued graph signal (representing label information) from the
information provided by the labels of a few data points.

 <dc:description>  Accurate knowledge of object poses is crucial to successful robotic
manipulation tasks, and yet most current approaches only work in laboratory
settings. Noisy sensors and cluttered scenes interfere with accurate pose
recognition, which is problematic especially when performing complex tasks
involving object interactions. This is because most pose estimation algorithms
focus only on estimating objects from a single frame, which means they lack
continuity between frames. Further, they often do not consider resulting
physical properties of the predicted scene such as intersecting objects or
objects in unstable positions. In this work, we enhance the accuracy and
stability of estimated poses for a whole scene by enforcing these physical
constraints over time through the integration of a physics simulation. This
allows us to accurately determine relationships between objects for a
construction task. Scene parsing performance was evaluated on both simulated
and real- world data. We apply our method to a real-world block stacking task,
where the robot must build a tall tower of colored blocks.

 <dc:description>  Population size estimates for hidden and hard-to-reach populations are
particularly important when members are known to suffer from disproportion
health issues or to pose health risks to the larger ambient population in which
they are embedded. Efforts to derive size estimates are often frustrated by a
range of factors that preclude conventional survey strategies, including social
stigma associated with group membership or members' involvement in illegal
activities.
  This paper extends prior research on the problem of network population size
estimation, building on established survey/sampling methodologies commonly used
with hard-to-reach groups. Three novel one-step, network-based population size
estimators are presented, to be used in the context of uniform random sampling,
respondent-driven sampling, and when networks exhibit significant clustering
effects. Provably sufficient conditions for the consistency of these estimators
(in large configuration networks) are given. Simulation experiments across a
wide range of synthetic network topologies validate the performance of the
estimators, which are seen to perform well on a real-world location-based
social networking data set with significant clustering. Finally, the proposed
schemes are extended to allow them to be used in settings where participant
anonymity is required. Systematic experiments show favorable tradeoffs between
anonymity guarantees and estimator performance.
  Taken together, we demonstrate that reasonable population estimates can be
derived from anonymous respondent driven samples of 250-750 individuals, within
ambient populations of 5,000-40,000. The method thus represents a novel and
cost-effective means for health planners and those agencies concerned with
health and disease surveillance to estimate the size of hidden populations.
Limitations and future work are discussed in the concluding section.

 <dc:title>Decision support from financial disclosures with deep neural networks
  and transfer learning</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kraus, Mathias</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Feuerriegel, Stefan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Company disclosures greatly aid in the process of financial decision-making;
therefore, they are consulted by financial investors and automated traders
before exercising ownership in stocks. While humans are usually able to
correctly interpret the content, the same is rarely true of computerized
decision support systems, which struggle with the complexity and ambiguity of
natural language. A possible remedy is represented by deep learning, which
overcomes several shortcomings of traditional methods of text mining. For
instance, recurrent neural networks, such as long short-term memories, employ
hierarchical structures, together with a large number of hidden layers, to
automatically extract features from ordered sequences of words and capture
highly non-linear relationships such as context-dependent meanings. However,
deep learning has only recently started to receive traction, possibly because
its performance is largely untested. Hence, this paper studies the use of deep
neural networks for financial decision support. We additionally experiment with
transfer learning, in which we pre-train the network on a different corpus with
a length of 139.1 million words. Our results reveal a higher directional
accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning when predicting stock
price movements in response to financial disclosures. Our work thereby helps to
highlight the business value of deep learning and provides recommendations to
practitioners and executives.

 <dc:description>  Recent approaches for high accuracy detection and tracking of object
categories in video consist of complex multistage solutions that become more
cumbersome each year. In this paper we propose a ConvNet architecture that
jointly performs detection and tracking, solving the task in a simple and
effective way. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we set up a ConvNet
architecture for simultaneous detection and tracking, using a multi-task
objective for frame-based object detection and across-frame track regression;
(ii) we introduce correlation features that represent object co-occurrences
across time to aid the ConvNet during tracking; and (iii) we link the frame
level detections based on our across-frame tracklets to produce high accuracy
detections at the video level. Our ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal
object detection is evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset where it
achieves state-of-the-art results. Our approach provides better single model
performance than the winning method of the last ImageNet challenge while being
conceptually much simpler. Finally, we show that by increasing the temporal
stride we can dramatically increase the tracker speed.

 <dc:description>  Standing at the paradigm shift towards data-intensive science, machine
learning techniques are becoming increasingly important. In particular, as a
major breakthrough in the field, deep learning has proven as an extremely
powerful tool in many fields. Shall we embrace deep learning as the key to all?
Or, should we resist a 'black-box' solution? There are controversial opinions
in the remote sensing community. In this article, we analyze the challenges of
using deep learning for remote sensing data analysis, review the recent
advances, and provide resources to make deep learning in remote sensing
ridiculously simple to start with. More importantly, we advocate remote sensing
scientists to bring their expertise into deep learning, and use it as an
implicit general model to tackle unprecedented large-scale influential
challenges, such as climate change and urbanization.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study an experimentally-observed connection between two
seemingly unrelated processes, one from computational geometry and the other
from differential geometry. The first one (which we call &quot;grid peeling&quot;) is the
convex-layer decomposition of subsets $G\subset \mathbb Z^2$ of the integer
grid, previously studied for the particular case $G=\{1,\ldots,m\}^2$ by
Har-Peled and Lidick\'y (2013). The second one is the affine curve-shortening
flow (ACSF), first studied by Alvarez et al. (1993) and Sapiro and Tannenbaum
(1993). We present empirical evidence that, in a certain well-defined sense,
grid peeling behaves at the limit like ACSF on convex curves. We offer some
theoretical arguments in favor of this conjecture.
  We also pay closer attention to the simple case where $G=\mathbb N^2$ is a
quarter-infinite grid. This case corresponds to ACSF starting with an infinite
L-shaped curve, which when transformed using the ACSF becomes a hyperbola for
all times $t&gt;0$. We prove that, in the grid peeling of $\mathbb N^2$, (1) the
number of grid points removed up to iteration $n$ is $\Theta(n^{3/2}\log n)$;
and (2) the boundary at iteration $n$ is sandwiched between two hyperbolas that
are separated from each other by a constant factor.

 <dc:description>  For many algorithms, parameter tuning remains a challenging and critical
task, which becomes tedious and infeasible in a multi-parameter setting.
Multi-penalty regularization, successfully used for solving undetermined sparse
regression of problems of unmixing type where signal and noise are additively
mixed, is one of such examples. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic
framework for an adaptive parameter choice in multi-penalty regularization with
a focus on the correct support recovery. Building upon the theory of
regularization paths and algorithms for single-penalty functionals, we extend
these ideas to a multi-penalty framework by providing an efficient procedure
for the construction of regions containing structurally similar solutions,
i.e., solutions with the same sparsity and sign pattern, over the whole range
of parameters. Combining this with a model selection criterion, we can choose
regularization parameters in a data-adaptive manner. Another advantage of our
algorithm is that it provides an overview on the solution stability over the
whole range of parameters. This can be further exploited to obtain additional
insights into the problem of interest. We provide a numerical analysis of our
method and compare it to the state-of-the-art single-penalty algorithms for
compressed sensing problems in order to demonstrate the robustness and power of
the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The goal in speech enhancement is to obtain an estimate of clean speech
starting from the noisy signal by minimizing a chosen distortion measure, which
results in an estimate that depends on the unknown clean signal or its
statistics. Since access to such prior knowledge is limited or not possible in
practice, one has to estimate the clean signal statistics. In this paper, we
develop a new risk minimization framework for speech enhancement, in which, one
optimizes an unbiased estimate of the distortion/risk instead of the actual
risk. The estimated risk is expressed solely as a function of the noisy
observations. We consider several perceptually relevant distortion measures and
develop corresponding unbiased estimates under realistic assumptions on the
noise distribution and a priori signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Minimizing the
risk estimates gives rise to the corresponding denoisers, which are nonlinear
functions of the a posteriori SNR. Perceptual evaluation of speech quality
(PESQ), average segmental SNR (SSNR) computations, and listening tests show
that the proposed risk optimization approach employing Itakura-Saito and
weighted hyperbolic cosine distortions gives better performance than the other
distortion measures. For SNRs greater than 5 dB, the proposed approach gives
superior denoising performance over the benchmark techniques based on the
Wiener filter, log-MMSE minimization, and Bayesian nonnegative matrix
factorization.

 <dc:description>  The Refinement Calculus of Reactive Systems (RCRS) is a compositional formal
framework for modeling and reasoning about reactive systems. RCRS provides a
language which allows to describe atomic components as symbolic transition
systems or QLTL formulas, and composite components formed using three primitive
composition operators: serial, parallel, and feedback. The semantics of the
language is given in terms of monotonic property transformers, an extension to
reactive systems of monotonic predicate transformers which have been used to
give compositional semantics to sequential programs. RCRS allows to specify
both safety and liveness properties. It also allows to model input-output
systems which are both non-deterministic and non-input-receptive (i.e., which
may reject some inputs at some points in time), and can thus be seen as a
behavioral type system. RCRS provides a set of techniques for symbolic
computer-aided reasoning, including compositional static analysis and
verification. RCRS comes with an open-source implementation built on top of the
Isabelle theorem prover.

 <dc:description>  We propose a call-by-value lambda calculus extended with a new construct
inspired by abductive inference and motivated by the programming idioms of
machine learning. Although syntactically simple the abductive construct has a
complex and subtle operational semantics which we express using a style based
on the Geometry of Interaction. We show that the calculus is sound, in the
sense that well typed programs terminate normally. We also give a visual
implementation of the semantics which relies on additional garbage collection
rules, which we also prove sound.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bibliometrics offers a particular representation of science. Through
bibliometric methods a bibliometrician will always highlight particular
elements of publications, and through these elements operationalize particular
representations of science, while obscuring other possible representations from
view. Understanding bibliometrics as representation implies that a bibliometric
analysis is always performative: a bibliometric analysis brings a particular
representation of science into being that potentially influences the science
system itself. In this review we analyze the ways the humanities have been
represented throughout the history of bibliometrics, often in comparison to
other scientific domains or to a general notion of the sciences. Our review
discusses bibliometric scholarship between 1965 and 2016 that studies the
humanities empirically. We distinguish between two periods of bibliometric
scholarship. The first period, between 1965 and 1989, is characterized by a
sociological theoretical framework, the development and use of the Price index,
and small samples of journal publications as data sources. The second period,
from the mid-1980s up until the present day, is characterized by a new
hinterland, that of science policy and research evaluation, in which
bibliometric methods become embedded.

 <dc:description>  Planning robust robot manipulation requires good forward models that enable
robust plans to be found. This work shows how to achieve this using a forward
model learned from robot data to plan push manipulations. We explore learning
methods (Gaussian Process Regression, and an Ensemble of Mixture Density
Networks) that give estimates of the uncertainty in their predictions. These
learned models are utilised by a model predictive path integral (MPPI)
controller to plan how to push the box to a goal location. The planner avoids
regions of high predictive uncertainty in the forward model. This includes both
inherent uncertainty in dynamics, and meta uncertainty due to limited data.
Thus, pushing tasks are completed in a robust fashion with respect to estimated
uncertainty in the forward model and without the need of differentiable cost
functions. We demonstrate the method on a real robot, and show that learning
can outperform physics simulation. Using simulation, we also show the ability
to plan uncertainty averse paths.

 <dc:description>  We propose a dynamic edge exchangeable network model that can capture sparse
connections observed in real temporal networks, in contrast to existing models
which are dense. The model achieved superior link prediction accuracy on
multiple data sets when compared to a dynamic variant of the blockmodel, and is
able to extract interpretable time-varying community structures from the data.
In addition to sparsity, the model accounts for the effect of social influence
on vertices' future behaviours. Compared to the dynamic blockmodels, our model
has a smaller latent space. The compact latent space requires a smaller number
of parameters to be estimated in variational inference and results in a
computationally friendly inference algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Parametric prediction error methods constitute a classical approach to the
identification of linear dynamic systems with excellent large-sample
properties. A more recent regularized approach, inspired by machine learning
and Bayesian methods, has also gained attention. Methods based on this approach
estimate the system impulse response with excellent small-sample properties. In
several applications, however, it is desirable to obtain a compact
representation of the system in the form of a parametric model. By viewing the
identification of such models as a decision, we develop a decision-theoretic
formulation of the parametric system identification problem that bridges the
gap between the classical and regularized approaches above. Using the
output-error model class as an illustration, we show that this
decision-theoretic approach leads to a regularized method that is robust to
small sample-sizes as well as overparameterization.

 <dc:description>  In this survey paper, we review recent uses of convolution neural networks
(CNNs) to solve inverse problems in imaging. It has recently become feasible to
train deep CNNs on large databases of images, and they have shown outstanding
performance on object classification and segmentation tasks. Motivated by these
successes, researchers have begun to apply CNNs to the resolution of inverse
problems such as denoising, deconvolution, super-resolution, and medical image
reconstruction, and they have started to report improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, including sparsity-based techniques such as
compressed sensing. Here, we review the recent experimental work in these
areas, with a focus on the critical design decisions: Where does the training
data come from? What is the architecture of the CNN? and How is the learning
problem formulated and solved? We also bring together a few key theoretical
papers that offer perspective on why CNNs are appropriate for inverse problems
and point to some next steps in the field.

 <dc:description>  The vast volume of marine wireless sampling data and its continuously
explosive growth herald the coming of the era of marine wireless big data. Two
challenges imposed by these data are how to fast, reliably, and sustainably
deliver them in extremely hostile marine environments and how to apply them
after collection. In this article, we first propose an architecture of
heterogeneous marine networks that flexibly exploits the existing underwater
wireless techniques as a potential solution for fast data transmission. We then
investigate the possibilities of and develop the schemes for energy-efficient
and reliable undersea transmission without or slightly with data rate
reduction. After discussing the data transmission, we summarize the possible
applications of the collected big data and particularly focus on the problems
of applying these data in sea-surface object detection and marine object
recognition. Open issues and challenges that need to be further explored
regarding transmission and detection/recognition are also discussed in the
article.

 <dc:description>  Topological Data Analysis (tda) is a recent and fast growing eld providing a
set of new topological and geometric tools to infer relevant features for
possibly complex data. This paper is a brief introduction, through a few
selected topics, to basic fundamental and practical aspects of tda for non
experts. 1 Introduction and motivation Topological Data Analysis (tda) is a
recent eld that emerged from various works in applied (algebraic) topology and
computational geometry during the rst decade of the century. Although one can
trace back geometric approaches for data analysis quite far in the past, tda
really started as a eld with the pioneering works of Edelsbrunner et al. (2002)
and Zomorodian and Carlsson (2005) in persistent homology and was popularized
in a landmark paper in 2009 Carlsson (2009). tda is mainly motivated by the
idea that topology and geometry provide a powerful approach to infer robust
qualitative, and sometimes quantitative, information about the structure of
data-see, e.g. Chazal (2017). tda aims at providing well-founded mathematical,
statistical and algorithmic methods to infer, analyze and exploit the complex
topological and geometric structures underlying data that are often represented
as point clouds in Euclidean or more general metric spaces. During the last few
years, a considerable eort has been made to provide robust and ecient data
structures and algorithms for tda that are now implemented and available and
easy to use through standard libraries such as the Gudhi library (C++ and
Python) Maria et al. (2014) and its R software interface Fasy et al. (2014a).
Although it is still rapidly evolving, tda now provides a set of mature and
ecient tools that can be used in combination or complementary to other data
sciences tools. The tdapipeline. tda has recently known developments in various
directions and application elds. There now exist a large variety of methods
inspired by topological and geometric approaches. Providing a complete overview
of all these existing approaches is beyond the scope of this introductory
survey. However, most of them rely on the following basic and standard pipeline
that will serve as the backbone of this paper: 1. The input is assumed to be a
nite set of points coming with a notion of distance-or similarity between them.
This distance can be induced by the metric in the ambient space (e.g. the
Euclidean metric when the data are embedded in R d) or come as an intrinsic
metric dened by a pairwise distance matrix. The denition of the metric on the
data is usually given as an input or guided by the application. It is however
important to notice that the choice of the metric may be critical to reveal
interesting topological and geometric features of the data.

 <dc:title>FFDNet: Toward a Fast and Flexible Solution for CNN based Image
  Denoising</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Due to the fast inference and good performance, discriminative learning
methods have been widely studied in image denoising. However, these methods
mostly learn a specific model for each noise level, and require multiple models
for denoising images with different noise levels. They also lack flexibility to
deal with spatially variant noise, limiting their applications in practical
denoising. To address these issues, we present a fast and flexible denoising
convolutional neural network, namely FFDNet, with a tunable noise level map as
the input. The proposed FFDNet works on downsampled sub-images to speed up the
inference, and adopts orthogonal regularization to enhance the generalization
ability. In contrast to the existing discriminative denoisers, FFDNet enjoys
several desirable properties, including (i) the ability to handle a wide range
of noise levels (i.e., [0, 75]) effectively with a single network, (ii) the
ability to remove spatially variant noise by specifying a non-uniform noise
level map, and (iii) faster speed than benchmark BM3D even on CPU without
sacrificing denoising performance. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real
noisy images are conducted to evaluate FFDNet in comparison with
state-of-the-art denoisers. The results show that FFDNet is effective and
efficient, making it highly attractive for practical denoising applications.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a real-time, constrained, nonlinear Model Predictive Control for
the motion planning of legged robots. The proposed approach uses a constrained
optimal control algorithm known as SLQ. We improve the efficiency of this
algorithm by introducing a multi-processing scheme for estimating value
function in its backward pass. This pass has been often calculated as a single
process. This parallel SLQ algorithm can optimize longer time horizons without
proportional increase in its computation time. Thus, our MPC algorithm can
generate optimized trajectories for the next few phases of the motion within
only a few milliseconds. This outperforms the state of the art by at least one
order of magnitude. The performance of the approach is validated on a quadruped
robot for generating dynamic gaits such as trotting.

in an initial step the quality of linked references data in MA in comparison
with Web of Science (WoS). Linked references are the backbone of bibliometrics,
because they are the basis of the times cited information in citation indexes.
We found that the concordance of linked references between MA and WoS ranges
from weak to non-existent for the full sample (publications of the University
of Zurich with less than 50 linked references in MA). An analysis with a sample
restricted to less than 50 linked references in WoS showed a strong agreement
between linked references in MA and WoS.

 <dc:description>  A coin with three states is not necessarily an anomaly. A coin falls on
either of its two sides head or tail. However, there is a remote possibility
that it may not fall but roll on its edge and get stuck somewhere without
falling on either of its sides. This possibility is remote for a classical coin
so much so that it is never analyzed. For a three state quantum coin(qutrit),
this is a fact. It has three states, period. Playing a Parrondo's game with a
qutrit is the subject of this paper. We show that a true quantum Parrondo's
game can be played with a 3 state coin in a 1D quantum walk in contrast to the
fact that playing a true Parrondo's game with a 2 state coin(qubit) in 1D
quantum walk fails in the asymptotic limits.

 <dc:description>  Image retargeting aims to resize an image to one with a prescribed aspect
ratio. Simple scaling inevitably introduces unnatural geometric distortions on
the important content of the image. In this paper, we propose a simple and yet
effective method to resize an image, which preserves the geometry of the
important content, using the Beltrami representation. Our algorithm allows
users to interactively label content regions as well as line structures. Image
resizing can then be achieved by warping the image by an orientation-preserving
bijective warping map with controlled distortion. The warping map is
represented by its Beltrami representation, which captures the local geometric
distortion of the map. By carefully prescribing the values of the Beltrami
representation, images with different complexity can be effectively resized.
Our method does not require solving any optimization problems and tuning
parameters throughout the process. This results in a simple and efficient
algorithm to solve the image retargeting problem. Extensive experiments have
been carried out, which demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method.

 <dc:description>  In the context of software startups, project failure is embraced actively and
considered crucial to obtain validated learning that can lead to pivots. A
pivot is the strategic change of a business concept, product or the different
elements of a business model. A better understanding is needed on different
types of pivots and different factors that lead to failures and trigger pivots,
for software entrepreneurial teams to make better decisions under chaotic and
unpredictable environment. Due to the nascent nature of the topic, the existing
research and knowledge on the pivots of software startups are very limited. In
this study, we aimed at identifying the major types of pivots that software
startups make during their startup processes, and highlighting the factors that
fail software projects and trigger pivots. To achieve this, we conducted a case
survey study based on the secondary data of the major pivots happened in 49
software startups. 10 pivot types and 14 triggering factors were identified.
The findings show that customer need pivot is the most common among all pivot
types. Together with customer segment pivot, they are common market related
pivots. The major product related pivots are zoom-in and technology pivots.
Several new pivot types were identified, including market zoom-in, complete and
side project pivots. Our study also demonstrates that negative customer
reaction and flawed business model are the most common factors that trigger
pivots in software startups. Our study extends the research knowledge on
software startup pivot types and pivot triggering factors. Meanwhile it
provides practical knowledge to software startups, which they can utilize to
guide their effective decisions on pivoting

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art
performance for automatic medical image segmentation. However, they have not
demonstrated sufficiently accurate and robust results for clinical use. In
addition, they are limited by the lack of image-specific adaptation and the
lack of generalizability to previously unseen object classes. To address these
problems, we propose a novel deep learning-based framework for interactive
segmentation by incorporating CNNs into a bounding box and scribble-based
segmentation pipeline. We propose image-specific fine-tuning to make a CNN
model adaptive to a specific test image, which can be either unsupervised
(without additional user interactions) or supervised (with additional
scribbles). We also propose a weighted loss function considering network and
interaction-based uncertainty for the fine-tuning. We applied this framework to
two applications: 2D segmentation of multiple organs from fetal MR slices,
where only two types of these organs were annotated for training; and 3D
segmentation of brain tumor core (excluding edema) and whole brain tumor
(including edema) from different MR sequences, where only tumor cores in one MR
sequence were annotated for training. Experimental results show that 1) our
model is more robust to segment previously unseen objects than state-of-the-art
CNNs; 2) image-specific fine-tuning with the proposed weighted loss function
significantly improves segmentation accuracy; and 3) our method leads to
accurate results with fewer user interactions and less user time than
traditional interactive segmentation methods.

 <dc:description>  So-called 'social bots' have garnered a lot of attention lately. Previous
research showed that they attempted to influence political events such as the
Brexit referendum and the US presidential elections. It remains, however,
somewhat unclear what exactly can be understood by the term 'social bot'. This
paper addresses the need to better understand the intentions of bots on social
media and to develop a shared understanding of how 'social' bots differ from
other types of bots. We thus describe a systematic review of publications that
researched bot accounts on social media. Based on the results of this
literature review, we propose a scheme for categorising bot accounts on social
media sites. Our scheme groups bot accounts by two dimensions - Imitation of
human behaviour and Intent.

 <dc:title>About Microservices, Containers and their Underestimated Impact on
  Network Performance</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kratzke, Nane</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Microservices are used to build complex applications composed of small,
independent and highly decoupled processes. Recently, microservices are often
mentioned in one breath with container technologies like Docker. That is why
operating system virtualization experiences a renaissance in cloud computing.
These approaches shall provide horizontally scalable, easily deployable systems
and a high-performance alternative to hypervisors. Nevertheless, performance
impacts of containers on top of hypervisors are hardly investigated.
Furthermore, microservice frameworks often come along with software defined
networks. This contribution presents benchmark results to quantify the impacts
of container, software defined networking and encryption on network
performance. Even containers, although postulated to be lightweight, show a
noteworthy impact to network performance. These impacts can be minimized on
several system layers. Some design recommendations for cloud deployed systems
following the microservice architecture pattern are derived.

 <dc:description>  In the article, we describe a trajectory planning problem for a 6-DOF robotic
manipulator arm that carries an ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensor with
synthetic aperture (SAR). The resolution depends on the trajectory and velocity
profile of the sensor head. The constraints can be modelled as an optimization
problem to obtain a feasible, collision-free target trajectory of the
end-effector of the manipulator arm in Cartesian coordinates that minimizes
observation time. For 3D-reconstruction, the target is observed in multiple
height slices. For Through-the-Wall radar the sensor can be operated in sliding
mode for scanning larger areas. For IED inspection the spot-light mode is
preferred, constantly pointing the antennas towards the target to obtain
maximum azimuth resolution.

 <dc:description>  Kalman filtering is a classic state estimation technique used widely in
engineering applications such as statistical signal processing and control of
vehicles. It is now being used to solve problems in computer systems, such as
controlling the voltage and frequency of processors to minimize energy while
meeting throughput requirements.
  Although there are many presentations of Kalman filtering in the literature,
they are usually focused on particular problem domains such as linear systems
with Gaussian noise or robot navigation, which makes it difficult to understand
the general principles behind Kalman filtering. In this paper, we first present
the general statistical ideas behind Kalman filtering at a level accessible to
anyone with a basic knowledge of probability theory and calculus, and then show
how these abstract concepts can be applied to state estimation problems in
linear systems. This separation of abstract concepts from applications should
make it easier to apply Kalman filtering to other problems in computer systems.

 <dc:description>  We consider multi-agent stochastic optimization problems over reproducing
kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). In this setting, a network of interconnected
agents aims to learn decision functions, i.e., nonlinear statistical models,
that are optimal in terms of a global convex functional that aggregates data
across the network, with only access to locally and sequentially observed
samples. We propose solving this problem by allowing each agent to learn a
local regression function while enforcing consensus constraints. We use a
penalized variant of functional stochastic gradient descent operating
simultaneously with low-dimensional subspace projections. These subspaces are
constructed greedily by applying orthogonal matching pursuit to the sequence of
kernel dictionaries and weights. By tuning the projection-induced bias, we
propose an algorithm that allows for each individual agent to learn, based upon
its locally observed data stream and message passing with its neighbors only, a
regression function that is close to the globally optimal regression function.
That is, we establish that with constant step-size selections agents' functions
converge to a neighborhood of the globally optimal one while satisfying the
consensus constraints as the penalty parameter is increased. Moreover, the
complexity of the learned regression functions is guaranteed to remain finite.
On both multi-class kernel logistic regression and multi-class kernel support
vector classification with data generated from class-dependent Gaussian mixture
models, we observe stable function estimation and state of the art performance
for distributed online multi-class classification. Experiments on the Brodatz
textures further substantiate the empirical validity of this approach.

 <dc:description>  Saliency detection aims to detect the most attractive objects in images,
which has been widely used as a foundation for various multimedia applications.
In this paper, we propose a novel salient object detection algorithm for RGB-D
images using center-dark channel prior. First, we generate an initial saliency
map based on a color saliency map and a depth saliency map of a given RGB-D
image. Then, we generate a center-dark channel map based on a center saliency
prior and a dark channel prior. Finally, we fuse the initial saliency map with
the center dark channel map to generate the final saliency map. The proposed
algorithm is evaluated on two public RGB-D datasets, and the experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-theart methods.

 <dc:description>  Graph theory provides a language for studying the structure of relations, and
it is often used to study interactions over time too. However, it poorly
captures the both temporal and structural nature of interactions, that calls
for a dedicated formalism. In this paper, we generalize graph concepts in order
to cope with both aspects in a consistent way. We start with elementary
concepts like density, clusters, or paths, and derive from them more advanced
concepts like cliques, degrees, clustering coefficients, or connected
components. We obtain a language to directly deal with interactions over time,
similar to the language provided by graphs to deal with relations. This
formalism is self-consistent: usual relations between different concepts are
preserved. It is also consistent with graph theory: graph concepts are special
cases of the ones we introduce. This makes it easy to generalize higher-level
objects such as quotient graphs, line graphs, k-cores, and centralities. This
paper also considers discrete versus continuous time assumptions, instantaneous
links, and extensions to more complex cases.

 <dc:description>  We propose a deep semantic characterization of space and motion categorically
from the viewpoint of grounding embodied human-object interactions. Our key
focus is on an ontological model that would be adept to formalisation from the
viewpoint of commonsense knowledge representation, relational learning, and
qualitative reasoning about space and motion in cognitive robotics settings. We
demonstrate key aspects of the space &amp; motion ontology and its formalization as
a representational framework in the backdrop of select examples from a dataset
of everyday activities. Furthermore, focussing on human-object interaction data
obtained from RGBD sensors, we also illustrate how declarative
(spatio-temporal) reasoning in the (constraint) logic programming family may be
performed with the developed deep semantic abstractions.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art methods for learning cross-lingual word embeddings have
relied on bilingual dictionaries or parallel corpora. Recent works showed that
the need for parallel data supervision can be alleviated with character-level
information. While these methods showed encouraging results, they are not on
par with their supervised counterparts and are limited to pairs of languages
sharing a common alphabet. In this work, we show that we can build a bilingual
dictionary between two languages without using any parallel corpora, by
aligning monolingual word embedding spaces in an unsupervised way. Without
using any character information, our model even outperforms existing supervised
methods on cross-lingual tasks for some language pairs. Our experiments
demonstrate that our method works very well also for distant language pairs,
like English-Russian or English-Chinese. We finally show that our method is a
first step towards fully unsupervised machine translation and describe
experiments on the English-Esperanto language pair, on which there only exists
a limited amount of parallel data.

 <dc:description>  Comparing with traditional learning criteria, such as mean square error
(MSE), the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion is superior in nonlinear and
non-Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. The argument of the
logarithm in Renyis entropy estimator, called information potential (IP), is a
popular MEE cost in information theoretic learning (ITL). The computational
complexity of IP is however quadratic in terms of sample number due to double
summation. This creates computational bottlenecks especially for large-scale
datasets. To address this problem, in this work we propose an efficient
quantization approach to reduce the computational burden of IP, which decreases
the complexity from O(N*N) to O (MN) with M &lt;&lt; N. The new learning criterion is
called the quantized MEE (QMEE). Some basic properties of QMEE are presented.
Illustrative examples are provided to verify the excellent performance of QMEE.

 <dc:title>Finding Euler Tours in One Pass in the W-Streaming Model with O(n
  log(n)) RAM</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of finding an Euler tour in an undirected graph G in the
W-Streaming model with O(n polylog(n)) RAM, where n resp. m is the number of
nodes resp. edges of G. Our main result is the first one pass W-Streaming
algorithm computing an Euler tour of G in the form of an edge successor
function with only O(n log(n)) RAM which is optimal for this setting (e.g., Sun
and Woodruff (2015)). The previously best-known result in this model is
implicitly given by Demetrescu et al. (2010) with the parallel algorithm of
Atallah and Vishkin (1984) using O(m/n) passes under the same RAM limitation.
For graphs with \omega(n) edges this is non-constant. Our overall approach is
to partition the edges into edge-disjoint cycles and to merge the cycles until
a single Euler tour is achieved. Note that in the W-Streaming model such a
merging is far from being obvious as the limited RAM allows the processing of
only a constant number of cycles at once. This enforces us to merge cycles that
partially are no longer present in RAM. Furthermore, the successor of an edge
cannot be changed after the edge has left RAM. So, we steadily have to output
edges and their designated successors, not knowing the appearance of edges and
cycles yet to come. We solve this problem with a special edge swapping
technique, for which two certain edges per node are sufficient to merge tours
without having all of their edges in RAM. Mathematically, this is controlled by
structural results on the space of certain equivalence classes corresponding to
cycles and the characterization of associated successor functions. For example,
we give conditions under which the swapping of edge successors leads to a
merging of equivalence classes.

 <dc:description>  Hardware performance monitoring (HPM) is a crucial ingredient of performance
analysis tools. While there are interfaces like LIKWID, PAPI or the kernel
interface perf\_event which provide HPM access with some additional features,
many higher level tools combine event counts with results retrieved from other
sources like function call traces to derive (semi-)automatic performance
advice. However, although HPM is available for x86 systems since the early 90s,
only a small subset of the HPM features is used in practice. Performance
patterns provide a more comprehensive approach, enabling the identification of
various performance-limiting effects. Patterns address issues like bandwidth
saturation, load imbalance, non-local data access in ccNUMA systems, or false
sharing of cache lines. This work defines HPM event sets that are best suited
to identify a selection of performance patterns on the Intel Haswell processor.
We validate the chosen event sets for accuracy in order to arrive at a reliable
pattern detection mechanism and point out shortcomings that cannot be easily
circumvented due to bugs or limitations in the hardware.

 <dc:description>  Radon transform and its inverse operation are important techniques in medical
imaging tasks. Recently, there has been renewed interest in Radon transform for
applications such as content-based medical image retrieval. However, all
studies so far have used Radon transform as a global or quasi-global image
descriptor by extracting projections of the whole image or large sub-images.
This paper attempts to show that the dense sampling to generate the histogram
of local Radon projections has a much higher discrimination capability than the
global one. In this paper, we introduce Local Radon Descriptor (LRD) and apply
it to the IRMA dataset, which contains 14,410 x-ray images as well as to the
INRIA Holidays dataset with 1,990 images. Our results show significant
improvement in retrieval performance by using LRD versus its global version. We
also demonstrate that LRD can deliver results comparable to well-established
descriptors like LBP and HOG.

 <dc:description>  The Lazy Shortest Path (LazySP) class consists of motion-planning algorithms
that only evaluate edges along shortest paths between the source and target.
These algorithms were designed to minimize the number of edge evaluations in
settings where edge evaluation dominates the running time of the algorithm; but
how close to optimal are LazySP algorithms in terms of this objective? Our main
result is an analytical upper bound, in a probabilistic model, on the number of
edge evaluations required by LazySP algorithms; a matching lower bound shows
that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal in the worst case.

 <dc:description>  One of the most basic skills a robot should possess is predicting the effect
of physical interactions with objects in the environment. This enables optimal
action selection to reach a certain goal state. Traditionally, these dynamics
are described by physics-based analytical models, which may however be very
hard to find for complex problems. More recently, we have seen learning
approaches that can predict the effect of more complex physical interactions
directly from sensory input. However, it is an open question how far these
models generalize beyond their training data. In this work, we analyse how
analytical and learned models can be combined to leverage the best of both
worlds. As physical interaction task, we use planar pushing, for which there
exists a well-known analytical model and a large real-world dataset. We propose
to use a neural network to convert the raw sensory data into a suitable
representation that can be consumed by the analytical model and compare this
approach to using neural networks for both, perception and prediction. Our
results show that the combined method outperforms the purely learned version in
terms of accuracy and generalization to push actions not seen during training.
It also performs comparable to the analytical model applied on ground truth
input values, despite using raw sensory data as input.

 <dc:description>  We investigate recurrent neural network architectures for event-sequence
processing. Event sequences, characterized by discrete observations stamped
with continuous-valued times of occurrence, are challenging due to the
potentially wide dynamic range of relevant time scales as well as interactions
between time scales. We describe four forms of inductive bias that should
benefit architectures for event sequences: temporal locality, position and
scale homogeneity, and scale interdependence. We extend the popular gated
recurrent unit (GRU) architecture to incorporate these biases via intrinsic
temporal dynamics, obtaining a continuous-time GRU. The CT-GRU arises by
interpreting the gates of a GRU as selecting a time scale of memory, and the
CT-GRU generalizes the GRU by incorporating multiple time scales of memory and
performing context-dependent selection of time scales for information storage
and retrieval. Event time-stamps drive decay dynamics of the CT-GRU, whereas
they serve as generic additional inputs to the GRU. Despite the very different
manner in which the two models consider time, their performance on eleven data
sets we examined is essentially identical. Our surprising results point both to
the robustness of GRU and LSTM architectures for handling continuous time, and
to the potency of incorporating continuous dynamics into neural architectures.

 <dc:description>  Wearable cameras can gather large amounts of image data that provide rich
visual information about the daily activities of the wearer. Motivated by the
large number of health applications that could be enabled by the automatic
recognition of daily activities, such as lifestyle characterization for habit
improvement, context-aware personal assistance and tele-rehabilitation
services, we propose a system to classify 21 daily activities from
photo-streams acquired by a wearable photo-camera. Our approach combines the
advantages of a Late Fusion Ensemble strategy relying on convolutional neural
networks at image level with the ability of recurrent neural networks to
account for the temporal evolution of high level features in photo-streams. The
proposed method was tested on a set of 44,902 egocentric images and achieved an
overall accuracy of 87.07%, outperforming state of the art end-to-end
methodologies.

 <dc:description>  In GFG automata, it is possible to resolve nondeterminism in a way that only
depends on the past and still accepts all the words in the language. The
motivation for GFG automata comes from their adequacy for games and synthesis,
wherein general nondeterminism is inappropriate. We continue the ongoing effort
of studying the power of nondeterminism in GFG automata. Initial indications
have hinted that every GFG automaton embodies a deterministic one. Today we
know that this is not the case, and in fact GFG automata may be exponentially
more succinct than deterministic ones.
  We focus on the typeness question, namely the question of whether a GFG
automaton with a certain acceptance condition has an equivalent GFG automaton
with a weaker acceptance condition on the same structure. Beyond the
theoretical interest in studying typeness, its existence implies efficient
translations among different acceptance conditions. This practical issue is of
special interest in the context of games, where the Buchi and co-Buchi
conditions admit memoryless strategies for both players. Typeness is known to
hold for deterministic automata and not to hold for general nondeterministic
automata.
  We show that GFG automata enjoy the benefits of typeness, similarly to the
case of deterministic automata. In particular, when Rabin or Streett GFG
automata have equivalent Buchi or co-Buchi GFG automata, respectively, then
such equivalent automata can be defined on a substructure of the original
automata. Using our typeness results, we further study the place of GFG
automata in between deterministic and nondeterministic ones. Specifically,
considering automata complementation, we show that GFG automata lean toward
nondeterministic ones, admitting an exponential state blow-up in the
complementation of a Streett automaton into a Rabin automaton, as opposed to
the constant blow-up in the deterministic case.

 <dc:description>  The presence of gender stereotypes in many aspects of society is a well-known
phenomenon. In this paper, we focus on studying such stereotypes and bias in
Hindi movie industry (Bollywood). We analyze movie plots and posters for all
movies released since 1970. The gender bias is detected by semantic modeling of
plots at inter-sentence and intra-sentence level. Different features like
occupation, introduction of cast in text, associated actions and descriptions
are captured to show the pervasiveness of gender bias and stereo- type in
movies. We derive a semantic graph and compute centrality of each character and
observe similar bias there. We also show that such bias is not applicable for
movie posters where females get equal importance even though their character
has little or no impact on the movie plot. Furthermore, we explore the movie
trailers to estimate on-screen time for males and females and also study the
portrayal of emotions by gender in them. The silver lining is that our system
was able to identify 30 movies over last 3 years where such stereotypes were
broken.

 <dc:description>  The use of educational games for pedagogical practice can provide new
conceptions of teaching-learning in an interactive environment stimulating the
acquisition of new knowledge. The so-called serious games are focused on the
goal of transmitting educational content or training to the user. In the
context of entrepreneurship, serious games appear to have greater importance
due to the multidisciplinary of the knowledge needed. Therefore, we propose the
adoption of the Entrexplorer game in the context of a university classroom. The
game is a cloud-based serious game about the theme of entrepreneurship where
users can access learning contents that will assist them in the acquisition of
entrepreneurial skills. The organization of the game in eight levels with six
additional floors let students learn the different dimensions of an
entrepreneurship project while progressing during the gameplay.

 <dc:description>  Carsharing is a model of renting vehicles for short periods of time, where
the payment is made according to the time and distance effectively traveled.
Carsharing offers a simple, economical and smart alternative to urban mobility,
that is already being adopted in the major cities in the world. The proposed
methodology consisted in the development of a decision support system that
simplifies the process of choosing carsharing services. Adopting the AHP
method, the user can indicate their preferences in the choice of vehicles, and
the system returns an ordered list of the most suitable available vehicles
based on their geographic location. The findings of the project indicate that
the use of this system encourage and simplify the use of carsharing services,
which will allow to enhance the financial, mobility and environment advantages
inherent to their use.

 <dc:description>  There is a computer decision support system (CDSS) for urbanization of the
northern part of the Volga-Akhtuba floodplain. This system includes subsystems
of cognitive and game-theoretic analysis, geoinformation and hydrodynamic
simulations. The paper presents the cognitive graph, two-level and three-level
models of hierarchical games for the cases of uncontrolled and controlled
development of the problem situation. We described the quantitative analysis of
the effects of different strategies for the spatial distribution of the
urbanized territories. For this reason we conducted the territory zoning
according to the level of negative consequences of urbanization for various
agents. In addition, we found an analytical solution for games with the linear
dependence of the average flooded area on the urbanized area. We numerically
computed a game equilibrium for dependences derived from the imitational
geoinformation and hydrodynamic modeling of flooding. As the result, we showed
that the transition to the three-level management system and the implementation
of an optimal urbanization strategy minimize its negative consequences.

 <dc:description>  Industry 4.0, or Digital Manufacturing, is a vision of inter-connected
services to facilitate innovation in the manufacturing sector. A fundamental
requirement of innovation is the ability to be able to visualise manufacturing
data, in order to discover new insight for increased competitive advantage.
This article describes the enabling technologies that facilitate In-Transit
Analytics, which is a necessary precursor for Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT) visualisation.

 <dc:title>City Cloud Brain, a New Architecture of Smart City Based on the Internet
  Cloud Brain</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Liu, Feng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the ten years after the Smart City was put forward, there are still
problems like unclear concept, lack of top-down design and information island.
With the further development of the Internet, the brain-like architecture of
the Internet is becoming clearer and clearer. As a product of combination of
city buildings and the Internet, the Smart City will also have a new
architecture, and the city cloud brain thus appears. Based on the Internet
Cloud Brain, this paper describes how to construct the Smart City in the form
of brain-like tissue, and how to evaluate the construction level of the Smart
City (City IQ) relying on the Big SNS (city neural networks) and city cloud
reflex arcs.

 <dc:description>  Blended courses have become the norm in post-secondary education.
Universities use large-scale learning management systems to manage class
content. Instructors deliver readings, lectures, and office hours online;
students use intelligent tutors, web forums, and online submission systems; and
classes communicate via web forums. These online tools allow students to form
new social networks or bring social relationships online. They also allow us to
collect data on students' social relationships. In this paper we report on our
research on community formation in blended courses based on online forum
interactions. We found that it was possible to group students into communities
using standard community detection algorithms via their posts and reply
structure and that the students' grades are significantly correlated with their
closest peers.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, hype surrounding the proliferation of blockchain-based
technology has been significant. Apart from the creation of bitcoin and other
cryptocurrencies, it has been difficult to determine what practical utility
might lie in the adoption of blockchain, mainly because there are so few in
existence at present. Even so, interest in the technology has increased
tremendously. This paper is a primer for software quality professionals. It
briefly describes the history of blockchain technology, attempts to define and
disambiguate terminology, fosters a general understanding of how blockchain
works, and discusses how and why software quality professionals might want to
invest time and energy in learning about, implementing, or using
blockchain-based technologies in their own organizations -- or alternatively,
improving the quality of blockchain technology itself.

 <dc:description>  Traditional power systems education and training is flanked by the demand for
coping with the rising complexity of energy systems, like the integration of
renewable and distributed generation, communication, control and information
technology. A broad understanding of these topics by the current/future
researchers and engineers is becoming more and more necessary. This paper
identifies educational and training needs addressing the higher complexity of
intelligent energy systems. Education needs and requirements are discussed,
such as the development of systems-oriented skills and cross-disciplinary
learning. Education and training possibilities and necessary tools are
described focusing on classroom but also on laboratory-based learning methods.
In this context, experiences of using notebooks, co-simulation approaches,
hardware-in-the-loop methods and remote labs experiments are discussed.

 <dc:description>  One the major challenges in undergraduate computing programs is the learning
of object-oriented programming (OOP). This paradigm has a variety of concepts
with an abstraction level usually high for most beginners, even the ones who
already code in an imperative language. Furthermore, transitioning from
imperative programming to OOP is a complex issue, with various inappropriate
side effects. A significant effort has been pursued in the search of motivating
and attractive solutions for such issues. One of those is the use of playful
environments that merge games with learning. In this work, we report our
experience with OOP learning workshops by means of games, challenges and
competitions, supported by Greenfoot and Robocode learning environments. A
workshop with sophomore students in a Computer Engineering program is presented
here. Lessons learning to motive students include: design of motivating
examples, use of competitive challenges, and an appropriate ratio between
tutors and students. Results suggest that the workshop was a practical and
effective way to introduce OOP and motivate students to learn it.

 <dc:description>  Cars can nowadays record several thousands of signals through the CAN bus
technology and potentially provide real-time information on the car, the driver
and the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a new method for the
analysis and classification of driver behavior using a selected subset of CAN
bus signals, specifically gas pedal position, brake pedal pressure, steering
wheel angle, steering wheel momentum, velocity, RPM, frontal and lateral
acceleration. Data has been collected in a completely uncontrolled experiment,
where 64 people drove 10 cars for or a total of over 2000 driving trips without
any type of pre-determined driving instruction on a wide variety of road
scenarios. We propose an unsupervised learning technique that clusters drivers
in different groups, and offers a validation method to test the robustness of
clustering in a wide range of experimental settings. The minimal amount of data
needed to preserve robust driver clustering is also computed. The presented
study provides a new methodology for near-real-time classification of driver
behavior in uncontrolled environments.

 <dc:description>  The term, Big Data, has been authored to refer to the extensive heave of data
that can't be managed by traditional data handling methods or techniques. The
field of Big Data plays an indispensable role in various fields, such as
agriculture, banking, data mining, education, chemistry, finance, cloud
computing, marketing, health care stocks. Big data analytics is the method for
looking at big data to reveal hidden patterns, incomprehensible relationship
and other important data that can be utilize to resolve on enhanced decisions.
There has been a perpetually expanding interest for big data because of its
fast development and since it covers different areas of applications. Apache
Hadoop open source technology created in Java and keeps running on Linux
working framework was used. The primary commitment of this exploration is to
display an effective and free solution for big data application in a
distributed environment, with its advantages and indicating its easy use. Later
on, there emerge to be a required for an analytical review of new developments
in the big data technology. Healthcare is one of the best concerns of the
world. Big data in healthcare imply to electronic health data sets that are
identified with patient healthcare and prosperity. Data in the healthcare area
is developing past managing limit of the healthcare associations and is relied
upon to increment fundamentally in the coming years.

 <dc:description>  In past few years, several data-sets have been released for text and images.
We present an approach to create the data-set for use in detecting and removing
gender bias from text. We also include a set of challenges we have faced while
creating this corpora. In this work, we have worked with movie data from
Wikipedia plots and movie trailers from YouTube. Our Bollywood Movie corpus
contains 4000 movies extracted from Wikipedia and 880 trailers extracted from
YouTube which were released from 1970-2017. The corpus contains csv files with
the following data about each movie - Wikipedia title of movie, cast, plot
text, co-referenced plot text, soundtrack information, link to movie poster,
caption of movie poster, number of males in poster, number of females in
poster. In addition to that, corresponding to each cast member the following
data is available - cast name, cast gender, cast verbs, cast adjectives, cast
relations, cast centrality, cast mentions. We present some preliminary results
on the task of bias removal which suggest that the data-set is quite useful for
performing such tasks.

 <dc:description>  As the underground infrastructure systems of cities age, maintenance and
repair become an increasing concern. Cities face difficulties in planning
maintenance, predicting and responding to infrastructure related issues, and in
realizing their vision to be a smart city due to their incomplete understanding
of the existing state of the infrastructure. Only few cities have accurate and
complete digital information on their underground infrastructure (e.g.,
electricity, water, natural gas) systems, which poses problems to those
planning and performing construction projects. To address these issues, we
introduce GUIDES as a new data conversion and management framework for urban
underground infrastructure systems that enable city administrators, workers,
and contractors along with the general public and other users to query
digitized and integrated data to make smarter decisions. This demo paper
presents the GUIDES architecture and describes two of its central components:
(i) mapping of underground infrastructure systems, and (ii) integration of
heterogeneous geospatial data.

 <dc:description>  The success of a business mission is highly dependent on the Communications
and Information Systems (CIS) that support the mission. Mission Impact
Assessment (MIA) seeks to assist the integration of business or military
operations with cyber defense, particularly in bridging the cognitive gap
between operational decision-makers and cyber defenders. Recent years have seen
a growing interest in model-driven approaches to MIA. Such approaches involve
construction and simulation of models of the mission, systems, and attack
scenarios in order to understand an attack's impact, including its nature,
dependencies involved, and the extent of consequences. This paper discusses
representative examples of recent research on model-driven approach to MIA,
highlights its potential value and cautions about serious remaining challenges.

 <dc:description>  Most recently proposed methods for Neural Program Induction work under the
assumption of having a large set of input/output (I/O) examples for learning
any underlying input-output mapping. This paper aims to address the problem of
data and computation efficiency of program induction by leveraging information
from related tasks. Specifically, we propose two approaches for cross-task
knowledge transfer to improve program induction in limited-data scenarios. In
our first proposal, portfolio adaptation, a set of induction models is
pretrained on a set of related tasks, and the best model is adapted towards the
new task using transfer learning. In our second approach, meta program
induction, a $k$-shot learning approach is used to make a model generalize to
new tasks without additional training. To test the efficacy of our methods, we
constructed a new benchmark of programs written in the Karel programming
language. Using an extensive experimental evaluation on the Karel benchmark, we
demonstrate that our proposals dramatically outperform the baseline induction
method that does not use knowledge transfer. We also analyze the relative
performance of the two approaches and study conditions in which they perform
best. In particular, meta induction outperforms all existing approaches under
extreme data sparsity (when a very small number of examples are available),
i.e., fewer than ten. As the number of available I/O examples increase (i.e. a
thousand or more), portfolio adapted program induction becomes the best
approach. For intermediate data sizes, we demonstrate that the combined method
of adapted meta program induction has the strongest performance.

 <dc:description>  We propose new computational models for analyzing self-reported emotional
diary texts of pregnant women to support maternal care. We gathered affective
ratings outside clinical setting and developed new models to facilitate
interpretation and communication of affective expressions between persons
representing different affective ratings. Relying on constructed emotion
theory, models of dimensional emotion categories and affective ratings of Self
Assessment Manikin, we demonstrate our new proposal to analyze linguistic data
with computational models exploiting vector space and clustering methods. 35
persons having Finnish as a native language provided affective ratings for 195
emotional adjectives and 16 pregnancy-related nouns in Finnish in dimensions of
pleasure, arousal and dominance. We developed new models to represent
dependencies and differences of affective ratings between various population
subgroup categorizations, including &quot;women without children&quot;, &quot;women with
children&quot; and &quot;men without children&quot; that we consider important population
segments to be addressed in maternal care. Our affective ratings showed
significant correlations between pleasure and dominance (like Warriner et al.,
2013) and with previous data collections (S\&quot;oderholm et al., 2013; Eilola &amp;
Havelka, 2010; Warriner et al., 2013). Our affective ratings had significant
effects on categorizations based on gender, gender-parental role and the time
of the day and duration of giving ratings. Our results indicate accordance with
significant affectivity differences of gender and age (Warriner et al., 2013)
and motherhood (Rosebrock et al., 2015). Our proposed models aim to support
health-related communication. Our results suggest gathering next the affective
ratings of patients of maternal care in a real clinical setting.

 <dc:title>Counterfactual Conditionals in Quantified Modal Logic</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Govindarajulu, Naveen Sundar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Bringsjord, Selmer</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel formalization of counterfactual conditionals in a
quantified modal logic. Counterfactual conditionals play a vital role in
ethical and moral reasoning. Prior work has shown that moral reasoning systems
(and more generally, theory-of-mind reasoning systems) should be at least as
expressive as first-order (quantified) modal logic (QML) to be well-behaved.
While existing work on moral reasoning has focused on counterfactual-free QML
moral reasoning, we present a fully specified and implemented formal system
that includes counterfactual conditionals. We validate our model with two
projects. In the first project, we demonstrate that our system can be used to
model a complex moral principle, the doctrine of double effect. In the second
project, we use the system to build a data-set with true and false
counterfactuals as licensed by our theory, which we believe can be useful for
other researchers. This project also shows that our model can be
computationally feasible.

 <dc:description>  We present Synkhronos, an extension to Theano for multi-GPU computations
leveraging data parallelism. Our framework provides automated execution and
synchronization across devices, allowing users to continue to write serial
programs without risk of race conditions. The NVIDIA Collective Communication
Library is used for high-bandwidth inter-GPU communication. Further
enhancements to the Theano function interface include input slicing (with
aggregation) and input indexing, which perform common data-parallel computation
patterns efficiently. One example use case is synchronous SGD, which has
recently been shown to scale well for a growing set of deep learning problems.
When training ResNet-50, we achieve a near-linear speedup of 7.5x on an NVIDIA
DGX-1 using 8 GPUs, relative to Theano-only code running a single GPU in
isolation. Yet Synkhronos remains general to any data-parallel computation
programmable in Theano. By implementing parallelism at the level of individual
Theano functions, our framework uniquely addresses a niche between manual
multi-device programming and prescribed multi-GPU training routines.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new mathematical formulation for the problem of
de-anonymizing social network users by actively querying their membership in
social network groups is introduced. In this formulation, the attacker has
access to a noisy observation of the group membership of each user in the
social network. When an unidentified victim visits a malicious website, the
attacker uses browser history sniffing to make queries regarding the victim's
social media activity. Particularly, it can make polar queries regarding the
victim's group memberships and the victim's identity. The attacker receives
noisy responses to her queries. The goal is to de-anonymize the victim with the
minimum number of queries. Starting with a rigorous mathematical model for this
active de-anonymization problem, an upper bound on the attacker's expected
query cost is derived, and new attack algorithms are proposed which achieve
this bound. These algorithms vary in computational cost and performance. The
results suggest that prior heuristic approaches to this problem provide
sub-optimal solutions.

scale as $\exp(-r^{2/d})$ at radius $r=\tilde{\Omega}_d(n^{d/2})$. Our
concentration radius is optimal up to logarithmic factors for constant $d$,
improving known results by polynomial factors in the number of spins. We
demonstrate the efficacy of polynomial functions as statistics for testing the
strength of interactions in social networks in both synthetic and real world

 <dc:title>On Data-Driven Saak Transform</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kuo, C. -C. Jay</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Yueru</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Being motivated by the multilayer RECOS (REctified-COrrelations on a Sphere)
transform, we develop a data-driven Saak (Subspace approximation with augmented
kernels) transform in this work. The Saak transform consists of three steps: 1)
building the optimal linear subspace approximation with orthonormal bases using
the second-order statistics of input vectors, 2) augmenting each transform
kernel with its negative, 3) applying the rectified linear unit (ReLU) to the
transform output. The Karhunen-Lo\'eve transform (KLT) is used in the first
step. The integration of Steps 2 and 3 is powerful since they resolve the sign
confusion problem, remove the rectification loss and allow a straightforward
implementation of the inverse Saak transform at the same time. Multiple Saak
transforms are cascaded to transform images of a larger size. All Saak
transform kernels are derived from the second-order statistics of input random
vectors in a one-pass feedforward manner. Neither data labels nor
backpropagation is used in kernel determination. Multi-stage Saak transforms
offer a family of joint spatial-spectral representations between two extremes;
namely, the full spatial-domain representation and the full spectral-domain
representation. We select Saak coefficients of higher discriminant power to
form a feature vector for pattern recognition, and use the MNIST dataset
classification problem as an illustrative example.

 <dc:description>  Understanding tie strength in social networks, and the factors that influence
it, have received much attention in a myriad of disciplines for decades.
Several models incorporating indicators of tie strength have been proposed and
used to quantify relationships in social networks, and a standard set of
structural network metrics have been applied to predominantly online social
media sites to predict tie strength. Here, we introduce the concept of the
&quot;social bow tie&quot; framework, a small subgraph of the network that consists of a
collection of nodes and ties that surround a tie of interest, forming a
topological structure that resembles a bow tie. We also define several
intuitive and interpretable metrics that quantify properties of the bow tie. We
use random forests and regression models to predict categorical and continuous
measures of tie strength from different properties of the bow tie, including
nodal attributes. We also investigate what aspects of the bow tie are most
predictive of tie strength in two distinct social networks: a collection of 75
rural villages in India and a nationwide call network of European mobile phone
users. Our results indicate several of the bow tie metrics are highly
predictive of tie strength, and we find the more the social circles of two
individuals overlap, the stronger their tie, consistent with previous findings.
However, we also find that the more tightly-knit their non-overlapping social
circles, the weaker the tie. This new finding complements our current
understanding of what drives the strength of ties in social networks.

and testing of audio array processing algorithms. The content of the package
can be divided into three main components: an intuitive Python object-oriented
interface to quickly construct different simulation scenarios involving
multiple sound sources and microphones in 2D and 3D rooms; a fast C
implementation of the image source model for general polyhedral rooms to
efficiently generate room impulse responses and simulate the propagation
between sources and receivers; and finally, reference implementations of
popular algorithms for beamforming, direction finding, and adaptive filtering.
Together, they form a package with the potential to speed up the time to market
of new algorithms by significantly reducing the implementation overhead in the
performance evaluation step.

 <dc:description>  Joint image filters leverage the guidance image as a prior and transfer the
structural details from the guidance image to the target image for suppressing
noise or enhancing spatial resolution. Existing methods either rely on various
explicit filter constructions or hand-designed objective functions, thereby
making it difficult to understand, improve, and accelerate these filters in a
coherent framework. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach for
constructing joint filters based on Convolutional Neural Networks. In contrast
to existing methods that consider only the guidance image, the proposed
algorithm can selectively transfer salient structures that are consistent with
both guidance and target images. We show that the model trained on a certain
type of data, e.g., RGB and depth images, generalizes well to other modalities,
e.g., flash/non-Flash and RGB/NIR images. We validate the effectiveness of the
proposed joint filter through extensive experimental evaluations with
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Crowdsourcing for Beyond Polarity Sentiment Analysis A Pure Emotion

 <dc:description>  Sentiment analysis aims to uncover emotions conveyed through information. In
its simplest form, it is performed on a polarity basis, where the goal is to
classify information with positive or negative emotion. Recent research has
explored more nuanced ways to capture emotions that go beyond polarity. For
these methods to work, they require a critical resource: a lexicon that is
appropriate for the task at hand, in terms of the range of emotions it captures
diversity. In the past, sentiment analysis lexicons have been created by
experts, such as linguists and behavioural scientists, with strict rules.
Lexicon evaluation was also performed by experts or gold standards. In our
paper, we propose a crowdsourcing method for lexicon acquisition, which is
scalable, cost-effective, and doesn't require experts or gold standards. We
also compare crowd and expert evaluations of the lexicon, to assess the overall
lexicon quality, and the evaluation capabilities of the crowd.

 <dc:description>  Users' persistent social media contents like posts on Facebook Timeline are
presented as an &quot;exhibition&quot; about the person to others, and managing these
exhibitional contents for impression management needs intentional and manual
efforts. To raise awareness of and facilitate impression management around past
contents, we developed a prototype called PersonalityInsight. The system
employs computational psycho-linguistic analysis to help users visualize the
way their past text posts might convey impressions of their personality and
allowed users to modify their posts based on these visualizations. We conducted
a user study to evaluate the design; users overall found that such a tool
raised awareness of the fact and the ways personality might be conveyed through
their past content as one aspect of impression management, but that it needs
design improvement to offer action-able suggestions for content modification,
as well as careful thinking about impression management as one of many values
people have about their digital past.

 <dc:description>  A widely studied non-deterministic polynomial time (NP) hard problem lies in
finding a route between the two nodes of a graph. Often meta-heuristics
algorithms such as $A^{*}$ are employed on graphs with a large number of nodes.
Here, we propose a deep recurrent neural network architecture based on the
Sequence-2-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model, widely used, for instance in text
translation. Particularly, we illustrate that utilising a context vector that
has been learned from two different recurrent networks enables increased
accuracies in learning the shortest route of a graph. Additionally, we show
that one can boost the performance of the Seq2Seq network by smoothing the loss
function using a homotopy continuation of the decoder's loss function.

 <dc:description>  Learning a regression function using censored or interval-valued output data
is an important problem in fields such as genomics and medicine. The goal is to
learn a real-valued prediction function, and the training output labels
indicate an interval of possible values. Whereas most existing algorithms for
this task are linear models, in this paper we investigate learning nonlinear
tree models. We propose to learn a tree by minimizing a margin-based
discriminative objective function, and we provide a dynamic programming
algorithm for computing the optimal solution in log-linear time. We show
empirically that this algorithm achieves state-of-the-art speed and prediction
accuracy in a benchmark of several data sets.

 <dc:description>  Linear least-squares regression models can inform interpolative

bonus, this provides an interpretation as regression-aware principal component
analysis for a kind of canonical correlation analysis. The regression-aware
decompositions effectively enable supervision to inform classical
dimensionality reduction, which classically has been unsupervised.

 <dc:title>Is it reasonable to limit scientific coauthorship? There is no inflation

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the evolution of coauthorship in Spain in the social
sciences between 2000 and 2013. The goal is to explore to which extent
limitations on the number of coauthors established by Spanish national
evaluation agencies are justified. The analysis of 11681 papers authored by
researchers affiliated to Spanish institutions in 20 subject categories of the
social sciences reveals that there is no inflation in the number of authors,
team size is similar to that found in foreign papers and the number of authors
is dependent on international and institutional collaboration. With the
exception of Anthropology and Special Education, in no area the average of
authors by paper is higher than four. However, papers with a higher number of
authors receive more citations. Overall, our results suggest that there is no
justification on limiting the number of coauthors in publications,
acknowledging that their inclusion in the criteria employed by Spanish
evaluation agencies is to prevent honorary authors. Such limitation endangers
institutional and international collaboration, and consequently, high impact
research.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study several monotonicity axioms in approval-based
multi-winner voting rules. We consider monotonicity with respect to the support
received by the winners and also monotonicity in the size of the committee.
Monotonicity with respect to the support is studied when the set of voters does
not change and when new voters enter the election. For each of these two cases
we consider a strong and a weak version of the axiom. We observe certain
incompatibilities between the monotonicity axioms and well-known representation
axioms (extended/proportional justified representation) for the voting rules
that we analyze and provide formal proofs of incompatibility between some of
these axioms and perfect representation.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the local convergence of proximal splitting algorithms to solve
optimization problems that are convex besides a rank constraint. For this, we
show conditions under which the proximal operator of a function involving the
rank constraint is locally identical to the proximal operator of its convex
envelope, hence implying local convergence. The conditions imply that the
non-convex algorithms locally converge to a solution whenever a convex
relaxation involving the convex envelope can be expected to solve the
non-convex problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the use of hybrid simulation to build and compose
heterogeneous simulation scenarios that can be proficiently exploited to model
and represent the Internet of Things (IoT). Hybrid simulation is a methodology
that combines multiple modalities of modeling/simulation. Complex scenarios are
decomposed into simpler ones, each one being simulated through a specific
simulation strategy. All these simulation building blocks are then synchronized
and coordinated. This simulation methodology is an ideal one to represent IoT
setups, which are usually very demanding, due to the heterogeneity of possible
scenarios arising from the massive deployment of an enormous amount of sensors
and devices. We present a use case concerned with the distributed simulation of
smart territories, a novel view of decentralized geographical spaces that,
thanks to the use of IoT, builds ICT services to manage resources in a way that
is sustainable and not harmful to the environment. Three different simulation
models are combined together, namely, an adaptive agent-based parallel and
distributed simulator, an OMNeT++ based discrete event simulator and a
script-language simulator based on MATLAB. Results from a performance analysis
confirm the viability of using hybrid simulation to model complex IoT
scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Memory consistency models are notorious for being difficult to define
precisely, to reason about, and to verify. More than a decade of effort has
gone into nailing down the definitions of the ARM and IBM Power memory models,
and yet there still remain aspects of those models which (perhaps surprisingly)
remain unresolved to this day. In response to these complexities, there has
been somewhat of a recent trend in the (general-purpose) architecture community
to limit new memory models to being (multicopy) atomic: where store values can
be read by the issuing processor before being advertised to other processors.
TSO is the most notable example, used in the past by IBM 370 and SPARC-TSO, and
currently used in x86. Recently (in March 2017) ARM has also switched to a
multicopy atomic memory model, and the new RISC-V ISA and recent academic
proposals such as WMM are pushing to do the same.
  In this paper, we show that when memory models are atomic, it becomes much
easier to produce axiomatic definitions, operational definitions, and proofs of
equivalence than doing the same under non-atomic models. The increased ease
with which these definitions can be produced in turn allows architects to build
processors much more confidently, and yet the relaxed nature of the models we
propose still allows most or all of the performance of non-atomic models to be
retained. In fact, in this paper, we show that atomic memory models can be
defined in a way that is parametrized by basic instruction and fence orderings.
Our operational vs. axiomatic equivalence proofs, which are likewise
parameterized, show that the operational model is sound with respect to the
axioms and that the operational model is complete: that it can show any
behavior permitted by axiomatic model.

 <dc:description>  Efficient heterogeneous communication technologies are critical components to
provide flawless connectivity in smart cities. The proliferation of wireless
technologies, services and communication devices has created the need for green
and spectrally efficient communication technologies. Physical- layer network
coding (PNC) is now well-known as a potential candidate for delay-sensitive and
spectrally efficient communication applications, especially in bidirectional
relaying, and is therefore well-suited for smart city applications. In this
paper, we provide a brief introduction to PNC and the associated distance
shortening phenomenon which occurs at the relay. We discuss the issues with
existing schemes that mitigate the deleterious effect of distance shortening,
and we propose simple and effective solutions based on the use of multiple
antenna systems. Simulation results confirm that full diversity order can be
achieved in a PNC system by using antenna selection schemes based on the
Euclidean distance metric.

 <dc:title>GeneSIS-RT: Generating Synthetic Images for training Secondary
  Real-world Tasks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach for generating high-quality, synthetic data for
domain-specific learning tasks, for which training data may not be readily
available. We leverage recent progress in image-to-image translation to bridge
the gap between simulated and real images, allowing us to generate realistic
training data for real-world tasks using only unlabeled real-world images and a
simulation. GeneSIS-RT ameliorates the burden of having to collect labeled
real-world images and is a promising candidate for generating high-quality,
domain-specific, synthetic data.
  To show the effectiveness of using GeneSIS-RT to create training data, we
study two tasks: semantic segmentation and reactive obstacle avoidance. We
demonstrate that learning algorithms trained using data generated by GeneSIS-RT
make high-accuracy predictions and outperform systems trained on raw simulated
data alone, and as well or better than those trained on real data. Finally, we
use our data to train a quadcopter to fly 60 meters at speeds up to 3.4 m/s
through a cluttered environment, demonstrating that our GeneSIS-RT images can
be used to learn to perform mission-critical tasks.

 <dc:description>  Dijkstra observed that verifying correctness of a program is difficult and
conjectured that derivation of a program hand-in-hand with its proof of
correctness was the answer. We illustrate this goal-oriented approach by
applying it to the domain of dense linear algebra libraries for distributed
memory parallel computers. We show that algorithms that underlie the
implementation of most functionality for this domain can be systematically
derived to be correct. The benefit is that an entire family of algorithms for
an operation is discovered so that the best algorithm for a given architecture
can be chosen. This approach is very practical: Ideas inspired by it have been
used to rewrite the dense linear algebra software stack starting below the
Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and reaching up through the Elemental
distributed memory library, and every level in between. The paper demonstrates
how formal methods and rigorous mathematical techniques for correctness impact
HPC.

 <dc:description>  Audio-based multimedia retrieval tasks may identify semantic information in
audio streams, i.e., audio concepts (such as music, laughter, or a revving
engine). Conventional Gaussian-Mixture-Models have had some success in
classifying a reduced set of audio concepts. However, multi-class
classification can benefit from context window analysis and the discriminating
power of deeper architectures. Although deep learning has shown promise in
various applications such as speech and object recognition, it has not yet met
the expectations for other fields such as audio concept classification. This
paper explores, for the first time, the potential of deep learning in
classifying audio concepts on User-Generated Content videos. The proposed
system is comprised of two cascaded neural networks in a hierarchical
configuration to analyze the short- and long-term context information. Our
system outperforms a GMM approach by a relative 54%, a Neural Network by 33%,
and a Deep Neural Network by 12% on the TRECVID-MED database

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In multi-agent navigation, agents need to move towards their goal locations
while avoiding collisions with other agents and static obstacles, often without
communication with each other. Existing methods compute motions that are
optimal locally but do not account for the aggregated motions of all agents,
producing inefficient global behavior especially when agents move in a crowded
space. In this work, we develop methods to allow agents to dynamically adapt
their behavior to their local conditions. We accomplish this by formulating the
multi-agent navigation problem as an action-selection problem, and propose an
approach, ALAN, that allows agents to compute time-efficient and collision-free
motions. ALAN is highly scalable because each agent makes its own decisions on
how to move using a set of velocities optimized for a variety of navigation
tasks. Experimental results show that the agents using ALAN, in general, reach
their destinations faster than using ORCA, a state-of-the-art collision
avoidance framework, the Social Forces model for pedestrian navigation, and a
Predictive collision avoidance model.

 <dc:description>  We propose Marve, a system for extracting measurement values, units, and
related words from natural language text. Marve uses conditional random fields
(CRF) to identify measurement values and units, followed by a rule-based system
to find related entities, descriptors and modifiers within a sentence. Sentence
tokens are represented by an undirected graphical model, and rules are based on
part-of-speech and word dependency patterns connecting values and units to
contextual words. Marve is unique in its focus on measurement context and early
experimentation demonstrates Marve's ability to generate high-precision
extractions with strong recall. We also discuss Marve's role in refining
measurement requirements for NASA's proposed HyspIRI mission, a hyperspectral
infrared imaging satellite that will study the world's ecosystems. In general,
our work with HyspIRI demonstrates the value of semantic measurement
extractions in characterizing quantitative discussion contained in large
corpuses of natural language text. These extractions accelerate broad,
cross-cutting research and expose scientists new algorithmic approaches and
experimental nuances. They also facilitate identification of scientific
opportunities enabled by HyspIRI leading to more efficient scientific
investment and research.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of maximizing the harvested power in Multiple Input
Multiple Output (MIMO) Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer
(SWIPT) systems with power splitting reception. Different from recently
proposed designs, we target with our novel problem formulation at the jointly
optimal transmit precoding and receive uniform power splitting (UPS) ratio
maximizing the harvested power, while ensuring that the Quality-of-Service
(QoS) requirement of the MIMO link is satisfied. We assume generic practical
Radio Frequency (RF) Energy Harvesting (EH) receive operation that results in a
non-convex optimization problem for the design parameters, which we then solve
optimally after formulating it in an equivalent generalized convex form. Our
representative results including comparisons of achievable EH gains with
benchmark schemes provide key insights on various system parameters.

 <dc:description>  We study the construction of coresets for kernel density estimates. That is
we show how to approximate the kernel density estimate described by a large
point set with another kernel density estimate with a much smaller point set.
For characteristic kernels (including Gaussian and Laplace kernels), our
approximation preserves the $L_\infty$ error between kernel density estimates
within error $\epsilon$, with coreset size $2/\epsilon^2$, but no other aspects
of the data, including the dimension, the diameter of the point set, or the
bandwidth of the kernel common to other approximations. When the dimension is
unrestricted, we show this bound is tight for these kernels as well as a much
broader set.
  This work provides a careful analysis of the iterative Frank-Wolfe algorithm
adapted to this context, an algorithm called \emph{kernel herding}. This
analysis unites a broad line of work that spans statistics, machine learning,
and geometry.
  When the dimension $d$ is constant, we demonstrate much tighter bounds on the
size of the coreset specifically for Gaussian kernels, showing that it is
bounded by the size of the coreset for axis-aligned rectangles. Currently the
best known constructive bound is $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \log^d
\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, and non-constructively, this can be improved by
$\sqrt{\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}}$. This improves the best constant dimension
bounds polynomially for $d \geq 3$.

 <dc:description>  Using different methods for laying out a graph can lead to very different
visual appearances, with which the viewer perceives different information.
Selecting a &quot;good&quot; layout method is thus important for visualizing a graph. The
selection can be highly subjective and dependent on the given task. A common
approach to selecting a good layout is to use aesthetic criteria and visual
inspection. However, fully calculating various layouts and their associated
aesthetic metrics is computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a
machine learning approach to large graph visualization based on computing the
topological similarity of graphs using graph kernels. For a given graph, our
approach can show what the graph would look like in different layouts and
estimate their corresponding aesthetic metrics. An important contribution of
our work is the development of a new framework to design graph kernels. Our
experimental study shows that our estimation calculation is considerably faster
than computing the actual layouts and their aesthetic metrics. Also, our graph
kernels outperform the state-of-the-art ones in both time and accuracy. In
addition, we conducted a user study to demonstrate that the topological
similarity computed with our graph kernel matches perceptual similarity
assessed by human users.

 <dc:description>  Conventional seismic techniques for detecting the subsurface geologic
features are challenged by limited data coverage, computational inefficiency,
and subjective human factors. We developed a novel data-driven geological
feature detection approach based on pre-stack seismic measurements. Our
detection method employs an efficient and accurate machine-learning detection
approach to extract useful subsurface geologic features automatically.
Specifically, our method is based on kernel ridge regression model. The
conventional kernel ridge regression can be computationally prohibited because
of the large volume of seismic measurements. We employ a data reduction
technique in combination with the conventional kernel ridge regression method
to improve the computational efficiency and reduce memory usage. In particular,
we utilize a randomized numerical linear algebra technique, named Nystr\&quot;om
method, to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature space without
compromising the information content required for accurate detection. We
provide thorough computational cost analysis to show efficiency of our new
geological feature detection methods. We further validate the performance of
our new subsurface geologic feature detection method using synthetic surface
seismic data for 2D acoustic and elastic velocity models. Our numerical
examples demonstrate that our new detection method significantly improves the
computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy. Interestingly,
we show that our method yields a speed-up ratio on the order of $\sim10^2$ to
$\sim 10^3$ in a multi-core computational environment.

 <dc:title>Modular decomposition of transitive graphs and transitively orienting

 <dc:description>  The modular decomposition of a graph is a canonical representation of its
modules. Algorithms for computing the modular decomposition of directed and
undirected graphs differ significantly, with the undirected case being simpler,
and algorithms for directed graphs often work by reducing the problem to
decomposing undirected graphs. In this paper we show that transitive acyclic
digraphs have the same strong modules as their undirected versions. This
simplifies reduction for transitive digraphs, requiring only the computation of
strongly connected components. Furthermore, we are interested in permutation
graphs, where both the graph and its complement are transitively orientable.
Such graphs may be represented indirectly, as the transitive closure of a given
graph. For non-transitive graphs we present a linear-time algorithm which
allows us to identify prime-free modules w.r.t their transitive closure, which
speeds up both modular decomposition and transitive orientation for sparse
graphs. Finally, we show that any transitive orientation of a digraph's
complement also transitively orients the complement of the digraph's transitive
closure, allowing us to find such orientations in (near-)linear time.

 <dc:description>  Sentence vectors represent an appealing approach to meaning: learn an
embedding that encompasses the meaning of a sentence in a single vector, that
can be used for a variety of semantic tasks. Existing models for learning
sentence embeddings either require extensive computational resources to train
on large corpora, or are trained on costly, manually curated datasets of
sentence relations. We observe that humans naturally annotate the relations
between their sentences with discourse markers like &quot;but&quot; and &quot;because&quot;. These
words are deeply linked to the meanings of the sentences they connect. Using
this natural signal, we automatically collect a classification dataset from
unannotated text. Training a model to predict these discourse markers yields
high quality sentence embeddings. Our model captures complementary information
to existing models and achieves comparable generalization performance to state
of the art models.

 <dc:description>  Spectral decomposition of the Koopman operator is attracting attention as a
tool for the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. Dynamic mode
decomposition is a popular numerical algorithm for Koopman spectral analysis;
however, we often need to prepare nonlinear observables manually according to
the underlying dynamics, which is not always possible since we may not have any
a priori knowledge about them. In this paper, we propose a fully data-driven
method for Koopman spectral analysis based on the principle of learning Koopman
invariant subspaces from observed data. To this end, we propose minimization of
the residual sum of squares of linear least-squares regression to estimate a
set of functions that transforms data into a form in which the linear
regression fits well. We introduce an implementation with neural networks and
evaluate performance empirically using nonlinear dynamical systems and
applications.

 <dc:description>  Focusing on the task of identifying event temporal status, we find that
events directly or indirectly governing the target event in a dependency tree
are most important contexts. Therefore, we extract dependency chains containing
context events and use them as input in neural network models, which
consistently outperform previous models using local context words as input.
Visualization verifies that the dependency chain representation can effectively
capture the context events which are closely related to the target event and
play key roles in predicting event temporal status.

 <dc:title>A Finite Element Computational Framework for Active Contours on Graphs</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a new framework for the solution of active contour
models on graphs. With the use of the Finite Element Method we generalize
active contour models on graphs and reduce the problem from a partial
differential equation to the solution of a sparse non-linear system.
Additionally, we extend the proposed framework to solve models where the curve
evolution is locally constrained around its current location. Based on the
previous extension, we propose a fast algorithm for the solution of a wide
range active contour models. Last, we present a supervised extension of
Geodesic Active Contours for image segmentation and provide experimental
evidence for the effectiveness of our framework.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents, NeuroTrainer, an intelligent memory module with
in-memory accelerators that forms the building block of a scalable architecture
for energy efficient training for deep neural networks. The proposed
architecture is based on integration of a homogeneous computing substrate
composed of multiple processing engines in the logic layer of a 3D memory
module. NeuroTrainer utilizes a programmable data flow based execution model to
optimize memory mapping and data re-use during different phases of training
operation. A programming model and supporting architecture utilizes the
flexible data flow to efficiently accelerate training of various types of DNNs.
The cycle level simulation and synthesized design in 15nm FinFET showspower
efficiency of 500 GFLOPS/W, and almost similar throughput for a wide range of
DNNs including convolutional, recurrent, multi-layer-perceptron, and mixed
(CNN+RNN) networks

 <dc:description>  In building intelligent transportation systems such as taxi or rideshare
services, accurate prediction of travel time and distance is crucial for
customer experience and resource management. Using the NYC taxi dataset, which
contains taxi trips data collected from GPS-enabled taxis [23], this paper
investigates the use of deep neural networks to jointly predict taxi trip time
and distance. We propose a model, called ST-NN (Spatio-Temporal Neural
Network), which first predicts the travel distance between an origin and a
destination GPS coordinate, then combines this prediction with the time of day
to predict the travel time. The beauty of ST-NN is that it uses only the raw
trips data without requiring further feature engineering and provides a joint
estimate of travel time and distance. We compare the performance of ST-NN to
that of state-of-the-art travel time estimation methods, and we observe that
the proposed approach generalizes better than state-of-the-art methods. We show
that ST-NN approach significantly reduces the mean absolute error for both
predicted travel time and distance, about 17% for travel time prediction. We
also observe that the proposed approach is more robust to outliers present in
the dataset by testing the performance of ST-NN on the datasets with and
without outliers.

 <dc:title>Enhanced Mobile Computing Experience with Cloud Offloading</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Qian, Hao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The need for increased performance of mobile device directly conflicts with
the desire for longer battery life. Offloading compu-tation to multiple devices
is an effective method to reduce energy consumption and enhance performance for
mobile applications. Android provides mechanisms for creating mobile
applications but lacks a native scheduling system for determining where code
should be executed. This paper presents Jade, a system that adds sophisticated
energy-aware computation offloading capabilities to Android apps. Jade monitors
device and application status and automatically decides where code should be
executed. Jade dynamically adjusts offloading strategy by adapting to workload
variation, communication costs, and energy status in a distributed network of
Android and non-Android devices. Jade minimizes the burden on developers to
build applications with computation offloading ability by providing easy-to-use
Jade API. Evaluation shows that Jade can effectively reduce up to 39% of
average power consumption for mobile application while improving application
performance.

 <dc:title>One Password: An Encryption Scheme for Hiding Users' Register

 <dc:creator>Zhao, Bo</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, the attack which leverages register information (e.g.
accounts and passwords) leaked from 3rd party applications to try other
applications is popular and serious. We call this attack &quot;database collision&quot;.
Traditionally, people have to keep dozens of accounts and passwords for
different applications to prevent this attack. In this paper, we propose a
novel encryption scheme for hiding users' register information and preventing
this attack. Specifically, we first hash the register information using
existing safe hash function. Then the hash string is hidden, instead a
coefficient vector is stored for verification. Coefficient vectors of the same
register information are generated randomly for different applications. Hence,
the original information is hardly cracked by dictionary based attack or
database collision in practice. Using our encryption scheme, each user only
needs to keep one password for dozens of applications.

 <dc:description>  We establish a unified analytical framework for load balancing systems, which
allows us to construct a general class $\Pi$ of policies that are both
throughput optimal and heavy-traffic delay optimal. This general class $\Pi$
includes as special cases popular policies such as join-shortest-queue and
power-of-$d$, but not the join-idle-queue (JIQ) policy. In fact, we show that
JIQ, which is not in $\Pi$, is actually not heavy-traffic delay optimal. Owing
to the significant flexibility offered by class $\Pi$, we are able to design a
new policy called join-below-threshold (JBT-d), which maintains the simplicity
of pull-based policies such as JIQ, but updates its threshold dynamically. We
prove that JBT-$d$ belongs to the class $\Pi$ when the threshold is picked
appropriately and thus it is heavy-traffic delay optimal. Extensive simulations
show that the new policy not only has a low complexity in message rates, but
also achieves excellent delay performance, comparable to the optimal
join-shortest-queue in various system settings.

 <dc:title>Fast initial guess estimation for digital image correlation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Digital image correlation (DIC) is a widely used optical metrology for
quantitative deformation measurement due to its non-contact, low-cost, highly
precise feature. DIC relies on nonlinear optimization algorithm. Thus it is
quite important to efficiently obtain a reliable initial guess. The most widely
used method for obtaining initial guess is reliability-guided digital image
correlation (RG-DIC) method, which is reliable but path-dependent. This
path-dependent method limits the further improvement of computation speed of
DIC using parallel computing technology, and error of calculation may be spread
out along the calculation path. Therefore, a reliable and path-independent
algorithm which is able to provide reliable initial guess is desirable to reach
full potential of the ability of parallel computing. In this paper, an
algorithm used for initial guess estimation is proposed. Numerical and real
experiments show that the proposed algorithm, adaptive incremental
dissimilarity approximations algorithm (A-IDA), has the following
characteristics: 1) Compared with inverse compositional Gauss-Newton (IC-GN)
sub-pixel registration algorithm, the computational time required by A-IDA
algorithm is negligible, especially when subset size is relatively large; 2)
the efficiency of A-IDA algorithm is less influenced by search range; 3) the
efficiency is less influenced by subset size; 4) it is easy to select the
threshold for the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A major issue of locally repairable codes is their robustness. If a local
repair group is not able to perform the repair process, this will result in
increasing the repair cost. Therefore, it is critical for a locally repairable
code to have multiple repair groups. In this paper we consider robust locally
repairable coding schemes which guarantee that there exist multiple alternative
local repair groups for any single failure such that the failed node can still
be repaired locally even if some of the repair groups are not available. We use
linear programming techniques to establish upper bounds on the code size of
these codes. Furthermore, we address the update efficiency problem of the
distributed data storage networks. Any modification on the stored data will
result in updating the content of the storage nodes. Therefore, it is essential
to minimise the number of nodes which need to be updated by any change in the
stored data. We characterise the update-efficient storage code properties and
establish the necessary conditions that the weight enumerator of these codes
need to satisfy.

Long-Short Memory (LSTM) and basic statistics in multiple multistep time series
prediction. LSTM can dive into all the pages and learn the general trends of

not fluctuate too much from the reality. A recent Kaggle competition on 145K

 <dc:title>Fast, Accurate and Fully Parallelizable Digital Image Correlation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Digital image correlation (DIC) is a widely used optical metrology for
surface deformation measurements. DIC relies on nonlinear optimization method.
Thus an initial guess is quite important due to its influence on the converge
characteristics of the algorithm. In order to obtain a reliable, accurate
initial guess, a reliability-guided digital image correlation (RG-DIC) method,
which is able to intelligently obtain a reliable initial guess without using
time-consuming integer-pixel registration, was proposed. However, the RG-DIC
and its improved methods are path-dependent and cannot be fully parallelized.
Besides, it is highly possible that RG-DIC fails in the full-field analysis of
deformation without manual intervention if the deformation fields contain large
areas of discontinuous deformation. Feature-based initial guess is highly
robust while it is relatively time-consuming. Recently, path-independent
algorithm, fast Fourier transform-based cross correlation (FFT-CC) algorithm,
was proposed to estimate the initial guess. Complete parallelizability is the
major advantage of the FFT-CC algorithm, while it is sensitive to small
deformation. Wu et al proposed an efficient integer-pixel search scheme, but
the parameters of this algorithm are set by the users empirically. In this
technical note, a fully parallelizable DIC method is proposed. Different from
RG-DIC method, the proposed method divides DIC algorithm into two parts:
full-field initial guess estimation and sub-pixel registration. The proposed
method has the following benefits: 1) providing a pre-knowledge of deformation
fields; 2) saving computational time; 3) reducing error propagation; 4)
integratability with well-established DIC algorithms; 5) fully
parallelizability.

 <dc:description>  There are many classical problems in P whose time complexities have not been
improved over the past decades. Recent studies of &quot;Hardness in P&quot; have revealed
that, for several of such problems, the current fastest algorithm is the best
possible under some complexity assumptions. To bypass this difficulty, Fomin et
al. (SODA 2017) introduced the concept of fully polynomial FPT algorithms. For
a problem with the current best time complexity $O(n^c)$, the goal is to design
an algorithm running in $k^{O(1)}n^{c'}$ time for a parameter $k$ and a
constant $c'&lt;c$. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of graph problems
in P parameterized by tree-depth, a graph parameter related to tree-width. We
show that a simple divide-and-conquer method can solve many graph problems,
including Weighted Matching, Negative Cycle Detection, Minimum Weight Cycle,
Replacement Paths, and 2-hop Cover, in $O(\mathrm{td}\cdot m)$ time or
$O(\mathrm{td}\cdot (m+n\log n))$ time, where $\mathrm{td}$ is the tree-depth
of the input graph. Because any graph of tree-width $\mathrm{tw}$ has
tree-depth at most $(\mathrm{tw}+1)\log_2 n$, our algorithms also run in
$O(\mathrm{tw}\cdot m\log n)$ time or $O(\mathrm{tw}\cdot (m+n\log n)\log n)$
time. These results match or improve the previous best algorithms parameterized
by tree-width. Especially, we solve an open problem of fully polynomial FPT
algorithm for Weighted Matching parameterized by tree-width posed by Fomin et
al.

 <dc:description>  In practical analysis, domain knowledge about analysis target has often been
accumulated, although, typically, such knowledge has been discarded in the
statistical analysis stage, and the statistical tool has been applied as a
black box. In this paper, we introduce sign constraints that are a handy and
simple representation for non-experts in generic learning problems. We have
developed two new optimization algorithms for the sign-constrained regularized
loss minimization, called the sign-constrained Pegasos (SC-Pega) and the
sign-constrained SDCA (SC-SDCA), by simply inserting the sign correction step
into the original Pegasos and SDCA, respectively. We present theoretical
analyses that guarantee that insertion of the sign correction step does not
degrade the convergence rate for both algorithms. Two applications, where the
sign-constrained learning is effective, are presented. The one is exploitation
of prior information about correlation between explanatory variables and a
target variable. The other is introduction of the sign-constrained to
SVM-Pairwise method. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvement
of generalization performance by introducing sign constraints in both
applications.

 <dc:description>  In future full-duplex communications, the cancellation of self-interference
(SI) arising from hardware nonidealities, will play an important role in the
design of mobile-scale devices. To this end, we introduce an optimal digital SI
cancellation solution for shared-antenna-based direct-conversion transceivers
(DCTs). To establish that the underlying widely linear signal model is not
adequate for strong transmit signals, the impacts of various circuit
imperfections, including power amplifier (PA) distortion, frequency-dependent
I/Q imbalances, quantization noise and thermal noise, on the performance of the
conventional augmented complex least mean square (ACLMS) based SI canceller,
are analyzed. In order to achieve a sufficient
signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) when the nonlinear SI components
are not negligible, we propose an augmented nonlinear CLMS (ANCLMS) based SI
canceller for a joint cancellation of both the linear and nonlinear SI
components by virtue of a widely-nonlinear model fit. A rigorous mean and mean
square performance evaluation is conducted to justify the performance
advantages of the proposed scheme over the conventional ACLMS solution.
Simulations on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless
local area network (WLAN) standard compliant waveforms support the analysis.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian inference for models that have an intractable partition function is
known as a doubly intractable problem, where standard Monte Carlo methods are
not applicable. The past decade has seen the development of auxiliary variable
Monte Carlo techniques (M{\o}ller et al., 2006; Murray et al., 2006) for
tackling this problem; these approaches being members of the more general class
of pseudo-marginal, or exact-approximate, Monte Carlo algorithms (Andrieu and
Roberts, 2009), which make use of unbiased estimates of intractable posteriors.
Everitt et al. (2017) investigated the use of exact-approximate importance
sampling (IS) and sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in doubly intractable problems,
but focussed only on SMC algorithms that used data-point tempering. This paper
describes SMC samplers that may use alternative sequences of distributions, and
describes ways in which likelihood estimates may be improved adaptively as the
algorithm progresses, building on ideas from Moores et al. (2015). This
approach is compared with a number of alternative algorithms for doubly
intractable problems, including approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), which
we show is closely related to the method of M{\o}ller et al. (2006).

 <dc:description>  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications has drawn significant interest
recently due to many advantages such as low cost, high mobility, and on-demand
deployment. This paper addresses the issue of physical-layer security in a UAV
communication system, where a UAV sends confidential information to a
legitimate receiver in the presence of a potential eavesdropper which are both
on the ground. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the system by jointly
optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a finite horizon. In
contrast to the existing literature on wireless security with static nodes, we
exploit the mobility of the UAV in this paper to enhance the secrecy rate via a
new trajectory design. Although the formulated problem is non-convex and
challenging to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the problem
efficiently, based on the block coordinate descent and successive convex
optimization methods. Specifically, the UAV's transmit power and trajectory are
each optimized with the other fixed in an alternating manner until convergence.
Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the
secrecy rate of the UAV communication system, as compared to benchmark schemes
without transmit power control or trajectory optimization.

 <dc:description>  Machine learning systems are increasingly used to make decisions about
people's lives, such as whether to give someone a loan or whether to interview
someone for a job. This has led to considerable interest in making such machine
learning systems fair. One approach is to transform the input data used by the
algorithm. This can be achieved by passing each input data point through a
representation function prior to its use in training or testing. Techniques for
learning such representation functions from data have been successful
empirically, but typically lack theoretical fairness guarantees. We show that
it is possible to prove that a representation function is fair according to
common measures of both group and individual fairness, as well as useful with
respect to a target task. These provable properties can be used in a governance
model involving a data producer, a data user and a data regulator, where there
is a separation of concerns between fairness and target task utility to ensure
transparency and prevent perverse incentives. We formally define the 'cost of
mistrust' of using this model compared to the setting where there is a single
trusted party, and provide bounds on this cost in particular cases. We present
a practical approach to learning fair representation functions and apply it to
financial and criminal justice datasets. We evaluate the fairness and utility
of these representation functions using measures motivated by our theoretical
results.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel tractable generative model that extends Sum-Product
Networks (SPNs) and significantly boost their power. We call it
Sum-Product-Quotient Networks (SPQNs), whose core concept is to incorporate
conditional distributions into the model by direct computation using quotient
nodes, e.g. $P(A|B){=}\frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$. We provide sufficient conditions
for the tractability of SPQNs that generalize and relax the decomposable and
complete tractability conditions of SPNs. These relaxed conditions give rise to
an exponential boost to the expressive efficiency of our model, i.e. we prove
that there are distributions which SPQNs can compute efficiently but require
SPNs to be of exponential size. Thus, we narrow the gap in expressivity between
tractable graphical models and other Neural Network-based generative models.

 <dc:description>  A vector-valued model-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) procedure is proposed for
identifying faulty/falsified sensor measurements. First, given the system
dynamics, we derive tools for tuning the CUSUM procedure in the fault/attack
free case to fulfill a desired detection performance (in terms of false alarm
rate). We use the widely-used chi-squared fault/attack detection procedure as a
benchmark to compare the performance of the CUSUM. In particular, we
characterize the state degradation that a class of attacks can induce to the
system while enforcing that the detectors (CUSUM and chi-squared) do not raise
alarms. In doing so, we find the upper bound of state degradation that is
possible by an undetected attacker. We quantify the advantage of using a
dynamic detector (CUSUM), which leverages the history of the state, over a
static detector (chi-squared) which uses a single measurement at a time.
Simulations of a chemical reactor with heat exchanger are presented to
illustrate the performance of our tools.

 <dc:description>  Querying graph databases has recently received much attention. We propose a
new approach to this problem, which balances competing goals of expressive
power, language clarity and computational complexity. A distinctive feature of
our approach is the ability to express properties of minimal (e.g. shortest)
and maximal (e.g. most valuable) paths satisfying given criteria. To express
complex properties in a modular way, we introduce labelling-generating
ontologies. The resulting formalism is computationally attractive -- queries
can be answered in non-deterministic logarithmic space in the size of the
database.

 <dc:description>  Network overlays, running on top of the existing Internet substrate, are of
perennial value to Internet end-users in the context of, e.g., real-time
applications. Such overlays can employ traffic relays to yield path latencies
lower than the direct paths, a phenomenon known as Triangle Inequality
Violation (TIV). Past studies identify the opportunities of reducing latency
using TIVs. However, they do not investigate the gains of strategically
selecting relays in Colocation Facilities (Colos). In this work, we answer the
following questions: (i) how Colo-hosted relays compare with other relays as
well as with the direct Internet, in terms of latency (RTT) reductions; (ii)
what are the best locations for placing the relays to yield these reductions.
To this end, we conduct a large-scale one-month measurement of inter-domain
paths between RIPE Atlas (RA) nodes as endpoints, located at eyeball networks.
We employ as relays Planetlab nodes, other RA nodes, and machines in Colos. We
examine the RTTs of the overlay paths obtained via the selected relays, as well
as the direct paths. We find that Colo-based relays perform the best and can
achieve latency reductions against direct paths, ranging from a few to 100s of
milliseconds, in 76% of the total cases; 75% (58% of total cases) of these
reductions require only 10 relays in 6 large Colos.

 <dc:title>Multi-Batch Experience Replay for Fast Convergence of Continuous Action
  Control</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Policy gradient methods for direct policy optimization are widely considered
to obtain optimal policies in continuous Markov decision process (MDP)
environments. However, policy gradient methods require exponentially many
samples as the dimension of the action space increases. Thus, off-policy
learning with experience replay is proposed to enable the agent to learn by
using samples of other policies. Generally, large replay memories are preferred
to minimize the sample correlation but large replay memories can yield large
bias or variance in importance-sampling-based off-policy learning. In this
paper, we propose a multi batch experience replay scheme suitable for
off-policy actor-critic-style policy gradient methods such as the proximal
policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which maintains the advantages of
experience replay and accelerates learning without causing large bias. To
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, we apply the proposed
experience replay scheme to the PPO algorithm and various continuous control
tasks. Numerical results show that our algorithm converges faster and closer to
the global optimum than other policy gradient methods.

 <dc:title>Revisiting the Design Issues of Local Models for Japanese

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The research trend in Japanese predicate-argument structure (PAS) analysis is
shifting from pointwise prediction models with local features to global models
designed to search for globally optimal solutions. However, the existing global
models tend to employ only relatively simple local features; therefore, the
overall performance gains are rather limited. The importance of designing a
local model is demonstrated in this study by showing that the performance of a
sophisticated local model can be considerably improved with recent feature
embedding methods and a feature combination learning based on a neural network,
outperforming the state-of-the-art global models in $F_1$ on a common benchmark
dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a new approach for classification of target task using limited
labeled target data as well as enormous unlabeled source data is proposed which
is called self-taught learning. The target and source data can be drawn from
different distributions. In the previous approaches, covariate shift assumption
is considered where the marginal distributions p(x) change over domains and the
conditional distributions p(y|x) remain the same. In our approach, we propose a
new objective function which simultaneously learns a common space T(.) where
the conditional distributions over domains p(T(x)|y) remain the same and learns
robust SVM classifiers for target task using both source and target data in the
new representation. Hence, in the proposed objective function, the hidden label
of the source data is also incorporated. We applied the proposed approach on
Caltech-256, MSRC+LMO datasets and compared the performance of our algorithm to
the available competing methods. Our method has a superior performance to the
successful existing algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Safe autonomous driving may be one of the most difficult engineering
challenges that any artificial intelligence system has been asked to do since
the birth of AI over sixty years ago. The difficulty is not within the task
itself, but rather in the extremely small margin of allowable error given the
human life at stake and the extremely large number of edge cases that have to
be accounted for. In other words, we task these systems to expect the
unexpected with near 100% accuracy, which is a technical challenge for machine
learning methods that to date have generally been better at memorizing the
expected than predicting the unexpected. In fact, the process of efficiently
and automatically discovering the edge cases of driving may be the key to
solving this engineering challenge. In this work, we propose and evaluate a
method for discovering edge cases by monitoring the disagreement between two
monocular-vision-based automated steering systems. The first is a proprietary
Tesla Autopilot system equipped in the first generation of Autopilot-capable
vehicles. The second is a end-to-end neural network trained on a large-scale
naturalistic dataset of 420 hours or 45 million frames of autonomous driving in
Tesla vehicles.

 <dc:description>  The presence of noisy instances in mobile phone data is a fundamental issue
for classifying user phone call behavior (i.e., accept, reject, missed and
outgoing), with many potential negative consequences. The classification
accuracy may decrease and the complexity of the classifiers may increase due to
the number of redundant training samples. To detect such noisy instances from a
training dataset, researchers use naive Bayes classifier (NBC) as it identifies
misclassified instances by taking into account independence assumption and
conditional probabilities of the attributes. However, some of these
misclassified instances might indicate usages behavioral patterns of individual
mobile phone users. Existing naive Bayes classifier based noise detection
techniques have not considered this issue and, thus, are lacking in
classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose an improved noise detection
technique based on naive Bayes classifier for effectively classifying users'
phone call behaviors. In order to improve the classification accuracy, we
effectively identify noisy instances from the training dataset by analyzing the
behavioral patterns of individuals. We dynamically determine a noise threshold
according to individual's unique behavioral patterns by using both the naive
Bayes classifier and Laplace estimator. We use this noise threshold to identify
noisy instances. To measure the effectiveness of our technique in classifying
user phone call behavior, we employ the most popular classification algorithm
(e.g., decision tree). Experimental results on the real phone call log dataset
show that our proposed technique more accurately identifies the noisy instances
from the training datasets that leads to better classification accuracy.

 <dc:description>  To precisely reach for an object with a humanoid robot, it is of central
importance to have good knowledge of both end-effector, object pose and shape.
In this work we propose a framework for markerless visual servoing on unknown
objects, which is divided in four main parts: I) a least-squares minimization
problem is formulated to find the volume of the object graspable by the robot's
hand using its stereo vision; II) a recursive Bayesian filtering technique,
based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) filtering, estimates the 6D pose
(position and orientation) of the robot's end-effector without the use of
markers; III) a nonlinear constrained optimization problem is formulated to
compute the desired graspable pose about the object; IV) an image-based visual
servo control commands the robot's end-effector toward the desired pose. We
demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of our approach with extensive
experiments on the iCub humanoid robot platform, achieving real-time
computation, smooth trajectories and sub-pixel precisions.

 <dc:description>  Distributed systems designed to serve clients across the world often make use
of geo-replication to attain low latency and high availability. Conflict-free
Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) allow the design of predictable multi-master
replication and support eventual consistency of replicas that are allowed to
transiently diverge. CRDTs come in two flavors: state-based, where a state is
changed locally and shipped and merged into other replicas; operation-based,
where operations are issued locally and reliably causal broadcast to all other
replicas. However, the standard definition of op-based CRDTs is very
encompassing, allowing even sending the full-state, and thus imposing storage
and dissemination overheads as well as blurring the distinction from
state-based CRDTs. We introduce pure op-based CRDTs, that can only send
operations to other replicas, drawing a clear distinction from state-based
ones. Data types with commutative operations can be trivially implemented as
pure op-based CRDTs using standard reliable causal delivery; whereas data types
having non-commutative operations are implemented using a PO-Log, a partially
ordered log of operations, and making use of an extended API, i.e., a Tagged
Causal Stable Broadcast (TCSB), that provides extra causality information upon
delivery and later informs when delivered messages become causally stable,
allowing further PO-Log compaction. The framework is illustrated by a catalog
of pure op-based specifications for classic CRDTs, including counters,
multi-value registers, add-wins and remove-wins sets.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we present the work towards improving the overall workflow
of the Percutaneous Coronary Interventions (PCI) procedures by capacitating the
imaging instruments to precisely monitor the steps of the procedure. In the
long term, such capabilities can be used to optimize the image acquisition to
reduce the amount of dose or contrast media employed during the procedure. We
present the automatic VOIDD algorithm to detect the vessel of intervention
which is going to be treated during the procedure by combining information from
the vessel image with contrast agent injection and images acquired during
guidewire tip navigation. Due to the robust guidewire tip segmentation method,
this algorithm is also able to automatically detect the sequence corresponding
to guidewire navigation. We present an evaluation methodology which
characterizes the correctness of the guide wire tip detection and correct
identification of the vessel navigated during the procedure. On a dataset of
2213 images from 8 sequences of 4 patients, VOIDD identifies
vessel-of-intervention with accuracy in the range of 88% or above and absence
of tip with accuracy in range of 98% or above depending on the test case.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the first results of a pilot experiment in the
capture and interpretation of multimodal signals of human experts engaged in
solving challenging chess problems. Our goal is to investigate the extent to
which observations of eye-gaze, posture, emotion and other physiological
signals can be used to model the cognitive state of subjects, and to explore
the integration of multiple sensor modalities to improve the reliability of
detection of human displays of awareness and emotion. We observed chess players
engaged in problems of increasing difficulty while recording their behavior.
Such recordings can be used to estimate a participant's awareness of the
current situation and to predict ability to respond effectively to challenging
situations. Results show that a multimodal approach is more accurate than a
unimodal one. By combining body posture, visual attention and emotion, the
multimodal approach can reach up to 93% of accuracy when determining player's
chess expertise while unimodal approach reaches 86%. Finally this experiment
validates the use of our equipment as a general and reproducible tool for the
study of participants engaged in screen-based interaction and/or problem
solving.

 <dc:description>  We study the average stack cost of Buechi pushdown automata (Buechi PDA). We
associate a non-negative price with each stack symbol and define the cost of a
stack as the sum of costs of all its elements. We introduce and study the
average stack cost problem (ASC), which asks whether there exists an accepting
run of a given Buechi PDA such that the long-run average of stack costs is
below some given threshold. The ASC problem generalizes mean-payoff objective
and can be used to express quantitative properties of pushdown systems. In
particular, we can compute the average response time using the ASC problem. We
show that the ASC problem can be solved in polynomial time.

 <dc:description>  Understanding driving behaviors is essential for improving safety and
mobility of our transportation systems. Data is usually collected via
simulator-based studies or naturalistic driving studies. Those techniques allow
for understanding relations between demographics, road conditions and safety.
On the other hand, they are very costly and time consuming. Thanks to the
ubiquity of smartphones, we have an opportunity to substantially complement
more traditional data collection techniques with data extracted from phone
sensors, such as GPS, accelerometer gyroscope and camera. We developed
statistical models that provided insight into driver behavior in the San
Francisco metro area based on tens of thousands of driver logs. We used novel
data sources to support our work. We used cell phone sensor data drawn from
five hundred drivers in San Francisco to understand the speed of traffic across
the city as well as the maneuvers of drivers in different areas. Specifically,
we clustered drivers based on their driving behavior. We looked at driver norms
by street and flagged driving behaviors that deviated from the norm.

 <dc:description>  For over twenty years, the term 'cosmic web' has guided our understanding of
the large-scale arrangement of matter in the cosmos, accurately evoking the
concept of a network of galaxies linked by filaments. But the physical
correspondence between the cosmic web and structural-engineering or textile
'spiderwebs' is even deeper than previously known, and extends to origami
tessellations as well. Here we explain that in a good structure-formation
approximation known as the adhesion model, threads of the cosmic web form a
spiderweb, i.e. can be strung up to be entirely in tension. The correspondence
is exact if nodes sampling voids are included, and if structure is excluded
within collapsed regions (walls, filaments and haloes), where dark-matter
multistreaming and baryonic physics affect the structure. We also suggest how
concepts arising from this link might be used to test cosmological models: for
example, to test for large-scale anisotropy and rotational flows in the cosmos.

 <dc:description>  Deriving insights from high-dimensional data is one of the core problems in
data mining. The difficulty mainly stems from the fact that there are
exponentially many variable combinations to potentially consider, and there are
infinitely many if we consider weighted combinations, even for linear
combinations. Hence, an obvious question is whether we can automate the search
for interesting patterns and visualizations. In this paper, we consider the
setting where a user wants to learn as efficiently as possible about
real-valued attributes. For example, to understand the distribution of crime
rates in different geographic areas in terms of other (numerical, ordinal
and/or categorical) variables that describe the areas. We introduce a method to
find subgroups in the data that are maximally informative (in the formal
Information Theoretic sense) with respect to a single or set of real-valued
target attributes. The subgroup descriptions are in terms of a succinct set of
arbitrarily-typed other attributes. The approach is based on the Subjective
Interestingness framework FORSIED to enable the use of prior knowledge when
finding most informative non-redundant patterns, and hence the method also
supports iterative data mining.

 <dc:description>  It is well known that the containment problem (as well as the equivalence
problem) for semilinear sets is $\log$-complete in $\Pi_2^p$. In this paper, we
show that already the containment problem for linear sets is $\log$-hard (and
therefore also $\log$-complete) in $\Pi_2^p$. This holds even when we use a
unary encoding for the numerical input parameters or when we restrict the
problem to $1$-dimensional linear sets (i.e, linear sets in $\nats_0$).
However, combining both restrictions, the problem becomes solvable in
polynomial time.

 <dc:title>Hierarchical Convolutional-Deconvolutional Neural Networks for Automatic
  Liver and Tumor Segmentation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yuan, Yading</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Automatic segmentation of liver and its tumors is an essential step for
extracting quantitative imaging biomarkers for accurate tumor detection,
diagnosis, prognosis and assessment of tumor response to treatment. MICCAI 2017
Liver Tumor Segmentation Challenge (LiTS) provides a common platform for
comparing different automatic algorithms on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT
images in tasks including 1) liver segmentation, 2) liver tumor segmentation,
and 3) tumor burden estimation. We participate this challenge by developing a
hierarchical framework based on deep fully convolutional-deconvolutional neural
networks (CDNN). A simple CDNN model is firstly trained to provide a quick but
coarse segmentation of the liver on the entire CT volume, then another CDNN is
applied to the liver region for fine liver segmentation. At last, the segmented
liver region, which is enhanced by histogram equalization, is employed as an
additional input to the third CDNN for tumor segmentation. Jaccard distance is
used as loss function when training CDNN models to eliminate the need of sample
re-weighting. Our framework is trained using the 130 challenge training cases
provided by LiTS. The evaluation on the 70 challenge testing cases resulted in
a mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.963 for liver segmentation, a
mean DSC of 0.657 for tumor segmentation, and a root mean square error (RMSE)
of 0.017 for tumor burden estimation, which ranked our method in the first,
fifth and third place, respectively

 <dc:title>Improving optimal control of grid-connected lithium-ion batteries

 <dc:description>  The increased deployment of intermittent renewable energy generators opens up
opportunities for grid-connected energy storage. Batteries offer significant
flexibility but are relatively expensive at present. Battery lifetime is a key
factor in the business case, and it depends on usage, but most techno-economic
analyses do not account for this. For the first time, this paper quantifies the
annual benefits of grid-connected batteries including realistic physical
dynamics and nonlinear electrochemical degradation. Three lithium-ion battery
models of increasing realism are formulated, and the predicted degradation of
each is compared with a large-scale experimental degradation data set
(Mat4Bat). A respective improvement in RMS capacity prediction error from 11\%
to 5\% is found by increasing the model accuracy. The three models are then
used within an optimal control algorithm to perform price arbitrage over one
year, including degradation. Results show that the revenue can be increased
substantially while degradation can be reduced by using more realistic models.
The estimated best case profit using a sophisticated model is a 175%
improvement compared with the simplest model. This illustrates that using a
simplistic battery model in a techno-economic assessment of grid-connected
batteries might substantially underestimate the business case and lead to
erroneous conclusions.

 <dc:description>  One of the fundamental issue in wireless sensor network is conserving energy
and thus extending the lifetime of the network. In this paper we investigate
the coverage problem in camera sensor networks by developing two algorithms
which consider network lifetime. Also, it is assumed that camera sensors spread
randomly over a large area in order to monitor a designated air space. To
increase the lifetime of the network, the density of distributed sensors could
be such that a subset of sensors can cover the required air space. As a sensor
dies another sensor should be selected to compensate for the dead one and
reestablish the complete coverage. This process should be continued until
complete coverage is not achievable by the existing sensors. Thereafter, a
graceful degradation of the coverage is desirable. The goal is to elongate the
lifetime of the network while maintaining a maximum possible coverage of the
designated air space. Since the selection of a subset of sensors for complete
coverage of the target area is an NP-complete problem we present a class of
heuristics for this case. This is done by prioritizing the sensors based on
their visual and communicative properties.

 <dc:description>  Assigning a satisfactory truly concurrent semantics to Petri nets with
confusion and distributed decisions is a long standing problem, especially if
one wants to fully replace nondeterminism with probability distributions and no
stochastic structure is desired/allowed. Here we propose a general solution
based on a recursive, static decomposition of (finite, occurrence) nets in loci
of decision, called structural branching cells (s-cells). Each s-cell exposes a
set of alternatives, called transactions, that can be equipped with a general
probabilistic distribution. The solution is formalised as a transformation from
a given Petri net to another net whose transitions are the transactions of the
s-cells and whose places are the places of the original net, with some
auxiliary structure for bookkeeping. The resulting net is confusion-free,
namely if a transition is enabled, then all its conflicting alternatives are
also enabled. Thus sets of conflicting alternatives can be equipped with
probability distributions, while nonintersecting alternatives are purely
concurrent and do not introduce any nondeterminism: they are Church-Rosser and
their probability distributions are independent. The validity of the
construction is witnessed by a tight correspondence result with the recent
approach by Abbes and Benveniste (AB) based on recursively stopped
configurations in event structures. Some advantages of our approach over AB's
are that: i) s-cells are defined statically and locally in a compositional way,
whereas AB's branching cells are defined dynamically and globally; ii) their
recursively stopped configurations correspond to possible executions, but the
existing concurrency is not made explicit. Instead, our resulting nets are
equipped with an original concurrency structure exhibiting a so-called complete
concurrency property.

 <dc:description>  As vehicle maneuver data becomes abundant for assisted or autonomous driving,
their implication of privacy invasion/leakage has become an increasing concern.
In particular, the surface for fingerprinting a driver will expand
significantly if the driver's identity can be linked with the data collected
from his mobile or wearable devices which are widely deployed worldwide and
have increasing sensing capabilities. In line with this trend, this paper
investigates a fast emerging driving data source that has driver's privacy
implications. We first show that such privacy threats can be materialized via
any mobile device with IMUs (e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer). We then
present Dri-Fi (Driver Fingerprint), a driving data analytic engine that can
fingerprint the driver with vehicle turn(s). Dri-Fi achieves this based on IMUs
data taken only during the vehicle's turn(s). Such an approach expands the
attack surface significantly compared to existing driver fingerprinting
schemes. From this data, Dri-Fi extracts three new features --- acceleration
along the end-of-turn axis, its deviation, and the deviation of the yaw rate
--- and exploits them to identify the driver. Our extensive evaluation shows
that an adversary equipped with Dri-Fi can correctly fingerprint the driver
within just one turn with 74.1%, 83.5%, and 90.8% accuracy across 12, 8, and 5
drivers --- typical of an immediate family or close-friends circle ---
respectively. Moreover, with measurements on more than one turn, the adversary
can achieve up to 95.3%, 95.4%, and 96.6% accuracy across 12, 8, and 5 drivers,
respectively.

 <dc:title>Additivity of Information in Multilayer Networks via Additive Gaussian
  Noise Transforms</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Multilayer (or deep) networks are powerful probabilistic models based on
multiple stages of a linear transform followed by a non-linear (possibly
random) function. In general, the linear transforms are defined by matrices and
the non-linear functions are defined by information channels. These models have
gained great popularity due to their ability to characterize complex
probabilistic relationships arising in a wide variety of inference problems.
The contribution of this paper is a new method for analyzing the fundamental
limits of statistical inference in settings where the model is known. The
validity of our method can be established in a number of settings and is
conjectured to hold more generally. A key assumption made throughout is that
the matrices are drawn randomly from orthogonally invariant distributions.
  Our method yields explicit formulas for 1) the mutual information; 2) the
minimum mean-squared error (MMSE); 3) the existence and locations of certain
phase-transitions with respect to the problem parameters; and 4) the stationary
points for the state evolution of approximate message passing algorithms. When
applied to the special case of models with multivariate Gaussian channels our
method is rigorous and has close connections to free probability theory for
random matrices. When applied to the general case of non-Gaussian channels, our
method provides a simple alternative to the replica method from statistical
physics. A key observation is that the combined effects of the individual
components in the model (namely the matrices and the channels) are additive

 <dc:description>  The Epicurean Philosophy is commonly thought as simplistic and hedonistic.
Here I discuss how this is a misconception and explore its link to
Reinforcement Learning. Based on the letters of Epicurus, I construct an
objective function for hedonism which turns out to be equivalent of the
Reinforcement Learning objective function when omitting the discount factor. I
then discuss how Plato and Aristotle 's views that can be also loosely linked
to Reinforcement Learning, as well as their weaknesses in relationship to it.
Finally, I emphasise the close affinity of the Epicurean views and the Bellman
equation.

 <dc:description>  We show that every 4-connected planar graph has a $B_3$-EPG representation,
i.e., every vertex is represented by a curve on the grid with at most three
bends, and two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding curves
share an edge of the grid. Our construction is based on a modification of the
representation by touching thickened $L$-shapes proposed by Gon\c{c}alves et

 <dc:title>Towards Scalable Spectral Clustering via Spectrum-Preserving
  Sparsification</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The eigendeomposition of nearest-neighbor (NN) graph Laplacian matrices is
the main computational bottleneck in spectral clustering. In this work, we
introduce a highly-scalable, spectrum-preserving graph sparsification algorithm
that enables to build ultra-sparse NN (u-NN) graphs with guaranteed
preservation of the original graph spectrums, such as the first few
eigenvectors of the original graph Laplacian. Our approach can immediately lead
to scalable spectral clustering of large data networks without sacrificing
solution quality. The proposed method starts from constructing low-stretch
spanning trees (LSSTs) from the original graphs, which is followed by
iteratively recovering small portions of &quot;spectrally critical&quot; off-tree edges
to the LSSTs by leveraging a spectral off-tree embedding scheme. To determine
the suitable amount of off-tree edges to be recovered to the LSSTs, an
eigenvalue stability checking scheme is proposed, which enables to robustly
preserve the first few Laplacian eigenvectors within the sparsified graph.
Additionally, an incremental graph densification scheme is proposed for
identifying extra edges that have been missing in the original NN graphs but
can still play important roles in spectral clustering tasks. Our experimental
results for a variety of well-known data sets show that the proposed method can
dramatically reduce the complexity of NN graphs, leading to significant
speedups in spectral clustering.

 <dc:title>Throughput Region of Spatially Correlated Interference Packet Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Vahid, Alireza</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Calderbank, Robert</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In multi-user wireless packet networks interference, typically modeled as
packet collision, is the throughput bottleneck. Users become aware of the
interference pattern via feedback and use this information for contention
resolution and for packet retransmission. Conventional random access protocols
interrupt communication to resolve contention which reduces network throughput
and increases latency and power consumption. In this work we take a different
approach and we develop opportunistic random access protocols rather than
pursuing conventional methods. We allow wireless nodes to communicate without
interruption and to observe the interference pattern. We then use this
interference pattern knowledge and channel statistics to counter the negative
impact of interference. The result of our approach is better use of resources
(e.g., time and energy) and higher network throughput. We prove the optimality
of our protocols using an extremal rank-ratio inequality. An important part of
our contributions is the integration of spatial correlation in our assumptions
and results. We identify spatial correlation regimes in which inherently
outdated feedback becomes as good as idealized instantaneous feedback, and
correlation regimes in which feedback does not provide any throughput gain.

 <dc:description>  Tracking movement of mobile nodes has received significant scientific and
commercial interest, but long term tracking of resource-constrained mobile
nodes remains challenging due to the high energy consumption of satellite
receivers. Cooperative position tracking has been proposed for energy
efficiency, however, all the cooperative schemes use opportunistic cooperation
and optimize for either energy or accuracy. Considering the existence of a
reasonably stable group of mobile nodes like animals, birds, and mobile assets,
we propose a cluster-based cooperative tracking algorithm, where cluster head
centrally coordinates resource usage among cluster members. Variants of this
strategy include the use of a cooperative Kalman filter with and without
inertial sensor inputs to estimate nodes positions. We use the Boid flocking
algorithm to generate group position movements in 3D and perform various
experiments to compare the energy and position accuracy tradeoff of our
proposed scheme with individual-based tracking and existing cooperative
schemes. We perform the experiments for fixed periodic GPS sampling and dynamic
GPS sampling triggered by node position error uncertainty tolerance limit.
Experiments results show that in periodic sampling scheme cooperative tracking
yields more than one-quarter reduction in energy consumption and more than
one-third improvement in position accuracy over individual-based tracking,
however, results for dynamic sampling scheme are comparable with existing
cooperative scheme.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing customer feedback is the best way to channelize the data into new
marketing strategies that benefit entrepreneurs as well as customers. Therefore
an automated system which can analyze the customer behavior is in great demand.
Users may write feedbacks in any language, and hence mining appropriate
information often becomes intractable. Especially in a traditional
feature-based supervised model, it is difficult to build a generic system as
one has to understand the concerned language for finding the relevant features.
In order to overcome this, we propose deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based approaches that do not require
handcrafting of features. We evaluate these techniques for analyzing customer
feedback sentences in four languages, namely English, French, Japanese and
Spanish. Our empirical analysis shows that our models perform well in all the
four languages on the setups of IJCNLP Shared Task on Customer Feedback
Analysis. Our model achieved the second rank in French, with an accuracy of
71.75% and third ranks for all the other languages.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of smartwatches poses new challenges to information security.
Although there are mature touch-based authentication methods for smartphones,
the effectiveness of using these methods on smartwatches is still unclear. We
conducted a user study (n=16) to evaluate how authentication methods (PIN and
Pattern), UIs (Square and Circular), and display sizes (38mm and 42mm) affect
authentication accuracy, speed, and security. Circular UIs are tailored to
smartwatches with fewer UI elements. Results show that 1) PIN is more accurate
and secure than Pattern; 2) Pattern is much faster than PIN; 3) Square UIs are
more secure but less accurate than Circular UIs; 4) display size does not
affect accuracy or speed, but security; 5) Square PIN is the most secure method
of all. The study also reveals a security concern that participants' favorite
method is not the best in any of the measures. We finally discuss implications
for future touch-based smartwatch authentication design.

However, obtaining demonstrations suitable for learning a policy that maps from
raw pixels to actions can be challenging. In this paper we describe how
consumer-grade Virtual Reality headsets and hand tracking hardware can be used
to naturally teleoperate robots to perform complex tasks. We also describe how
imitation learning can learn deep neural network policies (mapping from pixels
to actions) that can acquire the demonstrated skills. Our experiments showcase
the effectiveness of our approach for learning visuomotor skills.

supported by optical virtualise-able transceivers (V-BVT). A monitoring and
network resource configuration scheme is proposed to include the hardware
monitoring in both Ethernet and Optical layers. The scheme depicts the data and
control interactions among multiple network layers under the software defined
network (SDN) background, as well as the application that analyses the
monitored data obtained from the database. We also present a re-configuration

based on two criteria. The proposed monitoring scheme is experimentally
demonstrated with OpenFlow (OF) extensions for a holistic (re-)configuration
across both layers in Ethernet switches and V-BVTs.

 <dc:title>Analysis of planar ornament patterns via motif asymmetry assumption and

 <dc:creator>Adanova, Venera</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tari, Sibel</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Planar ornaments, a.k.a. wallpapers, are regular repetitive patterns which
exhibit translational symmetry in two independent directions. There are exactly
$17$ distinct planar symmetry groups. We present a fully automatic method for
complete analysis of planar ornaments in $13$ of these groups, specifically,
the groups called $p6m, \, p6, \, p4g, \,p4m, \,p4, \, p31m, \,p3m, \, p3, \,
cmm, \, pgg, \, pg, \, p2$ and $p1$. Given the image of an ornament fragment,
we present a method to simultaneously classify the input into one of the $13$
groups and extract the so called fundamental domain (FD), the minimum region
that is sufficient to reconstruct the entire ornament. A nice feature of our
method is that even when the given ornament image is a small portion such that
it does not contain multiple translational units, the symmetry group as well as
the fundamental domain can still be defined. This is because, in contrast to
common approach, we do not attempt to first identify a global translational
repetition lattice. Though the presented constructions work for quite a wide
range of ornament patterns, a key assumption we make is that the perceivable
motifs (shapes that repeat) alone do not provide clues for the underlying
symmetries of the ornament. In this sense, our main target is the planar
arrangements of asymmetric interlocking shapes, as in the symmetry art of
Escher.

 <dc:description>  A popular method of force-directed graph drawing is multidimensional scaling
using graph-theoretic distances as input. We present an algorithm to minimize
its energy function, known as stress, by using a relaxation method that
considers a single pair of vertices at a time. Our results show that relaxation
can reach lower stress levels faster and more consistently than majorization,
without needing help from a good initialization. We then present various
real-world applications to show how the unique properties of relaxation make it
easier to produce constrained layouts than previous approaches. We also show
how relaxation can be directly applied within the sparse stress approximation
of Ortmann et al. [1], making the algorithm scalable up to large graphs.

 <dc:title>Flat modal fixpoint logics with the converse modality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Enqvist, Sebastian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We prove a generic completeness result for a class of modal fixpoint logics
corresponding to flat fragments of the two-way mu-calculus, extending earlier
work by Santocanale and Venema. We observe that Santocanale and Venema's proof
that least fixpoints in the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of certain flat fixpoint
logics are constructive, using finitary adjoints, no longer works when the
converse modality is introduced. Instead, our completeness proof directly
constructs a model for a consistent formula, using the induction rule in a way
that is similar to the standard completeness proof for propositional dynamic
logic. This approach is combined with the concept of a focus, which has
previously been used in tableau based reasoning for modal fixpoint logics.

 <dc:title>Supporting Requirements Engineering Research that Industry Needs: The
  Naming the Pain in Requirements Engineering Initiative</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fern&#xe1;ndez, Daniel M&#xe9;ndez</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In light of the 40th jubilee of Requirements Engineering (RE), roughly 40
experts met in Switzerland to discuss where our discipline stands today. As of
today, the common view is, indisputably, that RE as a discipline is stable and
respected, as pointed out by Sarah Gregory when covering the seminar in her
column to which articles like this one are invited to present ongoing research.
However, it is also evident that after 40 years of promising research,
conducting research that industry needs is still an ongoing challenge. Research
that industry needs means research that solves industrial problems
practitioners face; but do we really understand those problems? Here, I want to
recapitulate on this research challenge and outline an initiative, the Naming
the Pain in Requirements Engineering Initiative, that aims at tackling this
problem.

 <dc:description>  In this work we study tilings of regions in the square lattice with L-shaped
trominoes. Deciding the existence of a tiling with L-trominoes for an arbitrary
region in general is NP-complete, nonetheless, we indentify restrictions to the
problem where either it remains NP-complete or it has a polynomial time
algorithm. First we show that an aztec diamond of order $n$ always has an
L-tromino tiling if and only if $n(n+1)\equiv 0\mod 3$; if an aztec diamond has
at least two defects or holes, however, the problem of deciding a tiling is
NP-complete. Then we study tilings of arbitrary regions where only $180^\circ$
rotations of L-trominoes are available. For this particular case we show that
deciding the existence of a tiling remains NP-complete, yet, if a region
contains certain so-called &quot;forbidden polyominoes&quot; as subregions, then there
exists a polynomial time algorithm for deciding a tiling.

 <dc:title>Secret-Key Generation in Many-to-One Networks: An Integrated
  Game-Theoretic and Information-Theoretic Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chou, Remi A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Yener, Aylin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper considers secret-key generation between several agents and a base
station that observe independent and identically distributed realizations of
correlated random variables. Each agent wishes to generate the longest possible
individual key with the base station by means of public communication. All keys
must be jointly kept secret from all external entities. Also each agent has a
level of security clearance; this setup requires that keys generated by agents
at a given level must be be kept secret from the agents at a strictly superior
level. In this many-to-one secret-key generation setting, it can be shown that
agents with the same level of security clearance can take advantage of a
collective protocol to increase the sum-rate of their generated keys. However,
when each agent is only interested in maximizing its own secret-key rate,
agents may be unwilling to participate in a collective protocol. Furthermore,
when such a collective protocol is employed, how to fairly allocate individual
key rates arises as a valid issue. This paper studies this tension between
cooperation and self-interest with a game-theoretic treatment. The work
establishes that, for each level of security clearance, cooperation is in the
best interest of all individualistic agents and that there exists individual
secret-key rate allocations that incentivize the agents to follow the protocol.
Additionally, an explicit low-complexity coding scheme based on polar codes and
hash functions that achieves such allocations is proposed.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of weakly supervised object localization where only
image-level annotations are available for training object detectors. Numerous
methods have been proposed to tackle this problem through mining object
proposals. However, a substantial amount of noise in object proposals causes
ambiguities for learning discriminative object models. Such approaches are
sensitive to model initialization and often converge to undesirable local
minimum solutions. In this paper, we propose to overcome these drawbacks by
progressive representation adaptation with two main steps: 1) classification
adaptation and 2) detection adaptation. In classification adaptation, we
transfer a pre-trained network to a multi-label classification task for
recognizing the presence of a certain object in an image. Through the
classification adaptation step, the network learns discriminative
representations that are specific to object categories of interest. In
detection adaptation, we mine class-specific object proposals by exploiting two
scoring strategies based on the adapted classification network. Class-specific
proposal mining helps remove substantial noise from the background clutter and
potential confusion from similar objects. We further refine these proposals
using multiple instance learning and segmentation cues. Using these refined
object bounding boxes, we fine-tune all the layer of the classification network
and obtain a fully adapted detection network. We present detailed experimental
validation on the PASCAL VOC and ILSVRC datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that our progressive representation adaptation algorithm performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We develop a theory of `behavioral communities' and the `atomic structure' of
networks. We define atoms to be groups of agents whose behaviors always match
each other in a set of coordination games played on the network. This provides
a microfoundation for a method of detecting communities in social and economic
networks. We provide theoretical results characterizing such behavior-based
communities and atomic structures and discussing their properties in large
random networks. We also provide an algorithm for identifying behavioral
communities. We discuss applications including: a method of estimating
underlying preferences by observing behavioral conventions in data, and
optimally seeding diffusion processes when there are peer interactions and
homophily. We illustrate the techniques with applications to high school
friendship networks and rural village networks.

 <dc:description>  With a large number of sensors and control units in networked systems,
distributed support vector machines (DSVMs) play a fundamental role in scalable
and efficient multi-sensor classification and prediction tasks. However, DSVMs
are vulnerable to adversaries who can modify and generate data to deceive the
system to misclassification and misprediction. This work aims to design defense
strategies for DSVM learner against a potential adversary. We establish a
game-theoretic framework to capture the conflicting interests between the DSVM
learner and the attacker. The Nash equilibrium of the game allows predicting
the outcome of learning algorithms in adversarial environments, and enhancing
the resilience of the machine learning through dynamic distributed learning
algorithms. We show that the DSVM learner is less vulnerable when he uses a
balanced network with fewer nodes and higher degree. We also show that adding
more training samples is an efficient defense strategy against an attacker. We
present secure and resilient DSVM algorithms with verification method and
rejection method, and show their resiliency against adversary with numerical
experiments.

 <dc:description>  Charcoal rot is a fungal disease that thrives in warm dry conditions and
affects the yield of soybeans and other important agronomic crops worldwide.
There is a need for robust, automatic and consistent early detection and
quantification of disease symptoms which are important in breeding programs for
the development of improved cultivars and in crop production for the
implementation of disease control measures for yield protection. Current
methods of plant disease phenotyping are predominantly visual and hence are
slow and prone to human error and variation. There has been increasing interest
in hyperspectral imaging applications for early detection of disease symptoms.
However, the high dimensionality of hyperspectral data makes it very important
to have an efficient analysis pipeline in place for the identification of
disease so that effective crop management decisions can be made. The focus of
this work is to determine the minimal number of most effective hyperspectral
bands that can distinguish between healthy and diseased specimens early in the
growing season. Healthy and diseased hyperspectral data cubes were captured at
3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 days after inoculation. We utilized inoculated and control
specimens from 4 different genotypes. Each hyperspectral image was captured at
240 different wavelengths in the range of 383 to 1032 nm. We used a combination
of genetic algorithm as an optimizer and support vector machines as a
classifier for identification of maximally effective band combinations. A
binary classification between healthy and infected samples using six selected
band combinations obtained a classification accuracy of 97% and a F1 score of
0.97 for the infected class. The results demonstrated that these carefully
chosen bands are more informative than RGB images, and could be used in a
multispectral camera for remote identification of charcoal rot infection in
soybean.

 <dc:description>  Systematic checkpointing of the machine state makes roll-back and restart of
execution from a safe state possible upon detection of an error. The energy
overhead of checkpointing, however, as incurred by storage and communication of
the machine state, grows with the frequency of checkpointing. Amortizing this
overhead becomes especially challenging, considering the growth of expected
error rates as an artifact of contemporary technology scaling, as checkpointing
frequency tends to increase with increasing error rates. At the same time, due
to imbalances in technology scaling, recomputing data can become more energy
efficient than storing and retrieving precomputed data. Recomputation of data
(which otherwise would be read from a checkpoint) can reduce the frequency of
checkpointing along with the data size to be checkpointed, and thereby mitigate
checkpointing overhead. This paper quantitatively characterizes a
recomputation-enabled checkpointing framework which can reduce the storage
overhead of checkpointing by up to 23.91%; the performance overhead by up to
11.92%, and the energy overhead by up to 12.53%, respectively.

 <dc:description>  Among many existing algorithms, convergence methods are the most popular
means of computing square root and the reciprocal of square root of numbers. An
initial approximation is required in these methods. Look up tables (LUT) are
employed to produce the initial approximation. In this paper a number of
methods are suggested to reduce the size of the look up tables. The precision
of the initial approximation plays an important role in the quality of the
final result. There are constraints for the use of a LUT in terms of its size
and its access time. Therefore, the optimization of the LUTs must be done in a
way to minimize hardware while offering acceptable convergence speed and
exactitude.

 <dc:description>  Robots that navigate through human crowds need to be able to plan safe,
efficient, and human predictable trajectories. This is a particularly
challenging problem as it requires the robot to predict future human
trajectories within a crowd where everyone implicitly cooperates with each
other to avoid collisions. Previous approaches to human trajectory prediction
have modeled the interactions between humans as a function of proximity.
However, that is not necessarily true as some people in our immediate vicinity
moving in the same direction might not be as important as other people that are
further away, but that might collide with us in the future. In this work, we
propose Social Attention, a novel trajectory prediction model that captures the
relative importance of each person when navigating in the crowd, irrespective
of their proximity. We demonstrate the performance of our method against a
state-of-the-art approach on two publicly available crowd datasets and analyze
the trained attention model to gain a better understanding of which surrounding
agents humans attend to, when navigating in a crowd.

results of Conant about the extension property for partial automorphisms and
extends an earlier result of the first and the last author giving the Ramsey

 <dc:title>How to Ask for Technical Help? Evidence-based Guidelines for Writing
  Questions on Stack Overflow</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Context: The success of Stack Overflow and other community-based
question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) sites depends mainly on the will of their members to
answer others' questions. In fact, when formulating requests on Q&amp;A sites, we
are not simply seeking for information. Instead, we are also asking for other
people's help and feedback. Understanding the dynamics of the participation in
Q&amp;A communities is essential to improve the value of crowdsourced knowledge.
  Objective: In this paper, we investigate how information seekers can increase
the chance of eliciting a successful answer to their questions on Stack
Overflow by focusing on the following actionable factors: affect, presentation
quality, and time.
  Method: We develop a conceptual framework of factors potentially influencing
the success of questions in Stack Overflow. We quantitatively analyze a set of
over 87K questions from the official Stack Overflow dump to assess the impact
of actionable factors on the success of technical requests. The information
seeker reputation is included as a control factor. Furthermore, to understand
the role played by affective states in the success of questions, we
qualitatively analyze questions containing positive and negative emotions.
Finally, a survey is conducted to understand how Stack Overflow users perceive
the guideline suggestions for writing questions.
  Results: We found that regardless of user reputation, successful questions
are short, contain code snippets, and do not abuse with uppercase characters.
As regards affect, successful questions adopt a neutral emotional style.
  Conclusion: We provide evidence-based guidelines for writing effective
questions on Stack Overflow that software engineers can follow to increase the
chance of getting technical help. As for the role of affect, we empirically
confirmed community guidelines that suggest avoiding rudeness in question
writing.

 <dc:description>  In most macro-scale robotics systems , propulsion and controls are enabled
through a physical tether or complex on-board electronics and batteries. A
tether simplifies the design process but limits the range of motion of the
robot, while on-board controls and power supplies are heavy and complicate the
design process. Here we present a simple design principle for an untethered,
entirely soft, swimming robot with the ability to achieve preprogrammed,
directional propulsion without a battery or on-board electronics. Locomotion is
achieved by employing actuators that harness the large displacements of
bistable elements, triggered by surrounding temperature changes. Powered by
shape memory polymer (SMP) muscles, the bistable elements in turn actuates the
robot's fins. Our robots are fabricated entirely using a commercially available
3D printer with no post-processing. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the
ability to program a vessel, which can autonomously deliver a cargo and
navigate back to the deployment point.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of automated machine learning, automated hyperparameter
optimization methods are by now routinely used. However, this progress is not
yet matched by equal progress on automatic analyses that yield information
beyond performance-optimizing hyperparameter settings. In this work, we aim to
answer the following two questions: Given an algorithm, what are generally its
most important hyperparameters, and what are good priors over their
hyperparameters' ranges to draw values from? We present methodology and a
framework to answer these questions based on meta-learning across many
datasets. We apply this methodology using the experimental meta-data available
on OpenML to determine the most important hyperparameters of support vector
machines, random forests and Adaboost, and to infer priors for all their
hyperparameters. Our results, obtained fully automatically, provide a
quantitative basis to focus efforts in both manual algorithm design and in
automated hyperparameter optimization. Our experiments confirm that the
selected hyperparameters are indeed the most important ones and that our
obtained priors also lead to improvements in hyperparameter optimization.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with a new type of warehousing system, Robotic Mobile
Fulfillment Systems (RMFS). In such systems, robots are sent to carry storage
units, so-called &quot;pods&quot;, from the inventory and bring them to human operators
working at stations. At the stations, the items are picked according to
customers' orders. There exist new decision problems in such systems, for
example, the reallocation of pods after their visits at work stations or the
selection of pods to fulfill orders. In order to analyze decision strategies
for these decision problems and relations between them, we develop a simulation
framework called &quot;RAWSim-O&quot; in this paper. Moreover, we show a real-world
application of our simulation framework by integrating simple robot prototypes
based on vacuum cleaning robots.

 <dc:title>Entropy operates in non-linear semifields</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We set out to demonstrate that the R\'enyi entropies with parameter $\alpha$
are better thought of as operating in a type of non-linear semiring called a
positive semifield. We show how the R\'enyi's postulates lead to Pap's
g-calculus where the functions carrying out the domain transformation are
Renyi's information function and its inverse. In its turn, Pap's g-calculus
under R\'enyi's information function transforms the set of positive reals into
a family of semirings where &quot;standard&quot; product has been transformed into sum
and &quot;standard&quot; sum into a power-deformed sum. Consequently, the transformed
product has an inverse whence the structure is actually that of a positive
semifield. Instances of this construction lead into idempotent analysis and
tropical algebra as well as to less exotic structures. Furthermore, shifting
the definition of the $\alpha$ parameter shows in full the intimate relation of
the R\'enyi entropies to the weighted generalized power means. We conjecture
that this is one of the reasons why tropical algebra procedures, like the
Viterbi algorithm of dynamic programming, morphological processing, or neural
networks are so successful in computational intelligence applications. But
also, why there seem to exist so many procedures to deal with &quot;information&quot; at
large.

 <dc:description>  Motion planning is an extremely well-studied problem in the robotics
community, yet existing work largely falls into one of two categories:
computationally efficient but with few if any safety guarantees, or able to
give stronger guarantees but at high computational cost. This work builds on a
recent development called FaSTrack in which a slow offline computation provides
a modular safety guarantee for a faster online planner. We introduce the notion
of &quot;meta-planning&quot; in which a refined offline computation enables safe
switching between different online planners. This provides autonomous systems
with the ability to adapt motion plans to a priori unknown environments in
real-time as sensor measurements detect new obstacles, and the flexibility to
maneuver differently in the presence of obstacles than they would in free
space, all while maintaining a strict safety guarantee. We demonstrate the
meta-planning algorithm both in simulation and a hardware experiment using a
small Crazyflie 2.0 quadrotor.

 <dc:title>STDP Based Pruning of Connections and Weight Quantization in Spiking
  Neural Networks for Energy Efficient Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with a large number of weights and varied
weight distribution can be difficult to implement in emerging in-memory
computing hardware due to the limitations on crossbar size (implementing dot
product), the constrained number of conductance levels in non-CMOS devices and
the power budget. We present a sparse SNN topology where non-critical
connections are pruned to reduce the network size and the remaining critical
synapses are weight quantized to accommodate for limited conductance levels.
Pruning is based on the power law weight-dependent Spike Timing Dependent
Plasticity (STDP) model; synapses between pre- and post-neuron with high spike
correlation are retained, whereas synapses with low correlation or uncorrelated
spiking activity are pruned. The weights of the retained connections are
quantized to the available number of conductance levels. The process of pruning
non-critical connections and quantizing the weights of critical synapses is
performed at regular intervals during training. We evaluated our sparse and
quantized network on MNIST dataset and on a subset of images from Caltech-101
dataset. The compressed topology achieved a classification accuracy of 90.1%
(91.6%) on the MNIST (Caltech-101) dataset with 3.1x (2.2x) and 4x (2.6x)
improvement in energy and area, respectively. The compressed topology is energy
and area efficient while maintaining the same classification accuracy of a
2-layer fully connected SNN topology.

 <dc:description>  Ever growing volume and velocity of data coupled with decreasing attention
span of end users underscore the critical need for real-time analytics. In this
regard, anomaly detection plays a key role as an application as well as a means
to verify data fidelity. Although the subject of anomaly detection has been
researched for over 100 years in a multitude of disciplines such as, but not
limited to, astronomy, statistics, manufacturing, econometrics, marketing, most
of the existing techniques cannot be used as is on real-time data streams.
Further, the lack of characterization of performance -- both with respect to
real-timeliness and accuracy -- on production data sets makes model selection
very challenging. To this end, we present an in-depth analysis, geared towards
real-time streaming data, of anomaly detection techniques. Given the
requirements with respect to real-timeliness and accuracy, the analysis
presented in this paper should serve as a guide for selection of the &quot;best&quot;
anomaly detection technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
characterization of anomaly detection techniques proposed in very diverse set
of fields, using production data sets corresponding to a wide set of
application domains.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider the robust submodular maximization problem subject
a matroid constraint in the offline and online setting. In the offline version,
we are given a collection of $k$ monotone submodular functions and matroid on a
ground set of size $n$. The goal is to select one independent set that
maximizes the minimum of the submodular functions. Given the complexity of the
problem, we design a bi-criteria approximation algorithm that returns a set
that is the union of a logarithmic number of independent sets. In the online
version of the problem, we receive a new collection of functions at each time
step and aim to pick an independent set in every stage. We measure the
performance of the algorithm in the regret setting. Again, we give a
bi-criteria approximation algorithm which gives a (nearly) optimal
approximation as well as regret bounds. This result rely crucially on modifying
the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader algorithm of [Kalai and Vempala, 2005].

 <dc:description>  In Crowdfunding platforms, people turn their prototype ideas into real
products by raising money from the crowd, or invest in someone else's projects.
In reward-based crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo,
selecting accurate reward delivery duration becomes crucial for creators,
backers, and platform providers to keep the trust between the creators and the
backers, and the trust between the platform providers and users. According to
Kickstarter, 35% backers did not receive rewards on time. Unfortunately, little
is known about on-time and late reward delivery projects, and there is no prior
work to estimate reward delivery duration. To fill the gap, in this paper, we
(i) extract novel features that reveal latent difficulty levels of project
rewards; (ii) build predictive models to identify whether a creator will
deliver all rewards in a project on time or not; and (iii) build a regression
model to estimate accurate reward delivery duration (i.e., how long it will
take to produce and deliver all the rewards). Experimental results show that
our models achieve good performance -- 82.5% accuracy, 78.1 RMSE, and 0.108
NRMSE at the first 5% of the longest reward delivery duration.

 <dc:description>  We study and compare the human visual system and state-of-the-art deep neural
networks on classification of distorted images. Different from previous works,
we limit the display time to 100ms to test only the early mechanisms of the
human visual system, without allowing time for any eye movements or other

outperforms modern deep neural networks under blurry and noisy images. These
findings motivate future research into developing more robust deep networks.

 <dc:description>  We study a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN) consisting of multiple
mobile sensors or robots. Two key issues in MWSNs - energy consumption, which
is dominated by sensor movement, and sensing coverage - have attracted plenty
of attention, but the interaction of these issues is not well studied. To take
both sensing coverage and movement energy consumption into consideration, we
model the sensor deployment problem as a constrained source coding problem. %,
which can be applied to different coverage tasks, such as area coverage, target
coverage, and barrier coverage. Our goal is to find an optimal sensor
deployment to maximize the sensing coverage with specific energy constraints.
We derive necessary conditions to the optimal sensor deployment with (i) total
energy constraint and (ii) network lifetime constraint. Using these necessary
conditions, we design Lloyd-like algorithms to provide a trade-off between
sensing coverage and energy consumption. Simulation results show that our
algorithms outperform the existing relocation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Recent developments within memory-augmented neural networks have solved
sequential problems requiring long-term memory, which are intractable for
traditional neural networks. However, current approaches still struggle to
scale to large memory sizes and sequence lengths. In this paper we show how
access to memory can be encoded geometrically through a HyperNEAT-based Neural
Turing Machine (HyperENTM). We demonstrate that using the indirect HyperNEAT
encoding allows for training on small memory vectors in a bit-vector copy task
and then applying the knowledge gained from such training to speed up training
on larger size memory vectors. Additionally, we demonstrate that in some
instances, networks trained to copy bit-vectors of size 9 can be scaled to
sizes of 1,000 without further training. While the task in this paper is
simple, these results could open up the problems amendable to networks with
external memories to problems with larger memory vectors and theoretically
unbounded memory sizes.

 <dc:description>  Although aviation accidents are rare, safety incidents occur more frequently
and require careful analysis for providing actionable recommendations to
improve safety. Automatically analyzing safety incidents using flight data is
challenging because of the absence of labels on timestep-wise events in a
flight, complexity of multi-dimensional data, and lack of scalable tools to
perform analysis over large number of events. In this work, we propose a
precursor mining algorithm that identifies correlated patterns in
multidimensional time series to explain an adverse event. Precursors are
valuable to systems health and safety monitoring in explaining and forecasting
anomalies. Current precursor mining methods suffer from poor scalability to
high dimensional time series data and in capturing long-term memory. We propose
an approach by combining multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent
neural networks (DRNN) to take advantage of MIL's ability to model
weakly-supervised data and DRNN's ability to model long term memory processes,
to scale well to high dimensional data and to large volumes of data using GPU
parallelism. We apply the proposed method to find precursors and offer
explanations to high speed exceedance safety incidents using commercial flight
data.

 <dc:description>  Consider a generalized multiterminal source coding system, where $\ell\choose
m$ encoders, each observing a distinct size-$m$ subset of $\ell$ ($\ell\geq 2$)
zero-mean unit-variance symmetrically correlated Gaussian sources with
correlation coefficient $\rho$, compress their observations in such a way that
a joint decoder can reconstruct the sources within a prescribed mean squared
error distortion based on the compressed data. The optimal rate-distortion
performance of this system was previously known only for the two extreme cases
$m=\ell$ (the centralized case) and $m=1$ (the distributed case), and except
when $\rho=0$, the centralized system can achieve strictly lower compression
rates than the distributed system under all non-trivial distortion constraints.
Somewhat surprisingly, it is established in the present paper that the optimal
rate-distortion performance of the afore-described generalized multiterminal
source coding system with $m\geq 2$ coincides with that of the centralized
system for all distortions when $\rho\leq 0$ and for distortions below an
explicit positive threshold (depending on $m$) when $\rho&gt;0$. Moreover, when
$\rho&gt;0$, the minimum achievable rate of generalized multiterminal source
coding subject to an arbitrary positive distortion constraint $d$ is shown to
be within a finite gap (depending on $m$ and $d$) from its centralized
counterpart in the large $\ell$ limit except for possibly the critical
distortion $d=1-\rho$.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes an accelerated first-order algorithm we call the Robust
Momentum Method for optimizing smooth strongly convex functions. The algorithm
has a single scalar parameter that can be tuned to trade off robustness to
gradient noise versus worst-case convergence rate. At one extreme, the
algorithm is faster than Nesterov's Fast Gradient Method by a constant factor
but more fragile to noise. At the other extreme, the algorithm reduces to the
Gradient Method and is very robust to noise. The algorithm design technique is
inspired by methods from classical control theory and the resulting algorithm
has a simple analytical form. Algorithm performance is verified on a series of
numerical simulations.

 <dc:description>  We propose Bayesian hypernetworks: a framework for approximate Bayesian
inference in neural networks. A Bayesian hypernetwork, $h$, is a neural network
which learns to transform a simple noise distribution, $p(\epsilon) =
\mathcal{N}(0,I)$, to a distribution $q(\theta) \doteq q(h(\epsilon))$ over the
parameters $\theta$ of another neural network (the &quot;primary network&quot;). We train
$q$ with variational inference, using an invertible $h$ to enable efficient
estimation of the variational lower bound on the posterior $p(\theta |
\mathcal{D})$ via sampling. In contrast to most methods for Bayesian deep
learning, Bayesian hypernets can represent a complex multimodal approximate
posterior with correlations between parameters, while enabling cheap i.i.d.
sampling of $q(\theta)$. We demonstrate these qualitative advantages of
Bayesian hypernets, which also achieve competitive performance on a suite of
tasks that demonstrate the advantage of estimating model uncertainty, including
active learning and anomaly detection.

 <dc:description>  Complex interactions between entities are often represented as edges in a
network. In practice, the network is often constructed from noisy measurements
and inevitably contains some errors. In this paper we consider the problem of
estimating a network from multiple noisy observations where edges of the
original network are recorded with both false positives and false negatives.
This problem is motivated by neuroimaging applications where brain networks of
a group of patients with a particular brain condition could be viewed as noisy
versions of an unobserved true network corresponding to the disease. The key to
optimally leveraging these multiple observations is to take advantage of
network structure, and here we focus on the case where the true network
contains communities. Communities are common in real networks in general and in
particular are believed to be presented in brain networks. Under a community
structure assumption on the truth, we derive an efficient method to estimate
the noise levels and the original network, with theoretical guarantees on the
convergence of our estimates. We show on synthetic networks that the
performance of our method is close to an oracle method using the true parameter
values, and apply our method to fMRI brain data, demonstrating that it
constructs stable and plausible estimates of the population network.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of
economic and pricing theory for resource management in the evolving fifth
generation (5G) wireless networks. The 5G wireless networks are envisioned to
overcome existing limitations of cellular networks in terms of data rate,
capacity, latency, energy efficiency, spectrum efficiency, coverage,
reliability, and cost per information transfer. To achieve the goals, the 5G
systems will adopt emerging technologies such as massive Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO), mmWave communications, and dense Heterogeneous Networks
(HetNets). However, 5G involves multiple entities and stakeholders that may
have different objectives, e.g., high data rate, low latency, utility
maximization, and revenue/profit maximization. This poses a number of
challenges to resource management designs of 5G. While the traditional
solutions may neither efficient nor applicable, economic and pricing models
have been recently developed and adopted as useful tools to achieve the
objectives. In this paper, we review economic and pricing approaches proposed
to address resource management issues in the 5G wireless networks including
user association, spectrum allocation, and interference and power management.
Furthermore, we present applications of economic and pricing models for
wireless caching and mobile data offloading. Finally, we highlight important
challenges, open issues and future research directions of applying economic and
pricing models to the 5G wireless networks.

 <dc:description>  Edge sampling is an important topic in network analysis. It provides a
natural way to reduce network size while retaining desired features of the
original network. Sampling methods that only use local information are common
in practice as they do not require access to the entire network and can be
parallelized easily. Despite promising empirical performance, most of these
methods are derived from heuristic considerations and therefore still lack
theoretical justification. To address this issue, we study in this paper a
simple edge sampling scheme that uses network local information. We show that
when local connectivity is sufficiently strong, the sampled network satisfies a
strong spectral property. We quantify the strength of local connectivity by a
global parameter and relate it to more common network statistics such as
clustering coefficient and Ricci curvature. Based on this result, we also
derive a condition under which a hypergraph can be sampled and reduced to a
weighted network.

 <dc:description>  Residual networks (Resnets) have become a prominent architecture in deep
learning. However, a comprehensive understanding of Resnets is still a topic of
ongoing research. A recent view argues that Resnets perform iterative
refinement of features. We attempt to further expose properties of this aspect.
To this end, we study Resnets both analytically and empirically. We formalize
the notion of iterative refinement in Resnets by showing that residual
architectures naturally encourage features to move along the negative gradient
of loss during the feedforward phase. In addition, our empirical analysis
suggests that Resnets are able to perform both representation learning and
iterative refinement. In general, a Resnet block tends to concentrate
representation learning behavior in the first few layers while higher layers
perform iterative refinement of features. Finally we observe that sharing
residual layers naively leads to representation explosion and hurts
generalization performance, and show that simple existing strategies can help
alleviating this problem.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces, for the first time, non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) into short-packet communications. This introduction has great potential
to achieve low latency, thus making it attractive for the emerging Internet of
Things. Considering a finite blocklength, we determine the optimal transmission
rates and power allocation in NOMA that maximize the effective throughput of
the user with a higher channel gain while guaranteeing a certain effective
throughput at the other user. With a finite blocklength, the perfect successive
interference cancellation cannot be guaranteed, which leads to new challenges
in optimizing NOMA that have been addressed in this work. We also analyze the
performance of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) as a benchmark to fully
demonstrate the benefit of NOMA. Our examination shows that NOMA significantly
outperforms OMA in terms of achieving a higher effective throughput subject to
the same latency or incurring a lower latency to achieve the same effective
throughput target. Interestingly, we also find that with a finite blocklength
the advantage of NOMA relative to OMA is more prominent when the effective
throughput targets at the two users become more comparable. Our work indicates
that NOMA is a promising enabler of short-packet communications, and achieving
fairness among users.

 <dc:description>  As a non-invasive imaging modality, optical coherence tomography (OCT) can
provide micrometer-resolution 3D images of retinal structures. Therefore it is
commonly used in the diagnosis of retinal diseases associated with edema in and
under the retinal layers. In this paper, a new framework is proposed for the
task of fluid segmentation and detection in retinal OCT images. Based on the
raw images and layers segmented by a graph-cut algorithm, a fully convolutional
neural network was trained to recognize and label the fluid pixels. Random
forest classification was performed on the segmented fluid regions to detect
and reject the falsely labeled fluid regions. The leave-one-out cross
validation experiments on the RETOUCH database show that our method performs
well in both segmentation (mean Dice: 0.7317) and detection (mean AUC: 0.985)
tasks.

 <dc:description>  Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Amnestic
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common first symptom before the conversion
to clinical impairment where the individual becomes unable to perform
activities of daily living independently. Although there is currently no
treatment available, the earlier a conclusive diagnosis is made, the earlier
the potential for interventions to delay or perhaps even prevent progression to
full-blown AD. Neuroimaging scans acquired from MRI and metabolism images
obtained by FDG-PET provide in-vivo view into the structure and function
(glucose metabolism) of the living brain. It is hypothesized that combining
different image modalities could better characterize the change of human brain
and result in a more accuracy early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, we proposed
a novel framework to discriminate normal control(NC) subjects from subjects
with AD pathology (AD and NC, MCI subjects convert to AD in future). Our novel
approach utilizing a multimodal and multiscale deep neural network was found to
deliver a 85.68\% accuracy in the prediction of subjects within 3 years to
conversion. Cross validation experiments proved that it has better
discrimination ability compared with results in existing published literature.

 <dc:description>  We propose an image super resolution(ISR) method using generative adversarial
networks (GANs) that takes a low resolution input fundus image and generates a
high resolution super resolved (SR) image upto scaling factor of $16$. This
facilitates more accurate automated image analysis, especially for small or
blurred landmarks and pathologies. Local saliency maps, which define each
pixel's importance, are used to define a novel saliency loss in the GAN cost
function. Experimental results show the resulting SR images have perceptual
quality very close to the original images and perform better than competing
methods that do not weigh pixels according to their importance. When used for
retinal vasculature segmentation, our SR images result in accuracy levels close
to those obtained when using the original images.

 <dc:description>  Given two data matrices $X$ and $Y$, sparse canonical correlation analysis
(SCCA) is to seek two sparse canonical vectors $u$ and $v$ to maximize the
correlation between $Xu$ and $Yv$. However, classical and sparse CCA models
consider the contribution of all the samples of data matrices and thus cannot
identify an underlying specific subset of samples. To this end, we propose a
novel sparse weighted canonical correlation analysis (SWCCA), where weights are
used for regularizing different samples. We solve the $L_0$-regularized SWCCA
($L_0$-SWCCA) using an alternating iterative algorithm. We apply $L_0$-SWCCA to
synthetic data and real-world data to demonstrate its effectiveness and
superiority compared to related methods. Lastly, we consider also SWCCA with
different penalties like LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator) and Group LASSO, and extend it for integrating more than three data
matrices.

 <dc:description>  We propose an end-to-end neural network to predict the geolocation of a
tweet. The network takes as input a number of raw Twitter metadata such as the
tweet message and associated user account information. Our model is language
independent, and despite minimal feature engineering, it is interpretable and
capable of learning location indicative words and timing patterns. Compared to
state-of-the-art systems, our model outperforms them by 2%-6%. Additionally, we
propose extensions to the model to compress representation learnt by the
network into binary codes. Experiments show that it produces compact codes
compared to benchmark hashing algorithms. An implementation of the model is
released publicly.

 <dc:description>  Biometric identification systems have become immensely popular and important
because of their high reliability and efficiency. However person identification
at a distance, still remains a challenging problem. Gait can be seen as an
essential biometric feature for human recognition and identification. It can be
easily acquired from a distance and does not require any user cooperation thus
making it suitable for surveillance. But the task of recognizing an individual
using gait can be adversely affected by varying view points making this task
more and more challenging. Our proposed approach tackles this problem by
identifying spatio-temporal features and performing extensive experimentation
and training mechanism. In this paper, we propose a 3-D Convolution Deep Neural
Network for person identification using gait under multiple view. It is a
2-stage network, in which we have a classification network that initially
identifies the viewing point angle. After that another set of networks (one for
each angle) has been trained to identify the person under a particular viewing
angle. We have tested this network over CASIA-B publicly available database and
have achieved state-of-the-art results. The proposed system is much more
efficient in terms of time and space and performing better for almost all
angles.

 <dc:title>Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits for Real-Time Strategy Games</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Games with large branching factors pose a significant challenge for game tree
search algorithms. In this paper, we address this problem with a sampling
strategy for Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms called {\em na\&quot;{i}ve
sampling}, based on a variant of the Multi-armed Bandit problem called {\em
Combinatorial Multi-armed Bandits} (CMAB). We analyze the theoretical
properties of several variants of {\em na\&quot;{i}ve sampling}, and empirically
compare it against the other existing strategies in the literature for CMABs.
We then evaluate these strategies in the context of real-time strategy (RTS)
games, a genre of computer games characterized by their very large branching
factors. Our results show that as the branching factor grows, {\em na\&quot;{i}ve
sampling} outperforms the other sampling strategies.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks are widely used for classification. These deep models
often suffer from a lack of interpretability -- they are particularly difficult
to understand because of their non-linear nature. As a result, neural networks
are often treated as &quot;black box&quot; models, and in the past, have been trained
purely to optimize the accuracy of predictions. In this work, we create a novel
network architecture for deep learning that naturally explains its own
reasoning for each prediction. This architecture contains an autoencoder and a
special prototype layer, where each unit of that layer stores a weight vector
that resembles an encoded training input. The encoder of the autoencoder allows
us to do comparisons within the latent space, while the decoder allows us to
visualize the learned prototypes. The training objective has four terms: an
accuracy term, a term that encourages every prototype to be similar to at least
one encoded input, a term that encourages every encoded input to be close to at
least one prototype, and a term that encourages faithful reconstruction by the
autoencoder. The distances computed in the prototype layer are used as part of
the classification process. Since the prototypes are learned during training,
the learned network naturally comes with explanations for each prediction, and
the explanations are loyal to what the network actually computes.

 <dc:description>  Deep directed generative models have attracted much attention recently due to
their generative modeling nature and powerful data representation ability. In
this paper, we review different structures of deep directed generative models
and the learning and inference algorithms associated with the structures. We
focus on a specific structure that consists of layers of Bayesian Networks due
to the property of capturing inherent and rich dependencies among latent
variables. The major difficulty of learning and inference with deep directed
models with many latent variables is the intractable inference due to the
dependencies among the latent variables and the exponential number of latent
variable configurations. Current solutions use variational methods often
through an auxiliary network to approximate the posterior probability
inference. In contrast, inference can also be performed directly without using
any auxiliary network to maximally preserve the dependencies among the latent
variables. Specifically, by exploiting the sparse representation with the
latent space, max-max instead of max-sum operation can be used to overcome the
exponential number of latent configurations. Furthermore, the max-max operation
and augmented coordinate ascent are applied to both supervised and unsupervised
learning as well as to various inference. Quantitative evaluations on benchmark
datasets of different models are given for both data representation and feature
learning tasks.

 <dc:description>  What are the most popular research topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI)? We
formulate the problem as extracting top-$k$ topics that can best represent a
given area with the help of knowledge base. We theoretically prove that the
problem is NP-hard and propose an optimization model, FastKATE, to address this
problem by combining both explicit and latent representations for each topic.
We leverage a large-scale knowledge base (Wikipedia) to generate topic
embeddings using neural networks and use this kind of representations to help
capture the representativeness of topics for given areas. We develop a fast
heuristic algorithm to efficiently solve the problem with a provable error
bound. We evaluate the proposed model on three real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate our model's effectiveness, robustness,
real-timeness (return results in $&lt;1$s), and its superiority over several
alternative methods.

 <dc:description>  The requiring of large amounts of annotated training data has become a common
constraint on various deep learning systems. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised scene text detection method (WeText) that trains robust and accurate
scene text detection models by learning from unannotated or weakly annotated
data. With a &quot;light&quot; supervised model trained on a small fully annotated
dataset, we explore semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning on a large
unannotated dataset and a large weakly annotated dataset, respectively. For the
unsupervised learning, the light supervised model is applied to the unannotated
dataset to search for more character training samples, which are further
combined with the small annotated dataset to retrain a superior character
detection model. For the weakly supervised learning, the character searching is
guided by high-level annotations of words/text lines that are widely available
and also much easier to prepare. In addition, we design an unified scene
character detector by adapting regression based deep networks, which greatly
relieves the error accumulation issue that widely exists in most traditional
approaches. Extensive experiments across different unannotated and weakly
annotated datasets show that the scene text detection performance can be
clearly boosted under both scenarios, where the weakly supervised learning can
achieve the state-of-the-art performance by using only 229 fully annotated
scene text images.

 <dc:description>  This letter investigates the problem of anti-jamming communications in
dynamic and unknown environment through on-line learning. Different from
existing studies which need to know (estimate) the jamming patterns and
parameters, we use the spectrum waterfall, i.e., the raw spectrum environment,
directly. Firstly, to cope with the challenge of infinite state of raw spectrum
information, a deep anti-jamming Q-network is constructed. Then, a deep
anti-jamming reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to obtain the optimal
anti-jamming strategies. Finally, simulation results validate the the proposed
approach. The proposed approach is relying only on the local observed
information and does not need to estimate the jamming patterns and parameters,
which implies that it can be widely used various anti-jamming scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a method for cloud removal from visible light RGB
satellite images by extending the conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
(cGANs) from RGB images to multispectral images. Satellite images have been
widely utilized for various purposes, such as natural environment monitoring
(pollution, forest or rivers), transportation improvement and prompt emergency
response to disasters. However, the obscurity caused by clouds makes it
unstable to monitor the situation on the ground with the visible light camera.
Images captured by a longer wavelength are introduced to reduce the effects of
clouds. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is such an example that improves
visibility even the clouds exist. On the other hand, the spatial resolution
decreases as the wavelength increases. Furthermore, the images captured by long
wavelengths differs considerably from those captured by visible light in terms
of their appearance. Therefore, we propose a network that can remove clouds and
generate visible light images from the multispectral images taken as inputs.
This is achieved by extending the input channels of cGANs to be compatible with
multispectral images. The networks are trained to output images that are close
to the ground truth using the images synthesized with clouds over the ground
truth as inputs. In the available dataset, the proportion of images of the
forest or the sea is very high, which will introduce bias in the training
dataset if uniformly sampled from the original dataset. Thus, we utilize the
t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to improve the problem of
bias in the training dataset. Finally, we confirm the feasibility of the
proposed network on the dataset of four bands images, which include three
visible light bands and one near-infrared (NIR) band.

 <dc:description>  With the recent renaissance of deep convolution neural networks, encouraging
breakthroughs have been achieved on the supervised recognition tasks, where
each class has sufficient training data and fully annotated training data.
However, to scale the recognition to a large number of classes with few or now
training samples for each class remains an unsolved problem. One approach to
scaling up the recognition is to develop models capable of recognizing unseen
categories without any training instances, or zero-shot recognition/ learning.
This article provides a comprehensive review of existing zero-shot recognition
techniques covering various aspects ranging from representations of models, and
from datasets and evaluation settings. We also overview related recognition
tasks including one-shot and open set recognition which can be used as natural
extensions of zero-shot recognition when limited number of class samples become
available or when zero-shot recognition is implemented in a real-world setting.
Importantly, we highlight the limitations of existing approaches and point out
future research directions in this existing new research area.

 <dc:description>  Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are bio-inspired models of neural
computation that have proven highly effective. Still, ANNs lack a natural
notion of time, and neural units in ANNs exchange analog values in a
frame-based manner, a computationally and energetically inefficient form of
communication. This contrasts sharply with biological neurons that communicate
sparingly and efficiently using binary spikes. While artificial Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) can be constructed by replacing the units of an ANN with
spiking neurons, the current performance is far from that of deep ANNs on hard
benchmarks and these SNNs use much higher firing rates compared to their
biological counterparts, limiting their efficiency. Here we show how spiking
neurons that employ an efficient form of neural coding can be used to construct
SNNs that match high-performance ANNs and exceed state-of-the-art in SNNs on
important benchmarks, while requiring much lower average firing rates. For
this, we use spike-time coding based on the firing rate limiting adaptation
phenomenon observed in biological spiking neurons. This phenomenon can be
captured in adapting spiking neuron models, for which we derive the effective
transfer function. Neural units in ANNs trained with this transfer function can
be substituted directly with adaptive spiking neurons, and the resulting
Adaptive SNNs (AdSNNs) can carry out inference in deep neural networks using up
to an order of magnitude fewer spikes compared to previous SNNs. Adaptive
spike-time coding additionally allows for the dynamic control of neural coding
precision: we show how a simple model of arousal in AdSNNs further halves the
average required firing rate and this notion naturally extends to other forms
of attention. AdSNNs thus hold promise as a novel and efficient model for
neural computation that naturally fits to temporally continuous and
asynchronous applications.

 <dc:title>The Semantics of Transactions and Weak Memory in x86, Power, ARMv8, and

 <dc:description>  Weak memory models trade programmability for performance, while transactional
memory (TM) aims for ease of programming, sometimes at a performance cost. The
semantics of both have been studied in detail, but their combined semantics is
not well understood. This is problematic because TM is currently available,
either natively or via extensions, in widely-used architectures and languages
such as x86, Power, and C++, all of which have weak memory models. Our work
aims to provide an formal understanding of the interplay between weak memory
and TM, without which, programmers cannot robustly reason about programs that
use both of these important concurrent programming constructs.
  Our first research contribution is the definition of axiomatic models that
capture the combination of TM and weak memory as it exists in x86, Power, and
C++, and one way that the ARMv8 memory model could be extended to support TM.
Our second contribution is the systematic methodology we use to validate our
models. This methodology is based around a new tool that is able to synthesise
- automatically and exhaustively - exactly the minimal test programs that
distinguish any two axiomatic models. This enables us to validate our models by
comparing them against both an upper-bound model (transactional sequential
consistency) and a lower-bound model (the non-transactional version of each
model), and then checking that the outcomes of all the generated programs on
existing hardware (where available) are consistent with our models. We further
validate our models by checking compilation schemes from C++ transactions to
hardware transactions.

 <dc:title>Dynamic texture recognition using time-causal and time-recursive
  spatio-temporal receptive fields</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jansson, Ylva</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lindeberg, Tony</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work presents a first evaluation of using spatio-temporal receptive
fields from a recently proposed time-causal spatio-temporal scale-space
framework as primitives for video analysis. We propose a new family of video
descriptors based on regional statistics of spatio-temporal receptive field
responses and evaluate this approach on the problem of dynamic texture
recognition. Our approach generalises a previously used method, based on joint
histograms of receptive field responses, from the spatial to the
spatio-temporal domain and from object recognition to dynamic texture
recognition. The time-recursive formulation enables computationally efficient
time-causal recognition. The experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art. Especially, it is shown that binary
versions of our dynamic texture descriptors achieve improved performance
compared to a large range of similar methods using different primitives either
handcrafted or learned from data. Further, our qualitative and quantitative
investigation into parameter choices and the use of different sets of receptive
fields highlights the robustness and flexibility of our approach. Together,
these results support the descriptive power of this family of time-causal
spatio-temporal receptive fields, validate our approach for dynamic texture
recognition and point towards the possibility of designing a range of video
analysis methods based on these new time-causal spatio-temporal primitives.

 <dc:title>Performance Comparison of Intrusion Detection Systems and Application of

 <dc:description>  This study investigates the performance of two open source intrusion
detection systems (IDSs) namely Snort and Suricata for accurately detecting the
malicious traffic on computer networks. Snort and Suricata were installed on
two different but identical computers and the performance was evaluated at 10
Gbps network speed. It was noted that Suricata could process a higher speed of
network traffic than Snort with lower packet drop rate but it consumed higher
computational resources. Snort had higher detection accuracy and was thus
selected for further experiments. It was observed that the Snort triggered a
high rate of false positive alarms. To solve this problem a Snort adaptive
plug-in was developed. To select the best performing algorithm for Snort
adaptive plug-in, an empirical study was carried out with different learning
algorithms and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected. A hybrid version of
SVM and Fuzzy logic produced a better detection accuracy. But the best result
was achieved using an optimised SVM with firefly algorithm with FPR (false
positive rate) as 8.6% and FNR (false negative rate) as 2.2%, which is a good
result. The novelty of this work is the performance comparison of two IDSs at
10 Gbps and the application of hybrid and optimised machine learning algorithms
to Snort.

 <dc:description>  It has by now become a standard approach to use the theory of sparse (or
toric) elimination, based on the Newton polytope of a polynomial, in order to
reveal and exploit the structure of algebraic systems. This talk surveys
compact formulae, including older and recent results, in sparse elimination. We
start with root bounds and juxtapose two recent formulae: a generating function
of the m-B{\'e}zout bound and a closed-form expression for the mixed volume by
means of a matrix permanent. For the sparse resultant, a bevy of results have
established determinantal or rational formulae for a large class of systems,
starting with Macaulay. The discriminant is closely related to the resultant
but admits no compact formula except for very simple cases. We offer a new
determinantal formula for the discriminant of a sparse multilinear system
arising in computing Nash equilibria. We introduce an alternative notion of
compact formula, namely the Newton polytope of the unknown polynomial. It is
possible to compute it efficiently for sparse resultants, discriminants, as
well as the implicit equation of a parameterized variety. This leads us to
consider implicit matrix representations of geometric objects.

 <dc:description>  We present an innovative approach to the synthesis of linear arrays having
the least possible number of elements while radiating shaped beams lying in
completely arbitrary power masks. The approach, based on theory and procedures
lend from Compressive Sensing, has two innovative key features. First, it
exploits at best the multiplicity of equivalent field solutions corresponding
to the many different power patterns lying in the given mask. Second, it
a-priori optimizes those parameters that affect the performance of Compressive
Sensing. The overall problem is formulated as two convex programming routines
plus one local optimization, with the inherent advantages in terms of
computational time and solutions optimality. An extensive numerical comparison
against state-of-the-art procedures proves the effectiveness of the approach.

 <dc:description>  A massive number of devices are expected to fulfill the missions of sensing,
processing and control in cyber-physical Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems with
new applications and connectivity requirements. In this context, scarce
spectrum resources must accommodate a high traffic volume with stringent
requirements of low latency, high reliability and energy efficiency.
Conventional centralized network architectures may not be able to fulfill these
requirements due to congestion in backhaul links. This article presents a novel
design of a robust dynamic edge network architecture (RDNA) for IoT which
leverages the latest advances of mobile devices (e.g., their capability to act
as access points, storing and computing capabilities) to dynamically harvest
unused resources and mitigate network congestion. However, traffic dynamics may
compromise the availability of terminal access points and channels and, thus,
network connectivity. The proposed design embraces solutions at physical,
access, networking, application, and business layers to improve network
robustness. The high density of mobile devices provides alternatives for close
connectivity which reduces interference and latency, and thus, increases
reliability and energy efficiency. Moreover, the computing capabilities of
mobile devices project smartness onto the edge which is desirable for
autonomous and intelligent decision making. A case study is included to
illustrate the performance of RDNA. Potential applications of this architecture
in the context of IoT are outlined. Finally, some challenges for future
research are presented.

 <dc:description>  As many different 3D volumes could produce the same 2D x-ray image, inverting
this process is challenging. We show that recent deep learning-based
convolutional neural networks can solve this task. As the main challenge in
learning is the sheer amount of data created when extending the 2D image into a
3D volume, we suggest firstly to learn a coarse, fixed-resolution volume which
is then fused in a second step with the input x-ray into a high-resolution
volume. To train and validate our approach we introduce a new dataset that
comprises of close to half a million computer-simulated 2D x-ray images of 3D
volumes scanned from 175 mammalian species. Applications of our approach
include stereoscopic rendering of legacy x-ray images, re-rendering of x-rays
including changes of illumination, view pose or geometry. Our evaluation
includes comparison to previous tomography work, previous learning methods
using our data, a user study and application to a set of real x-rays.

therefore the results can also be applied to multi-task learning problems. We
achieve the optimal minimax convergence rates of multi-penalty regularization

 <dc:title>A Method of Generating Random Weights and Biases in Feedforward Neural

 <dc:description>  Neural networks with random hidden nodes have gained increasing interest from
researchers and practical applications. This is due to their unique features
such as very fast training and universal approximation property. In these
networks the weights and biases of hidden nodes determining the nonlinear
feature mapping are set randomly and are not learned. Appropriate selection of
the intervals from which weights and biases are selected is extremely
important. This topic has not yet been sufficiently explored in the literature.
In this work a method of generating random weights and biases is proposed. This
method generates the parameters of the hidden nodes in such a way that
nonlinear fragments of the activation functions are located in the input space
regions with data and can be used to construct the surface approximating a
nonlinear target function. The weights and biases are dependent on the input
data range and activation function type. The proposed methods allows us to
control the generalization degree of the model. These all lead to improvement
in approximation performance of the network. Several experiments show very
promising results.

 <dc:description>  In human-in-the-loop machine learning, the user provides information beyond
that in the training data. Many algorithms and user interfaces have been
designed to optimize and facilitate this human--machine interaction; however,
fewer studies have addressed the potential defects the designs can cause.
Effective interaction often requires exposing the user to the training data or
its statistics. The design of the system is then critical, as this can lead to
double use of data and overfitting, if the user reinforces noisy patterns in
the data. We propose a user modelling methodology, by assuming simple rational
behaviour, to correct the problem. We show, in a user study with 48
participants, that the method improves predictive performance in a sparse
linear regression sentiment analysis task, where graded user knowledge on
feature relevance is elicited. We believe that the key idea of inferring user
knowledge with probabilistic user models has general applicability in guarding
against overfitting and improving interactive machine learning.

 <dc:description>  Network based on distributed caching of content is a new architecture to
alleviate the ongoing explosive demands for rate of multi-media traffic. In
caching networks, coded caching is a recently proposed technique that achieves
significant performance gains compared to uncoded caching schemes. In this
paper, we derive a lower bound on the average rate with a memory constraint for
a family of caching allocation placement and a family of XOR cooperative
delivery. The lower bound inspires us how placement and delivery affect the
rate memory tradeoff. Based on the clues, we design a new placement and two new
delivery algorithms. On one hand, the new placement scheme can allocate the
cache more flexibly compared to grouping scheme. On the other hand, the new
delivery can exploit more cooperative opportunities compared to the known
schemes. The simulations validate our idea.

 <dc:description>  A hierarchical scheme for clustering data is presented which applies to
spaces with a high number of dimension ($N_{_{D}}&gt;3$). The data set is first
reduced to a smaller set of partitions (multi-dimensional bins). Multiple
clustering techniques are used, including spectral clustering, however, new
techniques are also introduced based on the path length between partitions that
are connected to one another. A Line-Of-Sight algorithm is also developed for
clustering. A test bank of 12 data sets with varying properties is used to
expose the strengths and weaknesses of each technique. Finally, a robust
clustering technique is discussed based on reaching a consensus among the
multiple approaches, overcoming the weaknesses found individually.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 an enormous amount
of data is produced at the edge of the network. Due to a lack of computing
power, this data is currently send to the cloud where centralized machine
learning models are trained to derive higher level knowledge. With the recent
development of specialized machine learning hardware for mobile devices, a new
era of distributed learning is about to begin that raises a new research
question: How can we search in distributed machine learning models? Machine
learning at the edge of the network has many benefits, such as low-latency
inference and increased privacy. Such distributed machine learning models can
also learn personalized for a human user, a specific context, or application
scenario. As training data stays on the devices, control over possibly
sensitive data is preserved as it is not shared with a third party. This new
form of distributed learning leads to the partitioning of knowledge between
many devices which makes access difficult. In this paper we tackle the problem
of finding specific knowledge by forwarding a search request (query) to a
device that can answer it best. To that end, we use a entropy based quality
metric that takes the context of a query and the learning quality of a device
into account. We show that our forwarding strategy can achieve over 95%
accuracy in a urban mobility scenario where we use data from 30 000 people
commuting in the city of Trento, Italy.

 <dc:description>  It is a usual practice to ignore any structural information underlying
classes in multi-class classification. In this paper, we propose a graph
convolutional network (GCN) augmented neural network classifier to exploit a
known, underlying graph structure of labels. The proposed approach resembles an
(approximate) inference procedure in, for instance, a conditional random field
(CRF), however without losing any modelling flexibility. The proposed method
can easily scale up to thousands of labels. We evaluate the proposed approach
on the problems of document classification and object recognition and report
both accuracies and graph-theoretic metrics that correspond to the consistency
of the model's prediction. The experiment results reveal that the proposed
model outperforms a baseline method which ignores the graph structures of a
label space.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable a myriad of applications by
interconnecting objects - such as sensors and robots - over the Internet. IoT
applications range from healthcare to autonomous vehicles and include disaster
management. Enabling these applications in cloud environments requires the
design of appropriate IoT Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IoT IaaS) to ease the
provisioning of the IoT objects as cloud services. This paper discusses a case
study on search and rescue IoT applications in large-scale disaster scenarios.
It proposes an IoT IaaS architecture that virtualizes robots (IaaS for robots)
and provides them to the upstream applications as-a-Service. Node- and
Network-level robots virtualization are supported. The proposed architecture
meets a set of identified requirements, such as the need for a unified
description model for heterogeneous robots, publication/discovery mechanism,
and federation with other IaaS for robots when needed. A validating proof of
concept is built and experiments are made to evaluate its performance. Lessons
learned and prospective research directions are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Algorithmic decision making process now affects many aspects of our lives.
Standard tools for machine learning, such as classification and regression, are
subject to the bias in data, and thus direct application of such off-the-shelf
tools could lead to a specific group being unfairly discriminated. Removing
sensitive attributes of data does not solve this problem because a
\textit{disparate impact} can arise when non-sensitive attributes and sensitive
attributes are correlated. Here, we study a fair machine learning algorithm
that avoids such a disparate impact when making a decision. Inspired by the
two-stage least squares method that is widely used in the field of economics,
we propose a two-stage algorithm that removes bias in the training data. The
proposed algorithm is conceptually simple. Unlike most of existing fair
algorithms that are designed for classification tasks, the proposed method is
able to (i) deal with regression tasks, (ii) combine explanatory attributes to
remove reverse discrimination, and (iii) deal with numerical sensitive
attributes. The performance and fairness of the proposed algorithm are
evaluated in simulations with synthetic and real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  We describe a deep learning approach for automated brain hemorrhage detection
from computed tomography (CT) scans. Our model emulates the procedure followed
by radiologists to analyse a 3D CT scan in real-world. Similar to radiologists,
the model sifts through 2D cross-sectional slices while paying close attention
to potential hemorrhagic regions. Further, the model utilizes 3D context from
neighboring slices to improve predictions at each slice and subsequently,
aggregates the slice-level predictions to provide diagnosis at CT level. We
refer to our proposed approach as Recurrent Attention DenseNet (RADnet) as it
employs original DenseNet architecture along with adding the components of
attention for slice level predictions and recurrent neural network layer for
incorporating 3D context. The real-world performance of RADnet has been
benchmarked against independent analysis performed by three senior radiologists
for 77 brain CTs. RADnet demonstrates 81.82% hemorrhage prediction accuracy at
CT level that is comparable to radiologists. Further, RADnet achieves higher
recall than two of the three radiologists, which is remarkable.

 <dc:title>An Empirical Comparison of Dependency Network Evolution in Seven

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Nearly every popular programming language comes with one or more package
managers. The software packages distributed by such package managers form large
software ecosystems. These packaging ecosystems contain a large number of
package releases that are updated regularly and that have many dependencies to
other package releases. While packaging ecosystems are extremely useful for
their respective communities of developers, they face challenges related to
their scale, complexity, and rate of evolution. Typical problems are backward
incompatible package updates, and the risk of (transitively) depending on
packages that have become obsolete or inactive. This manuscript uses the
libraries.io dataset to carry out a quantitative empirical analysis of the
similarities and differences between the evolution of package dependency
networks for seven packaging ecosystems of varying sizes and ages: Cargo for
Rust, CPAN for Perl, CRAN for R, npm for JavaScript, NuGet for the .NET
platform, Packagist for PHP, and RubyGems for Ruby. We propose novel metrics to
capture the growth, changeability, resuability and fragility of these
dependency networks, and use these metrics to analyse and compare their
evolution. We observe that the dependency networks tend to grow over time, both
in size and in number of package updates, while a minority of packages are
responsible for most of the package updates. The majority of packages depend on
other packages, but only a small proportion of packages accounts for most of
the reverse dependencies. We observe a high proportion of fragile packages due
to a high and increasing number of transitive dependencies. These findings are
instrumental for assessing the quality of a package dependency network, and
improving it through dependency management tools and imposed policies.

for analyzing and classifying artifacts and aesthetic forms from the era of
Classicism. The framework accommodates both traditional knowledge
representation as a formal ontology and data-driven knowledge discovery, where
cultural patterns will be identified by means of algorithms in statistical
analysis and machine learning. We created a Deep Learning approach trained on
photographs to classify the objects inside these photographs. In a next step,
we will apply a different Deep Learning approach. It is capable of locating
multiple objects inside an image and classifying them with a high accuracy.

 <dc:title>$\ell^1$-Analysis Minimization and Generalized (Co-)Sparsity: When Does

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of signal estimation from undersampled
noisy sub-Gaussian measurements under the assumption of a cosparse model. Based
on generalized notions of sparsity, we derive novel recovery guarantees for the
$\ell^{1}$-analysis basis pursuit, enabling highly accurate predictions of its
sample complexity. The corresponding bounds on the number of required
measurements do explicitly depend on the Gram matrix of the analysis operator
and therefore particularly account for its mutual coherence structure. Our
findings defy conventional wisdom which promotes the sparsity of analysis
coefficients as the crucial quantity to study. In fact, this common paradigm
breaks down completely in many situations of practical interest, for instance,
when applying a redundant (multilevel) frame as analysis prior. By extensive
numerical experiments, we demonstrate that, in contrast, our theoretical
sampling-rate bounds reliably capture the recovery capability of various
examples, such as redundant Haar wavelets systems, total variation, or random
frames. The proofs of our main results build upon recent achievements in the
convex geometry of data mining problems. More precisely, we establish a
sophisticated upper bound on the conic Gaussian mean width that is associated
with the underlying $\ell^{1}$-analysis polytope. Due to a novel localization
argument, it turns out that the presented framework naturally extends to stable
recovery, allowing us to incorporate compressible coefficient sequences as
well.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a deep-learning based approach for estimating local
3D shape properties in point clouds. In contrast to the majority of prior
techniques that concentrate on global or mid-level attributes, e.g., for shape
classification or semantic labeling, we suggest a patch-based learning method,
in which a series of local patches at multiple scales around each point is
encoded in a structured manner. Our approach is especially well-adapted for
estimating local shape properties such as normals (both unoriented and
oriented) and curvature from raw point clouds in the presence of strong noise
and multi-scale features. Our main contributions include both a novel
multi-scale variant of a recently proposed PointNet architecture with emphasis
on local shape information, and a series of novel applications in which we
demonstrate how learning from training data arising from well-structured
triangle meshes, and applying the trained model to noisy point clouds can
produce superior results compared to specialized state-of-the-art techniques.
Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approach in the context of shape
reconstruction, by showing how it can be used to extract normal orientation
information from point clouds.

 <dc:title>Transfer of Tool Affordance and Manipulation Cues with 3D Vision Data</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Future service robots working in human environments, such as kitchens, will
face situations where they need to improvise. The usual tool for a given task
might not be available and the robot will have to use some substitute tool. The
robot needs to select an appropriate alternative tool from the candidates
available, and also needs to know where to grasp it, how to orient it and what
part to use as the end-effector. We present a system which takes as input a
candidate tool's point cloud and weight, and outputs a score for how effective
that tool is for a task, and how to use it. Our key novelty is in taking a
task-driven approach, where the task exerts a top-down influence on how low
level vision data is interpreted. This facilitates the type of 'everyday
creativity' where an object such as a wine bottle could be used as a rolling
pin, because the interpretation of the object is not fixed in advance, but
rather results from the interaction between the bottom-up and top-down
pressures at run-time. The top-down influence is implemented by transfer: prior
knowledge of geometric features that make a tool good for a task is used to
seek similar features in a candidate tool. The prior knowledge is learned by
simulating Web models performing the tasks. We evaluate on a set of fifty
household objects and five tasks. We compare our system with the closest one in
the literature and show that we achieve significantly better results

 <dc:description>  Scheduling of the transmission of status updates over an error-prone
communication channel is studied in order to minimize the long-term average age
of information (AoI) at the destination, under an average resource constraint
at the source node, which limits the average number of transmissions. After
each transmission, the source receives an instantaneous ACK/NACK feedback, and
decides on the next update, without a priori knowledge on the success of the
future transmissions. The optimal scheduling policy is studied under different
feedback mechanisms; in particular, standard automatic repeat request (ARQ) and
hybrid ARQ (HARQ) protocols are considered. Average-cost reinforcement learning
algorithms are proposed when the error probabilities for the HARQ system are
unknown.

 <dc:description>  Context is an essential capability for robots that are to be as adaptive as
possible in challenging environments. Although there are many context modeling
efforts, they assume a fixed structure and number of contexts. In this paper,
we propose an incremental deep model that extends Restricted Boltzmann
Machines. Our model gets one scene at a time, and gradually extends the
contextual model when necessary, either by adding a new context or a new
context layer to form a hierarchy. We show on a scene classification benchmark
that our method converges to a good estimate of the contexts of the scenes, and
performs better or on-par on several tasks compared to other incremental models
or non-incremental models.

 <dc:description>  The ability to reason about and predict the outcome of contacts is paramount
to the successful execution of many robot tasks. Analytical rigid-body contact
models are used extensively in planning and control due to their computational
efficiency and simplicity, yet despite their prevalence, little if any
empirical comparison of these models has been made and it is unclear how well
they approximate contact outcomes. In this paper, we first formulate a system
identification approach for six commonly used contact models in the literature,
and use the proposed method to find parameters for an experimental data-set of
impacts. Next, we compare the models empirically, and establish a task specific
upper bound on the performance of the models and the rigid-body contact model
paradigm. We highlight the limitations of these models, salient failure modes,
and the care that should be taken in parameter selection, which are ultimately
difficult to give a physical interpretation.

 <dc:description>  There have been several attempts at modeling context in robots. However,
either these attempts assume a fixed number of contexts or use a rule-based
approach to determine when to increment the number of contexts. In this paper,
we propose to pose the task of incrementing as a learning problem, which we
solve using a Recurrent Neural Network. We show that the network successfully
(with 98% testing accuracy) learns to predict when to increment, and
demonstrate, in a scene modeling problem (where the correct number of contexts
is not known), that the robot increments the number of contexts in an expected
manner (i.e., the entropy of the system is reduced). We also present how the
incremental model can be used for various scene reasoning tasks.

 <dc:description>  The increasing availability and adoption of shared vehicles as an alternative
to personally-owned cars presents ample opportunities for achieving more
efficient transportation in cities. With private cars spending on the average
over 95\% of the time parked, one of the possible benefits of shared mobility
is the reduced need for parking space. While widely discussed, a systematic
quantification of these benefits as a function of mobility demand and sharing
models is still mostly lacking in the literature. As a first step in this
direction, this paper focuses on a type of private mobility which, although
specific, is a major contributor to traffic congestion and parking needs,
namely, home-work commuting. We develop a data-driven methodology for
estimating commuter parking needs in different shared mobility models,
including a model where self-driving vehicles are used to partially compensate
flow imbalance typical of commuting, and further reduce parking infrastructure
at the expense of increased traveled kilometers. We consider the city of
Singapore as a case study, and produce very encouraging results showing that
the gradual transition to shared mobility models will bring tangible reductions
in parking infrastructure. In the future-looking, self-driving vehicle
scenario, our analysis suggests that up to 50\% reduction in parking needs can
be achieved at the expense of increasing total traveled kilometers of less than
2\%.

 <dc:title>On Parallel Solution of Sparse Triangular Linear Systems in CUDA</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Li, Ruipeng</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The acceleration of sparse matrix computations on modern many-core
processors, such as the graphics processing units (GPUs), has been recognized
and studied over a decade. Significant performance enhancements have been
achieved for many sparse matrix computational kernels such as sparse
matrix-vector products and sparse matrix-matrix products. Solving linear
systems with sparse triangular structured matrices is another important sparse
kernel as demanded by a variety of scientific and engineering applications such
as sparse linear solvers. However, the development of efficient parallel
algorithms in CUDA for solving sparse triangular linear systems remains a
challenging task due to the inherently sequential nature of the computation. In
this paper, we will revisit this problem by reviewing the existing
level-scheduling methods and proposing algorithms with self-scheduling
techniques. Numerical results have indicated that the CUDA implementations of
the proposed algorithms can outperform the state-of-the-art solvers in cuSPARSE
by a factor of up to $2.6$ for structured model problems and general sparse
matrices.

 <dc:description>  Abelian codes and complementary dual codes form important classes of linear
codes that have been extensively studied due to their rich algebraic structures
and wide applications. In this paper, a family of abelian codes with
complementary dual in a group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{p^\nu}[G]$ has been studied
under both the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products, where $p$ is a prime,
$\nu$ is a positive integer, and $G$ is an arbitrary finite abelian group.
Based on the discrete Fourier transform decomposition for semi-simple group
algebras and properties of ideas in local group algebras, the characterization
of such codes have been given. Subsequently, the number of complementary dual
abelian codes in $\mathbb{F}_{p^\nu}[G]$ has been shown to be independent of
the Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and it has been completely determined for every
finite abelian group $G$. In some cases, a simplified formula for the
enumeration has been provided as well. The known results for cyclic
complementary dual codes can be viewed as corollaries.

following up the SemEval CWI shared task. We use ensemble classifiers to
investigate how well computational methods can discriminate between complex and
non-complex words. Furthermore, we analyze the classification performance to
understand what makes lexical complexity challenging. Our findings show that
most systems performed poorly on the SemEval CWI dataset, and one of the
reasons for that is the way in which human annotation was performed.

 <dc:description>  Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) deliver content (e.g. Web pages, videos) to
geographically distributed end-users over the Internet. Some contents do
sometimes attract the attention of a large group of end-users. This often leads
to flash crowds which can cause major issues such as outage in the CDN.
Microservice architectural style aims at decomposing monolithic systems into
smaller components which can be independently deployed, upgraded and disposed.
Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging technology that aims to
reduce costs and bring agility by decoupling network functions from the
underlying hardware. This paper leverages the NFV and microservice
architectural style to propose an architecture for on-the-fly CDN component
provisioning to tackle issues such as flash crowds. In the proposed
architecture, CDN components are designed as sets of microservices which
interact via RESTFul Web services and are provisioned as Virtual Network
Functions (VNFs), which are deployed and orchestrated on-the-fly. We have built
a prototype in which a CDN surrogate server, designed as a set of
microservices, is deployed on-the-fly. The prototype is deployed on SAVI, a
Canadian distributed test bed for future Internet applications. The performance
is also evaluated.

self-orthogonal codes. Constructions of such codes have been given based on the
well-known matrix-product construction for linear codes. Criterion for the
underlying matrix and the input codes required in such constructions have been
determined. In many cases, the Hermitian self-orthogonality of the input codes
and the assumption that the underlying matrix is unitary can be relaxed. Some
special matrices used in the constructions and illustrative examples of good
Hermitian self-orthogonal codes have been provided as well.

in many learning problems including conditional independence testing, graphical
model inference, causal strength estimation and time-series problems. In
several applications, it is desirable to have a functional purely of the
conditional distribution p_{Y|X,Z} rather than of the joint distribution
p_{X,Y,Z}. We define the potential conditional mutual information as the
conditional mutual information calculated with a modified joint distribution
p_{Y|X,Z} q_{X,Z}, where q_{X,Z} is a potential distribution, fixed airport. We
develop K nearest neighbor based estimators for this functional, employing
importance sampling, and a coupling trick, and prove the finite k consistency
of such an estimator. We demonstrate that the estimator has excellent practical
performance and show an application in dynamical system inference.

 <dc:description>  We study planted problems---finding hidden structures in random noisy
inputs---through the lens of the sum-of-squares semidefinite programming
hierarchy (SoS). This family of powerful semidefinite programs has recently
yielded many new algorithms for planted problems, often achieving the best
known polynomial-time guarantees in terms of accuracy of recovered solutions
and robustness to noise. One theme in recent work is the design of spectral
algorithms which match the guarantees of SoS algorithms for planted problems.
Classical spectral algorithms are often unable to accomplish this: the twist in
these new spectral algorithms is the use of spectral structure of matrices
whose entries are low-degree polynomials of the input variables. We prove that
for a wide class of planted problems, including refuting random constraint
satisfaction problems, tensor and sparse PCA, densest-k-subgraph, community
detection in stochastic block models, planted clique, and others, eigenvalues
of degree-d matrix polynomials are as powerful as SoS semidefinite programs of
roughly degree d. For such problems it is therefore always possible to match
the guarantees of SoS without solving a large semidefinite program. Using
related ideas on SoS algorithms and low-degree matrix polynomials (and inspired
by recent work on SoS and the planted clique problem by Barak et al.), we prove
new nearly-tight SoS lower bounds for the tensor and sparse principal component
analysis problems. Our lower bounds for sparse principal component analysis are
the first to suggest that going beyond existing algorithms for this problem may
require sub-exponential time.

 <dc:description>  Fingerprint verification is an important bio-metric technique for personal
identification. Most of the automatic verification systems are based on
matching of fingerprint minutiae. Extraction of minutiae is an essential
process which requires estimation of orientation of the lines in an image. Most
of the existing methods involve intense mathematical computations and hence are
performed through software means. In this paper a hardware scheme to perform
real time orientation estimation is presented which is based on pipelined
architecture. Synthesized circuits proved the functionality and accuracy of the
suggested method.

 <dc:description>  The ability of sensing breathing is becoming an increasingly important
function for technology that aims at supporting both psychological and physical
wellbeing. We demonstrate ThermSense, a new breathing sensing platform based on
smartphone technology and low-cost thermal camera, which allows a user to
measure his/her breathing pattern in a contact-free manner. With the designed
key functions of Thermal Voxel Integration-based breathing estimation and
respiration variability spectrogram (RVS, bi-dimensional representation of
breathing dynamics), the developed platform provides scalability and
flexibility for gathering respiratory physiological measurements ubiquitously.
The functionality could be used for a variety of applications from stress

 <dc:title>Long-Term Inertial Navigation Aided by Dynamics of Flow Field Features</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Song, Zhuoyuan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mohseni, Kamran</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A current-aided inertial navigation framework is proposed for small
autonomous underwater vehicles in long-duration operations (&gt; 1 hour), where
neither frequent surfacing nor consistent bottom-tracking are available. We
instantiate this concept through mid-depth, underwater navigation. This
strategy mitigates dead-reckoning uncertainty of a traditional inertial
navigation system by comparing the estimate of local, ambient flow velocity
with preloaded ocean current maps. The proposed navigation system is
implemented through a marginalized particle filter where the vehicle's states
are sequentially tracked along with sensor bias and local turbulence that is
not resolved by general flow prediction. The performance of the proposed
approach is first analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations in two artificial
background flow fields, resembling real-world ocean circulation patterns,
superposed with smaller-scale, turbulent components with Kolmogorov energy
spectrum. The current-aided navigation scheme significantly improves the
dead-reckoning performance of the vehicle even when unresolved, small-scale
flow perturbations are present. For a 6-hour navigation with an
automotive-grade inertial navigation system, the current-aided navigation
scheme results in positioning estimates with under 3% uncertainty per distance
traveled (UDT) in a turbulent, double-gyre flow field, and under 7.3% UDT in a
turbulent, meandering jet flow field. Further evaluation with field test data
and actual ocean simulation analysis demonstrates consistent performance for a
6-hour mission, positioning result with under 25% UDT for a 24-hour navigation
when provided direct heading measurements, and terminal positioning estimate
with 16% UDT at the cost of increased uncertainty at an early stage of the
navigation.

 <dc:title>Automated Scalable Bayesian Inference via Hilbert Coresets</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The automation of posterior inference in Bayesian data analysis has enabled
experts and nonexperts alike to use more sophisticated models, engage in faster
exploratory modeling and analysis, and ensure experimental reproducibility.
However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at
the scale of massive modern datasets, and modifications to make them so are
typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical
guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework,
this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the dataset
itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian
inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation
of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and
demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from
the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert
coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an
inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert
coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one
based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on
approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact
computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the
construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood
functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to
implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic
datasets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a
significant reduction in the computational cost of inference.

 <dc:title>Functional Decision Theory: A New Theory of Instrumental Rationality</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yudkowsky, Eliezer</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Soares, Nate</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper describes and motivates a new decision theory known as functional
decision theory (FDT), as distinct from causal decision theory and evidential
decision theory. Functional decision theorists hold that the normative
principle for action is to treat one's decision as the output of a fixed
mathematical function that answers the question, &quot;Which output of this very
function would yield the best outcome?&quot; Adhering to this principle delivers a
number of benefits, including the ability to maximize wealth in an array of
traditional decision-theoretic and game-theoretic problems where CDT and EDT
perform poorly. Using one simple and coherent decision rule, functional
decision theorists (for example) achieve more utility than CDT on Newcomb's
problem, more utility than EDT on the smoking lesion problem, and more utility
than both in Parfit's hitchhiker problem. In this paper, we define FDT, explore
its prescriptions in a number of different decision problems, compare it to CDT
and EDT, and give philosophical justifications for FDT as a normative theory of
decision-making.

 <dc:title>A New Technique for Reachability of States in Concatenation Automata</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new technique for demonstrating the reachability of states in
deterministic finite automata representing the concatenation of two languages.
Such demonstrations are a necessary step in establishing the state complexity
of the concatenation of two languages, and thus in establishing the state
complexity of concatenation as an operation. Typically, ad-hoc induction
arguments are used to show particular states are reachable in concatenation
automata. We prove some results that seem to capture the essence of many of
these induction arguments. Using these results, reachability proofs in
concatenation automata can often be done more simply and without using
induction directly.

 <dc:description>  We propose a distributed bidding-aided Matern carrier sense multiple access
(CSMA) policy for device-to-device (D2D) content distribution. The network is
composed of D2D receivers and potential D2D transmitters, i.e., transmitters
are turned on or off by the scheduling algorithm. Each D2D receiver determines
the value of its request, by bidding on the set of potential transmitters in
its communication range. Given a medium access probability, a fraction of the
potential transmitters are jointly scheduled, i.e., turned on, determined
jointly by the auction policy and the power control scheme. The bidding-aided
scheduling algorithm exploits (i) the local demand distribution, (ii) spatial
distribution of D2D node locations, and (iii) the cache configurations of the
potential transmitters. We contrast the performance of the bidding-aided CSMA
policy with other well-known CSMA schemes that do not take into account
(i)-(iii), demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a higher spectral efficiency
in terms of the number of bits transmitted per unit time per unit bandwidth per
user. The gain becomes even more visible under randomized configurations and
requests rather than more skewed placement configurations and deterministic
demand distributions.

 <dc:description>  2D face analysis techniques, such as face landmarking, face recognition and
face verification, are reasonably dependent on illumination conditions which
are usually uncontrolled and unpredictable in the real world. An illumination
robust preprocessing method thus remains a significant challenge in reliable
face analysis. In this paper we propose a novel approach for improving lighting
normalization through building the underlying reflectance model which
characterizes interactions between skin surface, lighting source and camera
sensor, and elaborates the formation of face color appearance. Specifically,
the proposed illumination processing pipeline enables the generation of
Chromaticity Intrinsic Image (CII) in a log chromaticity space which is robust
to illumination variations. Moreover, as an advantage over most prevailing
methods, a photo-realistic color face image is subsequently reconstructed which
eliminates a wide variety of shadows whilst retaining the color information and
identity details. Experimental results under different scenarios and using
various face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed approach to deal
with lighting variations, including both soft and hard shadows, in face
recognition.

 <dc:description>  We propose a probabilistic model for interpreting gene expression levels that
are observed through single-cell RNA sequencing. In the model, each cell has a
low-dimensional latent representation. Additional latent variables account for
technical effects that may erroneously set some observations of gene expression
levels to zero. Conditional distributions are specified by neural networks,
giving the proposed model enough flexibility to fit the data well. We use
variational inference and stochastic optimization to approximate the posterior
distribution. The inference procedure scales to over one million cells, whereas
competing algorithms do not. Even for smaller datasets, for several tasks, the
proposed procedure outperforms state-of-the-art methods like ZIFA and
ZINB-WaVE. We also extend our framework to take into account batch effects and
other confounding factors and propose a natural Bayesian hypothesis framework
for differential expression that outperforms tradition DESeq2.

 <dc:description>  Recent work on imitation learning has generated policies that reproduce
expert behavior from multi-modal data. However, past approaches have focused
only on recreating a small number of distinct, expert maneuvers, or have relied
on supervised learning techniques that produce unstable policies. This work
extends InfoGAIL, an algorithm for multi-modal imitation learning, to reproduce
behavior over an extended period of time. Our approach involves reformulating
the typical imitation learning setting to include &quot;burn-in demonstrations&quot; upon
which policies are conditioned at test time. We demonstrate that our approach
outperforms standard InfoGAIL in maximizing the mutual information between
predicted and unseen style labels in road scene simulations, and we show that
our method leads to policies that imitate expert autonomous driving systems
over long time horizons.

 <dc:description>  Data discretization is an important step in the process of machine learning,
since it is easier for classifiers to deal with discrete attributes rather than
continuous attributes. Over the years, several methods of performing
discretization such as Boolean Reasoning, Equal Frequency Binning, Entropy have
been proposed, explored, and implemented. In this article, a simple supervised
discretization approach is introduced. The prime goal of MIL is to maximize
classification accuracy of classifier, minimizing loss of information while
discretization of continuous attributes. The performance of the suggested
approach is compared with the supervised discretization algorithm Minimum
Information Loss (MIL), using the state-of-the-art rule inductive algorithms-
J48 (Java implementation of C4.5 classifier). The presented approach is,
indeed, the modified version of MIL. The empirical results show that the
modified approach performs better in several cases in comparison to the
original MIL algorithm and Minimum Description Length Principle (MDLP) .

 <dc:description>  Regularization for matrix factorization (MF) and approximation problems has
been carried out in many different ways. Due to its popularity in deep
learning, dropout has been applied also for this class of problems. Despite its
solid empirical performance, the theoretical properties of dropout as a
regularizer remain quite elusive for this class of problems. In this paper, we
present a theoretical analysis of dropout for MF, where Bernoulli random
variables are used to drop columns of the factors. We demonstrate the
equivalence between dropout and a fully deterministic model for MF in which the
factors are regularized by the sum of the product of squared Euclidean norms of
the columns. Additionally, we inspect the case of a variable sized
factorization and we prove that dropout achieves the global minimum of a convex
approximation problem with (squared) nuclear norm regularization. As a result,
we conclude that dropout can be used as a low-rank regularizer with data
dependent singular-value thresholding.

 <dc:description>  Learning phrase representations has been widely explored in many Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks (e.g., Sentiment Analysis, Machine Translation)
and has shown promising improvements. Previous studies either learn
non-compositional phrase representations with general word embedding learning
techniques or learn compositional phrase representations based on syntactic
structures, which either require huge amounts of human annotations or cannot be
easily generalized to all phrases. In this work, we propose to take advantage
of large-scaled paraphrase database and present a pair-wise gated recurrent
units (pairwise-GRU) framework to generate compositional phrase
representations. Our framework can be re-used to generate representations for
any phrases. Experimental results show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on several phrase similarity tasks.

 <dc:description>  With the development of Big Data and cloud data sharing, privacy preserving
data publishing becomes one of the most important topics in the past decade. As
one of the most influential privacy definitions, differential privacy provides
a rigorous and provable privacy guarantee for data publishing. Differentially
private interactive publishing achieves good performance in many applications;
however, the curator has to release a large number of queries in a batch or a
synthetic dataset in the Big Data era. To provide accurate non-interactive
publishing results in the constraint of differential privacy, two challenges
need to be tackled: one is how to decrease the correlation between large sets
of queries, while the other is how to predict on fresh queries. Neither is easy
to solve by the traditional differential privacy mechanism. This paper
transfers the data publishing problem to a machine learning problem, in which
queries are considered as training samples and a prediction model will be
released rather than query results or synthetic datasets. When the model is
published, it can be used to answer current submitted queries and predict
results for fresh queries from the public. Compared with the traditional
method, the proposed prediction model enhances the accuracy of query results
for non-interactive publishing. Experimental results show that the proposed
solution outperforms traditional differential privacy in terms of Mean Absolute
Value on a large group of queries. This also suggests the learning model can
successfully retain the utility of published queries while preserving privacy.

 <dc:description>  Optic disk segmentation is a prerequisite step in automatic retinal screening
systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for optic disk segmentation
based on a local adaptive thresholding method. Location of the optic disk is
validated by intensity and average vessel width of retinal images. Then an
adaptive thresholding is applied on the temporal and nasal part of the optic
disc separately. Adaptive thresholding, makes our algorithm robust to
illumination variations and various image acquisition conditions. Moreover,
experimental results on the DRIVE and KHATAM databases show promising results
compared to the recent literature. In the DRIVE database, the optic disk in all
images is correctly located and the mean overlap reached to 43.21%. The optic
disk is correctly detected in 98% of the images with the mean overlap of 36.32%
in the KHATAM database.

 <dc:description>  It is known that the inconsistent distribution and representation of
different modalities, such as image and text, cause the heterogeneity gap that
makes it challenging to correlate such heterogeneous data. Generative
adversarial networks (GANs) have shown its strong ability of modeling data
distribution and learning discriminative representation, existing GANs-based
works mainly focus on generative problem to generate new data. We have
different goal, aim to correlate heterogeneous data, by utilizing the power of
GANs to model cross-modal joint distribution. Thus, we propose Cross-modal GANs
to learn discriminative common representation for bridging heterogeneity gap.
The main contributions are: (1) Cross-modal GANs architecture is proposed to
model joint distribution over data of different modalities. The inter-modality
and intra-modality correlation can be explored simultaneously in generative and
discriminative models. Both of them beat each other to promote cross-modal
correlation learning. (2) Cross-modal convolutional autoencoders with
weight-sharing constraint are proposed to form generative model. They can not
only exploit cross-modal correlation for learning common representation, but
also preserve reconstruction information for capturing semantic consistency
within each modality. (3) Cross-modal adversarial mechanism is proposed, which
utilizes two kinds of discriminative models to simultaneously conduct
intra-modality and inter-modality discrimination. They can mutually boost to
make common representation more discriminative by adversarial training process.
To the best of our knowledge, our proposed CM-GANs approach is the first to
utilize GANs to perform cross-modal common representation learning. Experiments
are conducted to verify the performance of our proposed approach on cross-modal
retrieval paradigm, compared with 10 methods on 3 cross-modal datasets.

 <dc:title>Subsampling for Ridge Regression via Regularized Volume Sampling</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Given $n$ vectors $\mathbf{x}_i\in \mathbb{R}^d$, we want to fit a linear
regression model for noisy labels $y_i\in\mathbb{R}$. The ridge estimator is a
classical solution to this problem. However, when labels are expensive, we are
forced to select only a small subset of vectors $\mathbf{x}_i$ for which we
obtain the labels $y_i$. We propose a new procedure for selecting the subset of
vectors, such that the ridge estimator obtained from that subset offers strong
statistical guarantees in terms of the mean squared prediction error over the
entire dataset of $n$ labeled vectors. The number of labels needed is
proportional to the statistical dimension of the problem which is often much
smaller than $d$. Our method is an extension of a joint subsampling procedure
called volume sampling. A second major contribution is that we speed up volume
sampling so that it is essentially as efficient as leverage scores, which is
the main i.i.d. subsampling procedure for this task. Finally, we show
theoretically and experimentally that volume sampling has a clear advantage
over any i.i.d. sampling in the sparse label case.

 <dc:description>  The key obstacle to achieving the full potential of the millimeter wave
(mmWave) band has been the poor propagation characteristics of wireless signals
in this band. One approach to overcome this issue is to use antennas that can
support higher gains while providing beam adaptability and diversity, i.e.,
reconfigurable antennas. In this article, we present a new architecture for
mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications that uses a new
class of reconfigurable antennas. More specifically, the proposed lens-based
antennas can support multiple radiation patterns while using a single radio
frequency chain. Moreover, by using a beam selection network, each antenna beam
can be steered in the desired direction. Further, using the proposed
reconfigurable antenna in a MIMO architecture, we propose a new signal
processing algorithm that uses the additional degrees of freedom provided by
the antennas to overcome propagation issues at mmWave frequencies. Our
simulation results show that the proposed reconfigurable antenna MIMO
architecture significantly enhances the performance of mmWave communication
systems.

 <dc:description>  We investigate video classification via a two-stream convolutional neural
network (CNN) design that directly ingests information extracted from
compressed video bitstreams. Our approach begins with the observation that all
modern video codecs divide the input frames into macroblocks (MBs). We
demonstrate that selective access to MB motion vector (MV) information within
compressed video bitstreams can also provide for selective, motion-adaptive, MB
pixel decoding (a.k.a., MB texture decoding). This in turn allows for the
derivation of spatio-temporal video activity regions at extremely high speed in
comparison to conventional full-frame decoding followed by optical flow
estimation. In order to evaluate the accuracy of a video classification
framework based on such activity data, we independently train two CNN
architectures on MB texture and MV correspondences and then fuse their scores
to derive the final classification of each test video. Evaluation on two
standard datasets shows that the proposed approach is competitive to the best
two-stream video classification approaches found in the literature. At the same
time: (i) a CPU-based realization of our MV extraction is over 977 times faster
than GPU-based optical flow methods; (ii) selective decoding is up to 12 times
faster than full-frame decoding; (iii) our proposed spatial and temporal CNNs
perform inference at 5 to 49 times lower cloud computing cost than the fastest
methods from the literature.

 <dc:title>Hierarchical semantic segmentation using modular convolutional neural
  networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eppel, Sagi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Image recognition tasks that involve identifying parts of an object or the
contents of a vessel can be viewed as a hierarchical problem, which can be
solved by initial recognition of the main object, followed by recognition of
its parts or contents. To achieve such modular recognition, it is necessary to
use the output of one recognition method (which identifies the general object)
as the input for a second method (which identifies the parts or contents). In
recent years, convolutional neural networks have emerged as the dominant method
for segmentation and classification of images. This work examines a method for
serially connecting convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation of
materials inside transparent vessels. It applies one fully convolutional neural
net to segment the image into vessel and background, and the vessel region is
used as an input for a second net which recognizes the contents of the glass
vessel. Transferring the segmentation map generated by the first nets to the
second net was performed using the valve filter attention method that involves
using different filters on different segments of the image. This modular
semantic segmentation method outperforms a single step method in which both the
vessel and its contents are identified using a single net. An advantage of the
modular neural net is that it allows networks to be built from existing trained
modules, as well the transfer and reuse of trained net modules without the need
for any retraining of the assembled net.

 <dc:description>  Parametric embedding methods such as parametric t-SNE (pt-SNE) have been
widely adopted for data visualization and out-of-sample data embedding without
further computationally expensive optimization or approximation. However, the
performance of pt-SNE is highly sensitive to the hyper-parameter batch size due
to conflicting optimization goals, and often produces dramatically different
embeddings with different choices of user-defined perplexities. To effectively
solve these issues, we present parametric t-distributed stochastic
exemplar-centered embedding methods. Our strategy learns embedding parameters
by comparing given data only with precomputed exemplars, resulting in a cost
function with linear computational and memory complexity, which is further
reduced by noise contrastive samples. Moreover, we propose a shallow embedding
network with high-order feature interactions for data visualization, which is
much easier to tune but produces comparable performance in contrast to a deep
neural network employed by pt-SNE. We empirically demonstrate, using several
benchmark datasets, that our proposed methods significantly outperform pt-SNE
in terms of robustness, visual effects, and quantitative evaluations.

 <dc:title>MinDelay: Low-latency Forwarding and Caching Algorithms for
  Information-Centric Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We present a new unified framework for minimizing congestion-dependent
network cost in information-centric networks by jointly optimizing forwarding
and caching strategies. As caching variables are integer-constrained, the
resulting optimization problem is NP-hard. To make progress, we focus on a
relaxed version of the optimization problem, where caching variables are
allowed to be real-valued. We develop necessary optimality conditions for the
relaxed problem, and leverage this result to design MinDelay, an adaptive and
distributed joint forwarding and caching algorithm, based on the conditional
gradient algorithm. The MinDelay algorithm elegantly yields feasible routing
variables and integer caching variables at each iteration, and can be
implemented in a distributed manner with low complexity and overhead. Over a
wide range of network topologies, simulation results show that MinDelay
typically has significantly better delay performance in the low to moderate
request rate regions. Furthermore, the MinDelay and VIP algorithms complement
each other in delivering superior delay performance across the entire range of
request arrival rates.

 <dc:description>  Predicting fine-grained interests of users with temporal behavior is
important to personalization and information filtering applications. However,
existing interest prediction methods are incapable of capturing the subtle
degreed user interests towards particular items, and the internal time-varying
drifting attention of individuals is not studied yet. Moreover, the prediction
process can also be affected by inter-personal influence, known as behavioral
mutual infectivity. Inspired by point process in modeling temporal point
process, in this paper we present a deep prediction method based on two
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to jointly model each user's continuous
browsing history and asynchronous event sequences in the context of inter-user
behavioral mutual infectivity. Our model is able to predict the fine-grained
interest from a user regarding a particular item and corresponding timestamps
when an occurrence of event takes place. The proposed approach is more flexible
to capture the dynamic characteristic of event sequences by using the temporal
point process to model event data and timely update its intensity function by
RNNs. Furthermore, to improve the interpretability of the model, the attention
mechanism is introduced to emphasize both intra-personal and inter-personal
behavior influence over time. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in fine-grained user interest
prediction.
