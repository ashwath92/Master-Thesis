 <dc:title>Improved Parsing for Argument-Clusters Coordination</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Goldberg, Yoav</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Syntactic parsers perform poorly in prediction of Argument-Cluster
Coordination (ACC). We change the PTB representation of ACC to be more suitable
for learning by a statistical PCFG parser, affecting 125 trees in the training
set. Training on the modified trees yields a slight improvement in EVALB scores
on sections 22 and 23. The main evaluation is on a corpus of 4th grade science
exams, in which ACC structures are prevalent. On this corpus, we obtain an
impressive x2.7 improvement in recovering ACC structures compared to a parser
trained on the original PTB trees.

 <dc:description>  We present a content-based automatic music tagging algorithm using fully
convolutional neural networks (FCNs). We evaluate different architectures
consisting of 2D convolutional layers and subsampling layers only. In the
experiments, we measure the AUC-ROC scores of the architectures with different
complexities and input types using the MagnaTagATune dataset, where a 4-layer
architecture shows state-of-the-art performance with mel-spectrogram input.
Furthermore, we evaluated the performances of the architectures with varying
the number of layers on a larger dataset (Million Song Dataset), and found that
deeper models outperformed the 4-layer architecture. The experiments show that
mel-spectrogram is an effective time-frequency representation for automatic
tagging and that more complex models benefit from more training data.

 <dc:description>  Activation function is crucial to the recent successes of deep neural
networks. In this paper, we first propose a new activation function, Multiple
Parametric Exponential Linear Units (MPELU), aiming to generalize and unify the
rectified and exponential linear units. As the generalized form, MPELU shares
the advantages of Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) and Exponential
Linear Unit (ELU), leading to better classification performance and convergence
property. In addition, weight initialization is very important to train very
deep networks. The existing methods laid a solid foundation for networks using
rectified linear units but not for exponential linear units. This paper
complements the current theory and extends it to the wider range. Specifically,
we put forward a way of initialization, enabling training of very deep networks
using exponential linear units. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
initialization not only helps the training process but leads to better
generalization performance. Finally, utilizing the proposed activation function
and initialization, we present a deep MPELU residual architecture that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10/100 datasets. The code is
available at https://github.com/Coldmooon/Code-for-MPELU.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic surface growth models aid in studying properties of universality
classes like the Kardar--Paris--Zhang class. High precision results obtained
from large scale computational studies can be transferred to many physical
systems. Many properties, such as roughening and some two-time functions can be
studied using stochastic cellular automaton (SCA) variants of stochastic
models. Here we present a highly efficient SCA implementation of a surface
growth model capable of simulating billions of lattice sites on a single GPU.
We also provide insight into cases requiring arbitrary random probabilities
which are not accessible through bit-vectorization.

 <dc:description>  We give an oracle-based algorithm for the adversarial contextual bandit
problem, where either contexts are drawn i.i.d. or the sequence of contexts is
known a priori, but where the losses are picked adversarially. Our algorithm is
computationally efficient, assuming access to an offline optimization oracle,
and enjoys a regret of order $O((KT)^{\frac{2}{3}}(\log N)^{\frac{1}{3}})$,
where $K$ is the number of actions, $T$ is the number of iterations and $N$ is
the number of baseline policies. Our result is the first to break the
$O(T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ barrier that is achieved by recently introduced
algorithms. Breaking this barrier was left as a major open problem. Our
analysis is based on the recent relaxation based approach of (Rakhlin and
Sridharan, 2016).

 <dc:description>  We present a general formal argumentation system for dealing with the

conditional obligations, we answer the question whether an unconditional
obligation is detachable by considering reasons for and against its detachment.
For the evaluation of arguments in favor of detaching obligations we use a
Dung-style argumentation-theoretical semantics. We illustrate the modularity of
the general framework by considering some extensions, and we compare the
framework to some related approaches from the literature.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multimedia content delivery over the Internet is predominantly using the
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) as its primary protocol and multiple
proprietary solutions exits. The MPEG standard Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over
HTTP (DASH) provides an interoperable solution and in recent years various
adaptation logics/algorithms have been proposed. However, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no comprehensive evaluation of the various
logics/algorithms. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of
ten different adaptation logics/algorithms, which have been proposed in the
past years. The evaluation is done both objectively and subjectively. The
former is using a predefined bandwidth trajectory within a controlled
environment and the latter is done in a real-world environment adopting
crowdsourcing. The results shall provide insights about which strategy can be
adopted in actual deployment scenarios. Additionally, the evaluation
methodology described in this paper can be used to evaluate any other/new
adaptation logic and to compare it directly with the results reported here.

 <dc:description>  We analyze how both traditional data center integration and dispatchable load
integration affect power grid efficiency. We use detailed network models,
parallel optimization solvers, and thousands of renewable generation scenarios
to perform our analysis. Our analysis reveals that significant spillage and
stranded power will be observed in power grids as wind power levels are
increased. A counter-intuitive finding is that collocating data centers with
inflexible loads next to wind farms has limited impacts on renewable portfolio
standard (RPS) goals because it provides limited system-level flexibility and
can in fact increase stranded power and fossil-fueled generation. In contrast,
optimally placing data centers that are dispatchable (with flexible loads)
provides system-wide flexibility, reduces stranded power, and improves
efficiency. In short, optimally placed dispatchable computing loads can enable
better scaling to high RPS. We show that these dispatchable computing loads are
powered to 60~80\% of their requested capacity, indicating that there are
significant economic incentives provided by stranded power.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this study, we report on techniques and analyses that enable us to capture
Internet-wide activity at individual IP address-level granularity by relying on
server logs of a large commercial content delivery network (CDN) that serves
close to 3 trillion HTTP requests on a daily basis. Across the whole of 2015,
these logs recorded client activity involving 1.2 billion unique IPv4
addresses, the highest ever measured, in agreement with recent estimates.
Monthly client IPv4 address counts showed constant growth for years prior, but
since 2014, the IPv4 count has stagnated while IPv6 counts have grown. Thus, it
seems we have entered an era marked by increased complexity, one in which the
sole enumeration of active IPv4 addresses is of little use to characterize
recent growth of the Internet as a whole.
  With this observation in mind, we consider new points of view in the study of
global IPv4 address activity. Our analysis shows significant churn in active
IPv4 addresses: the set of active IPv4 addresses varies by as much as 25% over
the course of a year. Second, by looking across the active addresses in a
prefix, we are able to identify and attribute activity patterns to network
restructurings, user behaviors, and, in particular, various address assignment
practices. Third, by combining spatio-temporal measures of address utilization
with measures of traffic volume, and sampling-based estimates of relative host
counts, we present novel perspectives on worldwide IPv4 address activity,
including empirical observation of under-utilization in some areas, and
complete utilization, or exhaustion, in others.

 <dc:description>  There is an increasing consensus among re- searchers that making a computer
emotionally intelligent with the ability to decode human affective states would
allow a more meaningful and natural way of human-computer interactions (HCIs).
One unobtrusive and non-invasive way of recognizing human affective states
entails the exploration of how physiological signals vary under different
emotional experiences. In particular, this paper explores the correlation
between autonomically-mediated changes in multimodal body signals and discrete
emotional states. In order to fully exploit the information in each modality,
we have provided an innovative classification approach for three specific
physiological signals including Electromyogram (EMG), Blood Volume Pressure
(BVP) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). These signals are analyzed as inputs to
an emotion recognition paradigm based on fusion of a series of weak learners.
Our proposed classification approach showed 88.1% recognition accuracy, which
outperformed the conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with 17%
accuracy improvement. Furthermore, in order to avoid information redundancy and
the resultant over-fitting, a feature reduction method is proposed based on a
correlation analysis to optimize the number of features required for training
and validating each weak learner. Results showed that despite the feature space
dimensionality reduction from 27 to 18 features, our methodology preserved the
recognition accuracy of about 85.0%. This reduction in complexity will get us
one step closer towards embedding this human emotion encoder in the wireless
and wearable HCI platforms.

rules or engineered features; instead, we train deep neural networks on a large
conversational dataset. In particular, we exploit the structure of Reddit
comments and posts to extract 2.1 billion messages and 133 million
conversations. We evaluate our models on the task of predicting the next
response in a conversation, and we find that modeling both context and
participants improves prediction accuracy.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of estimating the depth map of a scene given
a single RGB image. We propose a fully convolutional architecture, encompassing
residual learning, to model the ambiguous mapping between monocular images and
depth maps. In order to improve the output resolution, we present a novel way
to efficiently learn feature map up-sampling within the network. For
optimization, we introduce the reverse Huber loss that is particularly suited
for the task at hand and driven by the value distributions commonly present in
depth maps. Our model is composed of a single architecture that is trained
end-to-end and does not rely on post-processing techniques, such as CRFs or
other additional refinement steps. As a result, it runs in real-time on images
or videos. In the evaluation, we show that the proposed model contains fewer
parameters and requires fewer training data than the current state of the art,
while outperforming all approaches on depth estimation. Code and models are
publicly available.

 <dc:description>  Applying submodular maximization in the streaming setting is nontrivial
because the commonly used greedy algorithm exceeds the fixed memory and
computational limits typically needed during stream processing. We introduce a
new algorithm, called stream clipper, that uses two thresholds to select
elements either into a solution set $S$ or an extra buffer $B$. The output is
achieved by a greedy algorithm that starts from $S$ and then, if needed,
greedily adds elements from $B$. Swapping elements out of $S$ may also be
triggered lazily for further improvements, and elements may also be removed
from $B$ (and corresponding thresholds adjusted) in order to keep memory use
bounded by a constant. Although the worst-case approximation factor does not
outperform the previous worst-case of $1/2$, stream clipper can perform better
than $1/2$ depending on the order of the elements in the stream. We develop the
idea of an &quot;order complexity&quot; to characterize orders on which an approximation
factor of $1-\alpha$ can be achieved. In news and video summarization tasks,
stream clipper significantly outperforms other streaming methods. It shows
similar performance to the greedy algorithm but with less computation and
memory costs.

 <dc:description>  Diagnosing and fixing performance problems on multicore machines with deep
memory hierarchies is extremely challenging. Certain problems are best
addressed when we can analyze the entire trace of program execution, e.g.,
every memory access. Unfortunately such detailed execution logs are very large
and cannot be analyzed by direct inspection. We present DINAMITE: a toolkit for
Dynamic INstrumentation and Analysis for MassIve Trace Exploration. DINAMITE is
a collection of tools for end-to-end performance analysis: from the LLVM
compiler pass that instruments the program to plug-and-play tools that use a
modern data analytics engine Spark Streaming for trace introspection. Using
DINAMITE we found opportunities to improve data layout in several applications
that resulted in 15-20% performance improvements and found a shared-variable
bottleneck in a popular key-value store, whose elimination improved performance
by 20x.

 <dc:description>  The ability to store data in the DNA of a living organism has applications in
a variety of areas including synthetic biology and watermarking of patented
genetically-modified organisms. Data stored in this medium is subject to errors
arising from various mutations, such as point mutations, indels, and tandem
duplication, which need to be corrected to maintain data integrity. In this
paper, we provide error-correcting codes for errors caused by tandem
duplications, which create a copy of a block of the sequence and insert it in a
tandem manner, i.e., next to the original. In particular, we present two
families of codes for correcting errors due to tandem-duplications of a fixed
length, the first family can correct any number of errors while the second
corrects a bounded number of errors. We also study codes for correcting tandem
duplications of length up to a given constant $k$, where we are primarily
focused on the cases of $k=2,3$. Finally, we provide a full classification of
the sets of lengths allowed in tandem duplication that result in a unique root
for all sequences.

 <dc:description>  In this short communication we introduce the quick clustering algorithm
(QUIST), an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm based on sorting. QUIST
is a poly-logarithmic divisive clustering algorithm that does not assume the
number of clusters, and/or the cluster size to be known ahead of time. It is
also insensitive to the original ordering of the input.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new random pruning method (called &quot;submodular sparsification
(SS)&quot;) to reduce the cost of submodular maximization. The pruning is applied
via a &quot;submodularity graph&quot; over the $n$ ground elements, where each directed
edge is associated with a pairwise dependency defined by the submodular
function. In each step, SS prunes a $1-1/\sqrt{c}$ (for $c&gt;1$) fraction of the
nodes using weights on edges computed based on only a small number ($O(\log
n)$) of randomly sampled nodes. The algorithm requires $\log_{\sqrt{c}}n$ steps
with a small and highly parallelizable per-step computation. An accuracy-speed
tradeoff parameter $c$, set as $c = 8$, leads to a fast shrink rate
$\sqrt{2}/4$ and small iteration complexity $\log_{2\sqrt{2}}n$. Analysis shows
that w.h.p., the greedy algorithm on the pruned set of size $O(\log^2 n)$ can
achieve a guarantee similar to that of processing the original dataset. In news
and video summarization tasks, SS is able to substantially reduce both
computational costs and memory usage, while maintaining (or even slightly
exceeding) the quality of the original (and much more costly) greedy algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Clock synchronization is ubiquitous in wireless systems for communication,
sensing and control. In this paper we design a scalable system in which an
indefinite number of passively receiving wireless units can synchronize to a
single master clock at the level of discrete clock ticks. Accurate
synchronization requires an estimate of the node positions. If such information
is available the framework developed here takes position uncertainties into
account. In the absence of such information we propose a mechanism which
enables simultaneous synchronization and positioning. Furthermore we derive the
Cramer-Rao bounds for the system which show that it enables synchronization
accuracy at sub-nanosecond levels. Finally, we develop and evaluate an online
estimation method which is statistically efficient.

 <dc:title>How to advance general game playing artificial intelligence by player
  modelling</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Cowley, Benjamin Ultan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  General game playing artificial intelligence has recently seen important
advances due to the various techniques known as 'deep learning'. However the
advances conceal equally important limitations in their reliance on: massive
data sets; fortuitously constructed problems; and absence of any human-level
complexity, including other human opponents. On the other hand, deep learning
systems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well.
The power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep
learning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving
beyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not
just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing
artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is
because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of
problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I
relate this argument to the performance of state of art general game playing
agents. I then describe a concept for a formal category theoretic basis to a
generalised player model. This formal model approach integrates my existing
'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:

Modelling using Psychology-Based Player Traits and Domain Specific Features.

datasets, as well as timestamps linked to the extraction procedure. This
paradigm is described through the modifications of the language used to
exchange data within the VAMDC and through the services that will implement
those modifications. This new paradigm should enforce traceability of datasets,
favour reproducibility of datasets extraction, and facilitate the systematic

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the use of the binary primes sequence to strengthen
pseudorandom (PN) decimal sequences for cryptography applications. The binary
primes sequence is added to the PN decimal sequence (where one can choose from
many arbitrary shift values) and it is shown that the sum sequence has improved
autocorrelation properties besides being computationally hard. Also, an
analysis on the computational complexity is performed and it is shown that the
complexity for the eavesdropper is of exponential complexity and therefore, the
proposed method is an attractive procedure for cryptographic applications.

 <dc:description>  In retrospective assessments, internet news reports have been shown to
capture early reports of unknown infectious disease transmission prior to
official laboratory confirmation. In general, media interest and reporting
peaks and wanes during the course of an outbreak. In this study, we quantify
the extent to which media interest during infectious disease outbreaks is
indicative of trends of reported incidence. We introduce an approach that uses
supervised temporal topic models to transform large corpora of news articles
into temporal topic trends. The key advantages of this approach include,
applicability to a wide range of diseases, and ability to capture disease
dynamics - including seasonality, abrupt peaks and troughs. We evaluated the
method using data from multiple infectious disease outbreaks reported in the
United States of America (U.S.), China and India. We noted that temporal topic
trends extracted from disease-related news reports successfully captured the
dynamics of multiple outbreaks such as whooping cough in U.S. (2012), dengue
outbreaks in India (2013) and China (2014). Our observations also suggest that
efficient modeling of temporal topic trends using time-series regression
techniques can estimate disease case counts with increased precision before
official reports by health organizations.

 <dc:description>  In several domains such as linguistics, molecular biology or social sciences,
holistic effects are hardly well-defined by modeling with single units, but
more and more studies tend to understand macro structures with the help of
meaningful and useful associations in fields such as social networks, systems
biology or semantic web. A stochastic multi-agent system offers both accurate
theoretical framework and operational computing implementations to model
large-scale associations, their dynamics and patterns extraction. We show that
clustering around a target object in a set of associations of object prove some
similarity in specific data and two case studies about gene-gene and term-term
relationships leading to an idea of a common organizing principle of cognition
with random and deterministic effects.

 <dc:description>  Given an $n$-vertex graph and two straight-line planar drawings of the graph
that have the same faces and the same outer face, we show that there is a morph
(i.e., a continuous transformation) between the two drawings that preserves
straight-line planarity and consists of $O(n)$ steps, which we prove is optimal
in the worst case. Each step is a unidirectional linear morph, which means that
every vertex moves at constant speed along a straight line, and the lines are
parallel although the vertex speeds may differ. Thus we provide an efficient
version of Cairns' 1944 proof of the existence of straight-line
planarity-preserving morphs for triangulated graphs, which required an
exponential number of steps.

 <dc:title>Attack resilient architecture to replace embedded Flash with STTRAM in
  homogeneous IoTs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM) is an emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM)
technology that provides better endurance, write energy and performance than
traditional NVM technologies such as Flash. In embedded application such as
microcontroller SoC of Internet of Things (IoT), embedded Flash (eFlash) is
widely employed. However, eFlash is also associated with cost. Therefore,
replacing eFlash with STTRAM is desirable in IoTs for power-efficiency.
Although promising, STTRAM brings several new security and privacy challenges
that pose a significant threat to sensitive data in memory. This is inevitable
due to the underlying dependency of this memory technology on environmental
parameters such as temperature and magnetic fields that can be exploited by an
adversary to tamper with the program and data. In this paper, we investigate
these attacks and propose a novel memory architecture for attack resilient IoT
network. The information redundancy present in a homogeneous peer-to-peer
connected IoT network is exploited to restore the corrupted memory of any IoT
node when under attack. We are able to build a failsafe IoT system with STTRAM
based program memory which allows guaranteed execution of all the IoT nodes
without complete shutdown of any node under attack. Experimental results using
commercial IoT boards demonstrate the latency and energy overhead of the attack
recovery process.

 <dc:description>  Crossbar arrays using emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as
Resistive RAM (ReRAM) offer high density, fast access speed and low-power.
However the bandwidth of the crossbar is limited to single-bit read/write per
access to avoid selection of undesirable bits. We propose a technique to
perform multi-bit read and write in a diode-STTRAM (Spin Transfer Torque RAM)
crossbar array. Simulation shows that the biasing voltage of half-selected
cells can be adjusted to improve the sense margin during read and thus reduce
the sneak path through the half-selected cells. In write operation, the
half-selected cells are biased with a pulse voltage source which increases the
write latency of these cells and enables to write 2-bits while keeping the
half-selected bits undisturbed. Simulation results indicate biasing the
half-selected cells by 700mV can enable reading as much as 512-bits while
sustaining 512x512 crossbar with 2.04 years retention. The 2-bit writing
requires pulsing by 50mV to optimize energy.

 <dc:description>  Face analysis techniques have become a crucial component of human-machine
interaction in the fields of assistive and humanoid robotics. However, the
variations in head-pose that arise naturally in these environments are still a
great challenge. In this paper, we present a real-time capable 3D face
modelling framework for 2D in-the-wild images that is applicable for robotics.
The fitting of the 3D Morphable Model is based exclusively on automatically
detected landmarks. After fitting, the face can be corrected in pose and
transformed back to a frontal 2D representation that is more suitable for face
recognition. We conduct face recognition experiments with non-frontal images
from the MUCT database and uncontrolled, in the wild images from the PaSC
database, the most challenging face recognition database to date, showing an
improved performance. Finally, we present our SCITOS G5 robot system, which
incorporates our framework as a means of image pre-processing for face
analysis.

 <dc:description>  We characterize the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) rates of a full-duplex
cloud radio access network (C-RAN) with all participate and single best remote
radio head (RRH) association schemes. Specifically, multi-antenna equipped RRHs
distributed according to a Poisson point process is assumed. The UL and DL sum
rate of the single best RRH association scheme is maximized using receive and
transmit beamformer designs at the UL and DL RRHs, respectively. In the case of
the single best strategy, we study both optimum and sub-optimum schemes based
on maximum ratio combining/maximal ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) and
zero-forcing/MRT (ZF/MRT) processing. Numerical results show that significant
performance improvements can be achieved by using the full-duplex mode as
compared to the half-duplex mode. Moreover, the choice of the beamforming
design and the RRH association scheme have a major influence on the achievable
full-duplex gains.

 <dc:description>  Formalizing an RDF abstract graph model to be compatible with the RDF formal
semantics has remained one of the foundational problems in the Semantic Web. In
this paper, we propose a new formal graph model for RDF datasets. This model
allows us to express the current model-theoretic semantics in the form of a
graph. We also propose the concepts of resource path and triple path as well as
an algorithm for traversing the new graph. We demonstrate the feasibility of
this graph model through two implementations: one is a new graph engine called
GraphKE, and the other is extended from RDF-3X to show that existing systems
can also benefit from this model. In order to evaluate the empirical aspect of
our graph model, we choose the shortest path algorithm and implement it in the
GraphKE and the RDF-3X. Our experiments on both engines for finding the
shortest paths in the YAGO2S-SP dataset give decent performance in terms of
execution time. The empirical results show that our graph model with
well-defined semantics can be effectively implemented.

 <dc:description>  The Median of Medians (also known as BFPRT) algorithm, although a landmark
theoretical achievement, is seldom used in practice because it and its variants
are slower than simple approaches based on sampling. The main contribution of
this paper is a fast linear-time deterministic selection algorithm
QuickselectAdaptive based on a refined definition of MedianOfMedians. The
algorithm's performance brings deterministic selection---along with its
desirable properties of reproducible runs, predictable run times, and immunity
to pathological inputs---in the range of practicality. We demonstrate results
on independent and identically distributed random inputs and on
normally-distributed inputs. Measurements show that QuickselectAdaptive is
faster than state-of-the-art baselines.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation is an important step in most visual tasks. While
convolutional neural networks have shown to perform well on single image
segmentation, to our knowledge, no study has been been done on leveraging
recurrent gated architectures for video segmentation. Accordingly, we propose a
novel method for online segmentation of video sequences that incorporates
temporal data. The network is built from fully convolutional element and
recurrent unit that works on a sliding window over the temporal data. We also
introduce a novel convolutional gated recurrent unit that preserves the spatial
information and reduces the parameters learned. Our method has the advantage
that it can work in an online fashion instead of operating over the whole input
batch of video frames. The network is tested on the change detection dataset,
and proved to have 5.5\% improvement in F-measure over a plain fully
convolutional network for per frame segmentation. It was also shown to have
improvement of 1.4\% for the F-measure compared to our baseline network that we
call FCN 12s.

 <dc:description>  We obtain a recurrence relation in $d$ for the average singular value $%
\alpha (d)$ of a complex valued $d\times d$\ matrix $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}X$ with
random i.i.d., N( 0,1) entries, and use it to show that $\alpha (d)$ decreases
monotonically with $d$ to the limit given by the Marchenko-Pastur
distribution.\ The monotonicity of $\alpha (d)$ has been recently conjectured
by Bandeira, Kennedy and Singer in their study of the Little Grothendieck
problem over the unitary group $\mathcal{U}_{d}$ \cite{BKS}, a combinatorial
optimization problem. The result implies sharp global estimates for $\alpha
(d)$, new bounds for the expected minimum and maximum singular values, and a
lower bound for the ratio of the expected maximum and the expected minimum
singular value. The proof is based on a connection with the theory of Tur\'{a}n
determinants of orthogonal polynomials. We also discuss some applications to
the problem that originally motivated the conjecture.

 <dc:description>  Binary decisions are very common in artificial intelligence. Applying a
threshold on the continuous score gives the human decider the power to control
the operating point to separate the two classes. The classifier,s
discriminating power is measured along the continuous range of the score by the
Area Under the ROC curve (AUC_ROC) in most application fields. Only finances
uses the poor single point metric maximum Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) distance.
This paper proposes the Area Under the KS curve (AUC_KS) for performance
assessment and proves AUC_ROC = 0.5 + AUC_KS, as a simpler way to calculate the
AUC_ROC. That is even more important for ROC averaging in ensembles of
classifiers or n fold cross-validation. The proof is geometrically inspired on
rotating all KS curve to make it lie on the top of the ROC chance diagonal. On
the practical side, the independent variable on the abscissa on the KS curve
simplifies the calculation of the AUC_ROC. On the theoretical side, this
research gives insights on probabilistic interpretations of classifiers
assessment and integrates the existing body of knowledge of the information
theoretical ROC approach with the proposed statistical approach based on the
thoroughly known KS distribution.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Language models (LMs) are statistical models that calculate probabilities
over sequences of words or other discrete symbols. Currently two major
paradigms for language modeling exist: count-based n-gram models, which have
advantages of scalability and test-time speed, and neural LMs, which often
achieve superior modeling performance. We demonstrate how both varieties of
models can be unified in a single modeling framework that defines a set of
probability distributions over the vocabulary of words, and then dynamically
calculates mixture weights over these distributions. This formulation allows us
to create novel hybrid models that combine the desirable features of
count-based and neural LMs, and experiments demonstrate the advantages of these
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Relative correctness is the property of a program to be more-correct than
another with respect to a given specification. Whereas the traditional
definition of (absolute) correctness divides candidate program into two classes
(correct, and incorrect), relative correctness arranges candidate programs on
the richer structure of a partial ordering. In other venues we discuss the
impact of relative correctness on program derivation, and on program
verification. In this paper, we discuss the impact of relative correctness on
program testing; specifically, we argue that when we remove a fault from a
program, we ought to test the new program for relative correctness over the old
program, rather than for absolute correctness. We present analytical arguments
to support our position, as well as an empirical argument in the form of a
small program whose faults are removed in a stepwise manner as its relative
correctness rises with each fault removal until we obtain a correct program.

 <dc:description>  We present an empirical study in which model-based testing (MBT) was applied
to a mobile system: the Android client of QuizUp, the largest mobile trivia
game in the world. The study shows that traditional MBT approaches based on
extended finite-state machines can be used to test a mobile app in an effective
and efficient way. Non-trivial defects were detected on a deployed system that
has millions of users and was already well tested. The duration of the overall
testing effort was of three months, including the construction of the models.
Maintaining a single behavioral model for the app was key in order to test it
in an efficient way.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we address the issue of change after deployment in
safety-critical embedded system applications. Our goal is to substitute
lab-based verification with in-field formal analysis to determine whether an
update may be safely applied. This is challenging because it requires an
automated process able to handle multiple viewpoints such as functional
correctness, timing, etc. For this purpose, we propose an original methodology
for contract-based negotiation of software updates. The use of contracts allows
us to cleanly split the verification effort between the lab and the field. In
addition, we show how to rely on existing viewpoint-specific methods for update
negotiation. We illustrate our approach on a concrete example inspired by the
automotive domain.

 <dc:description>  Pre-deployment verification of software components with respect to behavioral
specifications in the assume-guarantee form does not, in general, guarantee
absence of errors at run time. This is because assumptions about the
environment cannot be discharged until the environment is fixed. An intuitive
approach is to complement pre-deployment verification of guarantees, up to the
assumptions, with post-deployment monitoring of environment behavior to check
that the assumptions are satisfied at run time. Such a monitor is typically
implemented by instrumenting the application code of the component. An
additional challenge for the monitoring step is that environment behaviors are
typically obtained through an I/O library, which may alter the component's view
of the input format. This transformation requires us to introduce a second
pre-deployment verification step to ensure that alarms raised by the monitor
would indeed correspond to violations of the environment assumptions. In this
paper, we describe an approach for constructing monitors and verifying them
against the component assumption. We also discuss limitations of
instrumentation-based monitoring and potential ways to overcome it.

 <dc:title>Preliminary Results Towards Contract Monitorability</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper discusses preliminary investigations on the monitorability of
contracts for web service descriptions. There are settings where servers do not
guarantee statically whether they satisfy some specified contract, which forces
the client (i.e., the entity interacting with the server) to perform dynamic
checks. This scenario may be viewed as an instance of Runtime Verification,
where a pertinent question is whether contracts can be monitored for adequately
at runtime, otherwise stated as the monitorability of contracts. We consider a
simple language of finitary contracts describing both clients and servers, and
develop a formal framework that describes server contract monitoring. We define
monitor properties that potentially contribute towards a comprehensive notion
of contract monitorability and show that our simple contract language satisfies
these properties.

 <dc:description>  Training deep neural network is a high dimensional and a highly non-convex
optimization problem. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and it's
variations are the current state-of-the-art solvers for this task. However, due
to non-covexity nature of the problem, it was observed that SGD slows down near
saddle point. Recent empirical work claim that by detecting and escaping saddle
point efficiently, it's more likely to improve training performance. With this
objective, we revisit Hessian-free optimization method for deep networks. We
also develop its distributed variant and demonstrate superior scaling potential
to SGD, which allows more efficiently utilizing larger computing resources thus
enabling large models and faster time to obtain desired solution. Furthermore,
unlike truncated Newton method (Marten's HF) that ignores negative curvature
information by using na\&quot;ive conjugate gradient method and Gauss-Newton Hessian
approximation information - we propose a novel algorithm to explore negative
curvature direction by solving the sub-problem with stabilized bi-conjugate
method involving possible indefinite stochastic Hessian information. We show
that these techniques accelerate the training process for both the standard
MNIST dataset and also the TIMIT speech recognition problem, demonstrating
robust performance with upto an order of magnitude larger batch sizes. This
increased scaling potential is illustrated with near linear speed-up on upto 16
CPU nodes for a simple 4-layer network.

 <dc:description>  Today's exponentially increasing data volumes and the high cost of storage
make compression essential for the Big Data industry. Although research has
concentrated on efficient compression, fast decompression is critical for
analytics queries that repeatedly read compressed data. While decompression can
be parallelized somewhat by assigning each data block to a different process,
break-through speed-ups require exploiting the massive parallelism of modern
multi-core processors and GPUs for data decompression within a block. We
propose two new techniques to increase the degree of parallelism during
decompression. The first technique exploits the massive parallelism of GPU and
SIMD architectures. The second sacrifices some compression efficiency to
eliminate data dependencies that limit parallelism during decompression. We
evaluate these techniques on the decompressor of the DEFLATE scheme, called
Inflate, which is based on LZ77 compression and Huffman encoding. We achieve a
2X speed-up in a head-to-head comparison with several multi-core CPU-based
libraries, while achieving a 17% energy saving with comparable compression
ratios.

 <dc:description>  The constant demand for new features and bug fixes are forcing software
projects to shorten cycles and deliver updates ever faster, while sustaining
software quality. The availability of inexpensive, virtualized, cloud-computing
has helped shorten schedules, by enabling continuous integration (CI) on
demand. Platforms like GitHub support CI in-the-cloud. In projects using CI, a
user submitting a pull request triggers a CI step. Besides speeding up build
and test, this fortuitously creates voluminous archives of build and test
successes and failures. CI is a relatively new phenomenon, and these archives
allow a detailed study of CI. How many problems are exposed? Where do they
occur? What factors affect CI failures? Does the &quot;initial quality&quot; as
ascertained by CI predict how many bugs will later appear (&quot;eventual quality&quot;)
in the code? In this paper, we undertake a large-scale, fine resolution study
of these records, to better understand CI processes, the nature, and predictors
of CI failures, and the relationship of CI failures to the eventual quality of
the code. We find that: a) CI failures appear to be concentrated in a few
files, just like normal bugs; b) CI failures are not very highly correlated
with eventual failures; c) The use of CI in a pull request doesn't necessarily
mean the code in that request is of good quality.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we tackle the compressive phase retrieval problem in the
presence of noise. The noisy compressive phase retrieval problem is to recover
a $K$-sparse complex signal $s \in \mathbb{C}^n$, from a set of $m$ noisy
quadratic measurements: $ y_i=| a_i^H s |^2+w_i$, where $a_i^H\in\mathbb{C}^n$
is the $i$th row of the measurement matrix $A\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times n}$, and
$w_i$ is the additive noise to the $i$th measurement. We consider the regime
where $K=\beta n^\delta$, with constants $\beta&gt;0$ and $\delta\in(0,1)$. We use
the architecture of PhaseCode algorithm, and robustify it using two schemes:
the almost-linear scheme and the sublinear scheme. We prove that with high
probability, the almost-linear scheme recovers $s$ with sample complexity
$\Theta(K \log(n))$ and computational complexity $\Theta(n \log(n))$, and the
sublinear scheme recovers $s$ with sample complexity $\Theta(K\log^3(n))$ and
computational complexity $\Theta(K\log^3(n))$. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first scheme that achieves sublinear computational complexity for
compressive phase retrieval problem. Finally, we provide simulation results
that support our theoretical contributions.

 <dc:description>  Device-to-Device (D2D) communication appears as a key communication paradigm
to realizing the vision of Internet of Things (IoT) into reality by supporting
heterogeneous objects interconnection in a large scale network. These devices
may be many types of objects with embedded intelligence and communication
capabilities, e.g., smart phones, cars, or home appliances. The issue in in
this type of communication is the interference to cellular communication caused
by D2D communication. Thus, proper power control and resource allocation should
be coordinated in D2D network to prevent excessive interference and drastic
decrease in the throughput of the cellular system. In this paper, we consider
the problem of cross-layer resource allocation in time-varying cellular
wireless networks with D2D communication and incorporate average interference
to cellular system as a quality-of-service constraint. Specifically, each D2D
pair in the network injects packets to its queue, at rates chosen in order to
maximize a global utility function, subject to network stability and
interference constraints. The interference constraint enforces an arbitrarily
low interference to the cellular system caused by D2D communication. We first
obtain the stability region for the multiuser systems assuming that the nodes
have full channel state information (CSI) of their neighbors. Then, we provide
a joint flow control and scheduling scheme, which is proven to achieve a
utility arbitrarily close to the maximum achievable utility. Finally, we
address the consequences of practical implementation issue such as distributed
scheduling by a designing algorithm, which is capable of taking advantage of
diversity gain introduced by fading channels. We demonstrate the efficacy of
our policies by numerical studies under various network conditions.

 <dc:description>  The ability to grasp ordinary and potentially never-seen objects is an
important feature in both domestic and industrial robotics. For a system to
accomplish this, it must autonomously identify grasping locations by using
information from various sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect 3D camera. Despite
numerous progress, significant work still remains to be done in this field. To
this effect, we propose a dictionary learning and sparse representation (DLSR)
framework for representing RGBD images from 3D sensors in the context of
determining such good grasping locations. In contrast to previously proposed
approaches that relied on sophisticated regularization or very large datasets,
the derived perception system has a fast training phase and can work with small
datasets. It is also theoretically founded for dealing with masked-out entries,
which are common with 3D sensors. We contribute by presenting a comparative
study of several DLSR approach combinations for recognizing and detecting grasp
candidates on the standard Cornell dataset. Importantly, experimental results
show a performance improvement of 1.69% in detection and 3.16% in recognition
over current state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). Even though
nowadays most popular vision-based approach is CNN, this suggests that DLSR is
also a viable alternative with interesting advantages that CNN has not.

 <dc:description>  Pretraining is widely used in deep neutral network and one of the most famous
pretraining models is Deep Belief Network (DBN). The optimization formulas are
different during the pretraining process for different pretraining models. In
this paper, we pretrained deep neutral network by different pretraining models
and hence investigated the difference between DBN and Stacked Denoising
Autoencoder (SDA) when used as pretraining model. The experimental results show
that DBN get a better initial model. However the model converges to a
relatively worse model after the finetuning process. Yet after pretrained by
SDA for the second time the model converges to a better model if finetuned.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate GPU based parallel triangular solvers
systematically. The parallel triangular solvers are fundamental to incomplete
LU factorization family preconditioners and algebraic multigrid solvers. We
develop a new matrix format suitable for GPU devices. Parallel lower triangular
solvers and upper triangular solvers are developed for this new data structure.
With these solvers, ILU preconditioners and domain decomposition
preconditioners are developed. Numerical results show that we can speed
triangular solvers around seven times faster.

 <dc:description>  This research introduce our work on developing Krylov subspace and AMG
solvers on NVIDIA GPUs. As SpMV is a crucial part for these iterative methods,
SpMV algorithms for single GPU and multiple GPUs are implemented. A HEC matrix
format and a communication mechanism are established. And also, a set of
specific algorithms for solving preconditioned systems in parallel environments
are designed, including ILU(k), RAS and parallel triangular solvers. Based on
these work, several Krylov solvers and AMG solvers are developed. According to
numerical experiments, favorable acceleration performance is acquired from our
Krylov solver and AMG solver under various parameter conditions.

 <dc:description>  A parallel reservoir simulator has been developed, which is designed for
large-scale black oil simulations. It handles three phases, including water,
oil and gas, and three components, including water, oil and gas. This simulator
can calculate traditional reservoir models and naturally fractured models.
Various well operations are supported, such as water flooding, gas flooding and
polymer flooding. The operation constraints can be fixed bottom-hole pressure,
a fixed fluid rate, and combinations of them. The simulator is based on our
in-house platform, which provides grids, cell-centred data, linear solvers,
preconditioners and well modeling. The simulator and the platform use MPI for
communications among computation nodes. Our simulator is capable of simulating
giant reservoir models with hundreds of millions of grid cells. Numerical
simulations show that our simulator matches with commercial simulators and it
has excellent scalability.

 <dc:description>  Object-oriented Application Programing Interfaces (APIs) support software
reuse by providing pre-implemented functionalities. Due to the huge number of
included classes, reusing and understanding large APIs is a complex task.
Otherwise, software components are admitted to be more reusable and
understandable entities than object-oriented ones. Thus, in this paper, we
propose an approach for reengineering object-oriented APIs into component-based
ones. We mine components as a group of classes based on the frequency they are
used together and their ability to form a quality-centric component. To
validate our approach, we experimented on 100 Java applications that used
Android APIs.

 <dc:description>  Parallelization framework has become a necessity to speed up the training of
deep neural networks (DNN) recently. Such framework typically employs the Model
Average approach, denoted as MA-DNN, in which parallel workers conduct
respective training based on their own local data while the parameters of local
models are periodically communicated and averaged to obtain a global model
which serves as the new start of local models. However, since DNN is a highly
non-convex model, averaging parameters cannot ensure that such global model can
perform better than those local models. To tackle this problem, we introduce a
new parallel training framework called Ensemble-Compression, denoted as EC-DNN.
In this framework, we propose to aggregate the local models by ensemble, i.e.,
averaging the outputs of local models instead of the parameters. As most of
prevalent loss functions are convex to the output of DNN, the performance of
ensemble-based global model is guaranteed to be at least as good as the average
performance of local models. However, a big challenge lies in the explosion of
model size since each round of ensemble can give rise to multiple times size
increment. Thus, we carry out model compression after each ensemble,
specialized by a distillation based method in this paper, to reduce the size of
the global model to be the same as the local ones. Our experimental results
demonstrate the prominent advantage of EC-DNN over MA-DNN in terms of both
accuracy and speedup.

 <dc:description>  A popular approach to topic modeling involves extracting co-occurring n-grams
of a corpus into semantic themes. The set of n-grams in a theme represents an
underlying topic, but most topic modeling approaches are not able to label
these sets of words with a single n-gram. Such labels are useful for topic
identification in summarization systems. This paper introduces a novel approach
to labeling a group of n-grams comprising an individual topic. The approach
taken is to complement the existing topic distributions over words with a known
distribution based on a predefined set of topics. This is done by integrating
existing labeled knowledge sources representing known potential topics into the
probabilistic topic model. These knowledge sources are translated into a
distribution and used to set the hyperparameters of the Dirichlet generated
distribution over words. In the inference these modified distributions guide
the convergence of the latent topics to conform with the complementary
distributions. This approach ensures that the topic inference process is
consistent with existing knowledge. The label assignment from the complementary
knowledge sources are then transferred to the latent topics of the corpus. The
results show both accurate label assignment to topics as well as improved topic
generation than those obtained using various labeling approaches based off
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

 <dc:description>  An online truthful budgeted matching problem is considered for a bipartite
graph, where the right vertices are available ahead of time, and individual
left vertices arrive sequentially. On arrival of a left vertex, its edge
utilities (or weights) to all the right vertices and a corresponding cost (or
bid) are revealed. If a left vertex is matched to any of the right vertices,
then it has to be paid at least as much as its cost. The problem is to match
each left vertex instantaneously and irrevocably to any one of the right
vertices, if at all, to find the maximum weight matching that is truthful,
under a payment budget constraint. Truthfulness condition requires that no left
vertex has any incentive of misreporting its cost. Assuming that the vertices
arrive in an uniformly random order (secretary model) with arbitrary utilities,
a truthful algorithm is proposed that is $24\beta$-competitive (where $\beta$
is the ratio of the maximum and the minimum utility) and satisfies the payment
budget constraint. Direct applications of this problem include crowdsourcing
auctions, and matching wireless users to cooperative relays in device-to-device
enabled cellular network.

 <dc:description>  Code generation is regarded as an essential part of model-driven development
(MDD) to systematically transform the abstract models to concrete code. One
current challenges of templatebased code generation is that output-specific
information, i.e., information about the generated source code, is not
explicitly modeled and, thus, not accessible during code generation. Existing
approaches try to either parse the generated output or store it in a data
structure before writing into a file. In this paper, we propose a first
approach to explicitly model parts of the generated output. These modeled parts
are stored in a symbol for efficient management. During code generation this
information can be accessed to ensure that the composition of the overall
generated source code is valid. We achieve this goal by creating a domain model
of relevant generator output information, extending the symbol table to store
this information, and adapt the overall code generation process.

even for low-resource languages. We further present a new automatic correction

 <dc:title>Randomized Polynomial Time Identity Testing for Noncommutative Circuits</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Arvind, V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mukhopadhyay, Partha</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Raja, S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we show that the black-box polynomial identity testing for
noncommutative polynomials $f\in\mathbb{F}\langle z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_n \rangle$
of degree $D$ and sparsity $t$, can be done in randomized $\poly(n,\log t,\log
D)$ time. As a consequence, if the black-box contains a circuit $C$ of size $s$
computing $f\in\mathbb{F}\langle z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_n \rangle$ which has at most
$t$ non-zero monomials, then the identity testing can be done by a randomized
algorithm with running time polynomial in $s$ and $n$ and $\log t$. This makes
significant progress on a question that has been open for over ten years.
  The earlier result by Bogdanov and Wee [BW05], using the classical
Amitsur-Levitski theorem, gives a randomized polynomial-time algorithm only for
circuits of polynomially bounded syntactic degree. In our result, we place no
restriction on the degree of the circuit.
  Our algorithm is based on automata-theoretic ideas introduced in
[AMS08,AM08]. In those papers, the main idea was to construct deterministic
finite automata that isolate a single monomial from the set of nonzero
monomials of a polynomial $f$ in $\mathbb{F}\langle z_1,z_2,\cdots,z_n
\rangle$. In the present paper, since we need to deal with exponential degree
monomials, we carry out a different kind of monomial isolation using
nondeterministic automata.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: As the number of monomials in a noncommutative polynomial which has
  anarithmetic circuit of size $s$ can actually be doubly exponential in $s$,
  our result does not imply a randomized polynomial-time identity test for all
  size s noncommutative circuits. The algorithm works only for noncommutative
  size s circuits which computes a polynomial with exp(s) many monomials</dc:description>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the probably first application of the popular
\emph{Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP)} approach to the domain of
soccer-playing humanoid robots. DMPs are known for their ability to imitate
previously demonstrated motions as well as to flexibly adapt to unforeseen
changes to the desired trajectory with respect to speed and direction. As
demonstrated in this paper, this makes them a useful approach for describing
kick motions. Furthermore, we present a mathematical motor model that
compensates for the NAO robot's motor control delay as well as a novel minor
extension to the DMP formulation. The motor model is used in the calculation of
the Zero Moment Point (ZMP), which is needed to keep the robot in balance while
kicking. All approaches have been evaluated on real NAO robots.

 <dc:title>On the performance of different mutation operators of a
  subpopulation-based genetic algorithm for multi-robot task allocation
  problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The performance of different mutation operators is usually evaluated in
conjunc-tion with specific parameter settings of genetic algorithms and target
problems. Most studies focus on the classical genetic algorithm with different
parameters or on solving unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems such
as the traveling salesman problems. In this paper, a subpopulation-based
genetic al-gorithm that uses only mutation and selection is developed to solve
multi-robot task allocation problems. The target problems are constrained
combinatorial optimization problems, and are more complex if cooperative tasks
are involved as these introduce additional spatial and temporal constraints.
The proposed genetic algorithm can obtain better solutions than classical
genetic algorithms with tournament selection and partially mapped crossover.
The performance of different mutation operators in solving problems
without/with cooperative tasks is evaluated. The results imply that inversion
mutation performs better than others when solving problems without cooperative
tasks, and the swap-inversion combination performs better than others when
solving problems with cooperative tasks.

 <dc:title>Variance-Reduced Proximal Stochastic Gradient Descent for Non-convex

 <dc:description>  Here we study non-convex composite optimization: first, a finite-sum of
smooth but non-convex functions, and second, a general function that admits a
simple proximal mapping. Most research on stochastic methods for composite
optimization assumes convexity or strong convexity of each function. In this
paper, we extend this problem into the non-convex setting using variance
reduction techniques, such as prox-SVRG and prox-SAGA. We prove that, with a
constant step size, both prox-SVRG and prox-SAGA are suitable for non-convex
composite optimization, and help the problem converge to a stationary point
within $O(1/\epsilon)$ iterations. That is similar to the convergence rate seen
with the state-of-the-art RSAG method and faster than stochastic gradient
descent. Our analysis is also extended into the min-batch setting, which
linearly accelerates the convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first analysis of convergence rate of variance-reduced proximal stochastic
gradient for non-convex composite optimization.

 <dc:description>  In visual recognition tasks, such as image classification, unsupervised
learning exploits cheap unlabeled data and can help to solve these tasks more
efficiently. We show that the recursive autoconvolution operator, adopted from
physics, boosts existing unsupervised methods by learning more discriminative
filters. We take well established convolutional neural networks and train their
filters layer-wise. In addition, based on previous works we design a network
which extracts more than 600k features per sample, but with the total number of
trainable parameters greatly reduced by introducing shared filters in higher
layers. We evaluate our networks on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10
image classification benchmarks and report several state of the art results
among other unsupervised methods.

 <dc:description>  Low-dimensional word vectors have long been used in a wide range of
applications in natural language processing. In this paper we shed light on
estimating query vectors in ad-hoc retrieval where a limited information is
available in the original query. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a
well-known technique for updating query language models and expanding the
queries with a number of relevant terms. We formulate the query updating in
low-dimensional spaces first with rotating the query vector and then with
scaling. These consequential steps are embedded in a query-specific projection
matrix capturing both angle and scaling. In this paper we propose a new but not
the most effective technique necessarily for PRF in language modeling, based on
the query projection algorithm. We learn an embedded coefficient matrix for
each query, whose aim is to improve the vector representation of the query by
transforming it to a more reliable space, and then update the query language
model. The proposed embedded coefficient divergence minimization model (ECDMM)
takes top-ranked documents retrieved by the query and obtains a couple of
positive and negative sample sets; these samples are used for learning the
coefficient matrix which will be used for projecting the query vector and
updating the query language model using a softmax function. Experimental
results on several TREC and CLEF data sets in several languages demonstrate
effectiveness of ECDMM. The experimental results reveal that the new
formulation for the query works as well as state-of-the-art PRF techniques and
outperforms state-of-the-art PRF techniques in a TREC collection in terms of
MAP,P@5, and P@10 significantly.

 <dc:description>  We consider spectrally-precoded OFDM waveforms for 5G wideband transmission
in sub-6GHz band. In this densely packed spectrum, a low out-of-band (OOB)
waveform is a critical 5G component to achieve the promised high spectral
efficiency. By precoding data symbols before OFDM modulation, it is possible to
achieve extremely low out-of-band emission with very sharp spectrum transition
enabling an efficient and flexible usage of frequency resources.
Spectrally-precoded OFDM shows promising results for reaching 5G targets in
high-data rate enhanced mobile broadband and ultra-reliable low-latency
communications use cases. Spectral precoding is particularly efficient for
wideband transmission enabling short-time transmission, which will often
require flexible fragmented spectrum usage.

 <dc:description>  Visual storytelling aims to generate human-level narrative language (i.e., a
natural paragraph with multiple sentences) from a photo streams. A typical
photo story consists of a global timeline with multi-thread local storylines,
where each storyline occurs in one different scene. Such complex structure
leads to large content gaps at scene transitions between consecutive photos.
Most existing image/video captioning methods can only achieve limited
performance, because the units in traditional recurrent neural networks (RNN)
tend to &quot;forget&quot; the previous state when the visual sequence is inconsistent.
In this paper, we propose a novel visual storytelling approach with
Bidirectional Multi-thread Recurrent Neural Network (BMRNN). First, based on
the mined local storylines, a skip gated recurrent unit (sGRU) with delay
control is proposed to maintain longer range visual information. Second, by
using sGRU as basic units, the BMRNN is trained to align the local storylines
into the global sequential timeline. Third, a new training scheme with a
storyline-constrained objective function is proposed by jointly considering
both global and local matches. Experiments on three standard storytelling
datasets show that the BMRNN model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Detection of non-technical losses (NTL) which include electricity theft,
faulty meters or billing errors has attracted increasing attention from
researchers in electrical engineering and computer science. NTLs cause
significant harm to the economy, as in some countries they may range up to 40%
of the total electricity distributed. The predominant research direction is
employing artificial intelligence to predict whether a customer causes NTL.
This paper first provides an overview of how NTLs are defined and their impact
on economies, which include loss of revenue and profit of electricity providers
and decrease of the stability and reliability of electrical power grids. It
then surveys the state-of-the-art research efforts in a up-to-date and
comprehensive review of algorithms, features and data sets used. It finally
identifies the key scientific and engineering challenges in NTL detection and
suggests how they could be addressed in the future.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a new approach to code-based signatures that makes
use in particular of rank metric codes. When the classical approach consists in
finding the unique preimage of a syndrome through a decoding algorithm, we
propose to introduce the notion of mixed decoding of erasures and errors for
building signature schemes. In that case the difficult problem becomes, as is
the case in lattice-based cryptography, finding a preimage of weight above the
Gilbert-Varshamov bound (case where many solutions occur) rather than finding a
unique preimage of weight below the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. The paper
describes RankSign: a new signature algorithm for the rank metric based on a
new mixed algorithm for decoding erasures and errors for the recently
introduced Low Rank Parity Check (LRPC) codes. We explain how it is possible
(depending on choices of parameters) to obtain a full decoding algorithm which
is able to find a preimage of reasonable rank weight for any random syndrome
with a very strong probability. We study the semantic security of our signature
algorithm and show how it is possible to reduce the unforgeability to direct
attacks on the public matrix, so that no information leaks through signatures.
Finally, we give several examples of parameters for our scheme, some of which
with public key of size $11,520$ bits and signature of size $1728$ bits.
Moreover the scheme can be very fast for small base fields.

 <dc:description>  In deadline-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs), quality of
aggregation (QoA) is determined by the number of participating nodes in the
data aggregation process. The previous studies have attempted to propose
optimal scheduling algorithms to obtain the maximum QoA assuming a fixed
underlying aggregation tree. However, there exists no prior work to address the
issue of constructing optimal aggregation tree in deadline-constraints WSNs.
The structure of underlying aggregation tree is important since our analysis
demonstrates that the ratio between the maximum achievable QoAs of different
trees could be as large as O(2^D), where D is the deadline. This paper casts a
combinatorial optimization problem to address optimal tree construction for
deadline-constrained data aggregation in WSNs. While the problem is proved to
be NP-hard, we employ the recently proposed Markov approximation framework and
devise two distributed algorithms with different computation overheads to find
close-to-optimal solutions with bounded approximation gap. To further improve
the convergence of the proposed Markov-based algorithms, we devise another
initial tree construction algorithm with low computational complexity. Our
extensive experiments for a set randomly-generated scenarios demonstrate that
the proposed algorithms outperforms the existing alternative methods by
obtaining better quality of aggregations.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general paradigm for studying intelligent
behaviour, with applications ranging from artificial intelligence to psychology
and economics. AIXI is a universal solution to the RL problem; it can learn any
computable environment. A technical subtlety of AIXI is that it is defined
using a mixture over semimeasures that need not sum to 1, rather than over
proper probability measures. In this work we argue that the shortfall of a
semimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent's estimate of the
probability of its death. We formally define death for generally intelligent
agents like AIXI, and prove a number of related theorems about their behaviour.
Notable discoveries include that agent behaviour can change radically under
positive linear transformations of the reward signal (from suicidal to
dogmatically self-preserving), and that the agent's posterior belief that it
will survive increases over time.

 <dc:description>  The Schatten quasi-norm can be used to bridge the gap between the nuclear
norm and rank function, and is the tighter approximation to matrix rank.
However, most existing Schatten quasi-norm minimization (SQNM) algorithms, as
well as for nuclear norm minimization, are too slow or even impractical for
large-scale problems, due to the SVD or EVD of the whole matrix in each
iteration. In this paper, we rigorously prove that for any p, p1, p2&gt;0
satisfying 1/p=1/p1+1/p2, the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix is equivalent
to minimizing the product of the Schatten-p1 norm (or quasi-norm) and
Schatten-p2 norm (or quasi-norm) of its two factor matrices. Then we present
and prove the equivalence relationship between the product formula of the
Schatten quasi-norm and its weighted sum formula for the two cases of p1 and
p2: p1=p2 and p1\neq p2. In particular, when p&gt;1/2, there is an equivalence
between the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix and the Schatten-2p norms of
its two factor matrices, where the widely used equivalent formulation of the
nuclear norm can be viewed as a special case. That is, various SQNM problems
with p&gt;1/2 can be transformed into the one only involving smooth, convex norms
of two factor matrices, which can lead to simpler and more efficient algorithms
than conventional methods.
  We further extend the theoretical results of two factor matrices to the cases
of three and more factor matrices, from which we can see that for any 0&lt;p&lt;1,
the Schatten-p quasi-norm of any matrix is the minimization of the mean of the
Schatten-(p3+1)p norms of all factor matrices, where p3 denotes the largest
integer not exceeding 1/p. In other words, for any 0&lt;p&lt;1, the SQNM problem can
be transformed into an optimization problem only involving the smooth, convex
norms of multiple factor matrices.

 <dc:description>  Self-composition provides a powerful theoretical approach to prove relational
properties, i.e. properties relating several program executions, that has been
applied to compare two runs of one or similar programs (in secure dataflow
properties, code transformations, etc.). This tool demo paper presents RPP, an
original implementation of self-composition for specification and verification
of relational properties in C programs in the FRAMA-C platform. We consider a
very general notion of relational properties invoking any finite number of
function calls of possibly dissimilar functions with possible nested calls. The
new tool allows the user to specify a relational property, to prove it in a
completely automatic way using classic deductive verification, and to use it as
a hypothesis in the proof of other properties that may rely on it.

 <dc:title>Constrained Phase Noise Estimation in OFDM Using Scattered Pilots

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider an OFDM radio link corrupted by oscillator phase
noise in the receiver, namely the problem of estimating and compensating for
the impairment. To lessen the computational burden and delay incurred onto the
receiver, we estimate phase noise using only scattered pilot subcarriers, i.e.,
no tentative symbol decisions are used in obtaining and improving the phase
noise estimate. In particular, the phase noise estimation problem is posed as
an unconstrained optimization problem whose minimizer suffers from the
so-called amplitude and phase estimation error. These errors arise due to
receiver noise, estimation from limited scattered pilot subcarriers and
estimation using a dimensionality reduction model. It is empirically shown
that, at high signal-to-noise-ratios, the phase estimation error is small. To
reduce the amplitude estimation error, we restrict the minimizer to be drawn
from the so-called phase noise geometry set when minimizing the cost function.
The resulting optimization problem is a non-convex program. However, using the
S-procedure for quadratic equalities, we show that the optimal solution can be
obtained by solving the convex dual problem. We also consider a less complex
heuristic scheme that achieves the same objective of restricting the minimizer
to the phase noise geometry set. Through simulations, we demonstrate improved
coded bit-error-rate and phase noise estimation error performance when
enforcing the phase noise geometry. For example, at high
signal-to-noise-ratios, the probability density function of the phase noise
estimation error exhibits thinner tails which results in lower bit-error-rate.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the adversarially learned inference (ALI) model, which jointly
learns a generation network and an inference network using an adversarial
process. The generation network maps samples from stochastic latent variables
to the data space while the inference network maps training examples in data
space to the space of latent variables. An adversarial game is cast between
these two networks and a discriminative network is trained to distinguish
between joint latent/data-space samples from the generative network and joint
samples from the inference network. We illustrate the ability of the model to
learn mutually coherent inference and generation networks through the
inspections of model samples and reconstructions and confirm the usefulness of
the learned representations by obtaining a performance competitive with
state-of-the-art on the semi-supervised SVHN and CIFAR10 tasks.

 <dc:description>  Generative neural samplers are probabilistic models that implement sampling
using feedforward neural networks: they take a random input vector and produce
a sample from a probability distribution defined by the network weights. These
models are expressive and allow efficient computation of samples and
derivatives, but cannot be used for computing likelihoods or for
marginalization. The generative-adversarial training method allows to train
such models through the use of an auxiliary discriminative neural network. We
show that the generative-adversarial approach is a special case of an existing
more general variational divergence estimation approach. We show that any
f-divergence can be used for training generative neural samplers. We discuss
the benefits of various choices of divergence functions on training complexity
and the quality of the obtained generative models.

 <dc:description>  The weight of links in a network is often related to the similarity of the
nodes. Here, we introduce a simple tunable measure for analysing the similarity
of nodes across different link weights. In particular, we use the measure to
analyze homophily in a group of 659 freshman students at a large university.
Our analysis is based on data obtained using smartphones equipped with custom
data collection software, complemented by questionnaire-based data. The network
of social contacts is represented as a weighted multilayer network constructed
from different channels of telecommunication as well as data on face-to-face
contacts. We find that even strongly connected individuals are not more similar
with respect to basic personality traits than randomly chosen pairs of
individuals. In contrast, several socio-demographics variables have a
significant degree of similarity. We further observe that similarity might be
present in one layer of the multilayer network and simultaneously be absent in
the other layers. For a variable such as gender, our measure reveals a
transition from similarity between nodes connected with links of relatively low
weight to dis-similarity for the nodes connected by the strongest links. We
finally analyze the overlap between layers in the network for different levels
of acquaintanceships.

 <dc:description>  To maintain fairness, in the terms of resources shared by an individual peer,
a proper incentive policy is required in a peer to peer network. This letter
proposes, a simpler mechanism to rank the peers based on their resource
contributions to the network. This mechanism will suppress the free riders from
downloading the resources from the network. Contributions of the peers are
biased in such a way that it can balance the download and upload amount of
resources at each peer. This mechanism can be implemented in a distributed
system and it converges much faster than the other existing approaches.

 <dc:description>  A major challenge for machine learning is increasing the availability of data
while respecting the privacy of individuals. Here we combine the provable
privacy guarantees of the Differential Privacy framework with the flexibility
of Gaussian processes (GPs). We propose a method using GPs to provide
Differentially Private (DP) regression. We then improve this method by crafting
the DP noise covariance structure to efficiently protect the training data,
while minimising the scale of the added noise. We find that, for the dataset
used, this cloaking method achieves the greatest accuracy, while still
providing privacy guarantees, and offers practical DP for regression over
multi-dimensional inputs. Together these methods provide a starter toolkit for
combining differential privacy and GPs.

 <dc:title>On Solving Floating Point SSSP Using an Integer Priority Queue</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Otte, Michael</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We address the single source shortest path planning problem (SSSP) in the
case of floating point edge weights. We show how any integer based Dijkstra
solution that relies on a monotone integer priority queue to create a full
ordering over path lengths in order to solve integer SSSP can be used as an
oracle to solve floating point SSSP with positive edge weights (floating point
P-SSSP). Floating point P-SSSP is of particular interest to the robotics
community. This immediately yields a handful of faster runtimes for floating
point P-SSSP; for example, ${O({m + n\log \log \frac{C}{\delta}})}$, where $C$
is the largest weight and $\delta$ is the minimum edge weight in the graph. It
also ensures that many future advances for integer SSSP will be transferable to
floating point P-SSSP.

 <dc:description>  Degree sequence (DS) problems are around for at least hundred twenty years,
and with the advent of network science, more and more complicated, structured
DS problems were invented. Interestingly enough all those problems so far are
computationally easy. It is clear, however, that we will find soon
computationally hard DS problems. In this paper we want to find such hard DS
problems with relatively simple definition.
  For a vertex $v$ in the simple graph $G$ denote $d_i(v)$ the number of
vertices at distance exactly $i$ from $v$. Then $d_1(v)$ is the usual degree of
vertex $v.$ The vector $\mathbf{d}^2(G)=( (d_1(v_1), d_2(v_1)), \ldots,$
$(d_1(v_n), d_2(v_n))$ is the {\bf second order degree sequence} of the graph
$G$. In this note we show that the problem to decide whether a sequence of
natural numbers $((i_1,j_1),\ldots (i_n,j_n))$ is a second order degree
sequence of a simple undirected graph $G$ is strongly NP-complete. Then we will
discuss some further NP-complete DS problems.

the symmetric capacity of memoryless channels. Many decoding algorithms were
developed and implemented, addressing various application requirements: from
error-correction performance rivaling that of LDPC codes to very high
throughput or low-complexity decoders. In this work, we review the state of the

 <dc:description>  Stochastic structured prediction under bandit feedback follows a learning
protocol where on each of a sequence of iterations, the learner receives an
input, predicts an output structure, and receives partial feedback in form of a
task loss evaluation of the predicted structure. We present applications of
this learning scenario to convex and non-convex objectives for structured
prediction and analyze them as stochastic first-order methods. We present an
experimental evaluation on problems of natural language processing over
exponential output spaces, and compare convergence speed across different
objectives under the practical criterion of optimal task performance on
development data and the optimization-theoretic criterion of minimal squared
gradient norm. Best results under both criteria are obtained for a non-convex
objective for pairwise preference learning under bandit feedback.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a comprehensive study of the influence of environmental
uncertainty on business-IT alignment. The existing literature postulates
environmental uncertainty as a key challenge to achieving business-IT
alignment. Hence, the first objective of this study is to identify the extent
of the impact of environmental uncertainty on business-IT alignment, and to
determine its relative impact in the light of the other antecedents.
Furthermore, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) differ fundamentally
from large firms in many ways. Thus this paper also aims to investigate the
variation between SMEs and large firms with regard to the antecedents for
strategic alignment. Based on data collected from 212 firms, a conceptual model
is tested against the research objectives. The findings provide important
contributions to both research and practice by demonstrating the relative
impact of environmental uncertainty, and showing how the antecedents of
alignment vary between SMEs and large firms.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing is proved to be an effective computing technology for
organisations through the advantages that it offers such as cost-effectiveness,
IT technical agility and scalability, enhancing businesses processes, and
increasing enterprises competitiveness. In Australia, there is an emerging
trend that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) begin to adopt this
technology in the conventional working practices. However, there is a dearth of
prior studies on examining the factors that influence the cloud computing
adoption among Australian SMEs. To fill the empirical vacuum, this
research-in-progress proposes an integrated framework for examining the
determinants of cloud computing service adoption with the consideration of the
unique characteristics of Australian SMEs, such as relatively low adoption of
cloud computing services, less innovative, and limited knowledge about cloud
computing and its benefits and hindrances. To this end, we are conducting
consecutive studies to investigate this research issue. An exploratory
interview study will be undertaken to identify and verify the unique
characteristics of Australian SMEs toward the cloud computing adoption. This is
followed by an organisational level survey that examines the effects of those
determinants on cloud computing adoption. Finally, a decision model for cloud
computing adoption among Australian SMEs will be developed by using a Multi
Criteria Decision Approach (MCDA) through rating, prioritising, and ranking of
various criteria and alternatives available to the decision makers. Adopting
the mixed-method research fashion, this research-in-progress intends to make
significant implications to scholars and practitioners alike in the cloud
computing research and applications areas.

 <dc:description>  Advancements in web technology have revolutionised the way citizens interact
with governments. Unlike traditional methods of communication between citizens
and governments, E-Participation via e-government websites enhances
communication and enables citizens to become actively involved in the
policy-making process. Despite the growing importance of e-participation, the
potential factors influencing citizens engagement in e-participation have not
been the subject of investigation. Using responses obtained from Saudi
citizens, this study examines a number of factors that may influence the
intentions of citizens to engage in e-participation activities on e-government
websites. The results suggest that the factors of trust and subjective norms
have a significant impact on the intentions of citizens to engage in
e-participation activities.

 <dc:description>  Individual differences in learners learning styles can have a significant
effect on their acceptance of collaboration technologies to facilitate the
sharing of learning information in technology-based collaborative learning.
There is, however, a lack of research in exploring the impact of learning
styles on the acceptance of open learner models for information sharing in this
area. This study investigates the impact of learners learning styles on their
acceptance of open learner models for information sharing. A total of 240
undergraduate students in a university in Malaysia have participated in the
online survey. A chi-square test is performed to explore the relationship
between learning styles and the acceptance of open learner models for
information sharing in a higher education setting. The result reveals that
learning styles have no significant impact on learners acceptance of open
learner models for information sharing. The implications of this study can
assist education instructors to apply appropriate instructional strategies in
adopting open learner models for improving the performance of
technology-mediated learning.

 <dc:description>  Employees of early childhood education and care (ECEC) organisations may
experience a wide range of barriers as they attempt to integrate information
technology (IT) into their work practices. However, studies within the ECEC
organisational literature which attempt to identify and understand these
barriers are scant. This literature review is the first to present consolidated
findings from the body of knowledge on barriers to the integration of IT within
ECEC organisations. In addition to highlighting limitations and gaps in the
literature, it proposes a tri-perspective framework to provide for future
research to develop a deeper understanding of not only what barriers exist but
also how they interrelate and shape the IT integration process and the work
practices of ECEC organisational employees.

 <dc:description>  Enterprises rely more on Information Systems (IS) and software than ever
before. However the issue of maintaining a vendor-supplied IS, in particular
standard packaged software, has been poorly represented within academic
literature. This paper presents a conceptual study that synthesises the current
state of research concerning the deferral or execution of vendor-supplied
maintenance by the purchasing organisation. Based on a systematic review
process that adopts the purchasers viewpoint, a series of fears and triggers
emerge and are captured from the literature. Fears are articulated as reasons
for the purchasing organisation deferring the installation of vendor-supplied
maintenance, whereas triggers are events that upset the equilibrium of the
purchasing organisations IS or software and require the installation of the
vendor-supplied maintenance to proceed. Although prevalent in literature, fears
and triggers have not previously been recognised as an area of focus for
academic research.

 <dc:description>  The development of multi-synchronous decision support systems to facilitate
collaboration between diverse users is an emerging field in emergency
management. Traditionally, information management for emergency response has
been a centralised effort. However, modern devices such as smartphones provide
new methods for gaining real-time information about a disaster from users in
the field. In this paper, we present a framework for multi-synchronous
collaborative report writing in the scope of emergency management. This
framework supports desktop-based users as information providers and consumers,
alongside mobile users as information providers to facilitate multi-synchronous
collaboration. We consider the benefits of our framework for writing
collaborative Situation Reports and discuss future directions for research.

 <dc:description>  In emergency management for mass gathering, the knowledge about crowd types
can highly assist with providing timely response and effective resource
allocation. Crowd monitoring can be achieved using computer vision based
approaches and sensory data analysis. The emergence of social media platforms
presents an opportunity to capture valuable information about how people feel
and think. However, reviewing current works shows that there are a limited
number of studies that use social media in crowd monitoring and/or incorporate
a unified crowd model for consistency and interoperability. This presents a
novel framework for crowd monitoring using social media. It includes a standard
crowd model to represent different types of crowds. The proposed framework
considers the effect of emotion on crowd behaviour and uses the emotion
analysis of social media to identify the crowd types in an event. An experiment
using historical data of a past event to validate our framework and model is
described.

 <dc:description>  Business Intelligence (BI) is becoming more accessible and less expensive
with fewer risks through various deployment options available in the Cloud.
Cloud computing facilitates the acquisition of custom solutions for
not-for-profit (NFP) organisations at affordable and scalable costs on a
flexible pay-as-you-go basis. In this paper, we explore the key technical and
organisational aspects of BI in the Cloud (Cloud Intelligence) deployment in an
Australian NFP whose BI maturity is rising although still low. This
organisation aspires to Cloud Intelligence for improved managerial decision
making yet the issues surrounding the adoption of Cloud Intelligence are
complex, especially where corporate and Cloud governance is concerned. From the
findings of the case study, a conceptual framework has been developed and
presented which offers a view of how governance could be deployed so that NFPs
gain maximum leverage through their adoption of the Cloud.

 <dc:description>  The structure of communication networks is an important determinant of the
capacity of teams, organizations and societies to solve policy, business and
science problems. Yet, previous studies reached contradictory results about the
relationship between network structure and performance, finding support for the
superiority of both well-connected efficient and poorly connected inefficient
network structures. Here we argue that understanding how communication networks
affect group performance requires taking into consideration the social learning
strategies of individual team members. We show that efficient networks
outperform inefficient networks when individuals rely on conformity by copying
the most frequent solution among their contacts. However, inefficient networks
are superior when individuals follow the best member by copying the group
member with the highest payoff. In addition, groups relying on conformity based
on a small sample of others excel at complex tasks, while groups following the
best member achieve greatest performance for simple tasks. Our findings
reconcile contradictory results in the literature and have broad implications
for the study of social learning across disciplines.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we compare different metrics to predict the error rate of
optical systems based on nonbinary forward error correction (FEC). It is shown
that the correct metric to predict the performance of coded modulation based on
nonbinary FEC is the mutual information. The accuracy of the prediction is
verified in a detailed example with multiple constellation formats, FEC
overheads in both simulations and optical transmission experiments over a
recirculating loop. It is shown that the employed FEC codes must be universal
if performance prediction based on thresholds is used. A tutorial introduction
into the computation of the threshold from optical transmission measurements is
also given.

 <dc:description>  In compressed sensing, one wishes to acquire an approximately sparse
high-dimensional signal $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ via $m\ll n$ noisy linear
measurements, then later approximately recover $x$ given only those measurement
outcomes. Various guarantees have been studied in terms of the notion of
approximation in recovery, and some isolated folklore results are known stating
that some forms of recovery are stronger than others, via black-box reductions.
In this note we provide a general theorem concerning the hierarchy of strengths
of various recovery guarantees. As a corollary of this theorem, by reducing
from well-known results in the compressed sensing literature, we obtain an
efficient $\ell_p/\ell_p$ scheme for any $0&lt;p&lt;1$ with the fewest number of
measurements currently known amongst efficient schemes, improving recent bounds
of [SomaY16].

 <dc:description>  We introduce the multiresolution recurrent neural network, which extends the
sequence-to-sequence framework to model natural language generation as two
parallel discrete stochastic processes: a sequence of high-level coarse tokens,
and a sequence of natural language tokens. There are many ways to estimate or
learn the high-level coarse tokens, but we argue that a simple extraction
procedure is sufficient to capture a wealth of high-level discourse semantics.
Such procedure allows training the multiresolution recurrent neural network by
maximizing the exact joint log-likelihood over both sequences. In contrast to
the standard log- likelihood objective w.r.t. natural language tokens (word
perplexity), optimizing the joint log-likelihood biases the model towards
modeling high-level abstractions. We apply the proposed model to the task of
dialogue response generation in two challenging domains: the Ubuntu technical
support domain, and Twitter conversations. On Ubuntu, the model outperforms
competing approaches by a substantial margin, achieving state-of-the-art
results according to both automatic evaluation metrics and a human evaluation
study. On Twitter, the model appears to generate more relevant and on-topic
responses according to automatic evaluation metrics. Finally, our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model is more adept at overcoming the sparsity of
natural language and is better able to capture long-term structure.

 <dc:description>  Given a musical audio recording, the goal of automatic music transcription is
to determine a score-like representation of the piece underlying the recording.
Despite significant interest within the research community, several studies
have reported on a 'glass ceiling' effect, an apparent limit on the
transcription accuracy that current methods seem incapable of overcoming. In
this paper, we explore how much this effect can be mitigated by focusing on a
specific instrument class and making use of additional information on the
recording conditions available in studio or home recording scenarios. In
particular, exploiting the availability of single note recordings for the
instrument in use we develop a novel signal model employing variable-length
spectro-temporal patterns as its central building blocks - tailored for pitched
percussive instruments such as the piano. Temporal dependencies between
spectral templates are modeled, resembling characteristics of factorial scaled
hidden Markov models (FS-HMM) and other methods combining Non-Negative Matrix
Factorization with Markov processes. In contrast to FS-HMMs, our parameter
estimation is developed in a global, relaxed form within the extensible
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, which enables the
systematic combination of basic regularizers propagating sparsity and local
stationarity in note activity with more complex regularizers imposing temporal
semantics. The proposed method achieves an f-measure of 93-95% for note onsets
on pieces recorded on a Yamaha Disklavier (MAPS DB).

 <dc:description>  While Bayesian methods are praised for their ability to incorporate useful
prior knowledge, in practice, convenient priors that allow for computationally
cheap or tractable inference are commonly used. In this paper, we investigate
the following question: for a given model, is it possible to compute an
inference result with any convenient false prior, and afterwards, given any
target prior of interest, quickly transform this result into the target
posterior? A potential solution is to use importance sampling (IS). However, we
demonstrate that IS will fail for many choices of the target prior, depending
on its parametric form and similarity to the false prior. Instead, we propose
prior swapping, a method that leverages the pre-inferred false posterior to
efficiently generate accurate posterior samples under arbitrary target priors.
Prior swapping lets us apply less-costly inference algorithms to certain
models, and incorporate new or updated prior information &quot;post-inference&quot;. We
give theoretical guarantees about our method, and demonstrate it empirically on
a number of models and priors.

 <dc:title>Multi-Agent Modeling of Dynamical Systems: A Self-organized, Emergent,

 <dc:description>  This thesis presents the theoretical, conceptual and methodological aspects
that support the modeling of dynamical systems (DS) by using several agents.
The modeling approach permits the assessment of properties representing order,
change, equilibrium, adaptability, and autonomy, in DS. The modeling processes
were supported by a conceptual corpus regarding systems dynamics, multi-agent
systems, graph theory, and, particularly, the information theory. Besides to
the specification of the dynamical systems as a computational network of
agents, metrics that allow characterizing and assessing the inherent complexity
of such systems were defined. As a result, properties associated with
emergence, self-organization, complexity, homeostasis and autopoiesis were
defined, formalized and measured. The validation of the underlying DS model was
carried out on discrete systems (boolean networks and cellular automata) and
ecological systems. The central contribution of this thesis was the development
of a methodological approach for DS modeling. This approach includes a larger
set of properties than in traditional studies, what allows us to deepen in
questioning essential issues associated with the DS field. All this was
achieved from a simple base of calculation and interpretation, which does not
require advanced mathematical knowledge, and facilitates their application in
different fields of science.

 <dc:description>  Current multi-view factorization methods make assumptions that are not
acceptable for many kinds of data, and in particular, for graphical data with
hierarchical structure. At the same time, current hierarchical methods work
only in the single-view setting. We generalize the Treelet Transform to the
Multi-View Treelet Transform (MVTT) to allow for the capture of hierarchical
structure when multiple views are available. Further, we show how this
generalization is consistent with the existing theory and how it might be used
in denoising empirical networks and in computing the shared response of
functional brain data.

 <dc:title>A Spiking Network that Learns to Extract Spike Signatures from Speech
  Signals</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tavanaei, Amirhossein</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with adaptive synapses reflect core properties
of biological neural networks. Speech recognition, as an application involving
audio coding and dynamic learning, provides a good test problem to study SNN
functionality. We present a simple, novel, and efficient nonrecurrent SNN that
learns to convert a speech signal into a spike train signature. The signature
is distinguishable from signatures for other speech signals representing
different words, thereby enabling digit recognition and discrimination in
devices that use only spiking neurons. The method uses a small, nonrecurrent
SNN consisting of Izhikevich neurons equipped with spike timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) and biologically realistic synapses. This approach introduces
an efficient and fast network without error-feedback training, although it does
require supervised training. The new simulation results produce discriminative
spike train patterns for spoken digits in which highly correlated spike trains
belong to the same category and low correlated patterns belong to different
categories. The proposed SNN is evaluated using a spoken digit recognition task
where a subset of the Aurora speech dataset is used. The experimental results
show that the network performs well in terms of accuracy rate and complexity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel reordering scheme to improve the
performance of a Laplacian Mesh Smoothing (LMS). While the Laplacian smoothing
algorithm is well optimized and studied, we show how a simple reordering of the
vertices of the mesh can greatly improve the execution time of the smoothing
algorithm. The idea of our reordering is based on (i) the postulate that cache
misses are a very time consuming part of the execution of LMS, and (ii) the
study of the reuse distance patterns of various executions of the LMS
algorithm.
  Our reordering algorithm is very simple but allows for huge performance
improvement. We ran it on a Westmere-EX platform and obtained a speedup of 75
on 32 cores compared to the single core execution without reordering, and a
gain in execution of 32% on 32 cores compared to state of the art reordering.
Finally, we show that we leave little room for a better ordering by reducing
the L2 and L3 cache misses to a bare minimum.

 <dc:description>  This paper discusses an efficient parallel implementation of the ensemble
Kalman filter based on the modified Cholesky decomposition. The proposed
implementation starts with decomposing the domain into sub-domains. In each
sub-domain a sparse estimation of the inverse background error covariance
matrix is computed via a modified Cholesky decomposition; the estimates are
computed concurrently on separate processors. The sparsity of this estimator is
dictated by the conditional independence of model components for some radius of
influence. Then, the assimilation step is carried out in parallel without the
need of inter-processor communication. Once the local analysis states are
computed, the analysis sub-domains are mapped back onto the global domain to
obtain the analysis ensemble. Computational experiments are performed using the
Atmospheric General Circulation Model (SPEEDY) with the T-63 resolution on the
Blueridge cluster at Virginia Tech. The number of processors used in the
experiments ranges from 96 to 2,048. The proposed implementation outperforms in
terms of accuracy the well-known local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF)
for all the model variables. The computational time of the proposed
implementation is similar to that of the parallel LETKF method (where no
covariance estimation is performed). Finally, for the largest number of
processors, the proposed parallel implementation is 400 times faster than the
serial version of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Previous approaches to model and analyze facial expression analysis use three
different techniques: facial action units, geometric features and graph based
modelling. However, previous approaches have treated these technique
separately. There is an interrelationship between these techniques. The facial
expression analysis is significantly improved by utilizing these mappings
between major geometric features involved in facial expressions and the subset
of facial action units whose presence or absence are unique to a facial
expression. This paper combines dimension reduction techniques and image
classification with search space pruning achieved by this unique subset of
facial action units to significantly prune the search space. The performance
results on the publicly facial expression database shows an improvement in
performance by 70% over time while maintaining the emotion recognition
correctness.

 <dc:title>Training a Hidden Markov Model with a Bayesian Spiking Neural Network</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tavanaei, Amirhossein</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Maida, Anthony S</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is of some interest to understand how statistically based mechanisms for
signal processing might be integrated with biologically motivated mechanisms
such as neural networks. This paper explores a novel hybrid approach for
classifying segments of sequential data, such as individual spoken works. The
approach combines a hidden Markov model (HMM) with a spiking neural network
(SNN). The HMM, consisting of states and transitions, forms a fixed backbone
with nonadaptive transition probabilities. The SNN, however, implements a
biologically based Bayesian computation that derives from the spike
timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule. The emission (observation)
probabilities of the HMM are represented in the SNN and trained with the STDP
rule. A separate SNN, each with the same architecture, is associated with each
of the states of the HMM. Because of the STDP training, each SNN implements an
expectation maximization algorithm to learn the emission probabilities for one
HMM state. The model was studied on synthesized spike-train data and also on
spoken word data. Preliminary results suggest its performance compares
favorably with other biologically motivated approaches. Because of the model's
uniqueness and initial promise, it warrants further study. It provides some new
ideas on how the brain might implement the equivalent of an HMM in a neural
circuit.

 <dc:description>  Let $s_n$ be the number of words consisting of the ternary alphabet
consisting of the digits 0, 1, and 2 such that no subword (or factor) is a
square (a word concatenated with itself, e.g., $11$, $1212$, or $102102$). From
computational evidence, $s_n$ grows exponentially at a rate of about
$1.317277^n$. While known upper bounds are already relatively close to the
conjectured rate, effective lower bounds are much more difficult to obtain. In
this paper, we construct a $54$-Brinkhuis $952$-triple, which leads to an
improved lower bound on the number of $n$-letter ternary squarefree words:
$952^{n/53} \approx 1.1381531^n$.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a method for face detection in the wild, which integrates
a ConvNet and a 3D mean face model in an end-to-end multi-task discriminative
learning framework. The 3D mean face model is predefined and fixed (e.g., we
used the one provided in the AFLW dataset). The ConvNet consists of two
components: (i) The face pro- posal component computes face bounding box
proposals via estimating facial key-points and the 3D transformation (rotation
and translation) parameters for each predicted key-point w.r.t. the 3D mean
face model. (ii) The face verification component computes detection results by
prun- ing and refining proposals based on facial key-points based configuration
pooling. The proposed method addresses two issues in adapting state- of-the-art
generic object detection ConvNets (e.g., faster R-CNN) for face detection: (i)
One is to eliminate the heuristic design of prede- fined anchor boxes in the
region proposals network (RPN) by exploit- ing a 3D mean face model. (ii) The
other is to replace the generic RoI (Region-of-Interest) pooling layer with a
configuration pooling layer to respect underlying object structures. The
multi-task loss consists of three terms: the classification Softmax loss and
the location smooth l1 -losses [14] of both the facial key-points and the face
bounding boxes. In ex- periments, our ConvNet is trained on the AFLW dataset
only and tested on the FDDB benchmark with fine-tuning and on the AFW benchmark
without fine-tuning. The proposed method obtains very competitive
state-of-the-art performance in the two benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  This work includes all the technical details of the Sequential Principal
Curves Analysis (SPCA) in a single document. SPCA is an unsupervised nonlinear
and invertible feature extraction technique. The identified curvilinear
features can be interpreted as a set of nonlinear sensors: the response of each
sensor is the projection onto the corresponding feature. Moreover, it can be
easily tuned for different optimization criteria; e.g. infomax, error
minimization, decorrelation; by choosing the right way to measure distances
along each curvilinear feature. Even though proposed in [Laparra et al. Neural
Comp. 12] and shown to work in multiple modalities in [Laparra and Malo
Frontiers Hum. Neuro. 15], the SPCA framework has its original roots in the
nonlinear ICA algorithm in [Malo and Gutierrez Network 06]. Later on, the SPCA
philosophy for nonlinear generalization of PCA originated substantially faster
alternatives at the cost of introducing different constraints in the model.
Namely, the Principal Polynomial Analysis (PPA) [Laparra et al. IJNS 14], and
the Dimensionality Reduction via Regression (DRR) [Laparra et al. IEEE TGRS
15]. This report illustrates the reasons why we developed such family and is
the appropriate technical companion for the missing details in [Laparra et al.,
NeCo 12, Laparra and Malo, Front.Hum.Neuro. 15]. See also the data, code and

 <dc:description>  We outline the constraints faced by operators when deciding to share
de-identified data with researchers or policy makers. We describe a
conservative approach that we have taken to harness the value of CDRs for
infectious disease epidemiology while ensuring that identification of
individuals is impossible. We believe this approach serves as a useful and
highly conservative model for productive partnerships between mobile operators,
researchers, and public health practitioners.

 <dc:title>Unified Framework for Quantification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Firat, Aykut</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Quantification is the machine learning task of estimating test-data class
proportions that are not necessarily similar to those in training. Apart from
its intrinsic value as an aggregate statistic, quantification output can also
be used to optimize classifier probabilities, thereby increasing classification
accuracy. We unify major quantification approaches under a constrained
multi-variate regression framework, and use mathematical programming to
estimate class proportions for different loss functions. With this modeling
approach, we extend existing binary-only quantification approaches to
multi-class settings as well. We empirically verify our unified framework by
experimenting with several multi-class datasets including the Stanford
Sentiment Treebank and CIFAR-10.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  mHealth (mobile health) be the blessing of ICT and is probably one of the
most prominent services with noticeable effect on the development of healthcare
sector. Given the potential benefits mHealth can bring to older people, it is
important to understand the users (elderly population) intention to use the
technology. However, little research has been done to draw any systematic study
of elderlys adoption and usage of mHealth. The aim of this study is to
determine factors that influence the adoption and use of mHealth technology and
services by the elderly in Bangladesh. This research will develop a theoretical
model to determine the elderly behavioral intention to adopt mHealth
application. It is intended to determine if there is any significant
relationship between attitudinal constructs such as Performance Expectancy,
Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Condition, Hedonic
Motivation, Price Value, Habit and acceptance of mHealth services in
Bangladesh. The study will also investigate the moderating role of gender &amp;
experience and their influence on the adoption of mHealth technology and
services.

 <dc:description>  The increase reliance on information systems has created unprecedented
challenges for organizations to protect their critical information from
different security threats that have direct consequences on the corporate
liability, loss of credibility, and monetary damage. As a result, the security
of information has become a top priority in many organizations. This study
investigates the role of socio-organizational factors by drawing the insights
from the organizational theory literature in the adoption of information
security compliance in organizations. Based on the analysis of the survey data
collected from 294 employees from different organizations, the study indicates
management commitment, awareness and training, accountability, technology
capability, technology compatibility, processes integration, and audit and
monitoring have a significant positive impact on the adoption of information
security compliance in organizations. The study contributes to the information
security compliance research by exploring the criticality of
socio-organizational factors at the organizational level for information
security compliance.

 <dc:description>  E-mental health is an area within e-health in which the key role of IS/IT has
not been well established. Both clinicians and scholars are uncertain as to the
role of IS/IT and its potential benefits. This research review is introduced to
assist in understanding the enabling role in e-mental health and it focused on
one area of mental health, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in
university students. ADHD is estimated to affect approximately 6% of university
students by negatively impacting students' academic performance and social
life; hence, fewer of these students complete their degrees as compared to
their peers. This review outlines the potentials of using IS/IT in the
treatment of ADHD in university students. It also serves to greatly contribute
to e-mental health development and thereby to help to uncover further
possibilities of IT/IT to support broad areas within mental health disorders
and services.

 <dc:description>  As project managers (PMs) play an important role in project success,
assigning PMs with appropriate skills and personalities to projects is a
crucial task. Empirical research on skill requirements for information
technology (IT) PMs is limited and little information systems literature
focuses on the role of internally recruited IT PMs. This paper presents a case
study of a troubled IT project which was led by three consecutive PMs, all with
different backgrounds, skill sets, and personalities. Lessons learned from the
three PMs confirm the importance of some skills previously described in the
literature, and the need for an additional focus on how an IT PMs personality
encourages or inhibits IT project outcomes. Internally recruited PMs usually
lack IT project management expertise and experience but were found to have
advantages in understanding organisational culture and business processes.
Nevertheless, IT project management expertise was found to be a necessity of
project success.

 <dc:description>  This study evaluates how off-the-shelf commercial ICTs can contribute to
creating a feeling of Presence, Connectedness, and Awareness between parents
and their hospitalized child. Thematic analysis and descriptive statistics are
used to analyse qualitative and quantitative data collected through a survey of
thirty eight parents whose children were admitted to the Royal Childrens
Hospital. Through analysis of data, Presence is found to be less facilitated
through ICT than are Awareness and Connectedness. Although participants
reported that voice call on mobile phones was the most common way of
communication, their ideal was a video-chat application such as Skype, or a
combination of Skype and TV to facilitate feeling of Presence. A strong desire
to use rich media such as video-audio to help them have a greater feeling of
Presence was identified in parents responses to the questionnaire.

 <dc:description>  This research paper investigates the influence of industry on electronic
customer relationship management (e-CRM) performance. A case study approach
with two cases was applied to evaluate the influence of e-CRM on customer
behavioral and attitudinal loyalty along with customer pyramid. The cases
covered two industries consisting of computer and automotive industries. For
investigating customer behavioral loyalty and customer pyramid companies
database were computed while for examining customer attitudinal loyalty a
survey was conducted. The results show that e-CRM has significantly different
impacts on customer behavioral and attitudinal loyalty and customer pyramid in
two industries. This research provides new approach for organizations to
evaluate their e-CRM performance and compare it with other companies in order
to formulate stronger policies for customer relationship management.

 <dc:description>  Consumer trust is one of the key obstacles to online vendors seeking to
extend their consumers across cultures. This research identifies culture at the
individual consumer level. Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model,
this study focuses on the moderating role of uncertainty avoidance culture
value on privacy and security as cognition influences, joy and fear as
emotional influences (Stimuli), and individualism-collectivism on social
networking services as social influence and subsequently on interpersonal trust
(cognitive and affect-based trust) (Organism) towards purchase intention
(Response). Data were collected in Australia and the Partial least squares
(PLS) approach was used to test the research model. The findings confirmed the
moderating role of individual level culture on consumer's cognitive and
affect-based trust in B2Ce-commerce websites with diverse degrees of
uncertainty avoidance and individualism.

 <dc:title>Implications of managing health related records and relevant information

 <dc:description>  The implications of intergovernmental agencies may forever change the way in
which governments provide common services within a federated Australia. As
governments seek to reduce duplication and inconsistencies across state and
territory borders, intergovernmental agencies, born out of intergovernmental
agreements, without any link to specific state or territory legislation, are
challenging managers to develop, new approaches to procurement and implement
information systems within this new legal dynamic framework. This paper
considers the implications to managing health related records and their IT
systems, having common legislative obligations across all Australia
jurisdictions, to determine whether these new forms of government allow for the
disposal of information, aimed at saving costs, improving the quality of data
and reduce litigious risk. The paper also investigates the more general
implications for any organisation operating nationally, to data sovereignty and
how legislative ownership of records may predetermine how and where
intergovernmental agencies can manage information assets.

 <dc:description>  The identification of distinct user roles is an important theme in social
media research. However, for Enterprise Social Networks (ESN), the use of
social media within organisations, research identifying such roles is still
lacking. Yet, understanding user roles, in particular regarding their knowledge
contributions and communication behaviour, might usefully support companies in
managing critical knowledge resources. Against this backdrop, in this
research-in-progress paper we derive 16 metrics characterising the
participation behaviour, message content and structural position of ESN users
of an Australian professional services firm. Based on a factor analysis, we
identify four distinct dimensions of ESN user behaviour: Contribution &amp;
networking, information provision, contact dispersion and invisible usage. With
this research we contribute to the literature by transferring concepts and
methods of organisation science and social media research to an ESN context.
Further, our approach forms the basis for the identification of different types
of knowledge actors, which might ultimately help to improve organisational
knowledge transparency.

 <dc:description>  There is an increasing focus on the persuasive approach to develop a
people-centric security climate where employees are aware of the priority of
security and perform conscious security behaviour proactively. Employees can
evaluate the priority of security as they observe and interact with the
security features that constitute the security climate of the workplace. We
examined the fundamental challenge that not every employee could recognise
those features. In this multi-stage research, we adopted the theoretical lens
of symbolic interactionism to advance a conceptual model which explains the
relationship between organisation's social networks and the formation of
information security climate. A descriptive case study in Vietnam was then
conducted to refine the proposed model. The findings validated and extended the
dimensions of information security climate, as well as identified the relevant
organisation's social networks (i.e. information, affect, and power) that lead
to its formation.

 <dc:description>  Tertiary education is one of the most important industries in Australia and a
crucial source of income for its universities. Therefore, any new form of
tertiary education that may have impact on Australian universities should be
closely watched for implications on their business models. In the past decade,
MOOC-Massive Open Online Courses have emerged with the promise to offer world
class education accessible anywhere and anytime for free or at very reasonable
costs. MOOC not only provide opportunities for lifelong learning, they are also
designed to enrich, compliment and even (partly) substitute classic tertiary
education. Hence, it is of crucial importance how and where Australia takes its
stand in this rapidly evolving market. In this paper, Australia's international
position as a provider of MOOC is analysed and compared, in particular to
Germany and the US.

 <dc:description>  Mitigating consumer health risks and reducing food wastage has stimulated
research into mechanisms for improving consumers' food safety knowledge and
food management practice. Many studies report success, but differences in
methodology and in the type and range of foods and consumers involved has made
comparison and transferability of results challenging. While most studies
advocate for the importance of information in consumer education, few provide
detailed insight into what 'good' information means. Determining appropriate
content, formats, and methods of delivery for different types of consumers as
well as evaluating how different choices impact on consumers' food safety
knowledge and behaviour remains unclear. Within a larger research project on
enhancing provenance, stability and traceability of red meat value chains, this
paper presents findings from a survey of Australian red meat consumers (n=217).
It identifies consumers' food safety issues and reveals information and
communication preferences that may support good safety habits with food.

 <dc:description>  We examined the influence of three social engineering strategies on users'
judgments of how safe it is to click on a link in an email. The three
strategies examined were authority, scarcity and social proof, and the emails
were either genuine, phishing or spear-phishing. Of the three strategies, the
use of authority was the most effective strategy in convincing users that a
link in an email was safe. When detecting phishing and spear-phishing emails,
users performed the worst when the emails used the authority principle and
performed best when social proof was present. Overall, users struggled to
distinguish between genuine and spear-phishing emails. Finally, users who were
less impulsive in making decisions generally were less likely to judge a link
as safe in the fraudulent emails. Implications for education and training are
discussed.

 <dc:description>  Most companies' new business practices are based on customer data. These
practices have raised privacy concerns because of the associated risks. Privacy
laws require companies to gain customer consent before using their information,
which stands as the biggest roadblock to monetise this asset. Privacy
literature suggests that reducing privacy concerns and building trust may
increase individuals' intention to authorise the use of personal information.
Fair information practices (FIPs) are potential means to achieve this goal.
However, there is lack of empirical evidence on the mechanisms through which
the FIPs affect privacy concerns and trust. This research argues that FIPs load
individuals with control, which has been found to influence privacy concerns
and trust level. We will use an experimental design methodology to conduct the
study. The results are expected to have both theoretical and managerial
implications.

 <dc:title>Exploring the roles of ICT in supporting sustainability practices</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The concern about sustainability has arisen due to the overuse of natural
resources and the increased use of energy consumption over the last decades.
Information communication technologies (ICT) has the potential to address the
three main aspects of sustainability (people, planet, profit) and therefore,
several organizations have initiated a sustainable development by integrating
ICT within their business activities. However, the roles of ICT in supporting
sustainability initiatives have only been discussed in a limited number of
studies and there is a lack of practical examples that demonstrate how the
different roles of ICT are played out in an organization's environment.
Therefore, this research aims to explore how ICT can be used by organizations
to support sustainability initiatives. In particular, in this
research-in-progress paper, we examine how a leading organization deploys
Internet-of-Things as an example of an ICT application to support various
sustainability initiatives. The study findings enhance the current
understanding of how ICT can support sustainability practices of organizations.

 <dc:description>  Considerable research effort has been devoted to the study of Policy in the
domain of Information Security Management (ISM). However, our review of ISM
literature identified four key deficiencies that reduce the utility of the
guidance to organisations implementing policy management practices. This paper
provides a comprehensive overview of the management practices of information
security policy and develops a practice-based model that addresses the four
aforementioned deficiencies. The model provides comprehensive guidance to
practitioners on the activities security managers must undertake for security
policy development and allows practitioners to benchmark their current practice
with the models suggested best practice. The model contributes to theory by
mapping existing information security policy research in terms of the defined
management practices.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Global e-retailing continues to gain in popularity, but little attention is
being paid to the role of translation. This paper proposes a study
investigating whether improving translated information quality of product
descriptions increases the customers' information satisfaction, while reducing
the perceived product risk, which in turn improves their intention to use an
online shopping website. To manipulate translation quality, two translation
methods are used: machine and crowdsourced. The chosen translation written
language pair is from English to Simplified Chinese, as these are the official
languages of world's two largest economies (U.S.A and China respectively) that
also have large e-tailing markets. A model based on an integration of two
theories, DeLone &amp; McLean's Information Systems Success Model, and Perceived
Risk Theory, has been developed for testing the impact of translated
information quality. The moderating effect of translation method and
e-retailer's brand influencing customers' tolerance of imperfect translation is
also considered.

challenges in service failure prevention. This work-in-progress paper reports
on the first phase of an action-design research project to develop a service
failure prevention methodology. In this paper we review the literature on
online services, failure prevention and failure recovery and develop a
theoretical framework for online service failure prevention. This provides the
theoretical grounding for the artefact (the methodology) to be developed. We
use this framework to develop an initial draft of our methodology. We then
outline the remaining phases of the research, and offer some initial
conclusions gained from the project to date.

 <dc:description>  Today, cancer is one of the leading causes of death throughout the world.
This threatening disease has huge negative impacts, not only on quality of
life, but also on the healthcare industry, whose resources are already scarce.
Thus, finding new approaches for cancer care has been a central point of
interest during the last few decades. One of these approaches is the use of
computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems. This systems have the
potential to provide more effective and efficient patient-centric cancer care.
This paper serves to examine the business value of an American CPOE in an
Australian context. This is achieved by using our specifically designed tool to
evaluate the business value of IT in the healthcare, in combination with a
resource based view perspective. Our results show that the system has a number
of enabling resources to generate business value subject to having other
resources.

 <dc:description>  The ubiquity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in work
settings has changed the way employees behave. ICTs such as smartphones, email
and social media makes employees more connected than has ever been possible.
The degree of ICT connectivity can create a positive as well as a negative
impact on employees' productivity. In this context, the notion of ICT
self-discipline - an individual's ability to control their behaviours towards
ICTs - becomes pivotal in the process of managing ICT connectivity. This
follow-on study reports the results of an online survey of 443 to New Zealand
professionals regarding the influence of ICT self-discipline on the
relationship between ICT connectivity and employee productivity. Findings
indicated that the impact of ICT self-discipline varies depending on the
organisation and industry an employee works in. Insights and recommendations
for future research are shared in this paper. Findings from this study
contribute to IS research and practice.

 <dc:description>  Accurate and robust cell nuclei classification is the cornerstone for a wider
range of tasks in digital and Computational Pathology. However, most machine
learning systems require extensive labeling from expert pathologists for each
individual problem at hand, with no or limited abilities for knowledge transfer
between datasets and organ sites. In this paper we implement and evaluate a
variety of deep neural network models and model ensembles for nuclei
classification in renal cell cancer (RCC) and prostate cancer (PCa). We propose
a convolutional neural network system based on residual learning which
significantly improves over the state-of-the-art in cell nuclei classification.
Finally, we show that the combination of tissue types during training increases
not only classification accuracy but also overall survival analysis.

 <dc:description>  We present novel algorithms to factor polynomials over a finite field $\F_q$
of odd characteristic using rank $2$ Drinfeld modules with complex
multiplication. The main idea is to compute a lift of the Hasse invariant
(modulo the polynomial $f(x) \in \F_q[x]$ to be factored) with respect to a
Drinfeld module $\phi$ with complex multiplication. Factors of $f(x)$ supported
on prime ideals with supersingular reduction at $\phi$ have vanishing Hasse
invariant and can be separated from the rest. A Drinfeld module analogue of
Deligne's congruence plays a key role in computing the Hasse invariant lift. We
present two algorithms based on this idea. The first algorithm chooses Drinfeld
modules with complex multiplication at random and has a quadratic expected run
time. The second is a deterministic algorithm with $O(\sqrt{p})$ run time
dependence on the characteristic $p$ of $\F_q$.

 <dc:title>Sparse Signal Recovery using Generalized Approximate Message Passing
  with Built-in Parameter Estimation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Shuai</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tran, Trac D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithm under the
Bayesian setting shows advantage in recovering under-sampled sparse signals
from corrupted observations. Compared to conventional convex optimization
methods, it has a much lower complexity and is computationally tractable. In
the GAMP framework, the sparse signal and the observation are viewed to be
generated according to some pre-specified probability distributions in the
input and output channels. However, the parameters of the distributions are
usually unknown in practice. In this paper, we propose an extended GAMP
algorithm with built-in parameter estimation (PE-GAMP) and present its
empirical convergence analysis. PE-GAMP treats the parameters as unknown random
variables with simple priors and jointly estimates them with the sparse
signals. Compared with Expectation Maximization (EM) based parameter estimation
methods, the proposed PE-GAMP could draw information from the prior
distributions of the parameters to perform parameter estimation. It is also
more robust and much simpler, which enables us to consider more complex signal
distributions apart from the usual Bernoulli-Gaussian (BGm) mixture
distribution. Specifically, the formulations of Bernoulli-Exponential mixture
(BEm) distribution and Laplace distribution are given in this paper. Simulated
noiseless sparse signal recovery experiments demonstrate that the performance
of the proposed PE-GAMP matches the oracle GAMP algorithm. When noise is
present, both the simulated experiments and the real image recovery experiments
show that PE-GAMP is still able to maintain its robustness and outperform EM
based parameter estimation method when the sampling ratio is small.
Additionally, using the BEm formulation of the PE-GAMP, we can successfully
perform non-negative sparse coding of local image patches and provide useful
features for the image classification task.

 <dc:description>  For many application areas A/B testing, which partitions users of a system
into an A (control) and B (treatment) group to experiment between several
application designs, enables Internet companies to optimize their services to
the behavioral patterns of their users. Unfortunately, the A/B testing
framework cannot be applied in a straightforward manner to applications like
auctions where the users (a.k.a., bidders) submit bids before the partitioning
into the A and B groups is made. This paper combines auction theoretic modeling
with the A/B testing framework to develop methodology for A/B testing auctions.
The accuracy of our method %, assuming the auction is directly comparable to
ideal A/B testing where there is no interference between A and B. Our results
are based on an extension and improved analysis of the inference method of
Chawla et al. (2014).

 <dc:description>  We study distributed cooperative decision-making under the explore-exploit
tradeoff in the multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem. We extend the state-of-the-art
frequentist and Bayesian algorithms for single-agent MAB problems to
cooperative distributed algorithms for multi-agent MAB problems in which agents
communicate according to a fixed network graph. We rely on a running consensus
algorithm for each agent's estimation of mean rewards from its own rewards and
the estimated rewards of its neighbors. We prove the performance of these
algorithms and show that they asymptotically recover the performance of a
centralized agent. Further, we rigorously characterize the influence of the
communication graph structure on the decision-making performance of the group.

 <dc:description>  In this work we address the task of semantic image segmentation with Deep
Learning and make three main contributions that are experimentally shown to
have substantial practical merit. First, we highlight convolution with
upsampled filters, or 'atrous convolution', as a powerful tool in dense
prediction tasks. Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the
resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks. It also allows us to effectively enlarge the field of view of
filters to incorporate larger context without increasing the number of
parameters or the amount of computation. Second, we propose atrous spatial
pyramid pooling (ASPP) to robustly segment objects at multiple scales. ASPP
probes an incoming convolutional feature layer with filters at multiple
sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, thus capturing objects as well as
image context at multiple scales. Third, we improve the localization of object
boundaries by combining methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models.
The commonly deployed combination of max-pooling and downsampling in DCNNs
achieves invariance but has a toll on localization accuracy. We overcome this
by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected
Conditional Random Field (CRF), which is shown both qualitatively and
quantitatively to improve localization performance. Our proposed &quot;DeepLab&quot;
system sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image
segmentation task, reaching 79.7% mIOU in the test set, and advances the
results on three other datasets: PASCAL-Context, PASCAL-Person-Part, and
Cityscapes. All of our code is made publicly available online.

 <dc:description>  Document classification for text, images and other applicable entities has
long been a focus of research in academia and also finds application in many
industrial settings. Amidst a plethora of approaches to solve such problems,
machine-learning techniques have found success in a variety of scenarios. In
this paper we discuss the design of a machine learning-based semi-supervised
job title classification system for the online job recruitment domain currently
in production at CareerBuilder.com and propose enhancements to it. The system
leverages a varied collection of classification as well clustering algorithms.
These algorithms are encompassed in an architecture that facilitates leveraging
existing off-the-shelf machine learning tools and techniques while keeping into
consideration the challenges of constructing a scalable classification system
for a large taxonomy of categories. As a continuously evolving system that is
still under development we first discuss the existing semi-supervised
classification system which is composed of both clustering and classification
components in a proximity-based classifier setup and results of which are
already used across numerous products at CareerBuilder. We then elucidate our
long-term goals for job title classification and propose enhancements to the
existing system in the form of a two-stage coarse and fine level classifier
augmentation to construct a cascade of hierarchical vertical classifiers.
Preliminary results are presented using experimental evaluation on real world
industrial data.

 <dc:description>  A matrix network is a family of matrices, where the relationship between them
is modeled as a weighted graph. Each node represents a matrix, and the weight
on each edge represents the similarity between the two matrices. Suppose that
we observe a few entries of each matrix with noise, and the fraction of entries
we observe varies from matrix to matrix. Even worse, a subset of matrices in
this family may be completely unobserved. How can we recover the entire matrix
network from noisy and incomplete observations? One motivating example is the
cold start problem, where we need to do inference on new users or items that
come with no information. To recover this network of matrices, we propose a
structural assumption that the matrix network can be approximated by
generalized convolution of low rank matrices living on the same network. We
propose an iterative imputation algorithm to complete the matrix network. This
algorithm is efficient for large scale applications and is guaranteed to
accurately recover all matrices, as long as there are enough observations
accumulated over the network.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a fuzzy goal programming based on Taylor series for
solving decentralized bi-level multiobjective fractional programming (DBLMOFP)
problem. In the proposed approach, all of the membership functions are
associated with the fuzzy goals of each objective at the both levels and also
the fractional membership functions are converted to linear functions using the
Taylor series approach. Then a fuzzy goal programming is proposed to reach the
highest degree of each of the membership goals by taking the most satisfactory
solution for all decision makers at the both levels. Finally, a numerical
example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  We tested 14 very different classification algorithms (random forest,
gradient boosting machines, SVM - linear, polynomial, and RBF - 1-hidden-layer
neural nets, extreme learning machines, k-nearest neighbors and a bagging of
knn, naive Bayes, learning vector quantization, elastic net logistic
regression, sparse linear discriminant analysis, and a boosting of linear
classifiers) on 115 real life binary datasets. We followed the Demsar analysis
and found that the three best classifiers (random forest, gbm and RBF SVM) are
not significantly different from each other. We also discuss that a change of
less then 0.0112 in the error rate should be considered as an irrelevant
change, and used a Bayesian ANOVA analysis to conclude that with high
probability the differences between these three classifiers is not of practical
consequence. We also verified the execution time of &quot;standard implementations&quot;
of these algorithms and concluded that RBF SVM is the fastest (significantly
so) both in training time and in training plus testing time.

 <dc:description>  Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the
relationships between patients' covariates (e.g. clinical and genetic features)
and the effectiveness of various treatment options. Standard survival models
like the linear Cox proportional hazards model require extensive feature
engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment interaction at an
individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks and
survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they
have yet to be shown as effective treatment recommender systems. We introduce
DeepSurv, a Cox proportional hazards deep neural network and state-of-the-art
survival method for modeling interactions between a patient's covariates and
treatment effectiveness in order to provide personalized treatment
recommendations. We perform a number of experiments training DeepSurv on
simulated and real survival data. We demonstrate that DeepSurv performs as well
as or better than other state-of-the-art survival models and validate that
DeepSurv successfully models increasingly complex relationships between a
patient's covariates and their risk of failure. We then show how DeepSurv
models the relationship between a patient's features and effectiveness of
different treatment options to show how DeepSurv can be used to provide
individual treatment recommendations. Finally, we train DeepSurv on real
clinical studies to demonstrate how it's personalized treatment recommendations
would increase the survival time of a set of patients. The predictive and
modeling capabilities of DeepSurv will enable medical researchers to use deep
neural networks as a tool in their exploration, understanding, and prediction
of the effects of a patient's characteristics on their risk of failure.

 <dc:description>  We propose a pilot-data transmission overlay scheme for multipair massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying systems employing either half-
or full-duplex (HD or FD) communications at the relay station (RS). In the
proposed scheme, pilots are transmitted in partial overlap with data to
decrease the channel estimation overhead. The RS can detect the source data
with minimal destination pilot interference by exploiting the asymptotic
orthogonality of massive MIMO channels. Then pilot-data interference can be
effectively suppressed with assistance of the detected source data in the
destination channel estimation. Due to the transmission overlay, the effective
data period is extended, hence improving system throughput. Both theoretical
and simulation results confirm that the proposed pilot-data overlay scheme
outperforms the conventional separate pilot-data design in the limited
coherence time interval scenario. Moreover, asymptotic analyses at high and low
SNR regions demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme regardless of
the coherence interval length. Because of simultaneous transmission, the proper
allocation of source data transmission and relay data forwarding power can
further improve the system performance. Hence a power allocation problem is
formulated and a successive convex approximation approach is proposed to solve
the non-convex optimization problem with the FD pilot-data transmission
overlay.

 <dc:description>  The branch flow based optimal power flow(OPF) problem in radianlly operated
distribution networks can be exactly relazed to a second order cone programming
(SOCP) model without considering transformers. However, the introdution of
nonlinear transformer models will make the OPF model non-convex. This paper
presents an exact linearized transformer's OLTC model to keep the OPF model
convex via binary expanstion scheme and big-M method. Validity of the proposed
method is verified using IEEE 33-bus test system.

 <dc:description>  Computation of the trace of a matrix function plays an important role in many
scientific computing applications, including applications in machine learning,
computational physics (e.g., lattice quantum chromodynamics), network analysis
and computational biology (e.g., protein folding), just to name a few
application areas. We propose a linear-time randomized algorithm for
approximating the trace of matrix functions of large symmetric matrices. Our
algorithm is based on coupling function approximation using Chebyshev
interpolation with stochastic trace estimators (Hutchinson's method), and as
such requires only implicit access to the matrix, in the form of a function
that maps a vector to the product of the matrix and the vector. We provide
rigorous approximation error in terms of the extremal eigenvalue of the input
matrix, and the Bernstein ellipse that corresponds to the function at hand.
Based on our general scheme, we provide algorithms with provable guarantees for
important matrix computations, including log-determinant, trace of matrix
inverse, Estrada index, Schatten p-norm, and testing positive definiteness. We
experimentally evaluate our algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness on
matrices with tens of millions dimensions.

 <dc:description>  How can we find a good graph clustering of a real-world network, that allows
insight into its underlying structure and also potential functions? In this
paper, we introduce a new graph clustering algorithm Dcut from a density point
of view. The basic idea is to envision the graph clustering as a density-cut
problem, such that the vertices in the same cluster are densely connected and
the vertices between clusters are sparsely connected. To identify meaningful
clusters (communities) in a graph, a density-connected tree is first
constructed in a local fashion. Owing to the density-connected tree, Dcut
allows partitioning a graph into multiple densely tight-knit clusters directly.
We demonstrate that our method has several attractive benefits: (a) Dcut
provides an intuitive criterion to evaluate the goodness of a graph clustering
in a more natural and precise way; (b) Built upon the density-connected tree,
Dcut allows identifying the meaningful graph clusters of densely connected
vertices efficiently; (c) The density-connected tree provides a connectivity
map of vertices in a graph from a local density perspective. We systematically
evaluate our new clustering approach on synthetic as well as real data to
demonstrate its good performance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study joint queue-aware and channel-aware scheduling of
arbitrarily bursty traffic over multi-state time-varying channels, where the
bursty packet arrival in the network layer, the backlogged queue in the data
link layer, and the power adaptive transmission with fixed modulation in the
physical layer are jointly considered from a cross-layer perspective. To
achieve minimum queueing delay given a power constraint, a probabilistic
cross-layer scheduling policy is proposed, and characterized by a Markov chain
model. To describe the delay-power tradeoff, we formulate a non-linear
optimization problem, which however is very challenging to solve. To handle
with this issue, we convert the optimization problem into an equivalent Linear
Programming (LP) problem, which allows us to obtain the optimal threshold-based
scheduling policy with an optimal threshold imposed on the queue length in
accordance with each channel state.

 <dc:title>Message Passing for Analysis and Resilient Design of Self-Healing

 <dc:description>  Coupling cyber and physical systems gives rise to numerous engineering
challenges and opportunities. An important challenge is the contagion of
failure from one system to another, that can lead to large scale cascading
failures. On the other hand, self-healing ability emerges as a valuable
opportunity where the overlay cyber network can cure failures in the underlying
physical network. To capture both self-healing and contagion, we introduce a
factor graph representation of inter-dependent cyber-physical systems in which
factor nodes represent various node functionalities and the edges capture the
interactions between the nodes. We develop a message passing algorithm to study
the dynamics of failure propagation and healing in this representation. Through
applying a fixed-point analysis to this algorithm, we investigate the network
reaction to initial disruptions. Our analysis provides simple yet critical
guidelines for choosing network parameters to achieve resiliency against
cascading failures.

 <dc:description>  Quantization of a probability distribution refers to the idea of estimating a
given probability by a discrete probability supported by a finite set. In this
paper, we have considered a Borel probability measure $P$ on $\mathbb R^2$
which has support the R-triangle generated by a set of three contractive
similarity mappings on $\mathbb R^2$. For this probability measure, the optimal
sets of $n$-means and the $n$th quantization error are determined for all
$n\geq 2$.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of smooth imitation learning for online sequence
prediction, where the goal is to train a policy that can smoothly imitate
demonstrated behavior in a dynamic and continuous environment in response to
online, sequential context input. Since the mapping from context to behavior is
often complex, we take a learning reduction approach to reduce smooth imitation
learning to a regression problem using complex function classes that are
regularized to ensure smoothness. We present a learning meta-algorithm that
achieves fast and stable convergence to a good policy. Our approach enjoys
several attractive properties, including being fully deterministic, employing
an adaptive learning rate that can provably yield larger policy improvements
compared to previous approaches, and the ability to ensure stable convergence.
Our empirical results demonstrate significant performance gains over previous
approaches.

 <dc:description>  Video sequences contain rich dynamic patterns, such as dynamic texture
patterns that exhibit stationarity in the temporal domain, and action patterns
that are non-stationary in either spatial or temporal domain. We show that a
spatial-temporal generative ConvNet can be used to model and synthesize dynamic
patterns. The model defines a probability distribution on the video sequence,
and the log probability is defined by a spatial-temporal ConvNet that consists
of multiple layers of spatial-temporal filters to capture spatial-temporal
patterns of different scales. The model can be learned from the training video
sequences by an &quot;analysis by synthesis&quot; learning algorithm that iterates the
following two steps. Step 1 synthesizes video sequences from the currently
learned model. Step 2 then updates the model parameters based on the difference
between the synthesized video sequences and the observed training sequences. We
show that the learning algorithm can synthesize realistic dynamic patterns.

 <dc:description>  Coding schemes with extremely low computational complexity are required for
particular applications, such as wireless body area networks, in which case
both very high data accuracy and very low power-consumption are required
features. In this paper, coding schemes arising from incidence matrices of
graphs are proposed. An analysis of the resilience of such codes to erasures is
given using graph theoretical arguments; decodability of a graph is
characterized in terms of the rank of its incidence matrix. Bounds are given on
the number of decodable subgraphs of a graph and the number of edges that must
be deleted in order to arrive at an undecodable subgraph. Algorithms to
construct codes that are optimal with respect to these bounds are presented.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid growth of knowledge bases (KBs) on the web, how to take full
advantage of them becomes increasingly important. Knowledge base-based question
answering (KB-QA) is one of the most promising approaches to access the
substantial knowledge. Meantime, as the neural network-based (NN-based) methods
develop, NN-based KB-QA has already achieved impressive results. However,
previous work did not put emphasis on question representation, and the question
is converted into a fixed vector regardless of its candidate answers. This
simple representation strategy is unable to express the proper information of
the question. Hence, we present a neural attention-based model to represent the
questions dynamically according to the different focuses of various candidate
answer aspects. In addition, we leverage the global knowledge inside the
underlying KB, aiming at integrating the rich KB information into the
representation of the answers. And it also alleviates the out of vocabulary
(OOV) problem, which helps the attention model to represent the question more
precisely. The experimental results on WEBQUESTIONS demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  $k$ Nearest Neighbors ($k$NN) is one of the most widely used supervised
learning algorithms to classify Gaussian distributed data, but it does not
achieve good results when it is applied to nonlinear manifold distributed data,
especially when a very limited amount of labeled samples are available. In this
paper, we propose a new graph-based $k$NN algorithm which can effectively
handle both Gaussian distributed data and nonlinear manifold distributed data.
To achieve this goal, we first propose a constrained Tired Random Walk (TRW) by
constructing an $R$-level nearest-neighbor strengthened tree over the graph,
and then compute a TRW matrix for similarity measurement purposes. After this,
the nearest neighbors are identified according to the TRW matrix and the class
label of a query point is determined by the sum of all the TRW weights of its
nearest neighbors. To deal with online situations, we also propose a new
algorithm to handle sequential samples based a local neighborhood
reconstruction. Comparison experiments are conducted on both synthetic data
sets and real-world data sets to demonstrate the validity of the proposed new
$k$NN algorithm and its improvements to other version of $k$NN algorithms.
Given the widespread appearance of manifold structures in real-world problems
and the popularity of the traditional $k$NN algorithm, the proposed manifold
version $k$NN shows promising potential for classifying manifold-distributed
data.

 <dc:description>  To meet the growing local and distributed computing needs, the cloud is now
descending to the network edge and sometimes to user equipments. This approach
aims at distributing computing, data processing, and networking services closer
to the end users. Instead of concentrating data and computation in a small
number of large clouds, many edge systems are envisioned to be deployed close
to the end users or where computing and intelligent networking can best meet
user needs. In this paper, we go further converging such massively distributed
computing systems with multiple radio accesses. We propose an architecture
called MUREN (Multi-Radio Edge Node) for managing traffic in future mobile edge
networks. Our solution is based on the Mobile Edge Cloud (MEC) architecture and
its close interaction with Software Defined Networking (SDN), the whole jointly
interacting with Software-Defined Radios (SDR). We have implemented our
architecture in a proof of concept and tested it with two edge scenarios. Our
experiments show that centralizing the intelligence in the MEC allows to
guarantee the requirements of the edge services either by adapting the waveform
parameters, or through changing the radio interface or even by reconfiguring
the applications. More generally, the best decision can be seen as the optimal
reaction to the wireless links variations

 <dc:description>  In recent years there has been a growing interest in developing &quot;streaming
algorithms&quot; for efficient processing and querying of continuous data streams.
These algorithms seek to provide accurate results while minimizing the required
storage and the processing time, at the price of a small inaccuracy in their
output. A fundamental query of interest is the intersection size of two big
data streams. This problem arises in many different application areas, such as
network monitoring, database systems, data integration and information
retrieval. In this paper we develop a new algorithm for this problem, based on
the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. We show that this algorithm outperforms all
known schemes and that it asymptotically achieves the optimal variance.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies charging scheduling problem of electric vehicles (EVs) in
the scale of a microgrid (e.g., a university or town) where a set of charging
stations are controlled by a central aggregator. A bi-objective optimization
problem is formulated to jointly optimize total charging cost and user
convenience. Then, a close-to-optimal online scheduling algorithm is proposed
as solution. The algorithm achieves optimal charging cost and is near optimal
in terms of user convenience. Moreover, the proposed method applies an
efficient load forecasting technique to obtain future load information. The
algorithm is assessed through simulation and compared to the previous studies.
The results reveal that our method not only improves previous alternative
methods in terms of Pareto-optimal solution of the bi-objective optimization
problem, but also provides a close approximation for the load forecasting.

 <dc:description>  Current object recognition methods fail on object sets that include both
diffuse, reflective and transparent materials, although they are very common in
domestic scenarios. We show that a combination of cues from multiple sensor
modalities, including specular reflectance and unavailable depth information,
allows us to capture a larger subset of household objects by extending a state
of the art object recognition method. This leads to a significant increase in
robustness of recognition over a larger set of commonly used objects.

 <dc:title>Automated Road Traffic Congestion Detection and Alarm Systems:

 <dc:subject>68-02</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this position paper, we address the problems of automated road congestion
detection and alerting systems and their security properties. We review
different theoretical adaptive road traffic control approaches, and three
widely deployed adaptive traffic control systems (ATCSs), namely, SCATS, SCOOT
and InSync. We then discuss some related research questions, and the
corresponding possible approaches, as well as the adversary model and potential
attack scenarios. Two theoretical concepts of automated road congestion alarm
systems (including system architecture, communication protocol, and algorithms)
are proposed on top of ATCSs, such as SCATS, SCOOT and InSync, by incorporating
secure wireless vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Finally, the
security properties of the proposed system have been discussed and analysed
using the ProVerif protocol verification tool.

 <dc:description>  State explosion problem is the main obstacle of model checking. In this
paper, we try to solve this problem from a coalgebraic approach. We establish
an effective method to prove uniformly the existence of the smallest Kripke
structure with respect to bisimilarity, which describes all behaviors of the
Kripke structures and no redundancy. We show then this smallest Kripke
structure generates a concrete smallest one for each given finite Kripke
structure and some kind of infinite ones. This method is based on the existence
of the final coalgebra of a suitable endofunctor and can be generalized
smoothly to other coalgebraic structures. A naive implementation of this method
is developed in Ocaml.

 <dc:description>  In the domain of the Soccer simulation 2D league of the RoboCup project,
appropriate player positioning against a given opponent team is an important
factor of soccer team performance. This work proposes a model which decides the
strategy that should be applied regarding a particular opponent team. This task
can be realized by applying preliminary a learning phase where the model
determines the most effective strategies against clusters of opponent teams.
The model determines the best strategies by using sequential Bayes' estimators.
As a first trial of the system, the proposed model is used to determine the
association of player formations against opponent teams in the particular
situation of corner-kick. The implemented model shows satisfying abilities to
compare player formations that are similar to each other in terms of
performance and determines the right ranking even by running a decent number of
simulation games.

 <dc:description>  Content-based analysis and retrieval of digital images found in scientific
articles is often hindered by images consisting of multiple subfigures
(compound figures). We address this problem by proposing a method to
automatically classify and separate compound figures, which consists of two
main steps: (i) a supervised compound figure classifier (CFC) discriminates
between compound and non-compound figures using task-specific image features;
and (ii) an image processing algorithm is applied to predicted compound images
to perform compound figure separation (CFS). Our CFC approach is shown to
achieve state-of-the-art classification performance on a published dataset. Our
CFS algorithm shows superior separation accuracy on two different datasets
compared to other known automatic approaches. Finally, we propose a method to
evaluate the effectiveness of the CFC-CFS process chain and use it to optimize
the misclassification loss of CFC for maximal effectiveness in the process
chain.

 <dc:description>  In the last years, the advancements in signal processing and integrated
circuits technology allowed several research groups to develop working
prototypes of in-band full-duplex wireless systems. The introduction of such a
revolutionary concept is promising in terms of increasing network performance,
but at the same time poses several new challenges, especially at the MAC layer.
Consequently, innovative channel access strategies are needed to exploit the
opportunities provided by full-duplex while dealing with the increased
complexity derived from its adoption. In this direction, this paper proposes
RTS/CTS in the Frequency Domain (RCFD), a MAC layer scheme for full-duplex ad
hoc wireless networks, based on the idea of time-frequency channel contention.
According to this approach, different OFDM subcarriers are used to coordinate
how nodes access the shared medium. The proposed scheme leads to efficient
transmission scheduling with the result of avoiding collisions and exploiting
full-duplex opportunities. The considerable performance improvements with
respect to standard and state-of-the-art MAC protocols for wireless networks
are highlighted through both theoretical analysis and network simulations.

 <dc:description>  Real music signals are highly variable, yet they have strong statistical
structure. Prior information about the underlying physical mechanisms by which
sounds are generated and rules by which complex sound structure is constructed
(notes, chords, a complete musical score), can be naturally unified using
Bayesian modelling techniques. Typically algorithms for Automatic Music
Transcription independently carry out individual tasks such as multiple-F0
detection and beat tracking. The challenge remains to perform joint estimation
of all parameters. We present a Bayesian approach for modelling music audio,
and content analysis. The proposed methodology based on Gaussian processes
seeks joint estimation of multiple music concepts by incorporating into the
kernel prior information about non-stationary behaviour, dynamics, and rich
spectral content present in the modelled music signal. We illustrate the
benefits of this approach via two tasks: pitch estimation, and inferring
missing segments in a polyphonic audio recording.

 <dc:description>  We propose to use real-valued errors instead of classical bit flipping
intentional errors in the McEliece cryptosystem based on moderate-density
parity-check (MDPC) codes. This allows to exploit the error correcting
capability of these codes to the utmost, by using soft-decision iterative
decoding algorithms instead of hard-decision bit flipping decoders. However,
soft reliability values resulting from the use of real-valued noise can also be
exploited by attackers. We devise new attack procedures aimed at this, and
compute the relevant work factors and security levels. We show that, for a
fixed security level, these new systems achieve the shortest public key sizes
ever reached, with a reduction up to 25% with respect to previous proposals.

 <dc:description>  We present a comprehensive review of the most effective content-based e-mail
spam filtering techniques. We focus primarily on Machine Learning-based spam
filters and their variants, and report on a broad review ranging from surveying
the relevant ideas, efforts, effectiveness, and the current progress. The
initial exposition of the background examines the basics of e-mail spam
filtering, the evolving nature of spam, spammers playing cat-and-mouse with
e-mail service providers (ESPs), and the Machine Learning front in fighting
spam. We conclude by measuring the impact of Machine Learning-based filters and
explore the promising offshoots of latest developments.

 <dc:description>  Akari, Takuzu, Kakuro and KenKen are logic games similar to Sudoku. In Akari,
a labyrinth on a grid has to be lit by placing lanterns, respecting various
constraints. In Takuzu a grid has to be filled with 0's and 1's, while
respecting certain constraints. In Kakuro a grid has to be filled with numbers
such that the sums per row and column match given values; similarly in KenKen a
grid has to be filled with numbers such that in given areas the product, sum,
difference or quotient equals a given value. We give physical algorithms to
realize zero-knowledge proofs for these games which allow a player to show that
he knows a solution without revealing it. These interactive proofs can be
realized with simple office material as they only rely on cards and envelopes.
Moreover, we formalize our algorithms and prove their security.

 <dc:description>  We propose an algorithm for finding zero divisors in quaternion algebras over
quadratic number fields, or equivalently, solving homogeneous quadratic
equations in three variables over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})$ where $d$ is a
square-free integer. The algorithm is deterministic and runs in polynomial time
if one is allowed to call oracles for factoring integers and polynomials over
finite fields.

stochastic processes. Then, it investigates $L_p([0,T])$ and uniform
approximations of $\varphi$-sub-Gaussian random processes by finite time

specifications of the general results for which the assumptions can be easily
verified are given. Direct analytical methods are employed to obtain the

 <dc:description>  Autonomous robots must operate in complex and changing environments subject
to requirements on their behaviour. Verifying absolute satisfaction (true or
false) of these requirements is challenging. Instead, we analyse requirements
that admit flexible degrees of satisfaction. We analyse vague requirements
using fuzzy logic, and probabilistic requirements using model checking. The
resulting analysis method provides a partial ordering of system designs,
identifying trade-offs between different requirements in terms of the degrees
to which they are satisfied. A case study involving a home care robot
interacting with a human is used to demonstrate the approach.

 <dc:description>  We report on implementing graph grammars for intelligence analysis in OCaml.
Graph grammars are represented as elements of an algebraic data type in OCaml.
In addition to algebraic data types, we use other concepts from functional
programming languages to implement features of graph grammars. We use type
checking to perform graph pattern matching. Graph transformations are defined
as implicit coercions derived from structural subtyping proofs, subset types,
lambda abstractions, and analytics. An analytic is a general-purpose OCaml
function whose output is required to match a graph pattern described by an
element of an algebraic data type. By using a strongly-typed language for
representing graphs, we can ensure graphs produced from a graph transformation
will match a specific schema. This is a high priority requirement for
intelligence analysis.

 <dc:description>  We introduce temporal flows on temporal networks, i.e., networks the links of
which exist only at certain moments of time. Such networks are ephemeral in the
sense that no link exists after some time. Our flow model is new and differs
from the &quot;flows over time&quot; model, also called &quot;dynamic flows&quot; in the
literature. We show that the problem of finding the maximum amount of flow that
can pass from a source vertex s to a sink vertex t up to a given time is
solvable in Polynomial time, even when node buffers are bounded. We then
examine mainly the case of unbounded node buffers. We provide a simplified
static Time-Extended network (STEG), which is of polynomial size to the input
and whose static flow rates are equivalent to the respective temporal flow of
the temporal network, using STEG, we prove that the maximum temporal flow is
equal to the minimum temporal s-t cut. We further show that temporal flows can
always be decomposed into flows, each of which moves only through a journey,
i.e., a directed path whose successive edges have strictly increasing moments
of existence. We partially characterise networks with random edge
availabilities that tend to eliminate the s-t temporal flow. We then consider
mixed temporal networks, which have some edges with specified availabilities
and some edges with random availabilities, we show that it is #P-hard to
compute the tails and expectations of the maximum temporal flow (which is now a
random variable) in a mixed temporal network.

 <dc:title>Extraction of clinical information from the non-invasive fetal
  electrocardiogram</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Behar, Joachim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Estimation of the fetal heart rate (FHR) has gained interest in the last
century, low heart rate variability has been studied to identify intrauterine
growth restricted fetuses (prepartum), and abnormal FHR patterns have been
associated with fetal distress during delivery (intrapartum). Several
monitoring techniques have been proposed for FHR estimation, including
auscultation and Doppler ultrasound. This thesis focuses on the extraction of
the non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram (NI-FECG) recorded from a limited set
of abdominal sensors. The main challenge with NI-FECG extraction techniques is
the low signal-to-noise ratio of the FECG signal on the abdominal mixture
signal which consists of a dominant maternal ECG component, FECG and noise.
However the NI-FECG offers many advantages over the alternative fetal
monitoring techniques, the most important one being the opportunity to enable
morphological analysis of the FECG which is vital for determining whether an
observed FHR event is normal or pathological. In order to advance the field of
NI-FECG signal processing, the development of standardised public databases and
benchmarking of a number of published and novel algorithms was necessary.

 <dc:description>  The availability of training data for supervision is a frequently encountered
bottleneck of medical image analysis methods. While typically established by a
clinical expert rater, the increase in acquired imaging data renders
traditional pixel-wise segmentations less feasible. In this paper, we examine
the use of a crowdsourcing platform for the distribution of super-pixel weak
annotation tasks and collect such annotations from a crowd of non-expert
raters. The crowd annotations are subsequently used for training a fully
convolutional neural network to address the problem of fetal brain segmentation
in T2-weighted MR images. Using this approach we report encouraging results
compared to highly targeted, fully supervised methods and potentially address a
frequent problem impeding image analysis research.

  This paper explores modifications to a feedforward five-layer spiking
convolutional network (SCN) of the ventral visual stream [Masquelier, T.,
Thorpe, S., Unsupervised learning of visual features through spike timing
dependent plasticity. PLoS Computational Biology, 3(2), 247-257]. The original
model showed that a spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning algorithm
embedded in an appropriately selected SCN could perform unsupervised feature
discovery. The discovered features where interpretable and could effectively be
used to perform rapid binary decisions in a classifier. In order to study the
robustness of the previous results, the present research examines the effects
of modifying some of the components of the original model. For improved
biological realism, we replace the original non-leaky integrate-and-fire
neurons with Izhikevich-like neurons. We also replace the original STDP rule
with a novel rule that has a probabilistic interpretation. The probabilistic
STDP slightly but significantly improves the performance for both types of
model neurons. Use of the Izhikevich-like neuron was not found to improve
performance although performance was still comparable to the IF neuron. This
shows that the model is robust enough to handle more biologically realistic
neurons. We also conclude that the underlying reasons for stable performance in
the model are preserved despite the overt changes to the explicit components of
the model.

 <dc:description>  Polymorphic variants are a useful feature of the OCaml language whose current
definition and implementation rely on kinding constraints to simulate a
subtyping relation via unification. This yields an awkward formalization and
results in a type system whose behaviour is in some cases unintuitive and/or
unduly restrictive. In this work, we present an alternative formalization of
poly-morphic variants, based on set-theoretic types and subtyping, that yields
a cleaner and more streamlined system. Our formalization is more expressive
than the current one (it types more programs while preserving type safety), it
can internalize some meta-theoretic properties, and it removes some
pathological cases of the current implementation resulting in a more intuitive
and, thus, predictable type system. More generally, this work shows how to add
full-fledged union types to functional languages of the ML family that usually
rely on the Hindley-Milner type system. As an aside, our system also improves
the theory of semantic subtyping, notably by proving completeness for the type
reconstruction algorithm.

 <dc:description>  The packing chromatic number $\chi$ $\rho$ (G) of an undirected (resp.
oriented) graph G is the smallest integer k such that its set of vertices V (G)
can be partitioned into k disjoint subsets V 1,..., V k, in such a way that
every two distinct vertices in V i are at distance (resp. directed distance)
greater than i in G for every i, 1 $\le$ i $\le$ k. The generalized theta graph
$\Theta$ {\ell} 1,...,{\ell}p consists in two end-vertices joined by p $\ge$ 2
internally vertex-disjoint paths with respective lengths 1 $\le$ {\ell} 1 $\le$
. . . $\le$ {\ell} p. We prove that the packing chromatic number of any
undirected generalized theta graph lies between 3 and max{5, n 3 + 2}, where n
3 = |{i / 1 $\le$ i $\le$ p, {\ell} i = 3}|, and that both these bounds are
tight. We then characterize undirected generalized theta graphs with packing
chromatic number k for every k $\ge$ 3. We also prove that the packing
chromatic number of any oriented generalized theta graph lies between 2 and 5
and that both these bounds are tight.

 <dc:description>  Dynamical systems with large state-spaces are often expensive to thoroughly
explore experimentally. Coarse-graining methods aim to define simpler systems
which are more amenable to analysis and exploration; most current methods,
however, focus on a priori state aggregation based on similarities in
transition rates, which is not necessarily reflected in similar behaviours at
the level of trajectories. We propose a way to coarsen the state-space of a
system which optimally preserves the satisfaction of a set of logical
specifications about the system's trajectories. Our approach is based on
Gaussian Process emulation and Multi-Dimensional Scaling, a dimensionality
reduction technique which optimally preserves distances in non-Euclidean
spaces. We show how to obtain low-dimensional visualisations of the system's
state-space from the perspective of properties' satisfaction, and how to define
macro-states which behave coherently with respect to the specifications. Our
approach is illustrated on a non-trivial running example, showing promising
performance and high computational efficiency.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a new prototype-based clustering method named Evidential
C-Medoids (ECMdd), which belongs to the family of medoid-based clustering for
proximity data, is proposed as an extension of Fuzzy C-Medoids (FCMdd) on the
theoretical framework of belief functions. In the application of FCMdd and
original ECMdd, a single medoid (prototype), which is supposed to belong to the
object set, is utilized to represent one class. For the sake of clarity, this
kind of ECMdd using a single medoid is denoted by sECMdd. In real clustering
applications, using only one pattern to capture or interpret a class may not
adequately model different types of group structure and hence limits the
clustering performance. In order to address this problem, a variation of ECMdd
using multiple weighted medoids, denoted by wECMdd, is presented. Unlike
sECMdd, in wECMdd objects in each cluster carry various weights describing
their degree of representativeness for that class. This mechanism enables each
class to be represented by more than one object. Experimental results in
synthetic and real data sets clearly demonstrate the superiority of sECMdd and
wECMdd. Moreover, the clustering results by wECMdd can provide richer
information for the inner structure of the detected classes with the help of
prototype weights.

 <dc:title>The belief noisy-or model applied to network reliability analysis</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  One difficulty faced in knowledge engineering for Bayesian Network (BN) is
the quan-tification step where the Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) are
determined. The number of parameters included in CPTs increases exponentially
with the number of parent variables. The most common solution is the
application of the so-called canonical gates. The Noisy-OR (NOR) gate, which
takes advantage of the independence of causal interactions, provides a
logarithmic reduction of the number of parameters required to specify a CPT. In
this paper, an extension of NOR model based on the theory of belief functions,
named Belief Noisy-OR (BNOR), is proposed. BNOR is capable of dealing with both
aleatory and epistemic uncertainty of the network. Compared with NOR, more rich
information which is of great value for making decisions can be got when the
available knowledge is uncertain. Specially, when there is no epistemic
uncertainty, BNOR degrades into NOR. Additionally, different structures of BNOR
are presented in this paper in order to meet various needs of engineers. The
application of BNOR model on the reliability evaluation problem of networked
systems demonstrates its effectiveness.

 <dc:title>From Mechatronic Components to Industrial Automation Things - An IoT
  model for cyber-physical manufacturing systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thramboulidis, Kleanthis</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Foradis, Theodoros</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  IoT is considered as one of the key enabling technologies for the fourth
industrial revolution, that is known as Industry 4.0. In this paper, we
consider the mechatronic component as the lowest level in the system
composition hierarchy that tightly integrates mechanics with the electronics
and software required to convert the mechanics to intelligent (smart) object
offering well defined services to its environment. For this mechatronic
component to be integrated in the IoT-based industrial automation environment,
a software layer is required on top of it to convert its conventional interface
to an IoT compliant one. This layer, that we call IoTwrapper, transforms the
conventional mechatronic component to an Industrial Automation Thing (IAT). The
IAT is the key element of an IoT model specifically developed in the context of
this work for the manufacturing domain. The model is compared to existing IoT
models and its main differences are discussed. A model-to-model transformer is
presented to automatically transform the legacy mechatronic component to an IAT
ready to be integrated in the IoT-based industrial automation environment. The
UML4IoT profile is used in the form of a Domain Specific Modeling Language to
automate this transformation. A prototype implementation of an Industrial
Automation Thing using C and the Contiki operating system demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:title>Concurrent Remote Entanglement with Quantum Error Correction</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Remote entanglement of distant, non-interacting quantum entities is a key
primitive for quantum information processing. We present a new protocol to
remotely entangle two stationary qubits by first entangling them with
propagating ancilla qubits and then performing a joint two-qubit measurement on
the ancillas. Subsequently, single-qubit measurements are performed on each of
the ancillas. We describe two continuous variable implementations of the
protocol using propagating microwave modes. The first implementation uses
propagating Schr$\rm{\ddot{o}}$dinger cat-states as the flying ancilla qubits,
a joint-photon-number-modulo-2 measurement of the propagating modes for the
two-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final single-qubit
measurements. The presence of inefficiencies in realistic quantum systems limit
the success-rate of generating high fidelity Bell-states. This motivates us to
propose a second continuous variable implementation, where we use quantum error
correction to suppress the decoherence due to photon loss to first order. To
that end, we encode the ancilla qubits in superpositions of Schr\&quot;odinger cat
states of a given photon-number-parity, use a joint-photon-number-modulo-4
measurement as the two-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final
single-qubit measurements. We demonstrate the resilience of our
quantum-error-correcting remote entanglement scheme to imperfections. Further,
we describe a modification of our error-correcting scheme by incorporating
additional individual photon-number-modulo-2 measurements of the ancilla modes
to improve the success-rate of generating high-fidelity Bell-states. Our
protocols can be straightforwardly implemented in state-of-the-art
superconducting circuit-QED systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports applications of Difference of Convex functions (DC)
programming to Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) with expert data. This is made possible because the norm of the Optimal
Bellman Residual (OBR), which is at the heart of many RL and LfD algorithms, is
DC. Improvement in performance is demonstrated on two specific algorithms,
namely Reward-regularized Classification for Apprenticeship Learning (RCAL) and
Reinforcement Learning with Expert Demonstrations (RLED), through experiments
on generic Markov Decision Processes (MDP), called Garnets.

 <dc:description>  We present an eigenspectrum partitioning scheme without inversion for the
recently described real-space electronic transport code, TRANSEC. The primary
advantage of TRANSEC is its highly parallel algorithm, which enables studying
conductance in large systems. The present scheme adds a new source of
parallelization, significantly enhancing TRANSEC's parallel scalability,
especially for systems with many electrons. In principle, partitioning could
enable super-linear parallel speedup, as we demonstrate in calculations within
TRANSEC. In practical cases, we report better than five-fold improvement in CPU
time and similar improvements in wall time, compared to previously-published
large calculations. Importantly, the suggested scheme is relatively simple to
implement. It can be useful for general large Hermitian or weakly non-Hermitian
eigenvalue problems, whenever relatively accurate inversion via direct or
iterative linear solvers is impractical.

 <dc:description>  The success of kernel methods has initiated the design of novel positive
semidefinite functions, in particular for structured data. A leading design
paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured
objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels,
in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can
provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal
assignments yield indefinite functions, which complicates their use in kernel
methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that
guarantees positive semidefinite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels
give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed
in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing
the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high
classification accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the
original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.

 <dc:title>Using Neural Generative Models to Release Synthetic Twitter Corpora with

 <dc:description>  We present a method for generating synthetic versions of Twitter data using
neural generative models. The goal is to protect individuals in the source data
from stylometric re-identification attacks while still releasing data that
carries research value. To generate tweet corpora that maintain user-level word
distributions, our proposed approach augments powerful neural language models
with local parameters that weight user-specific inputs. We compare our work to
two standard text data protection methods: redaction and iterative translation.
We evaluate the three methods on risk and utility. We define risk following the
stylometric models of re-identification, and we define utility based on two
general language measures and two common text analysis tasks. We find that
neural models are able to significantly lower risk over previous methods at the
cost of some utility. More importantly, we show that the risk utility trade-off
depends on how the neural model's logits (or the unscaled pre-activation values
of the output layer) are scaled. This work presents promising results for a new
tool addressing the problem of privacy for free text and sharing social media
data in a way that respects privacy and is ethically responsible.

 <dc:title>Robust Ensemble Clustering Using Probability Trajectories</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Although many successful ensemble clustering approaches have been developed
in recent years, there are still two limitations to most of the existing
approaches. First, they mostly overlook the issue of uncertain links, which may
mislead the overall consensus process. Second, they generally lack the ability
to incorporate global information to refine the local links. To address these
two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach
based on sparse graph representation and probability trajectory analysis. In
particular, we present the elite neighbor selection strategy to identify the
uncertain links by locally adaptive thresholds and build a sparse graph with a
small number of probably reliable links. We argue that a small number of
probably reliable links can lead to significantly better consensus results than
using all graph links regardless of their reliability. The random walk process
driven by a new transition probability matrix is utilized to explore the global
information in the graph. We derive a novel and dense similarity measure from
the sparse graph by analyzing the probability trajectories of the random
walkers, based on which two consensus functions are further proposed.
Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Various treebanks have been released for dependency parsing. Despite that
treebanks may belong to different languages or have different annotation
schemes, they contain syntactic knowledge that is potential to benefit each
other. This paper presents an universal framework for exploiting these
multi-typed treebanks to improve parsing with deep multi-task learning. We
consider two kinds of treebanks as source: the multilingual universal treebanks
and the monolingual heterogeneous treebanks. Multiple treebanks are trained
jointly and interacted with multi-level parameter sharing. Experiments on
several benchmark datasets in various languages demonstrate that our approach
can make effective use of arbitrary source treebanks to improve target parsing
models.

 <dc:description>  A model of associative memory is studied, which stores and reliably retrieves
many more patterns than the number of neurons in the network. We propose a
simple duality between this dense associative memory and neural networks
commonly used in deep learning. On the associative memory side of this duality,
a family of models that smoothly interpolates between two limiting cases can be
constructed. One limit is referred to as the feature-matching mode of pattern
recognition, and the other one as the prototype regime. On the deep learning
side of the duality, this family corresponds to feedforward neural networks
with one hidden layer and various activation functions, which transmit the
activities of the visible neurons to the hidden layer. This family of
activation functions includes logistics, rectified linear units, and rectified
polynomials of higher degrees. The proposed duality makes it possible to apply
energy-based intuition from associative memory to analyze computational
properties of neural networks with unusual activation functions - the higher
rectified polynomials which until now have not been used in deep learning. The
utility of the dense memories is illustrated for two test cases: the logical
gate XOR and the recognition of handwritten digits from the MNIST data set.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art in
supervised learning vision tasks. Their convolutional filters are of paramount
importance for they allow to learn patterns while disregarding their locations
in input images. When facing highly irregular domains, generalized
convolutional operators based on an underlying graph structure have been
proposed. However, these operators do not exactly match standard ones on grid
graphs, and introduce unwanted additional invariance (e.g. with regards to
rotations). We propose a novel approach to generalize CNNs to irregular domains
using weight sharing and graph-based operators. Using experiments, we show that
these models resemble CNNs on regular domains and offer better performance than
multilayer perceptrons on distorded ones.

 <dc:title>How Deep is the Feature Analysis underlying Rapid Visual Categorization?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Eberhardt, Sven</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  Rapid categorization paradigms have a long history in experimental
psychology: Characterized by short presentation times and speedy behavioral
responses, these tasks highlight the efficiency with which our visual system
processes natural object categories. Previous studies have shown that
feed-forward hierarchical models of the visual cortex provide a good fit to
human visual decisions. At the same time, recent work in computer vision has
demonstrated significant gains in object recognition accuracy with increasingly
deep hierarchical architectures. But it is unclear how well these models
account for human visual decisions and what they may reveal about the
underlying brain processes.
  We have conducted a large-scale psychophysics study to assess the correlation
between computational models and human participants on a rapid animal vs.
non-animal categorization task. We considered visual representations of varying
complexity by analyzing the output of different stages of processing in three
state-of-the-art deep networks. We found that recognition accuracy increases
with higher stages of visual processing (higher level stages indeed
outperforming human participants on the same task) but that human decisions
agree best with predictions from intermediate stages.
  Overall, these results suggest that human participants may rely on visual
features of intermediate complexity and that the complexity of visual
representations afforded by modern deep network models may exceed those used by
human participants during rapid categorization.

 <dc:title>Leveraging Evolution Dynamics to Generate Benchmark Complex Networks

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  The past decade has seen tremendous growth in the field of Complex Social
Networks. Several network generation models have been extensively studied to
develop an understanding of how real world networks evolve over time. Two
important applications of these models are to study the evolution dynamics and
processes that shape a network, and to generate benchmark networks with known
community structures. Research has been conducted in both these directions,
relatively independent of the other. This creates a disjunct between real world
networks and the networks generated as benchmarks to study community detection
algorithms.
  In this paper, we propose to study both these application areas together. We
introduce a network generation model which is based on evolution dynamics of
real world networks and, it can generate networks with community structures
that can be used as benchmark graphs. We study the behaviour of different
community detection algorithms based on the proposed model and compare it with
other models to generate benchmark graphs. Results suggest that the proposed
model can generate networks which are not only structurally similar to real
world networks but can be used to generate networks with varying community
sizes and topologies.

 <dc:title>Infant directed speech is consistent with teaching</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Infant-directed speech (IDS) has distinctive properties that differ from
adult-directed speech (ADS). Why it has these properties -- and whether they
are intended to facilitate language learning -- is matter of contention. We
argue that much of this disagreement stems from lack of a formal, guiding
theory of how phonetic categories should best be taught to infant-like
learners. In the absence of such a theory, researchers have relied on
intuitions about learning to guide the argument. We use a formal theory of
teaching, validated through experiments in other domains, as the basis for a
detailed analysis of whether IDS is well-designed for teaching phonetic
categories. Using the theory, we generate ideal data for teaching phonetic
categories in English. We qualitatively compare the simulated teaching data
with human IDS, finding that the teaching data exhibit many features of IDS,
including some that have been taken as evidence IDS is not for teaching. The
simulated data reveal potential pitfalls for experimentalists exploring the
role of IDS in language learning. Focusing on different formants and phoneme
sets leads to different conclusions, and the benefit of the teaching data to
learners is not apparent until a sufficient number of examples have been
provided. Finally, we investigate transfer of IDS to learning ADS. The teaching
data improves classification of ADS data, but only for the learner they were
generated to teach; not universally across all classes of learner. This
research offers a theoretically-grounded framework that empowers
experimentalists to systematically evaluate whether IDS is for teaching.

 <dc:title>Reinforcement Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Indoor Scenes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Future advancements in robot autonomy and sophistication of robotics tasks
rest on robust, efficient, and task-dependent semantic understanding of the
environment. Semantic segmentation is the problem of simultaneous segmentation
and categorization of a partition of sensory data. The majority of current
approaches tackle this using multi-class segmentation and labeling in a
Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework or by generating multiple object
hypotheses and combining them sequentially. In practical settings, the subset
of semantic labels that are needed depend on the task and particular scene and
labelling every single pixel is not always necessary. We pursue these
observations in developing a more modular and flexible approach to multi-class
parsing of RGBD data based on learning strategies for combining independent
binary object-vs-background segmentations in place of the usual monolithic
multi-label CRF approach. Parameters for the independent binary segmentation
models can be learned very efficiently, and the combination strategy---learned
using reinforcement learning---can be set independently and can vary over
different tasks and environments. Accuracy is comparable to state-of-art
methods on a subset of the NYU-V2 dataset of indoor scenes, while providing
additional flexibility and modularity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate a distributed learning scheme for a broad class
of stochastic optimization problems and games that arise in signal processing
and wireless communications. The proposed algorithm relies on the method of
matrix exponential learning (MXL) and only requires locally computable gradient
observations that are possibly imperfect and/or obsolete. To analyze it, we
introduce the notion of a stable Nash equilibrium and we show that the
algorithm is globally convergent to such equilibria - or locally convergent
when an equilibrium is only locally stable. We also derive an explicit linear
bound for the algorithm's convergence speed, which remains valid under
measurement errors and uncertainty of arbitrarily high variance. To validate
our theoretical analysis, we test the algorithm in realistic
multi-carrier/multiple-antenna wireless scenarios where several users seek to
maximize their energy efficiency. Our results show that learning allows users
to attain a net increase between 100% and 500% in energy efficiency, even under
very high uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  The complexity and decidability of various decision problems involving the
shuffle operation are studied. The following three problems are all shown to be
$NP$-complete: given a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) $M$, and two
words $u$ and $v$, is $L(M)$ not a subset of $u$ shuffled with $v$, is $u$
shuffled with $v$ not a subset of $L(M)$, and is $L(M)$ not equal to $u$
shuffled with $v$? It is also shown that there is a polynomial-time algorithm
to determine, for $NFA$s $M_1, M_2$ and a deterministic pushdown automaton
$M_3$, whether $L(M_1)$ shuffled with $L(M_2)$ is a subset of $L(M_3)$. The
same is true when $M_1, M_2,M_3$ are one-way nondeterministic
$l$-reversal-bounded $k$-counter machines, with $M_3$ being deterministic.
Other decidability and complexity results are presented for testing whether
given languages $L_1, L_2$ and $R$ from various languages families satisfy
$L_1$ shuffled with $L_2$ is a subset of $R$, and $R$ is a subset of $L_1$
shuffled with $L_2$. Several closure results on shuffle are also shown.

 <dc:title>The complexity of reverse engineering problems for conjunctive queries</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Reverse engineering problems for conjunctive queries (CQs), such as query by
example (QBE) or definability, take a set of user examples and convert them
into an explanatory CQ. Despite their importance, the complexity of these
problems is prohibitively high (coNEXPTIME-complete). We isolate their two main
sources of complexity and propose relaxations of them that reduce the
complexity while having meaningful theoretical interpretations. The first
relaxation is based on the idea of using existential pebble games for
approximating homomorphism tests. We show that this characterizes
QBE/definability for CQs up to treewidth $k$, while reducing the complexity to
EXPTIME. As a side result, we obtain that the complexity of the
QBE/definability problems for CQs of treewidth $k$ is EXPTIME-complete for each
$k \geq 1$. The second relaxation is based on the idea of &quot;desynchronizing&quot;
direct products, which characterizes QBE/definability for unions of CQs and
reduces the complexity to coNP. The combination of these two relaxations yields
tractability for QBE and characterizes it in terms of unions of CQs of
treewidth at most $k$. We also study the complexity of these problems for
conjunctive regular path queries over graph databases, showing them to be no
more difficult than for CQs.

 <dc:description>  Recently, with the availability of various traffic datasets, human mobility
has been studied in different contexts. Researchers attempt to understand the
collective behaviors of human movement with respect to the spatio-temporal
distribution in traffic dynamics, from which a gravitational scaling law
characterizing the relation between the traffic flow, population and distance
has been found. However, most studies focus on the integrated properties of
gravitational scaling, neglecting its dynamical evolution during different
hours of a day. Investigating the hourly traffic flow data of Beijing subway
network, based on the hop-count distance of passengers, we find that the
scaling exponent of the gravitational law is smaller in Beijing subway system
compared to that reported in Seoul subway system. This means that traffic
demand in Beijing is much stronger and less sensitive to the travel distance.
Furthermore, we analyzed the temporal evolution of the scaling exponents in
weekdays and weekends. Our findings may help to understand and improve the
traffic congestion control in different subway systems.

 <dc:description>  Authorship analysis (AA) is the study of unveiling the hidden properties of
authors from a body of exponentially exploding textual data. It extracts an
author's identity and sociolinguistic characteristics based on the reflected
writing styles in the text. It is an essential process for various areas, such
as cybercrime investigation, psycholinguistics, political socialization, etc.
However, most of the previous techniques critically depend on the manual
feature engineering process. Consequently, the choice of feature set has been
shown to be scenario- or dataset-dependent. In this paper, to mimic the human
sentence composition process using a neural network approach, we propose to
incorporate different categories of linguistic features into distributed
representation of words in order to learn simultaneously the writing style
representations based on unlabeled texts for authorship analysis. In
particular, the proposed models allow topical, lexical, syntactical, and
character-level feature vectors of each document to be extracted as
stylometrics. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problems of
authorship characterization and authorship verification with the Twitter,
novel, and essay datasets. The experiments suggest that our proposed text
representation outperforms the bag-of-lexical-n-grams, Latent Dirichlet
Allocation, Latent Semantic Analysis, PVDM, PVDBOW, and word2vec
representations.

 <dc:title>Grid-like structure is optimal for path integration</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Grid cells in medial entorhinal cortex are believed to play a key role in
path integration. However, the relation between path integration and the
grid-like arrangement of their firing field remains unclear. We provide
theoretical evidence that grid-like structure and path integration are closely
related. In one dimension, the grid-like structure provides the optimal
solution for path integration assuming that the noise correlation structure is
Gaussian. In two dimensions, assuming that the noise is Gaussian, rectangular
grid-like structure is the optimal solution provided that 1- both noise
correlation and receptive field structures of the neurons can be
multiplicatively decomposed into orthogonal components and 2- the eigenvalues
of the decomposed correlation matrices decrease faster than the square of the
frequency of the corresponding eigenvectors. We will also address the decoding
mechanism and show that the problem of decoding reduces to the problem of
extracting task relevant information in the presence of task irrelevant
information. Change-based Population Coding provides the optimal solution for
this problem.

 <dc:title>BES with FEM: Building Energy Simulation using Finite Element Methods</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>van Schijndel, A. W. M.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An overall objective of energy efficiency in the built environment is to
improve building and systems performances in terms of durability, comfort and
economics. In order to predict, improve and meet a certain set of performance
requirements related to the indoor climate of buildings and the associated
energy demand, building energy simulation (BES) tools are indispensable. Due to
the rapid development of FEM software and the Multiphysics approaches, it
should possible to build and simulate full 3D models of buildings regarding the
energy demand. The paper presents a methodology for performing building energy
simulation with Comsol. The method was applied to an international test box
experiment. The results showed an almost perfect agreement between the used BES
model and Comsol. These preliminary results confirm the great opportunities to
use FEM related software for building energy performance simulation.

 <dc:description>  The Schatten-p quasi-norm $(0&lt;p&lt;1)$ is usually used to replace the standard
nuclear norm in order to approximate the rank function more accurately.
However, existing Schatten-p quasi-norm minimization algorithms involve
singular value decomposition (SVD) or eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) in each
iteration, and thus may become very slow and impractical for large-scale
problems. In this paper, we first define two tractable Schatten quasi-norms,
i.e., the Frobenius/nuclear hybrid and bi-nuclear quasi-norms, and then prove
that they are in essence the Schatten-2/3 and 1/2 quasi-norms, respectively,
which lead to the design of very efficient algorithms that only need to update
two much smaller factor matrices. We also design two efficient proximal
alternating linearized minimization algorithms for solving representative
matrix completion problems. Finally, we provide the global convergence and
performance guarantees for our algorithms, which have better convergence
properties than existing algorithms. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world data show that our algorithms are more accurate than the
state-of-the-art methods, and are orders of magnitude faster.

 <dc:title>Noise Response Data Reveal Novel Controllability Gramian for Nonlinear
  Network Dynamics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Control of nonlinear large-scale dynamical networks, e.g., collective
behavior of agents interacting via a scale-free connection topology, is a
central problem in many scientific and engineering fields. For the linear
version of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an
important role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable
by a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the
controllability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs
distribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental
noise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated
with randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This
fact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract
effectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In
addition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between
controllability and statistical mechanics.

 <dc:title>Minimizing Regret on Reflexive Banach Spaces and Learning Nash

 <dc:description>  We study a general version of the adversarial online learning problem. We are
given a decision set $\mathcal{X}$ in a reflexive Banach space $X$ and a
sequence of reward vectors in the dual space of $X$. At each iteration, we
choose an action from $\mathcal{X}$, based on the observed sequence of previous
rewards. Our goal is to minimize regret, defined as the gap between the
realized reward and the reward of the best fixed action in hindsight. Using
results from infinite dimensional convex analysis, we generalize the method of
Dual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain
general upper bounds on the worst-case regret that subsume a wide range of
results from the literature. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous
rewards, we obtain explicit anytime regret bounds in a setting where the
decision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space
$S$ whose Radon-Nikodym derivatives are elements of $L^p(S)$ for some $p &gt; 1$.
Importantly, we make no convexity assumptions on either the set $S$ or the
reward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret
for any online algorithm. We then apply these results to the problem of
learning in repeated continuous two-player zero-sum games, in which players'
strategy sets are compact metric spaces. In doing so, we first prove that if
both players play a Hannan-consistent strategy, then with probability 1 the
empirical distributions of play weakly converge to the set of Nash equilibria
of the game. We then show that, under mild assumptions, Dual Averaging on the
(infinite-dimensional) space of probability distributions indeed achieves
Hannan-consistency. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical
examples.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a model for end-to-end learning of task-oriented dialog
systems. The main component of the model is a recurrent neural network (an
LSTM), which maps from raw dialog history directly to a distribution over
system actions. The LSTM automatically infers a representation of dialog
history, which relieves the system developer of much of the manual feature
engineering of dialog state. In addition, the developer can provide software
that expresses business rules and provides access to programmatic APIs,
enabling the LSTM to take actions in the real world on behalf of the user. The
LSTM can be optimized using supervised learning (SL), where a domain expert
provides example dialogs which the LSTM should imitate; or using reinforcement
learning (RL), where the system improves by interacting directly with end
users. Experiments show that SL and RL are complementary: SL alone can derive a
reasonable initial policy from a small number of training dialogs; and starting
RL optimization with a policy trained with SL substantially accelerates the
learning rate of RL.

 <dc:description>  Conventional graph-based dependency parsers guarantee a tree structure both
during training and inference. Instead, we formalize dependency parsing as the
problem of independently selecting the head of each word in a sentence. Our
model which we call \textsc{DeNSe} (as shorthand for {\bf De}pendency {\bf
N}eural {\bf Se}lection) produces a distribution over possible heads for each
word using features obtained from a bidirectional recurrent neural network.
Without enforcing structural constraints during training, \textsc{DeNSe}
generates (at inference time) trees for the overwhelming majority of sentences,
while non-tree outputs can be adjusted with a maximum spanning tree algorithm.
We evaluate \textsc{DeNSe} on four languages (English, Chinese, Czech, and
German) with varying degrees of non-projectivity. Despite the simplicity of the
approach, our parsers are on par with the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we take a state-of-the-art model for distributed word
representation that explicitly factorizes the positive pointwise mutual
information (PPMI) matrix using window sampling and negative sampling and
address two of its shortcomings. We improve syntactic performance by using
positional contexts, and solve the need to store the PPMI matrix in memory by
working on aggregate data in external memory. The effectiveness of both
modifications is shown using word similarity and analogy tasks.

 <dc:title>Statistical Pattern Recognition for Driving Styles Based on Bayesian

 <dc:description>  Driving styles have a great influence on vehicle fuel economy, active safety,
and drivability. To recognize driving styles of path-tracking behaviors for
different divers, a statistical pattern-recognition method is developed to deal
with the uncertainty of driving styles or characteristics based on probability
density estimation. First, to describe driver path-tracking styles, vehicle
speed and throttle opening are selected as the discriminative parameters, and a
conditional kernel density function of vehicle speed and throttle opening is
built, respectively, to describe the uncertainty and probability of two
representative driving styles, e.g., aggressive and normal. Meanwhile, a
posterior probability of each element in feature vector is obtained using full
Bayesian theory. Second, a Euclidean distance method is involved to decide to
which class the driver should be subject instead of calculating the complex
covariance between every two elements of feature vectors. By comparing the
Euclidean distance between every elements in feature vector, driving styles are
classified into seven levels ranging from low normal to high aggressive.
Subsequently, to show benefits of the proposed pattern-recognition method, a
cross-validated method is used, compared with a fuzzy logic-based
pattern-recognition method. The experiment results show that the proposed
statistical pattern-recognition method for driving styles based on kernel
density estimation is more efficient and stable than the fuzzy logic-based
method.

 <dc:description>  Gatys et al. (2015) showed that pair-wise products of features in a
convolutional network are a very effective representation of image textures. We
propose a simple modification to that representation which makes it possible to
incorporate long-range structure into image generation, and to render images
that satisfy various symmetry constraints. We show how this can greatly improve
rendering of regular textures and of images that contain other kinds of
symmetric structure. We also present applications to inpainting and season
transfer.

 <dc:description>  While a number of excellent review articles on military robots have appeared
in existing literature, this paper focuses on a distinct sub-space of related
problems: small military robots organized into moderately sized squads,
operating in a ground combat environment. Specifically, we consider the
following: - Command of practical small robots, comparable to current
generation, small unmanned ground vehicles (e.g., PackBots) with limited
computing and sensor payload, as opposed to larger vehicle-sized robots or
micro-scale robots; - Utilization of moderately sized practical forces of 3-10
robots applicable to currently envisioned military ground operations; - Complex
three-dimensional physical environments, such as urban areas or mountainous
terrains and the inherent difficulties they impose, including limited and
variable fields of observation, difficult navigation, and intermittent
communication; - Adversarial environments where the active, intelligent enemy
is the key consideration in determining the behavior of the robotic force; and
- Purposeful, partly autonomous, coordinated behaviors that are necessary for
such a robotic force to survive and complete missions; these are far more
complex than, for example, formation control or field coverage behavior.

 <dc:description>  A Frontal-Delaunay refinement algorithm for mesh generation in piecewise
smooth domains is described. Built using a restricted Delaunay framework, this
new algorithm combines a number of novel features, including: (i) an
unweighted, conforming restricted Delaunay representation for domains specified
as a (non-manifold) collection of piecewise smooth surface patches and curve
segments, (ii) a protection strategy for domains containing curve segments that
subtend sharply acute angles, and (iii) a new class of off-centre refinement
rules designed to achieve high-quality point-placement along embedded curve
features. Experimental comparisons show that the new Frontal-Delaunay algorithm
outperforms a classical (statically weighted) restricted Delaunay-refinement
technique for a number of three-dimensional benchmark problems.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a neural conversation model for conducting
dialogues. We demonstrate the use of this model to generate help desk
responses, where users are asking questions about PC applications. Our model is
distinguished by two characteristics. First, it models intention across turns
with a recurrent network, and incorporates an attention model that is
conditioned on the representation of intention. Secondly, it avoids generating
non-specific responses by incorporating an IDF term in the objective function.
The model is evaluated both as a pure generation model in which a help-desk
response is generated from scratch, and as a retrieval model with performance
measured using recall rates of the correct response. Experimental results
indicate that the model outperforms previously proposed neural conversation
architectures, and that using specificity in the objective function
significantly improves performances for both generation and retrieval.

 <dc:description>  Weighted $\ell_1$-minimization has been studied as a technique for the
reconstruction of a sparse signal from compressively sampled measurements when
prior information about the signal, in the form of a support estimate, is
available. In this work, we study the recovery conditions and the associated
recovery guarantees of weighted $\ell_1$-minimization when arbitrarily many
distinct weights are permitted. For example, such a setup might be used when
one has multiple estimates for the support of a signal, and these estimates
have varying degrees of accuracy. Our analysis yields an extension to existing
works that assume only a single support estimate set upon which a constant
weight is applied. We include numerical experiments, with both synthetic
signals and real video data, that demonstrate the benefits of allowing
non-uniform weights in the reconstruction procedure.

 <dc:description>  Given an image, we wish to produce an image of larger size with significantly
more pixels and higher image quality. This is generally known as the Single
Image Super-Resolution (SISR) problem. The idea is that with sufficient
training data (corresponding pairs of low and high resolution images) we can
learn set of filters (i.e. a mapping) that when applied to given image that is
not in the training set, will produce a higher resolution version of it, where
the learning is preferably low complexity. In our proposed approach, the
run-time is more than one to two orders of magnitude faster than the best
competing methods currently available, while producing results comparable or
better than state-of-the-art.
  A closely related topic is image sharpening and contrast enhancement, i.e.,
improving the visual quality of a blurry image by amplifying the underlying
details (a wide range of frequencies). Our approach additionally includes an
extremely efficient way to produce an image that is significantly sharper than
the input blurry one, without introducing artifacts such as halos and noise
amplification. We illustrate how this effective sharpening algorithm, in
addition to being of independent interest, can be used as a pre-processing step
to induce the learning of more effective upscaling filters with built-in
sharpening and contrast enhancement effect.

 <dc:description>  We propose zoneout, a novel method for regularizing RNNs. At each timestep,
zoneout stochastically forces some hidden units to maintain their previous
values. Like dropout, zoneout uses random noise to train a pseudo-ensemble,
improving generalization. But by preserving instead of dropping hidden units,
gradient information and state information are more readily propagated through
time, as in feedforward stochastic depth networks. We perform an empirical
investigation of various RNN regularizers, and find that zoneout gives
significant performance improvements across tasks. We achieve competitive
results with relatively simple models in character- and word-level language
modelling on the Penn Treebank and Text8 datasets, and combining with recurrent
batch normalization yields state-of-the-art results on permuted sequential
MNIST.

 <dc:description>  We consider a class of probabilistic grammars for generating scenes with
multiple objects. Probabilistic scene grammars capture relationships between
objects using compositional rules that provide important contextual cues for
inference with ambiguous data. We show how to represent the distribution
defined by a probabilistic scene grammar using a factor graph. We also show how
to efficiently perform message passing in this factor graph. This leads to an
efficient approach for inference with a grammar model using belief propagation
as the underlying computational engine. Inference with belief propagation
naturally combines bottom-up and top-down contextual information and leads to a
robust algorithm for aggregating evidence. We show experiments on two different
applications to demonstrate the generality of the framework. The first
application involves detecting curves in noisy images, and we address this
problem using a grammar that generates a collection of curves using a
first-order Markov process. The second application involves localizing faces
and parts of faces in images. In this case, we use a grammar that captures
spatial relationships between the parts of a face. In both applications the
same framework leads to robust inference algorithms that can effectively
combine weak local information to reason about a scene.

 <dc:description>  This work presents cost-effective low-rank techniques for designing robust
adaptive beamforming (RAB) algorithms. The proposed algorithms are based on the
exploitation of the cross-correlation between the array observation data and
the output of the beamformer. Firstly, we construct a general linear equation
considered in large dimensions whose solution yields the steering vector
mismatch. Then, we employ the idea of the full orthogonalization method (FOM),
an orthogonal Krylov subspace based method, to iteratively estimate the
steering vector mismatch in a reduced-dimensional subspace, resulting in the
proposed orthogonal Krylov subspace projection mismatch estimation (OKSPME)
method. We also devise adaptive algorithms based on stochastic gradient (SG)
and conjugate gradient (CG) techniques to update the beamforming weights with
low complexity and avoid any costly matrix inversion. The main advantages of
the proposed low-rank and mismatch estimation techniques are their
cost-effectiveness when dealing with high dimension subspaces or large sensor
arrays. Simulations results show excellent performance in terms of the output
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the beamformer among all the
compared RAB methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In wireless cloud storage systems, the recovery failure probability depends
on not only wireless channel conditions but also storage size of each
distributed storage node. For an efficient utilization of limited storage
capacity and the performance characterization of allocation strategies, we
asymptotically analyze the recovery failure probability of a wireless cloud
storage system with a sum storage capacity constraint for both high SNR regime
and low SNR regime. Then, we find the optimal storage allocation strategy
across distributed storage nodes in terms of the asymptotic recovery failure
probability. Our analysis reveals that the maximal symmetric allocation is
optimal for high SNR regime and the minimal allocation (with $\lfloor T\rfloor$
complete storage nodes and an incomplete storage node) is optimal for low SNR
regime, where $T$ is the sum storage capacity. Based on the numerical
investigation, we also show that in intermediate SNR regime, a balance
allocation between the minimal allocation and the maximal symmetric allocation
would not be required if we select one between them according to SNR.

 <dc:description>  We study the projected gradient descent method on low-rank matrix problems
with a strongly convex objective. We use the Burer-Monteiro factorization
approach to implicitly enforce low-rankness; such factorization introduces
non-convexity in the objective. We focus on constraint sets that include both
positive semi-definite (PSD) constraints and specific matrix norm-constraints.
Such criteria appear in quantum state tomography and phase retrieval
applications.
  We show that non-convex projected gradient descent favors local linear
convergence in the factored space. We build our theory on a novel descent
lemma, that non-trivially extends recent results on the unconstrained problem.
The resulting algorithm is Projected Factored Gradient Descent, abbreviated as
ProjFGD, and shows superior performance compared to state of the art on quantum
state tomography and sparse phase retrieval applications.

 <dc:title>Improving Coreference Resolution by Learning Entity-Level Distributed
  Representations</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A long-standing challenge in coreference resolution has been the
incorporation of entity-level information - features defined over clusters of
mentions instead of mention pairs. We present a neural network based
coreference system that produces high-dimensional vector representations for
pairs of coreference clusters. Using these representations, our system learns
when combining clusters is desirable. We train the system with a
learning-to-search algorithm that teaches it which local decisions (cluster
merges) will lead to a high-scoring final coreference partition. The system
substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the English and
Chinese portions of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task dataset despite using few
hand-engineered features.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of optimal location querying for location based services
in road networks, which aims to find locations for new servers or facilities.
The existing optimal solutions on this problem consider only the cases with one
new server. When two or more new servers are to be set up, the problem with
minmax cost criteria, MinMax, becomes NP-hard. In this work we identify some
useful properties about the potential locations for the new servers, from which
we derive a novel algorithm for MinMax, and show that it is efficient when the
number of new servers is small. When the number of new servers is large, we
propose an efficient 3-approximate algorithm. We verify with experiments on
real road networks that our solutions are effective and attains significantly
better result quality compared to the existing greedy algorithms.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we investigate several neural network architectures for
fine-grained entity type classification. Particularly, we consider extensions
to a recently proposed attentive neural architecture and make three key
contributions. Previous work on attentive neural architectures do not consider
hand-crafted features, we combine learnt and hand-crafted features and observe
that they complement each other. Additionally, through quantitative analysis we
establish that the attention mechanism is capable of learning to attend over
syntactic heads and the phrase containing the mention, where both are known
strong hand-crafted features for our task. We enable parameter sharing through
a hierarchical label encoding method, that in low-dimensional projections show
clear clusters for each type hierarchy. Lastly, despite using the same
evaluation dataset, the literature frequently compare models trained using
different data. We establish that the choice of training data has a drastic
impact on performance, with decreases by as much as 9.85% loose micro F1 score
for a previously proposed method. Despite this, our best model achieves
state-of-the-art results with 75.36% loose micro F1 score on the well-
established FIGER (GOLD) dataset.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the recoverable robust spanning tree problem under
interval uncertainty representations. A polynomial time, combinatorial
algorithm for the recoverable spanning tree problem is first constructed. This
problem generalizes the incremental spanning tree problem, previously discussed
in literature. The algorithm built is then applied to solve the recoverable
robust spanning tree problem, under the traditional interval uncertainty
representation, in polynomial time. Moreover, the algorithm allows to obtain,
under some mild assumptions about the uncertainty intervals,several
approximation results for the recoverable robust spanning tree problem under
the Bertsimas and Sim interval uncertainty representation and the interval
uncertainty representation with a budget constraint.

 <dc:description>  We are proud to present the papers from the 17th Refinement Workshop,
co-located with FM 2015 held in Oslo, Norway on June 22nd, 2015.
  Refinement is one of the cornerstones of a formal approach to software
engineering: the process of developing a more detailed design or implementation
from an abstract specification through a sequence of mathematically-based steps
that maintain correctness with respect to the original specification.
  This 17th workshop continued a 20+ year tradition under the auspices of the
British Computer Society (BCS) FACS special interest group.
  This is the third volume that has appeared as an EPTCS proceedings, and we
would like to thank the editorial board (and in particular Rob van Glabbeek)
for their help and cooperation in making this happen.
  The organisers would like to thank everyone: the authors, BCS-FACS, EPTCS,
and the organisers of FM 2015 for their help in organising this workshop, the
participants of the workshop, and the reviewers involved in selecting the
papers.

 <dc:description>  Rubrics are being used in a wide variety of disciplines in higher education
to evaluate assessments and provide feedback to students. Rubrics are
traditionally implemented as paper-based table format to grade assessments and
provide feedback. The advancement of technology has integrated Rubric Tool into
Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Blackboard to facilitate online marking.
In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of Rubric Tool. We propose
an integrated conceptual framework using various theories from extant
literature to assess the effectiveness of Rubric Tool. Further, this framework
has been applied in an undergraduate course at the Asian campus of an
Australian International University. This is a research in progress paper which
adds to the literature on integrating information systems theory, learning
theory, political philosophy and communication theory to examine the
effectiveness of Rubric Tool in student learning.

 <dc:description>  The usage of recommendation agents (RAs) in the online marketplace can help
consumers to locate their desired products. RAs can help consumers effectively
obtain comprehensive product information and compare their candidate target
products. As a result, RAs have affected consumers shopping behaviour. In this
study, we investigate the usage and the influence of RAs in the online
marketplace. Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model, we propose
that the stimulus of using RAs (informativeness, product search effectiveness
and the lack of sociality stress) can affect consumers attitude (perceived
control and satisfaction), which further affects their behavioural outcomes
like impulsive purchase. We validate this research model with survey data from
157 users of RAs. The data largely support the proposed model and indicate that
the RAs can significantly contribute to impulsive purchase behaviour in online
marketplaces. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Social software solutions in enterprises such as IBM Connections are said to
have the potential to support communication and collaboration among employees.
However, companies are faced to manage the adoption of such collaborative tools
and therefore need to raise the employees' acceptance and motivation. To solve
these problems, developers started to implement Gamification elements in social
software tools, which aim to increase users' motivation. In this paper, we
critically examine the status quo of the current market of leading social
software solutions and seek to find out which Gamification approaches are
implementated in these collaborative tools. Our findings show, that most of the
major social collaboration solutions do not offer Gamification features by
default, but leave the integration to a various number of third party plug-in
vendors. Furthermore we identify a trend in which Gamification solutions
majorly focus on rewarding quantitative improvement of work activities,
neglecting qualitative performance. Subsequently, current solutions do not
match recent findings in research and ignore risks that can lower the
employees' motivation and work performance in the long run.

 <dc:title>Implementation of real-time moving horizon estimation for robust air

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents robust fault diagnosis and estimation for the calibrated
airspeed and angle-of-attack sensor faults in the RECONFIGURE benchmark. We
adopt a low-order longitudinal model augmented with wind dynamics. In order to
enhance sensitivity to faults in the presence of winds, we propose a
constrained residual generator by formulating a constrained moving horizon
estimation problem and exploiting the bounds of winds. The moving horizon
estimation problem requires solving a nonlinear program in real time, which is
challenging for flight control computers. This challenge is addressed by
adopting an efficient structure-exploiting algorithm within a real-time
iteration scheme. Specific approximations and simplifications are performed to
enable the implementation of the algorithm using the Airbus graphical symbol
library for industrial validation and verification. The simulation tests on the
RECONFIGURE benchmark over different flight points and maneuvers show the
efficacy of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Disaster Management (DM) is a complex set of interrelated activities. The
activities are often knowledge intensive and time sensitive. Sharing the
required knowledge timely is critical for DM. In developed countries, for
recurring disasters (e.g. floods), there are dedicated document repositories of
Disaster Management Plans (DMP) that can be accessed as needs arise. However,
accessing the appropriate plan in a timely manner and sharing activities
between plans often requires domain knowledge and intimate knowledge of the
plans in the first place. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based knowledge
analysis method to convert DMPs into a collection of knowledge units that can
be stored into a unified repository. The repository of DM actions then enables
the mixing and matching knowledge between different plans. The repository is
structured as a layered abstraction according to Meta Object Facility (MOF). We
use the flood management plans used by SES in NSW to illustrate and give a
preliminary validation of the approach. It is illustrated using DMPs along the
flood prone Murrumbidgee River in central NSW.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing provides an effective business model for the deployment of IT
infrastructure, platform, and software services. Often, facilities are
outsourced to cloud providers and this offers the service consumer
virtualization technologies without the added cost burden of development.
However, virtualization introduces serious threats to service delivery such as
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, Cross-VM Cache Side Channel attacks,
Hypervisor Escape and Hyper-jacking. One of the most sophisticated forms of
attack is the cross-VM cache side channel attack that exploits shared cache
memory between VMs. A cache side channel attack results in side channel data
leakage, such as cryptographic keys. Various techniques used by the attackers
to launch cache side channel attack are presented, as is a critical analysis of
countermeasures against cache side channel attacks.

 <dc:description>  The Australian government, to remind job seekers of appointments with
employment services providers in order to cut costs and free up human
resources, is using technologies such as Short Messaging Services (SMS).
However, the technologies in-use are but one side of this equation the
specifics of how these technologies are used is the other side, and these
specifics are highly under-theorized, particularly in regard to the views of
the people to which these technologies are directed. The purpose of this paper
is to provide a theoretical framing for this phenomenon as well as to introduce
an emerging methodological direction that may allow for a better understanding
of demographic-specific values and thereby better valence framing. The paper
also theorizes reactions to information that could be applicable elsewhere, not
just in e-government or with SMS, thereby contributing to discussions
surrounding the Big Data debate.

 <dc:description>  This study examines a human-based approach for knowledge retention that is
evolving through various knowledge sharing channels in a low-technology
environment with a strong emphasis on social networks in a loosely-coupled
inter-organisational government-industry collaboration focused on regional
sustainability. Using social network analysis combined with interview and
observational analysis, our results show that a combination of close-knit
community ties and group interaction promote the development of strong personal
networks that provide continued access to group memory to retain the groups
knowledge.

 <dc:description>  Virtual environments (VEs) are making their way into various sectors of life
to enhance and support human activity, including learning. VEs have been used
in various contexts for training, and in many cases they are designed to model
or simulate - as accurately and authentically as possible - a specific work
context. In striving for authenticity, visual and representative realism tends
to receive most of the development input, despite of several studies that
challenge its importance. New training avenues have raised the importance of
rigorous phenomenological descriptions for a deeper understanding of user
experience in the actual context of use. This paper reports the preliminary
steps in a phenomenological analysis of how employees working in actual
hazardous settings experience virtual safety training environments. Such
open-ended research project can reveal new aspects of user experience that can
advice the development and evaluation of human-computer interaction in digital
technology-enhanced training contexts.

 <dc:description>  Measurement capabilities are essential for a variety of network applications,
such as load balancing, routing, fairness and intrusion detection. These
capabilities require large counter arrays in order to monitor the traffic of
all network flows. While commodity SRAM memories are capable of operating at
line speed, they are too small to accommodate large counter arrays. Previous
works suggested estimators, which trade precision for reduced space. However,
in order to accurately estimate the largest counter, these methods compromise
the accuracy of the smaller counters. In this work, we present a closed form
representation of the optimal estimation function. We then introduce
Independent Counter Estimation Buckets (ICE-Buckets), a novel algorithm that
improves estimation accuracy for all counters. This is achieved by separating
the flows to buckets and configuring the optimal estimation function according
to each bucket's counter scale. We prove a tighter upper bound on the relative
error and demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to 57 times on real
Internet packet traces.

 <dc:title>Investigation of Audience Interaction Tools from the Perspective of

 <dc:description>  Maintaining engagement of large audiences is not easy. Traditionally,
lectures and presentations rely on one-way communication from the presenter to
the listening audience. Without receiving ongoing feedback, speakers cannot be
sure that their delivery is at an appropriate pace, or that their message is
being received and understood by their audience. This study suggests using a
real-time audience engagement solution (Xorro-Q) to facilitate synchronous
interaction between lecturers and their student audiences. Using activity
theory as a theoretical framework we conducted a study to investigate student
participation and engagement with an audience interaction tool in two
undergraduate computing courses. In one classroom setting, discussion questions
are raised during the class and instant feedback provided to students. In the
second setting, subject related questions were asked near the end of the
lecture to gauge students knowledge of concepts just taught in the class. In
this study quantitative data such as attendance, response rates, and assessment
outcomes were collected to explore how participant engagement varies across
different lecturing techniques. Findings from the study show that continuous
use of audience interaction tools through activity theory based settings is
preferred than merely using tools for assessment purpose in traditional
classroom settings. Although these findings are at a very initial stage, they
give some indication on how real-time audience engagement tools can be
developed within classroom settings for assisting in teaching and learning
practices.

 <dc:title>Modelling Symbolic Music: Beyond the Piano Roll</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Walder, Christian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of probabilistically modelling
symbolic music data. We introduce a representation which reduces polyphonic
music to a univariate categorical sequence. In this way, we are able to apply
state of the art natural language processing techniques, namely the long
short-term memory sequence model. The representation we employ permits
arbitrary rhythmic structure, which we assume to be given. We show that our
model is effective on four out of four piano roll based benchmark datasets. We
further improve our model by augmenting our training data set with
transpositions of the original pieces through all musical keys, thereby
convincingly advancing the state of the art on these benchmark problems. We
also fit models to music which is unconstrained in its rhythmic structure,
discuss the properties of this model, and provide musical samples which are
more sophisticated than previously possible with this class of recurrent neural
network sequence models. We also provide our newly preprocessed data set of non
piano-roll music data.

 <dc:title>Assortment optimisation under a general discrete choice model: A tight
  analysis of revenue-ordered assortments</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The assortment problem in revenue management is the problem of deciding which
subset of products to offer to consumers in order to maximise revenue. A simple
and natural strategy is to select the best assortment out of all those that are
constructed by fixing a threshold revenue $\pi$ and then choosing all products
with revenue at least $\pi$. This is known as the revenue-ordered assortments
strategy. In this paper we study the approximation guarantees provided by
revenue-ordered assortments when customers are rational in the following sense:
the probability of selecting a specific product from the set being offered
cannot increase if the set is enlarged. This rationality assumption, known as
regularity, is satisfied by almost all discrete choice models considered in the
revenue management and choice theory literature, and in particular by random
utility models. The bounds we obtain are tight and improve on recent results in
that direction, such as for the Mixed Multinomial Logit model by
Rusmevichientong et al. (2014). An appealing feature of our analysis is its
simplicity, as it relies only on the regularity condition.
  We also draw a connection between assortment optimisation and two pricing
problems called unit demand envy-free pricing and Stackelberg minimum spanning
tree: These problems can be restated as assortment problems under discrete
choice models satisfying the regularity condition, and moreover revenue-ordered
assortments correspond then to the well-studied uniform pricing heuristic. When
specialised to that setting, the general bounds we establish for
revenue-ordered assortments match and unify the best known results on uniform
pricing.

 <dc:title>Cut-Set Bound Is Loose for Gaussian Relay Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The cut-set bound developed by Cover and El Gamal in 1979 has since remained
the best known upper bound on the capacity of the Gaussian relay channel. We
develop a new upper bound on the capacity of the Gaussian primitive relay
channel which is tighter than the cut-set bound. Our proof is based on
typicality arguments and concentration of Gaussian measure. Combined with a
simple tensorization argument proposed by Courtade and Ozgur in 2015, our
result also implies that the current capacity approximations for Gaussian relay
networks, which have linear gap to the cut-set bound in the number of nodes,
are order-optimal and leads to a lower bound on the pre-constant.

 <dc:description>  We propose an image representation scheme combining the local and nonlocal
characterization of patches in an image. Our representation scheme can be shown
to be equivalent to a tight frame constructed from convolving local bases (e.g.
wavelet frames, discrete cosine transforms, etc.) with nonlocal bases (e.g.
spectral basis induced by nonlinear dimension reduction on patches), and we
call the resulting frame elements {\it convolution framelets}. Insight gained
from analyzing the proposed representation leads to a novel interpretation of a
recent high-performance patch-based image inpainting algorithm using Point
Integral Method (PIM) and Low Dimension Manifold Model (LDMM) [Osher, Shi and
Zhu, 2016]. In particular, we show that LDMM is a weighted
$\ell_2$-regularization on the coefficients obtained by decomposing images into
linear combinations of convolution framelets; based on this understanding, we
extend the original LDMM to a reweighted version that yields further improved
inpainting results. In addition, we establish the energy concentration property
of convolution framelet coefficients for the setting where the local basis is
constructed from a given nonlocal basis via a linear reconstruction framework;
a generalization of this framework to unions of local embeddings can provide a
natural setting for interpreting BM3D, one of the state-of-the-art image
denoising algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Multiscale entropy (MSE) is a widely-used tool to analyze biomedical signals.
It was proposed to overcome the deficiencies of conventional entropy methods
when quantifying the complexity of time series. However, MSE is undefined for
very short signals and slow for real-time applications because of the use of
sample entropy (SampEn). To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce
multiscale dispersion entropy (DisEn - MDE) as a very fast and powerful method
to quantify the complexity of signals. MDE is based on our recently developed
DisEn, which has a computation cost of O(N), compared with O(N2) for SampEn. We
also propose the refined composite MDE (RCMDE) to improve the stability of MDE.
We evaluate MDE, RCMDE, and refined composite MSE (RCMSE) on synthetic signals
and find that these methods have similar behaviors but the MDE and RCMDE are
significantly faster than MSE and RCMSE, respectively. The results also
illustrate that RCMDE is more stable than MDE for short and noisy signals,
which are common in biomedical applications. To evaluate the proposed methods
on real signals, we employ three biomedical datasets, including focal and
non-focal electroencephalograms (EEGs), blood pressure recordings in Fantasia
database, and resting-state EEGs activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
results again demonstrate a similar behavior of RCMSE, MDE and RCMDE, although
the RCMDE and MDE are significantly faster and lead to larger differences
between physiological conditions known to alter the complexity of the
physiological recordings. To sum up, MDE and RCMDE are expected to be useful
for the analysis of physiological signals thanks to their ability to
distinguish different types of dynamics.

 <dc:description>  Real-world multi-agent planning problems cannot be solved using
decision-theoretic planning methods due to the exponential complexity. We
approximate firefighting in rescue simulation as a spatially distributed task
and model with multi-agent Markov decision process. We use recent approximation
methods for spatial task problems to reduce the model complexity. Our
approximations are single-agent, static task, shortest path pruning, dynamic
planning horizon, and task clustering. We create scenarios from RoboCup Rescue
Simulation maps and evaluate our methods on these graph worlds. The results
show that our approach is faster and better than comparable methods and has
negligible performance loss compared to the optimal policy. We also show that
our method has a similar performance as DCOP methods on example RCRS scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes formal specification and verification of Lamport's
Multi-Paxos algorithm for distributed consensus. The specification is written
in TLA+, Lamport's Temporal Logic of Actions. The proof is written and checked
using TLAPS, a proof system for TLA+. Building on Lamport, Merz, and Doligez's
specification and proof for Basic Paxos, we aim to facilitate the understanding
of Multi-Paxos and its proof by minimizing the difference from those for Basic
Paxos, and to demonstrate a general way of proving other variants of Paxos and
other sophisticated distributed algorithms. We also discuss our general
strategies for proving properties about sets and tuples that helped the proof
check succeed in significantly reduced time.

 <dc:description>  Significant performance gains in deep learning coupled with the exponential
growth of image and video data on the Internet have resulted in the recent
emergence of automated image captioning systems. Ensuring scalability of
automated image captioning systems with respect to the ever increasing volume
of image and video data is a significant challenge. This paper provides a
valuable insight in that the detection of a few significant (top) objects in an
image allows one to extract other relevant information such as actions (verbs)
in the image. We expect this insight to be useful in the design of scalable
image captioning systems. We address two parameters by which the scalability of
image captioning systems could be quantified, i.e., the traditional algorithmic
time complexity which is important given the resource limitations of the user
device and the system development time since the programmers' time is a
critical resource constraint in many real-world scenarios. Additionally, we
address the issue of how word embeddings could be used to infer the verb
(action) from the nouns (objects) in a given image in a zero-shot manner. Our
results show that it is possible to attain reasonably good performance on
predicting actions and captioning images using our approaches with the added
advantage of simplicity of implementation.

 <dc:title>Root-finding with Implicit Deflation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pan, Victor Y.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We were initially motivated by the paper [SS17] by Schleicher and Stoll about
initialization of Newton's iterations for univariate polynomial root-finding.
Given a black box subroutine for the evaluation of the Newton's ratio of a
polynomial and its derivative, their algorithm very fast approximates all roots
of a univariate polynomial except for a small fraction of them. The challenge
of fast approximation of the remaining roots motivated our present work, but
our recipes for this task should have much broader independent interest for
implicit deflation in root-finding for univariate or multivariate polynomials,
rational, and analytic functions. These recipes can be also an example of
synergy of the combination of various methods for root-finding towards
enhancing their power, in particular towards faster convergence of functional
iterations in a larger domain.

 <dc:title>Operational Aspects of C/C++ Concurrency</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a family of operational semantics that gradually
approximates the realistic program behaviors in the C/C++11 memory model. Each
semantics in our framework is built by elaborating and combining two simple
ingredients: viewfronts and operation buffers. Viewfronts allow us to express
the spatial aspect of thread interaction, i.e., which values a thread can read,
while operation buffers enable manipulation with the temporal execution aspect,
i.e., determining the order in which the results of certain operations can be
observed by concurrently running threads.
  Starting from a simple abstract state machine, through a series of gradual
refinements of the abstract state, we capture such language aspects and
synchronization primitives as release/acquire atomics, sequentially-consistent
and non-atomic memory accesses, also providing a semantics for relaxed atomics,
while avoiding the Out-of-Thin-Air problem. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first formal and executable operational semantics of C11 capable of
expressing all essential concurrent aspects of the standard.
  We illustrate our approach via a number of characteristic examples, relating
the observed behaviors to those of standard litmus test programs from the
literature. We provide an executable implementation of the semantics in PLT
Redex, along with a number of implemented litmus tests and examples, and
showcase our prototype on a large case study: randomized testing and debugging
of a realistic Read-Copy-Update data structure.

 <dc:description>  Mass-market mobile security threats have increased recently due to the growth
of mobile technologies and the popularity of mobile devices. Accordingly,
techniques have been introduced for identifying, classifying, and defending
against mobile threats utilizing static, dynamic, on-device, off-device, and
hybrid approaches. In this paper, we contribute to the mobile security defense
posture by introducing Andro-profiler, a hybrid behavior based analysis and
classification system for mobile malware. Andro-profiler classifies malware by
exploiting the behavior profiling extracted from the integrated system logs
including system calls, which are implicitly equivalent to distinct behavior
characteristics. Andro-profiler executes a malicious application on an emulator
in order to generate the integrated system logs, and creates human-readable
behavior profiles by analyzing the integrated system logs. By comparing the
behavior profile of malicious application with representative behavior profile
for each malware family, Andro-profiler detects and classifies it into malware
families. The experiment results demonstrate that Andro-profiler is scalable,
performs well in detecting and classifying malware with accuracy greater than
$98\%$, outperforms the existing state-of-the-art work, and is capable of
identifying zero-day mobile malware samples.

 <dc:description>  The ability to reason with natural language is a fundamental prerequisite for
many NLP tasks such as information extraction, machine translation and question
answering. To quantify this ability, systems are commonly tested whether they
can recognize textual entailment, i.e., whether one sentence can be inferred
from another one. However, in most NLP applications only single source
sentences instead of sentence pairs are available. Hence, we propose a new task
that measures how well a model can generate an entailed sentence from a source
sentence. We take entailment-pairs of the Stanford Natural Language Inference
corpus and train an LSTM with attention. On a manually annotated test set we
found that 82% of generated sentences are correct, an improvement of 10.3% over
an LSTM baseline. A qualitative analysis shows that this model is not only
capable of shortening input sentences, but also inferring new statements via
paraphrasing and phrase entailment. We then apply this model recursively to
input-output pairs, thereby generating natural language inference chains that
can be used to automatically construct an entailment graph from source
sentences. Finally, by swapping source and target sentences we can also train a
model that given an input sentence invents additional information to generate a
new sentence.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the search for a counterexample to the Poincar\'e conjecture in
three and four dimensions, the Andrews-Curtis conjecture was proposed in 1965.
It is now generally suspected that the Andrews-Curtis conjecture is false, but
small potential counterexamples are not so numerous, and previous work has
attempted to eliminate some via combinatorial search. Progress has however been
limited, with the most successful approach (breadth-first-search using
secondary storage) being neither scalable nor heuristically-informed. A
previous empirical analysis of problem structure examined several heuristic
measures of search progress and determined that none of them provided any
useful guidance for search. In this article, we induce new quality measures
directly from the problem structure and combine them to produce a more
effective search driver via ensemble machine learning. By this means, we
eliminate 19 potential counterexamples, the status of which had been unknown
for some years.

 <dc:description>  We consider wireless transmission over fading channel powered by energy
harvesting and storage devices. Assuming a finite battery storage capacity, we
design an online power control strategy aiming at maximizing the long-term
time-averaged transmission rate under battery operational constraints for
energy harvesting. We first formulate the stochastic optimization problem, and
then develop techniques to transform this problem and employ techniques from
Lyapunov optimization to design the online power control solution. In
particular, we propose an approach to handle unbounded channel fade which
cannot by directly dealt with by Lyapunov framework. Our proposed algorithm
determines the transmission power based only on the current energy state of the
battery and channel fade conditions,without requiring any knowledge of the
statistics of energy arrivals and fading channels. Our online power control
solution is a three-stage closed-form solution depending on the battery energy
level. It not only provides strategic energy conservation through the battery
energy control, but also reveals an opportunistic transmission style based on
fading condition, both of which improve the long-term time-averaged
transmission rate. We further characterize the performance bound of our
proposed algorithm to the optimal solution with a general fading distribution.
Simulation results demonstrate a significant performance gain of our proposed
online algorithm over alternative online approaches.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the one-dimensional cutting stock problem with divisible
items, which is a new problem in the cutting stock literature. The problem
exists in steel industries. In the new problem, each item can be divided into
smaller pieces, then they can be recombined again by welding. The objective is
to minimize both the trim loss and the number of the welds. We present a
mathematical model and a dynamic programming based heuristic for the problem.
Furthermore, a software, which is based on the proposed heuristic algorithm, is
developed to use in MKA company, and its performance is analyzed by solving
real-life problems in the steel industry. The computational experiments show
the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Given a lower envelope in the form of an arbitrary sequence $u$, let $LSP(u,
d)$ denote the maximum length of any subsequence of $u$ that can be realized as
the lower envelope of a set of polynomials of degree at most $d$. Let $sp(m,
d)$ denote the minimum value of $LSP(u, d)$ over all sequences $u$ of length
$m$. We derive bounds on $sp(m, d)$ using another extremal function for
sequences.
  A sequence $u$ is called $v$-free if no subsequence of $u$ is isomorphic to
$v$. Given sequences $u$ and v, let $LSS(u, v)$ denote the maximum length of a
$v$-free subsequence of $u$. Let $ss(m, v)$ denote the minimum of $LSS(u, v)$
over all sequences $u$ of length $m$. By bounding $ss(m, v)$ for alternating
sequences $v$, we prove quasilinear bounds in $m^{1/2}$ on $sp(m,d)$ for all $d

 <dc:description>  Improving employees' understanding of digital forensic technical terms and
concepts within an organisation is likely to increase the potential of
successful collaboration during a cyber security incident (e.g. data breach)
investigation within that organisation. In this paper, we seek to determine
whether multimedia presentations, in this case videos, are an effective tool in
improving a learner's technical understanding of digital forensic terms and
concepts. Using the cognitive theory of multimedia learning as the underlying
theoretical lens, we surveyed nine participants from the financial sector who
have cyber security-related responsibilities. With the exception of one
participant, the study found that the use of multimedia presentations can
improve participants' understanding of technical digital forensic terms and
concepts. Potential future research questions are also identified.

 <dc:description>  As the online service industry has continued to grow, illegal activities in
the online world have drastically increased and become more diverse. Most
illegal activities occur continuously because cyber assets, such as game items
and cyber money in online games, can be monetized into real currency. The aim
of this study is to detect game bots in a Massively Multiplayer Online Role
Playing Game (MMORPG). We observed the behavioral characteristics of game bots
and found that they execute repetitive tasks associated with gold farming and
real money trading. We propose a game bot detection methodology based on user
behavioral characteristics. The methodology of this paper was applied to real
data provided by a major MMORPG company. Detection accuracy rate increased to
96.06% on the banned account list.

 <dc:title>Using Collaborative Visual Analytics for Innovative Industry-inspired
  Learning Activities</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Marjanovic, Olivera</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Inspired by the leading industry practices, this paper describes an
innovative learning activity that combines data visualization and collaboration
structured around sharing, co-creation and negotiation of
departmental/disciplinary insights across data silos, using both internal and
external data. This activity was designed within a much larger project aiming
to translate practitioner stories and experiences in using visual analytics
into educational scenarios and innovative industry-informed learning activities
for students. In addition to giving students access to state-of-the-art tools
for visualization (SAS-VA) and collaboration (Yammer), an even more important
educational objective is to expose students to current industry practices with
individual data-driven disciplinary insights no longer considered to sufficient
when dealing with complex multi-disciplinary challenges. Starting from a
data-informed business scenario, the paper describes the main steps of our
innovative data visualisation and collaboration activity, discusses possible
alternative software platforms and offers some ideas for the future work.

 <dc:description>  Affiliate Marketing (AM) has become an important and cost effective tool for
e-commerce. There are numerous risks and vulnerabilities that are typically
associated with AM. Though a well-planned AM model can greatly benefit the
e-commerce strategies of an enterprise, a haphazardly implemented system can
expose a business enterprise to major risks and vulnerabilities, which can lead
to great financial losses through fraudulent activities. This
research-in-progress has identified some of the risks and the technical
background of those scenarios. The research will now move on to build a
functional prototype of an AM network to design and test solutions to control
the identified risks.

 <dc:description>  This teaching case describes the challenges faced by MTech Imaging, a
Singapore small and medium enterprise (SME) that specializes in providing
thermal imaging solutions. In recent years, the company has relentlessly
strived to become a digital innovative solution provider. This push has led to
the development of a disruptive digital innovation called the AXION platform.
Students are provided with vivid accounts of the journey undertaken by MTech to
develop the AXION platform, the industry it competes in, and the challenges it
faces in attempting to disrupt its industry through the introduction of the
AXION platform. The case seeks to achieve three learning objectives: (1) allow
students to learn from MTechs experiences in developing disruptive digital
innovation; (2) immerse students as senior management of MTech to substantiate
the best digital innovation strategy to adopt in order to disrupt its industry;
and (3) expose students to the challenges of driving the adoption of such
digital innovation in the market. It is hoped that the case can inspire
students to become effective digital innovation entrepreneurs.

 <dc:description>  The extent to which enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems deliver value
for organizations has been debated. In this study, we argue that the presence
of appropriate organizational resources is essential for capturing the
potential of ERP implementation. We investigate the relationship between ERP
implementation and two organizational resources, specifically, Intellectual
Capital (IC) and Organizational Learning Capability (OLC) to enrich the
understanding of the way the value of ERP implementations can be realized. A
sample of 226 manufacturing firms in Vietnam was surveyed to test the
theoretical model. Structural equation modelling with partial least square
method and two approaches for moderation analysis were used to analyze the
data. The results indicate that ERP implementation scope has a positive impact
on intellectual capital (IC). However, firms need to build a certain level of
OLC to utilize ERP implementation for the enhancement of IC.

 <dc:description>  Many foreign companies see social media as a low cost marketing space for
entering the vast Chinese market. This is fraught with complexity, requiring an
understanding of social media behaviour, social media marketing, and the
Chinese context. In this exploratory pilot study, we develop the notion of
franding (online freinding of brands) as a unifying metaphor, and suggest that
effective social media brand strategies resemble effective online friend
behaviours. Based on this we develop some propositions and evaluate them
qualitatively in interviews with young Chinese consumers. Our study suggests
that conceptualizing brand social media relationships as a type of online
friendship can assist in harmonizing disparate literature and provide useful
insights for organizations operating in this complex area.

 <dc:description>  We submitted two systems to the SemEval-2016 Task 12: Clinical TempEval
challenge, participating in Phase 1, where we identified text spans of time and
event expressions in clinical notes and Phase 2, where we predicted a relation
between an event and its parent document creation time.
  For temporal entity extraction, we find that a joint inference-based approach
using structured prediction outperforms a vanilla recurrent neural network that
incorporates word embeddings trained on a variety of large clinical document
sets. For document creation time relations, we find that a combination of date
canonicalization and distant supervision rules for predicting relations on both
events and time expressions improves classification, though gains are limited,
likely due to the small scale of training data.

 <dc:description>  Social media technologies are increasingly utilized by patients, leading to
development of online social groups where patients share experiences and offer
support to their peers on these platforms. There is limited research
investigating actual use of social media platforms by patients, issues faced in
using such platforms and how appropriation of these platforms impact patient
outcomes. A conceptual model based on social support theory and model of
technology appropriation is proposed in order to investigate factors that
influence this phenomenon. The authors propose that social support theory and
model of technology appropriation could explain the determining factors, both
enablers and barriers that drive appropriation and knowledge sharing behaviours
of patients on social media platforms.

 <dc:description>  Propinquity between Australian Indigenous communities' social structures and
ICT purposed for cultural preservation is a modern area of research;
historically hindered by the &quot;digital divide&quot; thus limiting plentiful
literature and existing information systems in this field in theoretical and
practical applications. Henceforth, community consultation is mandatory in
deriving and delivering empirically effective processes in a cultural and
language preservation IS tool designed to teach future generations of
Indigenous Australians about native culture and language. More than 100 out of
250 languages spoken by Indigenous have become extinct since 1788 (Harrington,
2014) which inaugurates the urgency of this preservation tool. ICT has been
identified as the best provision method; by its capacity to best collect,
eternize and teach cultural knowledge and language. The aim of this research is
to specify requirements and considerations for the development of a socially
integrated, culturally conscious, end-user driven IS to preserve Indigenous
culture in Australia.

 <dc:description>  In the current SPARQL specification the notion of correlation and
substitution are not well defined. This problem triggers several ambiguities in
the semantics. In fact, implementations as Fuseki and Virtuoso assume different
semantics.
  In this technical report, we provide a semantics of correlation and
substitution following the classic philosophy of substitution and correlation
in logic, programming languages and SQL. We think this proposal not only fix
the current ambiguities and problems, but helps to set a safe formal base to
further extensions of the language.
  This work is part of an ongoing work of Daniel Hernandez. These anomalies in
the W3C Specification of SPARQL 1.1 were detected early and reported no later
than 2014, when two erratas were registered (cf.
https://www.w3.org/2013/sparql-errata#errata-query-8 and
https://www.w3.org/2013/sparql-errata#errata-query-10).

 <dc:description>  e-Health is a core part of Australias strategy to address rising costs and
changing demands for healthcare services. With over $1bn spent and only 6% of
Australians registered, the personally controlled electronic health record
(PCEHR) suggests user challenges remain. While evidence confirms the benefits
from involving users in systems development there is a need for more examples
of how to engage effectively in healthcare settings. This research describes
the use of an agile development methodology combined with the thinking out loud
technique to deliver a solution that exceeded user requirements in supporting a
new model of care. The 4C project solution connected Aged Care institutions
with general practices, hospitals and specialist services in Tasmanias
north-west region. It was underpinned by a model of Technology Mediated Social
Participation (TMSP). As a trial project for the PCEHR it remains unclear why
lessons learned appear not to have been deployed more explicitly in the
National roll-out.

 <dc:description>  The concept of an information technology (IT) related platform is broad and
covers phenomena ranging from the operating system Linux to the Internet. Such
platforms are of increasing importance to innovation and value creation across
many facets of industry and daily life. There is, however, a lack of common
understanding in both research and industry about what is mean by the term
platform when related to IT. This lack of consensus is detrimental to research
and knowledge development. Thus, the aims of this study are to: (i) provide a
sound definition of the IT-platform concept by identifying its distinguishing
dimensions; and (ii) identify important current research directions for the
IT-platform concept. To achieve these aims a systematic literature review was
undertaken with 133 relevant articles taken from major information systems
journals, conferences, and business publications. The study contributes by
providing a sound base for future research into IT-platforms.

 <dc:description>  The main focus of the requirements engineering (RE) literature has been on
the technical aspects related to the RE projects. Furthermore, research has
mainly focused on the specific methods for collecting the requirements for an
information system. To fill this gap, this paper studies the contribution of
social factors, such as social ties, knowledge sharing and flexibility, to
successful collaboration in RE teams. Data were collected from a successful RE
and development project in a public sector company in Finland. The results
suggest that human-related issues, such as flexibility and transactive memory,
were important for collaborative work in the RE team studied. The paper
concludes by discussing the implications for theory and suggesting practical

 <dc:description>  Research articles can support teaching by introducing the latest expert
thinking on relevant topics and trends and describing practical real-world case
studies to encourage discussion and analysis. However, from the point of view
of the instructor, a common challenge is identifying the most suitable papers
for classroom teaching amongst a very large pool of potential candidates that
are not typically written for teaching purposes. Further, even in
practice-oriented disciplines such as Information Security Management (ISM),
high-quality journals emphasise theoretical contribution and research method
rather than relevance to practice. Our review of the relevant literature did
not find a comprehensive set of criteria to assist instructors in evaluating
the suitability of research articles to teaching. Therefore, this
research-in-progress paper presents a framework to support academics in the
process of evaluating the suitability of research articles for their teaching
programs.

 <dc:description>  Enterprise Architecture (EA) continues to gain global recognition as a
management tool that would improve the organizations performance. However,
based on literature, it was found that the lack of EA knowledge of top
management (TM) hinders the assimiliation of EA. This study aims to gauge EA
knowledge required for TM for providing a comprehensive support towards EA
assimiliation. A semi-structured interviews were conducted with several
personnels in an organization. Data were analyzed using the constant
comparative method. This study found two sets of EA knowledge of TM; business
knowledge and technology knowledge. A conceptual knowledge relationship model
is proposed through synthesizing the roles of EA and TM in supporting the TM in
identifying the EA knowledge required. The findings gave contribution to
academicians and practitioners with knowledge of how to improve EA
assimiliation and a structured roadmap for understanding EA to achieve high
business value.

 <dc:description>  Knowledge sharing drives innovation and the opportunity to develop a
sustainable competitive advantage. However, in the extant knowledge management
and information security literature, leakage from sharing activities is
neglected. The risk of knowledge leakage is exacerbated with the pervasive use
of mobile devices and the adoption of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device). Thus, this
research-in-progress paper examines the role of the behavior of mobile workers
that engage in accidental knowledge leakage through the use of BYOD. We use the
Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB) to explain the causes behind this
phenomenon and how it negatively impacts organization's competitive advantage.
The contributions of this study are the following. First, it posits that the
reasons of knowledge leakage by mobile workers through BYOD can be explained
using DTPB. Second, the paper proposes a conceptual model for research based on
DTPB constructs whilst adding other variables such as BYOD and mobile device
usage context. Finally, the conceptual study outlines the potential
contributions and implications of this research.

 <dc:title>Liveness of Randomised Parameterised Systems under Arbitrary Schedulers
  (Technical Report)</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of verifying liveness for systems with a finite, but
unbounded, number of processes, commonly known as parameterised systems.
Typical examples of such systems include distributed protocols (e.g. for the
dining philosopher problem). Unlike the case of verifying safety, proving
liveness is still considered extremely challenging, especially in the presence
of randomness in the system. In this paper we consider liveness under arbitrary
(including unfair) schedulers, which is often considered a desirable property
in the literature of self-stabilising systems. We introduce an automatic method
of proving liveness for randomised parameterised systems under arbitrary
schedulers. Viewing liveness as a two-player reachability game (between
Scheduler and Process), our method is a CEGAR approach that synthesises a
progress relation for Process that can be symbolically represented as a
finite-state automaton. The method is incremental and exploits both
Angluin-style L*-learning and SAT-solvers. Our experiments show that our
algorithm is able to prove liveness automatically for well-known randomised
distributed protocols, including Lehmann-Rabin Randomised Dining Philosopher
Protocol and randomised self-stabilising protocols (such as the Israeli-Jalfon
Protocol). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully-automatic
method that can prove liveness for randomised protocols.

 <dc:description>  Periodically researchers examine their fields of research in order to test
the fields maturity, to determine theories and methods used, and to uncover
areas of research emphasis. Research articles for these studies are generally
located through keyword search, then manually read and coded in order to
summarise the research field. This research tests using metadata analysis
alone, on the internet of things (IoT) research field, using data extracted
from three academic databases. The metadata analysis was proposed to reduce
time in analysis, and allow for testing of a much larger sample of articles.
Findings indicated that the IoT research field was immature, with experimental
methods dominating research outputs. However, difficulties with keyword
metadata included synonyms, abbreviations, lack of accuracy, and method and
theory not being included in metadata. A keyword schema is suggested in order
to relieve these problems in future articles, and to assist researchers in
locating relevant literature.

 <dc:description>  Image segmentation is often performed on medical images for identifying
diseases in clinical evaluation. Hence it has become one of the major research
areas. Conventional image segmentation techniques are unable to provide
satisfactory segmentation results for medical images as they contain
irregularities. They need to be pre-processed before segmentation. In order to
obtain the most suitable method for medical image segmentation, we propose a
two stage algorithm. The first stage automatically generates a binary marker
image of the region of interest using mathematical morphology. This marker
serves as the mask image for the second stage which uses GrabCut on the input
image thus resulting in an efficient segmented result. The obtained result can
be further refined by user interaction which can be done using the Graphical
User Interface (GUI). Experimental results show that the proposed method is
accurate and provides satisfactory segmentation results with minimum user
interaction on medical as well as natural images.

 <dc:description>  The concurrent effect of various internal and external factors on IT
Outsourcing (ITO) decision making has seldom been investigated in a single
study. Furthermore, research on external factors is scarce and there is no
comprehensive theory that can fully explain ITO decisions made in practice.
This paper explains how key decision factors, both internal and external,
influence ITO decision making in a large Australian University. We also tested
the feasibility of a highly regarded descriptive model of ITO decisions as the
basic foundation of an ITO decision theory. The model failed to fully explain
ITO decisions in our case organisation. We draw researchers' attention to the
need for more exploration of external factors as well as clarification of
contingency factors that may explain inconsistencies between ITO decision
theories and practice, and call for more research for 'practicable' ITO
decision aids. Implications for practice are also discussed in the paper.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks continue to advance the state-of-the-art of image
recognition tasks with various methods. However, applications of these methods
to multimodality remain limited. We present Multimodal Residual Networks (MRN)
for the multimodal residual learning of visual question-answering, which
extends the idea of the deep residual learning. Unlike the deep residual
learning, MRN effectively learns the joint representation from vision and
language information. The main idea is to use element-wise multiplication for
the joint residual mappings exploiting the residual learning of the attentional
models in recent studies. Various alternative models introduced by
multimodality are explored based on our study. We achieve the state-of-the-art
results on the Visual QA dataset for both Open-Ended and Multiple-Choice tasks.
Moreover, we introduce a novel method to visualize the attention effect of the
joint representations for each learning block using back-propagation algorithm,
even though the visual features are collapsed without spatial information.

 <dc:description>  Many organizations have introduced various ICT-enabled innovations to improve
economic, environmental and social performance. The Open Food Network (OFN) is
an example of ICT-enabled innovation that has the potential to enhance the
sustainability of regional food supply chain by improving farmers access to
local and regional markets and consumers access to fresh local produce, as well
as optimizing the regional food distribution and improving local community
welfare. OFN has just been recently launched in Australia and currently there
is a limited understanding of the actual impacts and appropriate strategies to
encourage wider adoption. This research in progress aims to evaluate the
effectiveness of the OFN system in connecting and supporting the sustainability
of regional food supply chain communities in Australia that will help devise
strategies for expanding the use beyond Australia. Through a preliminary focus
group with a number of early adopters of the OFN, this study identifies the
actual use of OFN, benefits to main stakeholders and a number of challenges.
The findings contribute to a longer term research program that investigates how
ICT can support sustainability initiatives within organizations and supply
chains.

 <dc:description>  With spectrum auctions as our prime motivation, in this paper we analyze
combinatorial auctions where agents' valuations exhibit complementarities.
Assuming that the agents only value bundles of size at most $k$ and also
assuming that we can assess prices, we present a mechanism that is efficient,
approximately envy-free, asymptotically strategy-proof and that has
polynomial-time complexity. Modifying an iterative rounding procedure from
assignment problems, we use the primal and dual optimal solutions to the linear
programming relaxation of the auction problem to construct a lottery for the
allocations and to assess the prices to bundles. The allocations in the lottery
over-allocate goods by at most $k-1$ units, and the dual prices are shown to be
(approximately) envy-free irrespective of the allocation chosen. We conclude
with a detailed numerical investigation of a specific spectrum allocation
problem.

 <dc:description>  Haze removal is important for computational photography and computer vision
applications. However, most of the existing methods for dehazing are designed
for daytime images, and cannot always work well in the nighttime. Different
from the imaging conditions in the daytime, images captured in nighttime haze
condition may suffer from non-uniform illumination due to artificial light
sources, which exhibit low brightness/contrast and color distortion. In this
paper, we present a new nighttime hazy imaging model that takes into account
both the non-uniform illumination from artificial light sources and the
scattering and attenuation effects of haze. Accordingly, we propose an
efficient dehazing algorithm for nighttime hazy images. The proposed algorithm
includes three sequential steps. i) It enhances the overall brightness by
performing a gamma correction step after estimating the illumination from the
original image. ii) Then it achieves a color-balance result by performing a
color correction step after estimating the color characteristics of the
incident light. iii) Finally, it remove the haze effect by applying the dark
channel prior and estimating the point-wise environmental light based on the
previous illumination-balance result. Experimental results show that the
proposed algorithm can achieve illumination-balance and haze-free results with
good color rendition ability.

 <dc:title>Deep Q-Networks for Accelerating the Training of Deep Neural Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fu, Jie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a principled deep reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that is able to accelerate the convergence rate of general deep neural
networks (DNNs). With our approach, a deep RL agent (synonym for optimizer in
this work) is used to automatically learn policies about how to schedule
learning rates during the optimization of a DNN. The state features of the
agent are learned from the weight statistics of the optimizee during training.
The reward function of this agent is designed to learn policies that minimize
the optimizee's training time given a certain performance goal. The actions of
the agent correspond to changing the learning rate for the optimizee during
training. As far as we know, this is the first attempt to use deep RL to learn
how to optimize a large-sized DNN. We perform extensive experiments on a
standard benchmark dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of the policies
learned by our approach.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Ensuring safe and efficient mobility is a critical issue for smart city
operators. Increasing safety not only reduces the likelihood of road injuries
and fatalities, but also reduces traffic congestion and disruptions caused by
accidents, increasing efficiency. While new vehicles are increasingly equipped
with semi-automation, the added costs will initially limit the penetration rate
of these systems. An inexpensive way to replace or augment these systems is to
create networks of wearables (smart glasses, watches) that exchange positional
and path data at a very fast rate between all users, identify collision risks
and feedback collision resolution information to all users in an intuitive way
through their smart glasses.

 <dc:title>Better Image Segmentation by Exploiting Dense Semantic Predictions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Qiyang</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Griffin, Lewis D</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is well accepted that image segmentation can benefit from utilizing
multilevel cues. The paper focuses on utilizing the FCNN-based dense semantic
predictions in the bottom-up image segmentation, arguing to take semantic cues
into account from the very beginning. By this we can avoid merging regions of
similar appearance but distinct semantic categories as possible. The semantic
inefficiency problem is handled. We also propose a straightforward way to use
the contour cues to suppress the noise in multilevel cues, thus to improve the
segmentation robustness. The evaluation on the BSDS500 shows that we obtain the
competitive region and boundary performance. Furthermore, since all individual
regions can be assigned with appropriate semantic labels during the
computation, we are capable of extracting the adjusted semantic segmentations.
The experiment on Pascal VOC 2012 shows our improvement to the original
semantic segmentations which derives directly from the dense predictions.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel approach to tensor completion, which recovers
missing entries of data represented by tensors. The approach is based on the
tensor train (TT) rank, which is able to capture hidden information from
tensors thanks to its definition from a well-balanced matricization scheme.
Accordingly, new optimization formulations for tensor completion are proposed
as well as two new algorithms for their solution. The first one called simple
low-rank tensor completion via tensor train (SiLRTC-TT) is intimately related
to minimizing a nuclear norm based on TT rank. The second one is from a
multilinear matrix factorization model to approximate the TT rank of a tensor,
and is called tensor completion by parallel matrix factorization via tensor
train (TMac-TT). A tensor augmentation scheme of transforming a low-order
tensor to higher-orders is also proposed to enhance the effectiveness of
SiLRTC-TT and TMac-TT. Simulation results for color image and video recovery
show the clear advantage of our method over all other methods.

 <dc:description>  Projective measurement can increase the entropy of a state $\rho$, the
increased entropy is not only up to the basis of projective measurement, but
also has something to do with the properties of the state itself. In this paper
we define this increased entropy as basis entropy. And then we discuss the
usefulness of this new concept by showing its application in deciding whether a
state is pure or not and detecting the existence of quantum discord. And as
shown in the paper, this new concept can also be used to describe decoherence.

 <dc:description>  An open problem with categorical compositional distributional semantics is
the representation of words that are considered semantically vacuous from a
distributional perspective, such as determiners, prepositions, relative
pronouns or coordinators. This paper deals with the topic of coordination
between identical syntactic types, which accounts for the majority of
coordination cases in language. By exploiting the compact closed structure of
the underlying category and Frobenius operators canonically induced over the
fixed basis of finite-dimensional vector spaces, we provide a morphism as
representation of a coordinator tensor, and we show how it lifts from atomic
types to compound types. Linguistic intuitions are provided, and the importance
of the Frobenius operators as an addition to the compact closed setting with
regard to language is discussed.

 <dc:title>A Deep Learning Approach to Block-based Compressed Sensing of Images</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Compressed sensing (CS) is a signal processing framework for efficiently
reconstructing a signal from a small number of measurements, obtained by linear
projections of the signal. Block-based CS is a lightweight CS approach that is
mostly suitable for processing very high-dimensional images and videos: it
operates on local patches, employs a low-complexity reconstruction operator and
requires significantly less memory to store the sensing matrix. In this paper
we present a deep learning approach for block-based CS, in which a
fully-connected network performs both the block-based linear sensing and
non-linear reconstruction stages. During the training phase, the sensing matrix
and the non-linear reconstruction operator are \emph{jointly} optimized, and
the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art both in terms of
reconstruction quality and computation time. For example, at a 25% sensing rate
the average PSNR advantage is 0.77dB and computation time is over 200-times
faster.

 <dc:description>  We study a general adaptive ranking problem where an algorithm needs to
perform a sequence of actions on a random user, drawn from a known
distribution, so as to &quot;satisfy&quot; the user as early as possible. The
satisfaction of each user is captured by an individual submodular function,
where the user is said to be satisfied when the function value goes above some
threshold. We obtain a logarithmic factor approximation algorithm for this
adaptive ranking problem, which is the best possible. The adaptive ranking
problem has many applications in active learning and ranking: it significantly
generalizes previously-studied problems such as optimal decision trees,
equivalence class determination, decision region determination and submodular
cover. We also present some preliminary experimental results based on our
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  (This paper was written in November 2011 and never published. It is posted on
arXiv.org in its original form in June 2016). Many recent object recognition
systems have proposed using a two phase training procedure to learn sparse
convolutional feature hierarchies: unsupervised pre-training followed by
supervised fine-tuning. Recent results suggest that these methods provide
little improvement over purely supervised systems when the appropriate
nonlinearities are included. This paper presents an empirical exploration of
the space of learning procedures for sparse convolutional networks to assess
which method produces the best performance. In our study, we introduce an
augmentation of the Predictive Sparse Decomposition method that includes a
discriminative term (DPSD). We also introduce a new single phase supervised
learning procedure that places an L1 penalty on the output state of each layer
of the network. This forces the network to produce sparse codes without the
expensive pre-training phase. Using DPSD with a new, complex predictor that
incorporates lateral inhibition, combined with multi-scale feature pooling, and
supervised refinement, the system achieves a 70.6\% recognition rate on
Caltech-101. With the addition of convolutional training, a 77\% recognition
was obtained on the CIfAR-10 dataset.

 <dc:description>  Energy storage in data centers has mainly been used as devices to backup
generators during power outages. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
using energy storage devices to actively shape power consumption in data
centers to reduce their skyrocketing electricity bills. In this paper, we
consider using energy storage in data centers for two applications in a joint
fashion: reducing peak demand charges and enabling data centers to participate
in regulation markets. We develop an optimization framework that captures the
cost of electricity, degradation of energy storage devices, as well as the
benefit from regulation markets. Under this frame- work, using real data
Microsoft data center traces and PJM regulation signals, we show the
electricity bill of a data center can be reduced by up to 20%. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the saving from joint optimization can be even larger than the
sum of individually optimizing each component. We quantify the particular
aspects of data center load profiles that lead to this superlinear gain.
Compared to prior works that consider using energy storage devices for each
single application alone, our results suggest that energy storage in data
centers can have much larger impacts than previously thought possible.

 <dc:description>  Recent neural models of dialogue generation offer great promise for
generating responses for conversational agents, but tend to be shortsighted,
predicting utterances one at a time while ignoring their influence on future
outcomes. Modeling the future direction of a dialogue is crucial to generating
coherent, interesting dialogues, a need which led traditional NLP models of
dialogue to draw on reinforcement learning. In this paper, we show how to
integrate these goals, applying deep reinforcement learning to model future
reward in chatbot dialogue. The model simulates dialogues between two virtual
agents, using policy gradient methods to reward sequences that display three
useful conversational properties: informativity (non-repetitive turns),
coherence, and ease of answering (related to forward-looking function). We
evaluate our model on diversity, length as well as with human judges, showing
that the proposed algorithm generates more interactive responses and manages to
foster a more sustained conversation in dialogue simulation. This work marks a
first step towards learning a neural conversational model based on the
long-term success of dialogues.

 <dc:description>  The goal of community detection algorithms is to identify densely-connected
units within large networks. An implicit assumption is that all the constituent
nodes belong equally to their associated community. However, some nodes are
more important in the community than others. To date, efforts have been
primarily driven to identify communities as a whole, rather than understanding
to what extent an individual node belongs to its community. Therefore, most
metrics for evaluating communities, for example modularity, are global. These
metrics produce a score for each community, not for each individual node. In
this paper, we argue that the belongingness of nodes in a community is not
uniform.
  The central idea of permanence is based on the observation that the strength
of membership of a vertex to a community depends upon two factors: (i) the the
extent of connections of the vertex within its community versus outside its
community, and (ii) how tightly the vertex is connected internally. We discuss
how permanence can help us understand and utilize the structure and evolution
of communities by demonstrating that it can be used to -- (i) measure the
persistence of a vertex in a community, (ii) design strategies to strengthen
the community structure, (iii) explore the core-periphery structure within a
community, and (iv) select suitable initiators for message spreading.
  We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful
communities that concur with the ground-truth community structure of the
networks more accurately than eight other popular community detection
algorithms. Finally, we show that the communities obtained by this method are
(i) less affected by the changes in vertex-ordering, and (ii) more resilient to
resolution limit, degeneracy of solutions and asymptotic growth of values.

 <dc:title>Neural Net Models for Open-Domain Discourse Coherence</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Discourse coherence is strongly associated with text quality, making it
important to natural language generation and understanding. Yet existing models
of coherence focus on measuring individual aspects of coherence (lexical
overlap, rhetorical structure, entity centering) in narrow domains.
  In this paper, we describe domain-independent neural models of discourse
coherence that are capable of measuring multiple aspects of coherence in
existing sentences and can maintain coherence while generating new sentences.
We study both discriminative models that learn to distinguish coherent from
incoherent discourse, and generative models that produce coherent text,
including a novel neural latent-variable Markovian generative model that
captures the latent discourse dependencies between sentences in a text.
  Our work achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple coherence
evaluations, and marks an initial step in generating coherent texts given
discourse contexts.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the problem of answering cloze-style questions over
documents. Our model, the Gated-Attention (GA) Reader, integrates a multi-hop
architecture with a novel attention mechanism, which is based on multiplicative
interactions between the query embedding and the intermediate states of a
recurrent neural network document reader. This enables the reader to build
query-specific representations of tokens in the document for accurate answer
selection. The GA Reader obtains state-of-the-art results on three benchmarks
for this task--the CNN \&amp; Daily Mail news stories and the Who Did What dataset.
The effectiveness of multiplicative interaction is demonstrated by an ablation
study, and by comparing to alternative compositional operators for implementing
the gated-attention. The code is available at
https://github.com/bdhingra/ga-reader.

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of lossy compression of high-dimensional vectors through
quantization. We propose the approach that learns quantization parameters by
minimizing the distortion of scalar products and squared distances between
pairs of points. This is in contrast to previous works that obtain these
parameters through the minimization of the reconstruction error of individual
points. The proposed approach proceeds by finding a linear transformation of
the data that effectively reduces the minimization of the pairwise distortions
to the minimization of individual reconstruction errors. After such
transformation, any of the previously-proposed quantization approaches can be
used. Despite the simplicity of this transformation, the experiments
demonstrate that it achieves considerable reduction of the pairwise distortions
compared to applying quantization directly to the untransformed data.

 <dc:description>  The primate brain contains a hierarchy of visual areas, dubbed the ventral
stream, which rapidly computes object representations that are both specific
for object identity and relatively robust against identity-preserving
transformations like depth-rotations. Current computational models of object
recognition, including recent deep learning networks, generate these properties
through a hierarchy of alternating selectivity-increasing filtering and
tolerance-increasing pooling operations, similar to simple-complex cells
operations. While simulations of these models recapitulate the ventral stream's
progression from early view-specific to late view-tolerant representations,
they fail to generate the most salient property of the intermediate
representation for faces found in the brain: mirror-symmetric tuning of the
neural population to head orientation. Here we prove that a class of
hierarchical architectures and a broad set of biologically plausible learning
rules can provide approximate invariance at the top level of the network. While
most of the learning rules do not yield mirror-symmetry in the mid-level
representations, we characterize a specific biologically-plausible Hebb-type
learning rule that is guaranteed to generate mirror-symmetric tuning to faces
tuning at intermediate levels of the architecture.

 <dc:description>  We provide finite-sample analysis of a general framework for using k-nearest
neighbor statistics to estimate functionals of a nonparametric continuous
probability density, including entropies and divergences. Rather than plugging
a consistent density estimate (which requires $k \to \infty$ as the sample size
$n \to \infty$) into the functional of interest, the estimators we consider fix
k and perform a bias correction. This is more efficient computationally, and,
as we show in certain cases, statistically, leading to faster convergence
rates. Our framework unifies several previous estimators, for most of which
ours are the first finite sample guarantees.

 <dc:title>An Energy-Efficient Compressive Sensing Framework Incorporating Online

 <dc:description>  Wireless body area network (WBAN) is emerging in the mobile healthcare area
to replace the traditional wire-connected monitoring devices. As wireless data
transmission dominates power cost of sensor nodes, it is beneficial to reduce
the data size without much information loss. Compressive sensing (CS) is a
perfect candidate to achieve this goal compared to existing compression
techniques. In this paper, we proposed a general framework that utilize CS and
online dictionary learning (ODL) together. The learned dictionary carries
individual characteristics of the original signal, under which the signal has
an even sparser representation compared to pre-determined dictionaries. As a
consequence, the compression ratio is effectively improved by 2-4x comparing to
prior works. Besides, the proposed framework offloads pre-processing from
sensor nodes to the server node prior to dictionary learning, providing further
reduction in hardware costs. As it is data driven, the proposed framework has
the potential to be used with a wide range of physiological signals.

 <dc:description>  The ability to automatically detect other vehicles on the road is vital to
the safety of partially-autonomous and fully-autonomous vehicles. Most of the
high-accuracy techniques for this task are based on R-CNN or one of its faster
variants. In the research community, much emphasis has been applied to using 3D
vision or complex R-CNN variants to achieve higher accuracy. However, are there
more straightforward modifications that could deliver higher accuracy? Yes. We
show that increasing input image resolution (i.e. upsampling) offers up to 12
percentage-points higher accuracy compared to an off-the-shelf baseline. We
also find situations where earlier/shallower layers of CNN provide higher
accuracy than later/deeper layers. We further show that shallow models and
upsampled images yield competitive accuracy. Our findings contrast with the
current trend towards deeper and larger models to achieve high accuracy in
domain specific detection tasks.

 <dc:description>  A spectrally sparse signal of order $r$ is a mixture of $r$ damped or
undamped complex sinusoids. This paper investigates the problem of
reconstructing spectrally sparse signals from a random subset of $n$ regular
time domain samples, which can be reformulated as a low rank Hankel matrix
completion problem. We introduce an iterative hard thresholding (IHT) algorithm
and a fast iterative hard thresholding (FIHT) algorithm for efficient
reconstruction of spectrally sparse signals via low rank Hankel matrix
completion. Theoretical recovery guarantees have been established for FIHT,
showing that $O(r^2\log^2(n))$ number of samples are sufficient for exact
recovery with high probability. Empirical performance comparisons establish
significant computational advantages for IHT and FIHT. In particular, numerical
simulations on $3$D arrays demonstrate the capability of FIHT on handling large
and high-dimensional real data.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the scalar regression problem through a novel solution
to exactly optimize the Huber loss in a general semi-supervised setting, which
combines multi-view learning and manifold regularization. We propose a
principled algorithm to 1) avoid computationally expensive iterative schemes
while 2) adapting the Huber loss threshold in a data-driven fashion and 3)
actively balancing the use of labelled data to remove noisy or inconsistent
annotations at the training stage. In a wide experimental evaluation, dealing
with diverse applications, we assess the superiority of our paradigm which is
able to combine robustness towards noise with both strong performance and low
computational cost.

 <dc:description>  In order to cope with the relentless data tsunami in $5G$ wireless networks,
current approaches such as acquiring new spectrum, deploying more base stations
(BSs) and increasing nodes in mobile packet core networks are becoming
ineffective in terms of scalability, cost and flexibility. In this regard,
context-aware $5$G networks with edge/cloud computing and exploitation of
\emph{big data} analytics can yield significant gains to mobile operators. In
this article, proactive content caching in $5$G wireless networks is
investigated in which a big data-enabled architecture is proposed. In this
practical architecture, vast amount of data is harnessed for content popularity
estimation and strategic contents are cached at the BSs to achieve higher
users' satisfaction and backhaul offloading. To validate the proposed solution,
we consider a real-world case study where several hours of mobile data traffic
is collected from a major telecom operator in Turkey and a big data-enabled
analysis is carried out leveraging tools from machine learning. Based on the
available information and storage capacity, numerical studies show that several
gains are achieved both in terms of users' satisfaction and backhaul
offloading. For example, in the case of $16$ BSs with $30\%$ of content ratings
and $13$ Gbyte of storage size ($78\%$ of total library size), proactive
caching yields $100\%$ of users' satisfaction and offloads $98\%$ of the
backhaul.

generative model G and a discriminator D on a dataset with inputs belonging to
one of N classes. At training time, D is made to predict which of N+1 classes
the input belongs to, where an extra class is added to correspond to the
outputs of G. We show that this method can be used to create a more
data-efficient classifier and that it allows for generating higher quality
samples than a regular GAN.

 <dc:title>Curie: A method for protecting SVM Classifier from Poisoning Attack</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Machine learning is used in a number of security related applications such as
biometric user authentication, speaker identification etc. A type of causative
integrity attack against machine learning called Poisoning attack works by
injecting specially crafted data points in the training data so as to increase
the false positive rate of the classifier. In the context of the biometric
authentication, this means that more intruders will be classified as valid
user, and in case of speaker identification system, user A will be classified
user B. In this paper, we examine poisoning attack against SVM and introduce -
Curie - a method to protect the SVM classifier from the poisoning attack. The
basic idea of our method is to identify the poisoned data points injected by
the adversary and filter them out. Our method is light weight and can be easily
integrated into existing systems. Experimental results show that it works very
well in filtering out the poisoned data.

of a set of $n+1$ points on an $n$-manifold provide a true coordinate chart,
i.e., the barycentric coordinates provide a diffeomorphism between a
neighbourhood of a Euclidean simplex, and a neighbourhood containing the points

 <dc:description>  Automated forecasts serve important role in space weather science, by
providing statistical insights to flare-trigger mechanisms, and by enabling
tailor-made forecasts and high-frequency forecasts. Only by realtime forecast
we can experimentally measure the performance of flare-forecasting methods
while confidently avoiding overlearning.
  We have been operating unmanned flare forecast service since August, 2015
that provides 24-hour-ahead forecast of solar flares, every 12 minutes. We

 <dc:description>  Recent improvements in both the performance and scalability of
shared-nothing, transactional, in-memory NewSQL databases have reopened the
research question of whether distributed metadata for hierarchical file systems
can be managed using commodity databases. In this paper, we introduce HopsFS, a
next generation distribution of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) that
replaces HDFS' single node in-memory metadata service, with a distributed
metadata service built on a NewSQL database. By removing the metadata
bottleneck, HopsFS enables an order of magnitude larger and higher throughput
clusters compared to HDFS. Metadata capacity has been increased to at least 37
times HDFS' capacity, and in experiments based on a workload trace from
Spotify, we show that HopsFS supports 16 to 37 times the throughput of Apache
HDFS. HopsFS also has lower latency for many concurrent clients, and no
downtime during failover. Finally, as metadata is now stored in a commodity
database, it can be safely extended and easily exported to external systems for
online analysis and free-text search.

 <dc:title>Generalized Suffix Tree based Multiple Sequence Alignment for Service

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Assuring quality of contemporary software systems is a very challenging task
due to the often large complexity of the deployment environments in which they
will operate. Service virtualization is an approach to this challenge where
services within the deployment environment are emulated by synthesising service
response messages from models or by recording and then replaying service
interaction messages with the system. Record-and-replay techniques require an
approach where (i) message prototypes can be derived from recorded system
interactions (i.e. request-response sequences), (ii) a scheme to match incoming
request messages against message prototypes, and (iii) the synthesis of
response messages based on similarities between incoming messages and the
recorded system interactions. Previous approaches in service virtualization
have required a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm as a means of
finding common patterns of similarities and differences between messages
required by all three steps.
  In this paper, we present a novel MSA algorithm based on Generalized Suffix
Trees (GSTs). We evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
algorithm against six enterprise service message trace datasets, with the
proposed algorithm performing up to 50 times faster than standard MSA
approaches. Furthermore, the algorithm has applicability to other domains
beyond service virtualization.

 <dc:title>Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis on Fisher Networks: A Hybrid

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification is to seek a correct match for a person of interest
across views among a large number of imposters. It typically involves two
procedures of non-linear feature extractions against dramatic appearance
changes, and subsequent discriminative analysis in order to reduce intra-
personal variations while enlarging inter-personal differences. In this paper,
we introduce a hybrid architecture which combines Fisher vectors and deep
neural networks to learn non-linear representations of person images to a space
where data can be linearly separable. We reinforce a Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA) on top of the deep neural network such that linearly separable
latent representations can be learnt in an end-to-end fashion. By optimizing an
objective function modified from LDA, the network is enforced to produce
feature distributions which have a low variance within the same class and high
variance between classes. The objective is essentially derived from the general
LDA eigenvalue problem and allows to train the network with stochastic gradient
descent and back-propagate LDA gradients to compute the gradients involved in
Fisher vector encoding. For evaluation we test our approach on four benchmark
data sets in person re-identification (VIPeR [1], CUHK03 [2], CUHK01 [3], and
Market1501 [4]). Extensive experiments on these benchmarks show that our model
can achieve state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate how network densification influences the
performance of downlink cellular network in terms of coverage probability (CP)
and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Instead of the simplified unbounded
pathloss model (UPM), we apply a more realistic bounded pathloss model (BPM) to
model the decay of signal power caused by pathloss. It is shown that network
densification indeed degrades CP when the base station (BS) density $\lambda$
is sufficiently large. This is inconsistent with the result derived using UPM
that CP is independent of $\lambda$. Moreover, we shed light on the impact of
ultra-dense deployment of BSs on the ASE scaling law. Specifically, it is
proved that the cellular network ASE scales with rate $\lambda
e^{-\kappa\lambda}$, i.e., first increases with $\lambda$ and then diminishes
to be zero as $\lambda$ goes to infinity.

 <dc:title>shapeDTW: shape Dynamic Time Warping</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhao, Jiaping</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is an algorithm to align temporal sequences with
possible local non-linear distortions, and has been widely applied to audio,
video and graphics data alignments. DTW is essentially a point-to-point
matching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints.
Although DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve
locally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely
dissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we
propose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping
(shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural
information into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but
additionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching
points with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio
signal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated
pairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment
errors than DTW and its two variants. When shapeDTW is used as a distance
measure in a nearest neighbor classifier (NN-shapeDTW) to classify time series,
it beats DTW on 64 out of 84 UCR time series datasets, with significantly
improved classification accuracies. By using a properly designed local
structure descriptor, shapeDTW improves accuracies by more than 10% on 18
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, shapeDTW is the first distance measure
under the nearest neighbor classifier scheme to significantly outperform DTW,
which had been widely recognized as the best distance measure to date. Our code
is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/jiapingz/shapeDTW.

 <dc:description>  Most existing approaches for zero pronoun resolution are heavily relying on
annotated data, which is often released by shared task organizers. Therefore,
the lack of annotated data becomes a major obstacle in the progress of zero
pronoun resolution task. Also, it is expensive to spend manpower on labeling
the data for better performance. To alleviate the problem above, in this paper,
we propose a simple but novel approach to automatically generate large-scale
pseudo training data for zero pronoun resolution. Furthermore, we successfully
transfer the cloze-style reading comprehension neural network model into zero
pronoun resolution task and propose a two-step training mechanism to overcome
the gap between the pseudo training data and the real one. Experimental results
show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
systems with an absolute improvements of 3.1% F-score on OntoNotes 5.0 data.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the Coarse-Grain Out-of-Order (CG- OoO) general purpose
processor designed to achieve close to In-Order processor energy while
maintaining Out-of-Order (OoO) performance. CG-OoO is an energy-performance
proportional general purpose architecture that scales according to the program
load. Block-level code processing is at the heart of the this architecture;
CG-OoO speculates, fetches, schedules, and commits code at block-level
granularity. It eliminates unnecessary accesses to energy consuming tables, and
turns large tables into smaller and distributed tables that are cheaper to
access. CG-OoO leverages compiler-level code optimizations to deliver efficient
static code, and exploits dynamic instruction-level parallelism and block-level
parallelism. CG-OoO introduces Skipahead issue, a complexity effective, limited
out-of-order instruction scheduling model. Through the energy efficiency
techniques applied to the compiler and processor pipeline stages, CG-OoO closes
64% of the average energy gap between the In-Order and Out-of-Order baseline
processors at the performance of the OoO baseline. This makes CG-OoO 1.9x more
efficient than the OoO on the energy-delay product inverse metric.

We provide a new approach which directly yields an optimal distributed
scheduling policy that attains any desired maximal timely-throughput vector
under average-power constraints on the nodes. It pursues a novel intrinsically
stochastic decomposition of the Lagrangian of the constrained network-wide MDP
rather than of the fluid model. All decisions regarding a packet's transmission
scheduling, transmit power level, and routing, are completely distributed,
based solely on the age of the packet, not requiring any knowledge of network
state or queue lengths at any of the nodes. Global coordination is achieved
through a tractably computable &quot;price&quot; for transmission energy. This price is
different from that used to derive the backpressure policy where price
corresponds to queue lengths. A quantifiably near-optimal policy is provided if
nodes have peak-power constraints.

  Re-identification: An End-to-End Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present an end-to-end approach to simultaneously learn
spatio-temporal features and corresponding similarity metric for video-based
person re-identification. Given the video sequence of a person, features from
each frame that are extracted from all levels of a deep convolutional network
can preserve a higher spatial resolution from which we can model finer motion
patterns. These low-level visual percepts are leveraged into a variant of
recurrent model to characterize the temporal variation between time-steps.
Features from all time-steps are then summarized using temporal pooling to
produce an overall feature representation for the complete sequence. The deep
convolutional network, recurrent layer, and the temporal pooling are jointly
trained to extract comparable hidden-unit representations from input pair of
time series to compute their corresponding similarity value. The proposed
framework combines time series modeling and metric learning to jointly learn
relevant features and a good similarity measure between time sequences of
person.
  Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance for video-based person re-identification on iLIDS-VID and PRID
2011, the two primary public datasets for this purpose.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the problem of designing optimal auctions under restrictions on the
set of permissible allocations. In addition to allowing us to restrict to
deterministic mechanisms, we can also indirectly model non-additive valuations.
We prove a strong duality result, extending a result due to Daskalakis et al.
[2015], that guarantees the existence of a certificate of optimality for
optimal restricted mechanisms. As a corollary of our result, we provide a new
characterization of the set of allocations that the optimal mechanism may
actually use. To illustrate our result we find and certify optimal mechanisms
for four settings where previous frameworks do not apply, and provide new
economic intuition about some of the tools that have previously been used to
find optimal mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  The primary objective of this paper is to highlight the need for and benefits
of studying the steady state and dynamic response of power systems using three
phase integrated transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) system models (hereafter
referred to as hybrid models). Modeling and simulation requirements for
building and analyzing hybrid models are also discussed. Finally, results from
steady state and dynamic simulations of a large hybrid model are presented to
demonstrate insights that can be obtained from hybrid models which cannot be
obtained from the study of transmission and distribution systems separately.

 <dc:description>  In recent years deep neural networks have achieved great success in sentiment
classification for English, thanks in part to the availability of copious
annotated resources. Unfortunately, most other languages do not enjoy such an
abundance of annotated data for sentiment analysis. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Deep Averaging Network (ADAN) to transfer sentiment
knowledge learned from labeled English data to low-resource languages where
only unlabeled data exists. ADAN is a &quot;Y-shaped&quot; network with two
discriminative branches: a sentiment classifier and an adversarial language
identification scorer. Both branches take input from a shared feature extractor
that aims to learn hidden representations that capture the underlying sentiment
of the text and are invariant across languages. Experiments on Chinese and
Arabic sentiment classification demonstrate that ADAN significantly outperforms
several baselines, including a strong pipeline approach that relies on
state-of-the-art Machine Translation.

 <dc:description>  Real-world applications could benefit from the ability to automatically
generate a fine-grained ranking of photo aesthetics. However, previous methods
for image aesthetics analysis have primarily focused on the coarse, binary
categorization of images into high- or low-aesthetic categories. In this work,
we propose to learn a deep convolutional neural network to rank photo
aesthetics in which the relative ranking of photo aesthetics are directly
modeled in the loss function. Our model incorporates joint learning of
meaningful photographic attributes and image content information which can help
regularize the complicated photo aesthetics rating problem.
  To train and analyze this model, we have assembled a new aesthetics and
attributes database (AADB) which contains aesthetic scores and meaningful
attributes assigned to each image by multiple human raters. Anonymized rater
identities are recorded across images allowing us to exploit intra-rater
consistency using a novel sampling strategy when computing the ranking loss of
training image pairs. We show the proposed sampling strategy is very effective
and robust in face of subjective judgement of image aesthetics by individuals
with different aesthetic tastes. Experiments demonstrate that our unified model
can generate aesthetic rankings that are more consistent with human ratings. To
further validate our model, we show that by simply thresholding the estimated
aesthetic scores, we are able to achieve state-or-the-art classification
performance on the existing AVA dataset benchmark.

 <dc:description>  A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a
kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of
exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took
place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and
receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a
paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in
return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also
dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the
market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are
not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of
reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to
fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.
  In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with
short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the
practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new
integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of
these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as
the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in
which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide
exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United
Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our
new models are competitive with all existing solvers---in many cases
outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a distance-based formation control strategy that
can enable four mobile agents, which are modelled by a group of
single-integrators, to achieve the desired formation shape specified by using
six consistent inter-agent distances in a 2-dimensional space. The control law
is closely related to a gradient-based control law formed from a potential
function reflecting the error between the actual inter-agent distances and the
desired inter-agent distances. There are already control strategies achieving
the same objective in a distance-based control manner in the literature, but
the results do not yet include a global as opposed to local stability analysis.
We propose a control strategy modified from the existing gradient-based control
law so that we can achieve almost global convergence to the desired formation
shape, and the control law uses known properties for an associated formation
shape control problem involving a four-agent tetrahedron formation in
3-dimensional space. Simulation results verifying our analysis are also
presented.

Linear Logic and a categorical axiomatization of its denotational models. We

 <dc:description>  We consider deep multi-layered generative models such as Boltzmann machines
or Hopfield nets in which computation (which implements inference) is both
recurrent and stochastic, but where the recurrence is not to model sequential
structure, only to perform computation. We find conditions under which a simple
feedforward computation is a very good initialization for inference, after the
input units are clamped to observed values. It means that after the feedforward
initialization, the recurrent network is very close to a fixed point of the
network dynamics, where the energy gradient is 0. The main condition is that
consecutive layers form a good auto-encoder, or more generally that different
groups of inputs into the unit (in particular, bottom-up inputs on one hand,
top-down inputs on the other hand) are consistent with each other, producing
the same contribution into the total weighted sum of inputs. In biological
terms, this would correspond to having each dendritic branch correctly
predicting the aggregate input from all the dendritic branches, i.e., the soma
potential. This is consistent with the prediction that the synaptic weights
into dendritic branches such as those of the apical and basal dendrites of
pyramidal cells are trained to minimize the prediction error made by the
dendritic branch when the target is the somatic activity. Whereas previous work
has shown how to achieve fast negative phase inference (when the model is
unclamped) in a predictive recurrent model, this contribution helps to achieve
fast positive phase inference (when the target output is clamped) in such
recurrent neural models.

 <dc:description>  Malware checking is changing from being a local service to a cloud-assisted
one where users' devices query a cloud server, which hosts a dictionary of
malware signatures, to check if particular applications are potentially
malware. Whilst such an architecture gains all the benefits of cloud-based
services, it opens up a major privacy concern since the cloud service can infer
personal traits of the users based on the lists of applications queried by
their devices. Private membership test (PMT) schemes can remove this privacy
concern. However, known PMT schemes do not scale well to a large number of
simultaneous users and high query arrival rates. We propose a simple PMT
approach using a carousel: circling the entire dictionary through trusted
hardware on the cloud server. Users communicate with the trusted hardware via
secure channels. We show how the carousel approach, using different data
structures to represent the dictionary, can be realized on two different
commercial hardware security architectures (ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX). We
highlight subtle aspects of securely implementing seemingly simple PMT schemes
on these architectures. Through extensive experimental analysis, we show that
for the malware checking scenario our carousel approach surprisingly
outperforms Path ORAM on the same hardware by supporting a much higher query
arrival rate while guaranteeing acceptable response latency for individual
queries.

 <dc:description>  In a previous work, we presented a parallel encoding algorithm for
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes by partitioning hypergraph representation
for the LDPC codes. The aim of this research is to analyze the processing time
of this encoding algorithm. This paper clarifies that the processing time of
the encoding algorithm depends on the minimum cutsize of balanced hypergraph
partitions. Moreover, this paper gives the typical minimum cutsize and cutsize
distribution for balanced hypergraph bipartitions of random hypergraphs defined
from a regular LDPC ensemble.

 <dc:description>  In the Internet of Things (IoT), heterogeneous devices connect to each other
and to external systems to exchange data and provide services. Given the
diversity of devices, it is becoming increasingly common to establish
collaborative relationships between devices to provide composite services.
However, due to the high degree of heterogeneity in the IoT context, one of the
most significant challenges is to develop software applications that can run on
a wide variety of devices and can communicate and collaborate with an even
wider array of systems. A common middleware infrastructure for these devices
will therefore have a significant impact on the design, deployment, and use of
services in IoT systems by allowing developers to focus on the applications
rather than the low-level implementation details each device.

 <dc:title>Predictive Coding for Dynamic Vision : Development of Functional
  Hierarchy in a Multiple Spatio-Temporal Scales RNN Model</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Choi, Minkyu</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tani, Jun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The current paper presents a novel recurrent neural network model, the
predictive multiple spatio-temporal scales RNN (P-MSTRNN), which can generate
as well as recognize dynamic visual patterns in the predictive coding
framework. The model is characterized by multiple spatio-temporal scales
imposed on neural unit dynamics through which an adequate spatio-temporal
hierarchy develops via learning from exemplars. The model was evaluated by
conducting an experiment of learning a set of whole body human movement
patterns which was generated by following a hierarchically defined movement
syntax. The analysis of the trained model clarifies what types of
spatio-temporal hierarchy develop in dynamic neural activity as well as how
robust generation and recognition of movement patterns can be achieved by using
the error minimization principle.

 <dc:description>  The understanding and prediction of information diffusion processes on
networks is a major challenge in network theory with many implications in
social sciences. Many theoretical advances occurred due to stochastic spreading
models. Nevertheless, these stochastic models overlooked the influence of
rational decisions on the outcome of the process. For instance, different
levels of trust in acquaintances do play a role in information spreading, and
actors may change their spreading decisions during the information diffusion
process accordingly. Here, we study an information-spreading model in which the
decision to transmit or not is based on trust. We explore the interplay between
the propagation of information and the trust dynamics happening on a two-layer
multiplex network. Actors' trustable or untrustable states are defined as
accumulated cooperation or defection behaviors, respectively, in a Prisoner's
Dilemma set up, and they are controlled by a memory span. The propagation of
information is abstracted as a threshold model on the information-spreading
layer, where the threshold depends on the trustability of agents. The analysis
of the model is performed using a tree approximation and validated on
homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The results show that the memory of
previous actions has a significant effect on the spreading of information. For
example, the less memory that is considered, the higher is the diffusion.
Information is highly promoted by the emergence of trustable acquaintances.
These results provide insight into the effect of plausible biases on spreading
dynamics in a multilevel networked system.

 <dc:description>  A comprehensive study of the coded performance of long-haul
spectrally-efficient WDM optical fiber transmission systems with different
coded modulation decoding structures is presented. Achievable information rates
are derived for three different square QAM formats and the optimal format is
identified as a function of distance and specific decoder implementation. The
four cases analyzed combine hard-decision (HD) or soft-decision (SD) decoding
together with either a bit-wise or a symbol-wise demapper, the last two
suitable for binary and nonbinary codes, respectively. The information rates
achievable for each scheme are calculated based on the mismatched decoder
principle. These quantities represent true indicators of the coded performance
of the system for specific decoder implementations and when the modulation
format and its input distribution are fixed. In combination with the structure
of the decoder, two different receiver-side equalization strategies are also
analyzed: electronic dispersion compensation and digital backpropagation. We
show that, somewhat unexpectedly, schemes based on nonbinary HD codes can
achieve information rates comparable to SD decoders and that, when SD is used,
switching from a symbol-wise to a bit-wise decoder results in a negligible
penalty. Conversely, from an information-theoretic standpoint, HD binary
decoders are shown to be unsuitable for spectrally-efficient, long-haul
systems.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a recurrent neural network language model (RNN-LM) with long
short-term memory (LSTM) units that utilizes both character-level and
word-level inputs. Our model has a gate that adaptively finds the optimal
mixture of the character-level and word-level inputs. The gate creates the
final vector representation of a word by combining two distinct representations
of the word. The character-level inputs are converted into vector
representations of words using a bidirectional LSTM. The word-level inputs are
projected into another high-dimensional space by a word lookup table. The final
vector representations of words are used in the LSTM language model which
predicts the next word given all the preceding words. Our model with the gating
mechanism effectively utilizes the character-level inputs for rare and
out-of-vocabulary words and outperforms word-level language models on several
English corpora.

 <dc:description>  Although there are over 1,600,000 third-party Android apps in the Google Play
Store, little has been conclusively shown about how their individual (and
collective) permission usage has evolved over time. Recently, Android 6
overhauled the way permissions are granted by users, by switching to run-time
permission requests instead of install-time permission requests. This is a
welcome change, but recent research has shown that many users continue to
accept run-time permissions blindly, leaving them at the mercy of third-party
app developers and adversaries. Beyond intentionally invading privacy, highly
privileged apps increase the attack surface of smartphones and are more
attractive targets for adversaries. This work focuses exclusively on dangerous
permissions, i.e., those permissions identified by Android as guarding access
to sensitive user data. By taking snapshots of the Google Play Store over a
20-month period, we characterise changes in the number and type of dangerous
permissions used by Android apps when they are updated, to gain a greater
understanding of the evolution of permission usage. We found that approximately
25,000 apps asked for additional permissions every three months. Worryingly, we
made statistically significant observations that free apps and highly popular
apps were more likely to ask for additional permissions when they were updated.
By looking at patterns in dangerous permission usage, we find evidence that
suggests developers may still be failing to correctly specify the permissions
their apps need.

 <dc:description>  Cooperation can be supported by indirect reciprocity via reputation.Thanks to
gossip, reputations are built and circulated and humans can identify defectors
and ostracise them. However, the evolutionary stability of gossip is allegedly
undermined by the fact that it is more error-prone that direct observation,
whereas ostracism could be ineffective if the partner selection mechanism is
not robust. The aim of this work is to investigate the conditions under which
the combination of gossip and ostracism might support cooperation in groups of
different sizes. We are also interested in exploring the extent to which errors
in transmission might undermine the reliability of gossip as a mechanism for
identifying defectors. Our results show that a large quantity of gossip is
necessary to support cooperation, and that group structure can mitigate the
effects of errors in transmission.

 <dc:description>  Battery-free computational RFID platforms, such as WISP (Wireless
Identification and Sensing Platform), are emerging intermittently powered
devices designed for replacing existing battery-powered sensor networks. As
their applications become increasingly complex, we anticipate that
synchronization (among others) to appear as one of crucial building blocks for
collaborative and coordinated actions. With this paper we aim at providing
initial observations regarding the synchronization of intermittently powered
systems. In particular, we design and implement the first and very initial
synchronization protocol for the WISP platform that provides explicit
synchronization among individual WISPs that reside inside the communication
range of a common RFID reader. Evaluations in our testbed showed that with our
mechanism a synchronization error of approximately 1.5 milliseconds can be
ensured between the RFID reader and a WISP tag.

 <dc:description>  Despite recent interest and advances in facial micro-expression research,
there is still plenty room for improvement in terms of micro-expression
recognition. Conventional feature extraction approaches for micro-expression
video consider either the whole video sequence or a part of it, for
representation. However, with the high-speed video capture of micro-expressions
(100-200 fps), are all frames necessary to provide a sufficiently meaningful
representation? Is the luxury of data a bane to accurate recognition? A novel
proposition is presented in this paper, whereby we utilize only two images per
video: the apex frame and the onset frame. The apex frame of a video contains
the highest intensity of expression changes among all frames, while the onset
is the perfect choice of a reference frame with neutral expression. A new
feature extractor, Bi-Weighted Oriented Optical Flow (Bi-WOOF) is proposed to
encode essential expressiveness of the apex frame. We evaluated the proposed
method on five micro-expression databases: CAS(ME)$^2$, CASME II, SMIC-HS,
SMIC-NIR and SMIC-VIS. Our experiments lend credence to our hypothesis, with
our proposed technique achieving a state-of-the-art F1-score recognition
performance of 61% and 62% in the high frame rate CASME II and SMIC-HS
databases respectively.

 <dc:description>  Modern discriminative predictors have been shown to match natural
intelligences in specific perceptual tasks in image classification, object and
part detection, boundary extraction, etc. However, a major advantage that
natural intelligences still have is that they work well for &quot;all&quot; perceptual
problems together, solving them efficiently and coherently in an &quot;integrated
manner&quot;. In order to capture some of these advantages in machine perception, we
ask two questions: whether deep neural networks can learn universal image
representations, useful not only for a single task but for all of them, and how
the solutions to the different tasks can be integrated in this framework. We
answer by proposing a new architecture, which we call &quot;MultiNet&quot;, in which not
only deep image features are shared between tasks, but where tasks can interact
in a recurrent manner by encoding the results of their analysis in a common
shared representation of the data. In this manner, we show that the performance
of individual tasks in standard benchmarks can be improved first by sharing
features between them and then, more significantly, by integrating their
solutions in the common representation.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, there has been a rapid growth in global usage of the electronic
vehicles (EV). Despite apparent environmental and economic advantages of EVs,
their high demand charging jobs pose an immense challenge to the existing
electricity grid infrastructure. In microgrids, as the small-scale version of
traditional power grid, however, the EV charging scheduling is more
challenging. This is because, the microgrid owner, as a large electricity
customer, is interested in shaving its global peak demand, i.e., the aggregated
demand over multiple parking stations, to reduce total electricity cost. While
the EV charging scheduling problem in single station scenario has been studied
extensively in the previous research, the microgrid-level problem with multiple
stations subject to a global peak constraint is not tackled. This paper aims to
propose a near-optimal EV charging scheduling mechanism in a microgrid governed
by a single utility provider with multiple charging stations. The goal is to
maximize the total revenue while respecting both local and global peak
constraints. The underlying problem, however, is a NP-hard mixed integer linear
problem which is difficult to tackle and calls for approximation algorithm
design. We design a primaldual scheduling algorithm which runs in polynomial
time and achieves bounded approximation ratio. Moreover, the proposed global
scheduling algorithm applies a valley-filling strategy to further reduce the
global peak. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed
algorithm is 98% of the optimum, which is much better than the theoretical
bound obtained by our approximation analysis. Our algorithm reduces the peak
demand obtained by the existing alternative algorithm by 16% and simultaneously
achieves better resource utilization.

 <dc:description>  ADiT is an adaptive approach for processing distributed top-$k$ queries over
peer-to-peer networks optimizing both system load and query response time. This
approach considers the size of the peer to peer network, the amount $k$ of
searched objects, the network capabilities of a connected peer, i.e. the
transmission rate, the amount of objects stored on each peer, and the speed of
a peer in processing a local top-$k$ query. In extensive experiments with a
variety of scenarios we could show that ADiT outperforms state of the art
distributed query processing techniques.

 <dc:description>  A ${\mathbb{Z}}_2{\mathbb{Z}}_4$-additive code ${\cal
C}\subseteq{\mathbb{Z}}_2^\alpha\times{\mathbb{Z}}_4^\beta$ is called cyclic if
the set of coordinates can be partitioned into two subsets, the set of
${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ and the set of ${\mathbb{Z}}_4$ coordinates, such that any
simultaneous cyclic shift of the coordinates of both subsets leaves invariant
the code. These codes can be identified as submodules of the
$\mathbb{Z}_4[x]$-module
$\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^\alpha-1)\times\mathbb{Z}_4[x]/(x^\beta-1)$. Any
$\mathbb{Z}_2\mathbb{Z}_4$-additive cyclic code ${\cal C}$ is of the form
$\langle (b(x)\mid{ 0}), (\ell(x) \mid f(x)h(x) +2f(x)) \rangle$ for some
$b(x), \ell(x)\in\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/(x^\alpha-1)$ and $f(x),h(x)\in
{\mathbb{Z}}_4[x]/(x^\beta-1)$. A new algorithm is presented to compute the
generator polynomials for ${\mathbb{Z}}_2{\mathbb{Z}}_4$-additive cyclic codes.

 <dc:description>  Object classification according to their shape and size is of key importance
in many scientific fields. This work focuses on the case where the size and
shape of an object is characterized by a current}. A current is a mathematical
object which has been proved relevant to the modeling of geometrical data, like
submanifolds, through integration of vector fields along them. As a consequence
of the choice of a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) as a
test space for integrating manifolds, it is possible to consider that shapes
are embedded in this Hilbert Space. A vector-valued RKHS is a Hilbert space of
vector fields; therefore, it is possible to compute a mean of shapes, or to
calculate a distance between two manifolds. This embedding enables us to
consider size-and-shape classification algorithms.
  These algorithms are applied to a 3D database obtained from an anthropometric
survey of the Spanish child population with a potential application to online
sales of children's wear.

 <dc:description>  Due to limited backhaul/feedback link capacity and channel state information
(CSI) feedback delay, obtaining global and instantaneous channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT) is a main obstacle in practice. In this
paper, novel transmission schemes are proposed for a class of interference
networks that can achieve new trade-off regions between the sum of degrees of
freedom (sum-DoF) and CSI feedback delay with distributed and
temperately-delayed CSIT. More specifically, a distributed space-time
interference alignment (STIA) scheme is proposed for the two-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) X channel via a novel precoding method
called Cyclic Zero-padding. The achieved sum-DoFs herein for certain antenna
configurations are greater than the best known sum-DoFs in literature with
delayed CSIT. Furthermore, we propose a distributed retrospective interference
alignment (RIA) scheme that achieves more than 1 sum-DoF for the K-user
single-input single-output (SISO) X network. Finally, we extend the distributed
STIA to the MxN user multiple-input single-output (MISO) X network where each
transmitter has N-1 antennas and each receiver has a single antenna, yielding
the same sum-DoF as that in the global and instantaneous CSIT case. The
discussion and the result of the MISO X network can be extended to the MIMO
case due to spatial scale invariance property.

 <dc:description>  Inaccurate circuits make possible the conservation of limited resources, such
as energy. But effective design of such circuits requires an understanding of
resulting tradeoffs between accuracy and design parameters, such as voltages
and speed of execution. Although studies of tradeoffs have been done on
specific circuits, the applicability of those studies is narrow. This paper
presents a comprehensive and mathematically rigorous method for analyzing a
large class of inaccurate circuits for addition. Furthermore, it presents new,
fast algorithms for the computation of key statistical measures of inaccuracy
in such adders, thus helping hardware architects explore the design space with
greater confidence.

 <dc:description>  Leak detection in urban water distribution networks (WDNs) is challenging
given their scale, complexity, and limited instrumentation. We present an
algorithm for leak detection in WDNs, which involves making additional flow
measurements on-demand, and repeated use of water balance. Graph partitioning
is used to determine the location of flow measurements, with the objective to
minimize the measurement cost. We follow a multi-stage divide and conquer
approach. In every stage, a section of the WDN identified to contain the leak
is partitioned into two or more sub-networks, and water balance is used to
trace the leak to one of these sub-networks. This process is recursively
continued until the desired resolution is achieved. We investigate different
methods for solving the arising graph partitioning problem like integer linear
programming (ILP) and spectral bisection. The proposed methods are tested on
large scale benchmark networks, and our results indicate that on average, less
than 3% of the pipes need to be measured for finding the leak in large
networks.

 <dc:description>  The performance of $L$-branch scan-and-wait combining (SWC) reception systems
over arbitrarily correlated and not necessarily identically distributed
Nakagami-$m$ fading channels is analyzed and evaluated. Firstly, a fast
convergent infinite series representation for the SWC output signal-noise ratio
(SNR) is presented. This expression is used to obtain analytical expressions in
the form of infinite series for the average error probability performance of
various modulation schemes for integer values of $m$ as well as the average
number of paths estimation and average waiting time (AWT) of $L$-branch SWC
receivers for arbitrary values of $m$. The numerically obtained results have
shown that the performance expressions converge very fast to their exact
analytical values. It was found that the convergence speed depends on the
correlation and operating SNR values as well as the Nakagami $m$-parameter. In
addition to the analytical results, complementary computer simulated
performance evaluation results have been obtained by means of Monte Carlo error
counting techniques. The match between these two sets of results has verified
the accuracy of the proposed mathematical analysis. Furthermore, it is revealed
that, at the expense of a negligible AWT, the average error probability
performance of SWC receivers is always superior to that of switched-and-examine
combining receivers and in certain cases to that of maximal-ratio combining
receivers.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a constructive proof of cut elimination for a system
of full second order logic with the structural rules absorbed and using sets
instead of sequences. The standard problem of the cutrank growth is avoided by
using a new parameter for the induction, the cutweight. This technique can also
be applied to first order logic.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to crucial errors
  noted by reviewers: no cut-elimination proof for second-order logic can be
  formalized in second-order arithmetic. The author's arguments are
  formalizable in a subsystem of Kalmar-elementary arithmetic. So the purported
  proof seems patently wrong</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neural networks, in
particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks. However, these
architectures are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional
networks which have pushed the state-of-the-art in computer vision. We present
a new architecture (VDCNN) for text processing which operates directly at the
character level and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. We are
able to show that the performance of this model increases with depth: using up
to 29 convolutional layers, we report improvements over the state-of-the-art on
several public text classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that very deep convolutional nets have been applied to text
processing.

 <dc:description>  Impedance-based temperature detection (ITD) is a promising approach for rapid
estimation of internal cell temperature based on the correlation between
temperature and electrochemical impedance. Previously, ITD was used as part of
an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) state-estimator in conjunction with a thermal
model to enable estimation of the 1-D temperature distribution of a cylindrical
lithium-ion battery. Here, we extend this method to enable estimation of the
2-D temperature field of a battery with temperature gradients in both the
radial and axial directions.
  An EKF using a parameterised 2-D spectral-Galerkin model with ITD measurement
input (the imaginary part of the impedance at 215 Hz) is shown to accurately
predict the core temperature and multiple surface temperatures of a 32113
LiFePO$_4$ cell, using current excitation profiles based on an Artemis HEV
drive cycle. The method is validated experimentally on a cell fitted with a
heat sink and asymmetrically cooled via forced air convection.
  A novel approach to impedance-temperature calibration is also presented,
which uses data from a single drive cycle, rather than measurements at multiple
uniform cell temperatures as in previous studies. This greatly reduces the time
required for calibration, since it overcomes the need for repeated cell thermal
equalization.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose phraseNet, a neural machine translator with a
phrase memory which stores phrase pairs in symbolic form, mined from corpus or
specified by human experts. For any given source sentence, phraseNet scans the
phrase memory to determine the candidate phrase pairs and integrates tagging
information in the representation of source sentence accordingly. The decoder
utilizes a mixture of word-generating component and phrase-generating
component, with a specifically designed strategy to generate a sequence of
multiple words all at once. The phraseNet not only approaches one step towards
incorporating external knowledge into neural machine translation, but also
makes an effort to extend the word-by-word generation mechanism of recurrent
neural network. Our empirical study on Chinese-to-English translation shows
that, with carefully-chosen phrase table in memory, phraseNet yields 3.45 BLEU
improvement over the generic neural machine translator.

 <dc:description>  The problem of low-rank approximation with convex constraints, which often
appears in data analysis, image compression and model order reduction, is
considered. Given a data matrix, the objective is to find an approximation of
desired lower rank that fulfills the convex constraints and minimizes the
distance to the data matrix in the Frobenius norm. The problem of matrix
completion can be seen as a special case of this.
  Today, one of the most widely used techniques is to approximate this
non-convex problem using convex nuclear norm regularization. In many
situations, this technique does not give solutions with desirable properties.
We instead propose to use the largest convex minorizer (under-approximation) of
the Frobenius norm and the rank constraint as a convex proxy. This optimal
convex proxy can be combined with other convex constraints to form an optimal
convex minorizer of the original non-convex problem. With this approach, we get
easily verifiable conditions under which the solutions to the convex relaxation
and the original non-convex problem coincide. Several numerical examples are
provided for which that is the case. We also see that our proposed convex
relaxation consistently performs better than the nuclear norm heuristic,
especially in the matrix completion case.
  The expressibility and computational tractability is of great importance for
a convex relaxation. We provide a closed-form expression for the proposed
convex approximation, and show how to represent it as a semi-definite program.
We also show how to compute the proximal operator of the convex approximation.
This allows us to use scalable first-order methods to solve convex
approximation problems of large size.

 <dc:title>Modular non-repeating codes for DNA storage</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Holmes, Ian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We describe a strategy for constructing codes for DNA-based information
storage by serial composition of weighted finite-state transducers. The
resulting state machines can integrate correction of substitution errors;
synchronization by interleaving watermark and periodic marker signals;
conversion from binary to ternary, quaternary or mixed-radix sequences via an
efficient block code; encoding into a DNA sequence that avoids homopolymer,
dinucleotide, or trinucleotide runs and other short local repeats; and
detection/correction of errors (including local duplications, burst deletions,
and substitutions) that are characteristic of DNA sequencing technologies. We
present software implementing these codes, available at
github.com/ihh/dnastore, with simulation results demonstrating that the
generated DNA is free of short repeats and can be accurately decoded even in
the presence of substitutions, short duplications and deletions.

 <dc:description>  Approximate message passing (AMP) refers to a class of efficient algorithms
for statistical estimation in high-dimensional problems such as compressed
sensing and low-rank matrix estimation. This paper analyzes the performance of
AMP in the regime where the problem dimension is large but finite. For
concreteness, we consider the setting of high-dimensional regression, where the
goal is to estimate a high-dimensional vector $\beta_0$ from a noisy
measurement $y=A \beta_0 + w$. AMP is a low-complexity, scalable algorithm for
this problem. Under suitable assumptions on the measurement matrix $A$, AMP has
the attractive feature that its performance can be accurately characterized in
the large system limit by a simple scalar iteration called state evolution.
Previous proofs of the validity of state evolution have all been asymptotic
convergence results. In this paper, we derive a concentration inequality for
AMP with i.i.d. Gaussian measurement matrices with finite size $n \times N$.
The result shows that the probability of deviation from the state evolution
prediction falls exponentially in $n$. This provides theoretical support for
empirical findings that have demonstrated excellent agreement of AMP
performance with state evolution predictions for moderately large dimensions.
The concentration inequality also indicates that the number of AMP iterations
$t$ can grow no faster than order $\frac{\log n}{\log \log n}$ for the
performance to be close to the state evolution predictions with high
probability. The analysis can be extended to obtain similar non-asymptotic
results for AMP in other settings such as low-rank matrix estimation.

  large deviations inequality grow with each iteration of the algorithm</dc:description>

this reserve of scholarly documents for developing applications that can
facilitate and aid in better management of research. In addition to this, the
evolving nature of research problems has made them essentially
interdisciplinary. As a result, there is a growing need for scholarly
applications like collaborator discovery, expert finding and research
recommendation systems. This research paper reviews the current trends and
identifies the challenges existing in the architecture, services and

 <dc:description>  Is undecidability a requirement for open-ended evolution (OEE)? Using methods
derived from algorithmic complexity theory, we propose robust computational
definitions of open-ended evolution and the adaptability of computable
dynamical systems. Within this framework, we show that decidability imposes
absolute limits to the stable growth of complexity in computable dynamical
systems. Conversely, systems that exhibit (strong) open-ended evolution must be
undecidable, establishing undecidability as a requirement for such systems.
Complexity is assessed in terms of three measures: sophistication, coarse
sophistication and busy beaver logical depth. These three complexity measures
assign low complexity values to random (incompressible) objects. As time grows,
the stated complexity measures allow for the existence of complex states during
the evolution of a computable dynamical system. We show, however, that finding
these states involves undecidable computations. We conjecture that for similar
complexity measures that assign low complexity values, decidability imposes
comparable limits to the stable growth of complexity, and that such behaviour
is necessary for non-trivial evolutionary systems. We show that the
undecidability of adapted states imposes novel and unpredictable behaviour on
the individuals or populations being modelled. Such behaviour is irreducible.
Finally, we offer an example of a system, first proposed by Chaitin, that
exhibits strong OEE.

 <dc:title>Window Parity Games: An Alternative Approach Toward Parity Games with

 <dc:description>  Classical objectives in two-player zero-sum games played on graphs often deal
with limit behaviors of infinite plays: e.g., mean-payoff and total-payoff in
the quantitative setting, or parity in the qualitative one (a canonical way to
encode omega-regular properties). Those objectives offer powerful abstraction
mechanisms and often yield nice properties such as memoryless determinacy.
However, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which
something good can be witnessed. In this work, we consider two approaches
toward inclusion of time bounds in parity games. The first one, parity-response
games, is based on the notion of finitary parity games [CHH09] and parity games
with costs [FZ14,WZ16]. The second one, window parity games, is inspired by
window mean-payoff games [CDRR15]. We compare the two approaches and show that
while they prove to be equivalent in some contexts, window parity games offer a
more tractable alternative when the time bound is given as a parameter (P-c.
vs. PSPACE-c.). In particular, it provides a conservative approximation of
parity games computable in polynomial time. Furthermore, we extend both
approaches to the multi-dimension setting. We give the full picture for both
types of games with regard to complexity and memory bounds.

 <dc:description>  In the context of load balancing, Lu et al. introduced the distributed
Join-Idle-Queue algorithm, where a group of dispatchers distribute jobs to a
cluster of parallel servers. Each dispatcher maintains a queue of idle servers;
when a job arrives to a dispatcher, it sends it to a server on its queue, or to
a random server if the queue is empty. In turn, when a server has no jobs, it
requests to be placed on the idle queue of a randomly chosen dispatcher.
  Although this algorithm was shown to be quite effective, the original
asymptotic analysis makes simplifying assumptions that become increasingly
inaccurate as the system load increases. Further, the analysis does not
naturally generalize to interesting variations, such as having a server request
to be placed on the idle queue of a dispatcher before it has completed all
jobs, which can be beneficial under high loads.
  We provide a new asymptotic analysis of Join-Idle-Queue systems based on mean
field fluid limit methods, deriving families of differential equations that
describe these systems. Our analysis avoids previous simplifying assumptions,
is empirically more accurate, and generalizes naturally to the variation
described above, as well as other simple variations. Our theoretical and
empirical analyses shed further light on the performance of Join-Idle-Queue,
including potential performance pitfalls under high load.

 <dc:description>  The rapid growth of the availability of wearable biosensors has created the
opportunity for using biological signals to measure worker performance. An
important question is how to use such signals to not just measure, but actually
predict worker performance on a task under stressful and potentially high risk
conditions. Here we show that the biological signal known as galvanic skin
response (GSR) allows such a prediction. We conduct an experiment where
subjects answer arithmetic questions under low and high stress conditions while
having their GSR monitored using a wearable biosensor. Using only the GSR
measured under low stress conditions, we are able to predict which subjects
will perform well under high stress conditions, achieving an area under the
curve (AUC) of 0.76. If we try to make similar predictions without using any
biometric signals, the AUC barely exceeds 0.50. Our result suggests that
performance in high stress conditions can be predicted using signals obtained
from wearable biosensors in low stress conditions.

 <dc:description>  In mobile wireless networks with blockage, different users, and/or a single
user at different time slots, may be blocked by some common obstacles.
Therefore the temporal correlation of interference does not depend only on the
user displacement law but also on the spatial correlation introduced by the
obstacles. In this letter, we show that in mobile networks with a high density
of users, blockage increases the temporal correlation of interference, while in
sparse networks blockage has the opposite effect.

 <dc:description>  Random walks on regular bounded degree expander graphs have numerous
applications. A key property of these walks is that they converge rapidly to
the uniform distribution on the vertices. The recent study of expansion of high
dimensional simplicial complexes, which are the high dimensional analogues of
graphs, calls for the natural generalization of random walks to higher
dimensions. In particular, a high order random walk on a $2$-dimensional
simplicial complex moves at random between neighboring edges of the complex,
where two edges are considered neighbors if they share a common triangle. We
show that if a regular $2$-dimensional simplicial complex is a cosystolic
expander and the underlying graph of the complex has a spectral gap larger than
$1/2$, then the random walk on the edges of the complex converges rapidly to
the uniform distribution on the edges.

 <dc:description>  Modeling textual or visual information with vector representations trained
from large language or visual datasets has been successfully explored in recent
years. However, tasks such as visual question answering require combining these
vector representations with each other. Approaches to multimodal pooling
include element-wise product or sum, as well as concatenation of the visual and
textual representations. We hypothesize that these methods are not as
expressive as an outer product of the visual and textual vectors. As the outer
product is typically infeasible due to its high dimensionality, we instead
propose utilizing Multimodal Compact Bilinear pooling (MCB) to efficiently and
expressively combine multimodal features. We extensively evaluate MCB on the
visual question answering and grounding tasks. We consistently show the benefit
of MCB over ablations without MCB. For visual question answering, we present an
architecture which uses MCB twice, once for predicting attention over spatial
features and again to combine the attended representation with the question
representation. This model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the Visual7W
dataset and the VQA challenge.

 <dc:description>  Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is expected to enable a number of new
services and applications in future mobile networks and has attracted
significant research interest over the last few years. Remarkably, little
attention has been placed on the issue of D2D communication for users belonging
to different operators. In this paper, we focus on this aspect for D2D users
that belong to different tenants (virtual network operators), assuming
virtualized and programmable future 5G wireless networks. Under the assumption
of a cross-tenant orchestrator, we show that significant gains can be achieved
in terms of network performance by optimizing resource sharing from the
different tenants, i.e., slices of the substrate physical network topology. To
this end, a sum-rate optimization framework is proposed for optimal sharing of
the virtualized resources. Via a wide site of numerical investigations, we
prove the efficacy of the proposed solution and the achievable gains compared
to legacy approaches.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Bayesian Poisson Tucker decomposition (BPTD) for modeling
country--country interaction event data. These data consist of interaction
events of the form &quot;country $i$ took action $a$ toward country $j$ at time
$t$.&quot; BPTD discovers overlapping country--community memberships, including the
number of latent communities. In addition, it discovers directed
community--community interaction networks that are specific to &quot;topics&quot; of
action types and temporal &quot;regimes.&quot; We show that BPTD yields an efficient MCMC
inference algorithm and achieves better predictive performance than related
models. We also demonstrate that it discovers interpretable latent structure
that agrees with our knowledge of international relations.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present high-level overviews of tile-based self-assembling
systems capable of producing complex, infinite, aperiodic structures known as
discrete self-similar fractals. Fractals have a variety of interesting
mathematical and structural properties, and by utilizing the bottom-up growth
paradigm of self-assembly to create them we not only learn important techniques
for building such complex structures, we also gain insight into how similar
structural complexity arises in natural self-assembling systems. Our results
fundamentally leverage hierarchical assembly processes, and use as our building
blocks square &quot;tile&quot; components which are capable of activating and
deactivating their binding &quot;glues&quot; a constant number of times each, based only
on local interactions. We provide the first constructions capable of building
arbitrary discrete self-similar fractals at scale factor 1, and many at
temperature 1 (i.e. &quot;non-cooperatively&quot;), including the Sierpinski triangle.

 <dc:description>  Multivariate time series data in practical applications, such as health care,
geoscience, and biology, are characterized by a variety of missing values. In
time series prediction and other related tasks, it has been noted that missing
values and their missing patterns are often correlated with the target labels,
a.k.a., informative missingness. There is very limited work on exploiting the
missing patterns for effective imputation and improving prediction performance.
In this paper, we develop novel deep learning models, namely GRU-D, as one of
the early attempts. GRU-D is based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a
state-of-the-art recurrent neural network. It takes two representations of
missing patterns, i.e., masking and time interval, and effectively incorporates
them into a deep model architecture so that it not only captures the long-term
temporal dependencies in time series, but also utilizes the missing patterns to
achieve better prediction results. Experiments of time series classification
tasks on real-world clinical datasets (MIMIC-III, PhysioNet) and synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance and
provides useful insights for better understanding and utilization of missing
values in time series analysis.

 <dc:description>  We consider an agent's uncertainty about its environment and the problem of
generalizing this uncertainty across observations. Specifically, we focus on
the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. Drawing
inspiration from the intrinsic motivation literature, we use density models to
measure uncertainty, and propose a novel algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count
from an arbitrary density model. This technique enables us to generalize
count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case. We apply our ideas
to Atari 2600 games, providing sensible pseudo-counts from raw pixels. We
transform these pseudo-counts into intrinsic rewards and obtain significantly
improved exploration in a number of hard games, including the infamously
difficult Montezuma's Revenge.

 <dc:description>  Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising technology for realizing
energy-efficient wireless sensors for long-term health monitoring. In this
paper, we propose a data-driven CS framework that learns signal characteristics
and individual variability from patients' data to significantly enhance CS
performance and noise resilience. This is accomplished by a co-training
approach that optimizes both the sensing matrix and dictionary towards improved
restricted isometry property (RIP) and signal sparsity, respectively.
Experimental results upon ECG signals show that our framework is able to
achieve better reconstruction quality with up to 80% higher compression ratio
(CP) than conventional frameworks based on random sensing matrices and
overcomplete bases. In addition, our framework shows great noise resilience
capability, which tolerates up to 40dB higher noise energy at a CP of 9 times.

 <dc:description>  The observation of objects located in inaccessible regions is a recurring
challenge in a wide variety of important applications. Recent work has shown
that indirect diffuse light reflections can be used to reconstruct objects and
two-dimensional (2D) patterns around a corner. However, these prior methods
always require some specialized setup involving either ultrafast detectors or
narrowband light sources. Here we show that occluded objects can be tracked in
real time using a standard 2D camera and a laser pointer. Unlike previous
methods based on the backprojection approach, we formulate the problem in an
analysis-by-synthesis sense. By repeatedly simulating light transport through
the scene, we determine the set of object parameters that most closely fits the
measured intensity distribution. We experimentally demonstrate that this
approach is capable of following the translation of unknown objects, and
translation and orientation of a known object, in real time.

 <dc:description>  Typical security contests focus on breaking or mitigating the impact of buggy
systems. We present the Build-it Break-it Fix-it BIBIFI contest which aims to
assess the ability to securely build software not just break it. In BIBIFI
teams build specified software with the goal of maximizing correctness
performance and security. The latter is tested when teams attempt to break
other teams submissions. Winners are chosen from among the best builders and
the best breakers. BIBIFI was designed to be open-ended - teams can use any
language tool process etc. that they like. As such contest outcomes shed light
on factors that correlate with successfully building secure software and
breaking insecure software. During we ran three contests involving a total of
teams and two different programming problems. Quantitative analysis from these
contests found that the most efficient build-it submissions used CC but
submissions coded in a statically-typed language were less likely to have a
security flaw build-it teams with diverse programming-language knowledge also
produced more secure code. Shorter programs correlated with better scores.
Break-it teams that were also build-it teams were significantly better at
finding security bugs.

 <dc:description>  I review the advancements of atomic scale nanoelectronics towards quantum
neuromorphics. First, I summarize the key properties of elementary combinations
of few neurons, namely long-- and short--term plasticity, spike-timing
dependent plasticity (associative plasticity), quantumness and stochastic
effects, and their potential computational employment. Next, I review several
atomic scale device technologies developed to control electron transport at the
atomic level, including single atom implantation for atomic arrays and CMOS
quantum dots, single atom memories, Ag$_2$S and Cu$_2$S atomic switches,
hafnium based RRAMs, organic material based transistors, Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$
synapses. Each material/method proved successful in achieving some of the
properties observed in real neurons. I compare the different methods towards
the creation of a new generation of naturally inspired and biophysically
meaningful artificial neurons, in order to replace the rigid CMOS based
neuromorphic hardware. The most challenging aspect to address appears to obtain
both the stochastic/quantum behavior and the associative plasticity, which are
currently observed only below and above 20 nm length scale respectively, by
employing the same material.

and present a method to learn an optimization algorithm, which we believe to be
the first method that can automatically discover a better algorithm. We
approach this problem from a reinforcement learning perspective and represent
any particular optimization algorithm as a policy. We learn an optimization
algorithm using guided policy search and demonstrate that the resulting
algorithm outperforms existing hand-engineered algorithms in terms of
convergence speed and/or the final objective value.

 <dc:description>  A path integral formalism has been proposed recently for non-equilibrium

an efficient method for its numerical evaluation. The method used is based on
the multiscale MCMC method of Ceperley and co-workers in quantum applications.
A significant new feature of the method proposed is that the time endpoint is
not fixed and indeed the endpoint sample is the principle object of interest.

goal. This paper develops the ontology of the SSA domain and takes steps in the
creation of the space situational awareness ontology. Ontology objectives,
requirements and desiderata are outlined; and both the SSA domain and the
discipline of ontology are described. The purposes of the ontology include:
exploring the potential for ontology development and engineering to (i)
represent SSA data, general domain knowledge, objects and relationships (ii)
annotate and express the meaning of that data, and (iii) foster SSA
data-exchange and integration among SSA actors, orbital debris databases, space
object catalogs and other SSA data repositories. By improving SSA via data- and
knowledge-sharing, we can (iv) expand our scientific knowledge of the space
environment, (v) advance our capacity for planetary defense from near-Earth
objects, and (vi) ensure the future of safe space flight for generations to
come.

 <dc:description>  In the Proper Interval Vertex Deletion problem (PIVD for short), we are given
a graph $G$ and an integer parameter $k&gt;0$, and the question is whether there
are at most $k$ vertices in $G$ whose removal results in a proper interval
graph. It is known that the PIVD problem is fixed-parameter tractable and
admits a polynomial but &quot;unreasonably&quot; large kernel of $O(k^{53})$ vertices. A
natural question is whether the problem admits a polynomial kernel of
&quot;reasonable&quot; size. In this paper, we answer this question by deriving an
$O(k^7)$-vertex kernel for the PIVD problem. Our kernelization is based on
several new observations and a refined analysis of the kernelization.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: This paper is combined with another paper where a significantly
  improved kernel of size O(k^4) is obtained. Due to this reason, the authors
  withdraw this paper</dc:description>

 <dc:description>  We propose and investigate a semantics for &quot;peer data exchange systems&quot; where
different peers are related by data exchange constraints and trust
relationships. These two elements plus the data at the peers' sites and their
local integrity constraints are made compatible via a semantics that
characterizes sets of &quot;solution instances&quot; for the peers. They are the intended
-possibly virtual- instances for a peer that are obtained through a data repair
semantics that we introduce and investigate. The semantically correct answers
from a peer to a query, the so-called &quot;peer consistent answers&quot;, are defined as
those answers that are invariant under all its different solution instances. We
show that solution instances can be specified as the models of logic programs
with a stable model semantics. The repair semantics is based on null values as
used in SQL databases, and is also of independent interest for repairs of
single databases with respect to integrity constraints.

 <dc:description>  Understanding and even defining what constitutes animal interactions remains
a challenging problem. Correlational tools may be inappropriate for detecting
communication between a set of many agents exhibiting nonlinear behavior. A
different approach is to define coordinated motions in terms of an information
theoretic channel of direct causal information flow. In this work, we consider
time series data obtained by an experimental protocol of optical tracking of
the insect species Chironomus riparius. The data constitute reconstructed 3-D
spatial trajectories of the insects' flight trajectories and kinematics. We
present an application of the optimal causation entropy (oCSE) principle to
identify direct causal relationships or information channels among the insects.
The collection of channels inferred by oCSE describes a network of information
flow within the swarm. We find that information channels with a long spatial
range are more common than expected under the assumption that causal
information flows should be spatially localized. The tools developed herein are
general and applicable to the inference and study of intercommunication
networks in a wide variety of natural settings.

approach uses attention to decompose the problem into subproblems that can be
solved separately, thus making it trivially parallelizable. On the Stanford
Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, we obtain state-of-the-art results
with almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters than previous work and
without relying on any word-order information. Adding intra-sentence attention
that takes a minimum amount of order into account yields further improvements.

 <dc:title>A generalized formulation for vehicle routing problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Different types of formulations are proposed in the literature to model
vehicle routing problems. Currently, the most used ones can be fitted into two
classes, namely vehicle flow formulations and set partitioning formulations.
These types of formulations differ from each other not only due to their
variables and constraints but also due to their main features. Vehicle flow
formulations have the advantage of being compact models, so general-purpose
optimization packages can be used to straightforwardly solve them. However,
they typically show weak linear relaxations and have a large number of
constraints. Branch-and-cut methods based on specialized valid inequalities can
also be devised to solve these formulations, but they have not shown to be
effective for large-scale instances. On the other hand, set partitioning
formulations have stronger linear relaxations, but requires the implementation
of sophisticate techniques such as column generation and specialized
branch-and-price methods. Due to all these reasons, so far it is has been
recognized in the vehicle routing community that these two types of
formulations are rather different. In this paper, we show that they are
actually strongly related as they correspond to special cases of a generalized
formulation of vehicle routing problems.

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the improvement of energy efficiency in wireless sensor
networks (WSN).Taking into consideration the power saving problem which is of
crucial importance when the sensors are supplied by a limited power source,
this paper proposes a method that optimizes as much as possible the
transmission power of the sensors. Under the assumption of perfect channel
between the Base Station (BS) and the Sensor Nodes (SN's) and with sufficient
power resources at the BS, transferring the effort of transmission power to the
BS will not be a peculiar issue. This paper proposes a method that reduces the
transmitted data at the SN's and compensate this by requesting the variance of
the measured value form predicted values. Furthermore, a request management
algorithm (RMA) is developed to reduce the amount of requested data based on
consecutive successive predictions. The result of this method reveals a major
impact on reducing the transmission power at the SN's. Keywords: Wireless
Sensor Networks, Data Reduction, Time Series Forecasting, Artificial Neural
Networks.

 <dc:description>  ALOHA-type protocols became a popular solution for distributed and
uncoordinated multiple random access in wireless networks. However, such
distributed operation of the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer leads to
sub-optimal utilization of the shared channel. One of the reasons is the
occurrence of collisions when more than one packet is transmitted at the same
time. These packets cannot be decoded and retransmissions are necessary.
However, it has been recently shown that it is possible to apply signal
processing techniques with these collided packets so that useful information
can be decoded. This was recently proposed in the Irregular Repetition Slotted
ALOHA (IRSA), achieving a throughput $T \simeq 0.97$ for very large MAC frame
lengths as long as the number of active users is smaller than the number of
slots per frame. In this paper, we extend the operation of IRSA with i) an
iterative physical layer decoding processing that exploits the capture effect
and ii) a Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) processing at the
slot-level, named intra-slot SIC, to decode more than one colliding packet per
slot. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, referred to as
Extended IRSA (E-IRSA), in terms of throughput and channel capacity.
Computer-based simulation results show that E-IRSA protocol allows to reach the
maximum theoretical achievable throughput even in scenarios where the number of
active users is higher than the number of slots per frame. Results also show
that E-IRSA protocol significantly improves the performance even for small MAC
frame lengths used in practical scenarios.

 <dc:description>  In this paper an innovative Radio Resource Management (RRM) algorithm is
proposed with the purpose of increasing High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)
performances, in terms of system capacity and service quality, when the
Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Services (MBMS) is supplied. The proposed RRM
algorithm exploits channel quality indications to set up point-to-multipoint
connections to subgroups of multicast users and to select the proper modulation
and coding schemes on the downlink. The number of subgroups is determined
through an optimization technique that also takes into account the user
satisfaction. An exhaustive simulation campaign is conducted to compare the
proposed algorithm with the most promising approaches in the literature.
Comparisons aim to assess the capability of the proposed RRM algorithm to
efficiently manage group oriented services by providing an increment in terms
of user satisfaction.

 <dc:description>  With the increased demand for power efficiency in feedback-control systems,
communication is becoming a limiting factor, raising the need to trade off the
external cost that they incur with the capacity of the controller's
communication channels. With a proper design of the channels, this translates
into a sequential rate-distortion problem, where we minimize the rate of
information required for the controller's operation under a constraint on its
external cost. Memoryless controllers are of particular interest both for the
simplicity and frugality of their implementation and as a basis for studying
more complex controllers. In this paper we present the optimality principle for
memoryless linear controllers that utilize minimal information rates to achieve
a guaranteed external-cost level. We also study the interesting and useful
phenomenology of the optimal controller, such as the principled reduction of
its order.

 <dc:description>  Retentive (memory-utilizing) sensing-acting agents may operate under
limitations on the communication between their sensing, memory and acting
components, requiring them to trade off the external cost that they incur with
the capacity of their communication channels. In this paper we formulate this
problem as a sequential rate-distortion problem of minimizing the rate of
information required for the controller's operation under a constraint on its
external cost. We reduce this bounded retentive control problem to the
memoryless one, studied in Part I of this work, by viewing the memory reader as
one more sensor and the memory writer as one more actuator. We further
investigate the structure of the resulting optimal solution and demonstrate its
interesting phenomenology.

 <dc:description>  Demand response provides utilities with a mechanism to share with end users
the stochasticity resulting from the use of renewable sources. Pricing is
accordingly used to reflect energy availability, to allocate such a limited
resource to those loads that value it most. However, the strictly competitive
mechanism can result in service interruption in presence of competing demand.
To solve this issue we investigate on the use of forward contracts, i.e.,
service level agreements priced to reflect the expectation of future supply and
demand curves. Given the limited resources of microgrids, service interruption
is an opposite objective to the one of service availability. We firstly design
policy-based brokers and identify then a learning broker based on artificial
neural networks. We show the latter being progressively minimizing the
reimbursement costs and maximizing the overall profit.

 <dc:description>  A novel interference management approach is proposed for modern communication
scenarios, where multiple applications and networks coexist on the same channel
resource. The leading principle behind the proposed approach is that the
interference level should be adapted to the content being transmitted by the
data links to maximize the amount of delivered information. A network setting
is considered where Device-to-Device (D2D) communications underlay a Long Term
Evolution (LTE) link uploading video content to the network infrastructure. For
this scenario, an optimization problem is formulated aiming at the maximization
of the D2D throughput under a constraint on the Peak Signal-to-Noise-Ratio of
the video data stream. The resulting optimal policy focuses interference on
specific packets within the video stream, and significantly increases the
throughput achieved by the D2D link compared to an undifferentiated
interference strategy. The optimal strategy is applied to a real-world video
streaming application to further demonstrate the performance gain.

 <dc:title>Reliable Querying of Very Large, Fast Moving and Noisy Predicted

 <dc:description>  The abundance of predicted and mined but uncertain biological data show huge
needs for massive, efficient and scalable curation efforts. The human expertise
warranted by any successful curation enterprize is often economically
prohibitive especially for speculative end user queries that may not ultimately
bear fruit. So the challenge remains in devising a low cost engine capable of
delivering fast but tentative annotation and curation of a set of data items
that can be authoritatively validated by experts later demanding significantly
small investment. The aim thus is to make a large volume of predicted data
available for use as early as possible with an acceptable degree of confidence
in their accuracy while the curation continues. In this paper, we present a
novel approach to annotation and curation of biological database contents using
crowd computing. The technical contribution is in the identification and
management of trust of mechanical turks, and support for ad hoc declarative
queries, both of which are leveraged to support reliable analytics using noisy
predicted interactions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the efficient deployment of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) with directional antennas acting as wireless base stations that provide
coverage for ground users is analyzed. First, the downlink coverage probability
for UAVs as a function of the altitude and the antenna gain is derived. Next,
using circle packing theory, the three-dimensional locations of the UAVs is
determined in a way that the total coverage area is maximized while maximizing
the coverage lifetime of the UAVs. Our results show that, in order to mitigate
interference, the altitude of the UAVs must be properly adjusted based on the
beamwidth of the directional antenna as well as coverage requirements.
Furthermore, the minimum number of UAVs needed to guarantee a target coverage
probability for a given geographical area is determined. Numerical results
evaluate the various tradeoffs involved in various UAV deployment scenarios.

 <dc:title>Content-based Cognitive Interference Control for City Monitoring
  Applications in the Urban IoT</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the Urban Internet of Things devices and systems are interconnected at the
city scale to provide innovative services to the citizens.However, the traffic
generated by the sensing and processing systems may overload local access
networks. A coexistence problem arises where concurrent applications mutually
interfere and compete for available resources. This effect is further
aggravated by the multiple scales involved and heterogeneity of the networks
supporting the urban IoT. One of the main contributions of this paper is the
introduction of the notion of content-oriented cognitive interference control
in heterogeneous local access networks supporting computing and data processing
in the urban IoT. A network scenario where multiple communication technologies,
such as Device-to-Device and Long Term Evolution (LTE), is considered. The
focus of the present paper is on city monitoring applications, where a video
data stream generated by a camera system is remotely processed to detect
objects. The cognitive network paradigm is extended to dynamically shape the
interference pattern generated by concurrent data streams and induce a packet
loss trajectory compatible with video processing algorithms. Numerical results
show that the proposed cognitive transmission strategy enables a significant
throughput increase of interfering applications for a target accuracy of the
monitoring application.

 <dc:description>  Graphical simulations are a cornerstone of modern media and films. But
existing software packages are designed to run on HPC nodes, and perform poorly
in the computing cloud. These simulations have complex data access patterns
over complex data structures, and mutate data arbitrarily, and so are a poor
fit for existing cloud computing systems. We describe a software architecture
for running graphical simulations in the cloud that decouples control logic,
computations and data exchanges. This allows a central controller to balance
load by redistributing computations, and recover from failures. Evaluations
show that the architecture can run existing, state-of-the-art simulations in
the presence of stragglers and failures, thereby enabling this large class of
applications to use the computing cloud for the first time.

 <dc:description>  As the security landscape evolves over time, where thousands of species of
malicious codes are seen every day, antivirus vendors strive to detect and
classify malware families for efficient and effective responses against malware
campaigns. To enrich this effort, and by capitalizing on ideas from the social
network analysis domain, we build a tool that can help classify malware
families using features driven from the graph structure of their system calls.
To achieve that, we first construct a system call graph that consists of system
calls found in the execution of the individual malware families. To explore
distinguishing features of various malware species, we study social network
properties as applied to the call graph, including the degree distribution,
degree centrality, average distance, clustering coefficient, network density,
and component ratio. We utilize features driven from those properties to build
a classifier for malware families. Our experimental results show that
influence-based graph metrics such as the degree centrality are effective for
classifying malware, whereas the general structural metrics of malware are less
effective for classifying malware. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed system performs well in detecting and classifying malware families
within each malware class with accuracy greater than 96%.

 <dc:description>  Large scale cloud data analytics applications are often CPU bound. Most of
these cycles are wasted: benchmarks written in C++ run 10-51 times faster than
frameworks such as Naiad and Spark. However, calling faster implementations
from those frameworks only sees moderate (3-5x) speedups because their control
planes cannot schedule work fast enough.
  This paper presents execution templates, a control plane abstraction for
CPU-bound cloud applications, such as machine learning. Execution templates
leverage highly repetitive control flow to cache scheduling decisions as {\it
templates}. Rather than reschedule hundreds of thousands of tasks on every loop
execution, nodes instantiate these templates. A controller's template specifies
the execution across all worker nodes, which it partitions into per-worker
templates. To ensure that templates execute correctly, controllers dynamically
patch templates to match program control flow. We have implemented execution
templates in Nimbus, a C++ cloud computing framework. Running in Nimbus,
analytics benchmarks can run 16-43 times faster than in Naiad and Spark.
Nimbus's control plane can scale out to run these faster benchmarks on up to
100 nodes (800 cores).

information controls, a data-driven understanding of the phenomenon has
remained elusive. In this paper, we consider two design points in the space of
Internet censorship measurement with particular emphasis on how they address
the challenges of locating vantage points, choosing content to test, and
analyzing results. We discuss the trade offs of decisions made by each platform
and show how the resulting data provides complementary views of global
censorship. Finally, we discuss lessons learned and open challenges discovered
through our experiences.

diminishing benefits from Moore's law and Dennard scaling. Software innovation,
on the other hand, is flourishing, helped in good measure by a thriving
open-source ecosystem. We believe that open source can similarly help hardware
innovation, but has not yet due to several reasons. We identify these reasons
and how the industry, academia, and the hardware community at large can come
together to address them.

 <dc:description>  Recent results show that deep neural networks achieve excellent performance
even when, during training, weights are quantized and projected to a binary
representation. Here, we show that this is just the tip of the iceberg: these
same networks, during testing, also exhibit a remarkable robustness to
distortions beyond quantization, including additive and multiplicative noise,
and a class of non-linear projections where binarization is just a special
case. To quantify this robustness, we show that one such network achieves 11%
test error on CIFAR-10 even with 0.68 effective bits per weight. Furthermore,
we find that a common training heuristic--namely, projecting quantized weights
during backpropagation--can be altered (or even removed) and networks still
achieve a base level of robustness during testing. Specifically, training with
weight projections other than quantization also works, as does simply clipping
the weights, both of which have never been reported before. We confirm our
results for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Finally, drawing from these ideas,
we propose a stochastic projection rule that leads to a new state of the art
network with 7.64% test error on CIFAR-10 using no data augmentation.

 <dc:description>  In two-way channels, each user transmits and receives at the same time. This
allows each encoder to interactively adapt the current input to its own message
and all previously received signals. Such coding approach can introduce
correlation between inputs of different users, since all the users' outputs are
correlated by the nature of the channel. However, for some channels, such
adaptation in the coding scheme and its induced correlation among users are
useless in the sense that they do not help enlarge the capacity region with
respect to the standard coding method (where each user encodes only based on
its own message). In this paper, it is shown that adaptation is not helpful for
enlarging the capacity region of two classes of two-way discrete channels: the
modulo additive-noise channel with memory and the multiple access/degraded
broadcast channel.

 <dc:description>  Inferring implicit discourse relations in natural language text is the most
difficult subtask in discourse parsing. Surface features achieve good
performance, but they are not readily applicable to other languages without
semantic lexicons. Previous neural models require parses, surface features, or
a small label set to work well. Here, we propose neural network models that are
based on feedforward and long-short term memory architecture without any
surface features. To our surprise, our best configured feedforward architecture
outperforms LSTM-based model in most cases despite thorough tuning. Under
various fine-grained label sets and a cross-linguistic setting, our feedforward
models perform consistently better or at least just as well as systems that
require hand-crafted surface features. Our models present the first neural
Chinese discourse parser in the style of Chinese Discourse Treebank, showing
that our results hold cross-linguistically.

 <dc:description>  How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like &quot;Who
created the character Harry Potter&quot;? Carefully built knowledge bases provide
rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid
questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one
question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions --- ones that
can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a
Conditional Focused neural-network-based approach to answering factoid
questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find
more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a
unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural
networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7%
on a dataset of 108k questions - the largest public one to date. It outperforms
the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8%.

 <dc:description>  We propose to enhance the RNN decoder in a neural machine translator (NMT)
with external memory, as a natural but powerful extension to the state in the
decoding RNN. This memory-enhanced RNN decoder is called \textsc{MemDec}. At
each time during decoding, \textsc{MemDec} will read from this memory and write
to this memory once, both with content-based addressing. Unlike the unbounded
memory in previous work\cite{RNNsearch} to store the representation of source
sentence, the memory in \textsc{MemDec} is a matrix with pre-determined size
designed to better capture the information important for the decoding process
at each time step. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows
that it can improve by $4.8$ BLEU upon Groundhog and $5.3$ BLEU upon on Moses,
yielding the best performance achieved with the same training set.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) often makes mistakes in translating
low-frequency content words that are essential to understanding the meaning of
the sentence. We propose a method to alleviate this problem by augmenting NMT
systems with discrete translation lexicons that efficiently encode translations
of these low-frequency words. We describe a method to calculate the lexicon
probability of the next word in the translation candidate by using the
attention vector of the NMT model to select which source word lexical
probabilities the model should focus on. We test two methods to combine this
probability with the standard NMT probability: (1) using it as a bias, and (2)
linear interpolation. Experiments on two corpora show an improvement of 2.0-2.3
BLEU and 0.13-0.44 NIST score, and faster convergence time.

 <dc:description>  Internet of Things (IoT) aims to bring every object (e.g. smart cameras,
wearable, environmental sensors, home appliances, and vehicles) online, hence
generating massive amounts of data that can overwhelm storage systems and data
analytics applications. Cloud computing offers services at the infrastructure
level that can scale to IoT storage and processing requirements. However, there
are applications such as health monitoring and emergency response that require
low latency, and delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and then back
to the application can seriously impact their performances. To overcome this
limitation, Fog computing paradigm has been proposed, where cloud services are
extended to the edge of the network to decrease the latency and network
congestion. To realize the full potential of Fog and IoT paradigms for
real-time analytics, several challenges need to be addressed. The first and
most critical problem is designing resource management techniques that
determine which modules of analytics applications are pushed to each edge
device to minimize the latency and maximize the throughput. To this end, we
need a evaluation platform that enables the quantification of performance of
resource management policies on an IoT or Fog computing infrastructure in a
repeatable manner. In this paper we propose a simulator, called iFogSim, to
model IoT and Fog environments and measure the impact of resource management
techniques in terms of latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and
cost. We describe two case studies to demonstrate modeling of an IoT
environment and comparison of resource management policies. Moreover,
scalability of the simulation toolkit in terms of RAM consumption and execution
time is verified under different circumstances.

 <dc:description>  Conventional change detection methods require a large number of images to
learn background models or depend on tedious pixel-level labeling by humans. In
this paper, we present a weakly supervised approach that needs only image-level
labels to simultaneously detect and localize changes in a pair of images. To
this end, we employ a deep neural network with DAG topology to learn patterns
of change from image-level labeled training data. On top of the initial CNN
activations, we define a CRF model to incorporate the local differences and
context with the dense connections between individual pixels. We apply a
constrained mean-field algorithm to estimate the pixel-level labels, and use
the estimated labels to update the parameters of the CNN in an iterative EM
framework. This enables imposing global constraints on the observed foreground
probability mass function. Our evaluations on four benchmark datasets
demonstrate superior detection and localization performance.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the potential of attention-based neural machine translation in
simultaneous translation. We introduce a novel decoding algorithm, called
simultaneous greedy decoding, that allows an existing neural machine
translation model to begin translating before a full source sentence is
received. This approach is unique from previous works on simultaneous
translation in that segmentation and translation are done jointly to maximize
the translation quality and that translating each segment is strongly
conditioned on all the previous segments. This paper presents a first step
toward building a full simultaneous translation system based on neural machine
translation.

 <dc:description>  LSM-tree has been widely used in cloud computing systems by Google, Facebook,
and Amazon, to achieve high performance for write-intensive workloads. However,
in LSM-tree, random key-value queries can experience long latency and low
throughput due to the interference from the compaction, a basic operation in
the algorithm, to caching. LSM-tree relies on frequent compaction operations to
merge data into a sorted structure. After a compaction, the original data are
reorganized and written to other locations on the disk. As a result, the cached
data are invalidated since their referencing addresses are changed, causing
serious performance degradations.
  We propose dLSM in order to re-enable high-speed caching during intensive
writes. dLSM is an LSM-tree with a compaction buffer on the disk, working as a
cushion to minimize the cache invalidation caused by compactions. The
compaction buffer maintains a series of snapshots of the frequently compacted
data, which represent a consistent view of the corresponding data in the
underlying LSM-tree. Being updated in a much lower rate than that of
compactions, data in the compaction buffer are almost stationary. In dLSM, an
object is referenced by the disk address of the corresponding block either in
the compaction buffer for frequently compacted data, or in the underlying
LSM-tree for infrequently compacted data. Thus, hot objects can be effectively
kept in the cache without harmful invalidations. With the help of a small
on-disk compaction buffer, dLSM achieves a high query performance by enabling
effective caching, while retaining all merits of LSM-tree for write-intensive
data processing. We have implemented dLSM based on LevelDB. Our evaluations
show that with a standard DRAM cache, dLSM can achieve 5--8x performance
improvement over LSM with the same cache on HDD storage.

 <dc:description>  In a traditional formal development process, e.g. using the B method, the
informal user requirements are (manually) translated into a global abstract
formal specification. This translation is especially difficult to achieve. The
Event-B method was developed to incrementally and formally construct such a
specification using stepwise refinement. Each increment takes into account new
properties and system aspects. In this paper, we propose to couple a graphical
notation called Algebraic State-Transition Diagrams (ASTD) with an Event-B
specification in order to provide a better understanding of the software
behaviour. The dynamic behaviour is captured by the ASTD, which is based on
automata and process algebra operators, while the data model is described by
means of an Event-B specification. We propose a methodology to incrementally
refine such specification couplings, taking into account new refinement
relations and consistency conditions between the control specification and the
data specification. We compare the specifications obtained using each approach
for readability and proof complexity. The advantages and drawbacks of the
traditional approach and of our methodology are discussed. The whole process is
illustrated by a railway CBTC-like case study. Our approach is supported by
tools for translating ASTD's into B and Event-B into B.

 <dc:description>  &quot;Big data&quot; has become a major area of research and associated funding, as
well as a focus of utopian thinking. In the still growing research community,
one of the favourite optimistic analogies for data processing is that of the
oil refinery, extracting the essence out of the raw data. Pessimists look for
their imagery to the other end of the petrol cycle, and talk about the &quot;data
exhausts&quot; of our society.
  Obviously, the refinement community knows how to do &quot;refining&quot;. This paper
explores the extent to which notions of refinement and data in the formal
methods community relate to the core concepts in &quot;big data&quot;. In particular, can
the data refinement paradigm can be used to explain aspects of big data
processing?

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present the denotational semantics for channel mobility in
the Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) semantics framework. The basis for
the model is the UTP theory of reactive processes (precisely, the UTP semantics
for Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)), which is slightly extended to
allow the mobility of channels: the set of actions in which a process is
authorised to participate, originally static or constant (set during the
process's definition), is now made dynamic or variable: it can change during
the process's execution. A channel is thus moved around by communicating it via
other channels and then allowing the receiving process to extend its alphabet
with the received channel. New healthiness conditions are stated to ensure an
appropriate use of mobile channels.

 <dc:description>  Hierarchical transition systems provide a popular mathematical structure to
represent state-based software applications in which different layers of
abstraction are represented by inter-related state machines. The decomposition
of high level states into inner sub-states, and of their transitions into inner
sub-transitions is common refinement procedure adopted in a number of
specification formalisms.
  This paper introduces a hybrid modal logic for k-layered transition systems,
its first-order standard translation, a notion of bisimulation, and a modal
invariance result. Layered and hierarchical notions of refinement are also
discussed in this setting.

 <dc:description>  Relative correctness is the property of a program to be more-correct than
another program with respect to a given specification. Among the many
properties of relative correctness, that which we found most intriguing is the
property that program P' refines program P if and only if P' is more-correct
than P with respect to any specification. This inspires us to reconsider
program derivation by successive refinements: each step of this process
mandates that we transform a program P into a program P' that refines P, i.e.
P' is more-correct than P with respect to any specification. This raises the
question: why should we want to make P' more-correct than P with respect to any
specification, when we only have to satisfy specification R? In this paper, we
discuss a process of program derivation that replaces traditional sequence of
refinement-based correctness-preserving transformations starting from
specification R by a sequence of relative correctness-based
correctness-enhancing transformations starting from abort.

 <dc:description>  Safety-Critical Java (SCJ) is a version of Java whose goal is to support the
development of real-time, embedded, safety-critical software. In particular,
SCJ supports certification of such software by introducing abstractions that
enforce a simpler architecture, and simpler concurrency and memory models. In
this paper, we present SCJ-Circus, a refinement-oriented formal notation that
supports the specification and verification of low-level programming models
that include the new abstractions introduced by SCJ. SCJ-Circus is part of the
family of state-rich process algebra Circus, as such, SCJ-Circus includes the
Circus constructs for modelling sequential and concurrent behaviour, real-time
and object orientation. We present here the syntax and semantics of SCJ-Circus,
which is defined by mapping SCJ-Circus constructs to those of standard Circus.
This is based on an existing approach for modelling SCJ programs. We also
extend an existing Circus-based refinement strategy that targets SCJ programs
to account for the generation of SCJ-Circus models close to implementations in
SCJ.

 <dc:description>  Algorithmic and data refinement are well studied topics that provide a
mathematically rigorous approach to gradually introducing details in the
implementation of software. Program refinements are performed in the context of
some programming language, but mainstream languages lack features for recording
the sequence of refinement steps in the program text. To experiment with the
combination of refinement, automated verification, and language design,
refinement features have been added to the verification-aware programming
language Dafny. This paper describes those features and reflects on some
initial usage thereof.

 <dc:title>Towards linking correctness conditions for concurrent objects and

 <dc:description>  Correctness conditions for concurrent objects describe how atomicity of an
abstract sequential object may be decomposed. Many different concurrent objects
and proof methods for them have been developed. However, arguments about
correctness are conducted with respect to an object in isolation. This is in
contrast to real-world practice, where concurrent objects are often implemented
as part of a programming language library (e.g., java.util.concurrent) and are
instantiated within a client program. A natural question to ask, then is: How
does a correctness condition for a concurrent object ensure correctness of a
client program that uses the concurrent object? This paper presents the main
issues that surround this question and provides some answers by linking
different correctness conditions with a form of trace refinement.

 <dc:description>  Service composition has become commonplace nowadays, in large part due to the
increased complexity of software and supporting networks. Composition can be of
many types, for instance sequential, prioritising, non-deterministic. However,
a fundamental feature of the services to be composed consists in their
dependencies with respect to each other. In this paper we propose a theory of
service dependency, modelled around a dependency operator in the Action Systems
formalism. We analyze its properties, composition behaviour, and refinement
conditions with accompanying examples.

condition of engineering artifacts. However, the quality property is affected
by the diversity of conceptions around the model-driven paradigm. In this
document is presented a report of quality issues on modelling languages and

 <dc:title>Hand Action Detection from Ego-centric Depth Sequences with

 <dc:description>  Detecting hand actions from ego-centric depth sequences is a practically
challenging problem, owing mostly to the complex and dexterous nature of hand
articulations as well as non-stationary camera motion. We address this problem
via a Hough transform based approach coupled with a discriminatively learned
error-correcting component to tackle the well known issue of incorrect votes
from the Hough transform. In this framework, local parts vote collectively for
the start $\&amp;$ end positions of each action over time. We also construct an
in-house annotated dataset of 300 long videos, containing 3,177 single-action
subsequences over 16 action classes collected from 26 individuals. Our system
is empirically evaluated on this real-life dataset for both the action
recognition and detection tasks, and is shown to produce satisfactory results.
To facilitate reproduction, the new dataset and our implementation are also
provided online.

 <dc:description>  The Google DeepMind challenge match in March 2016 was a historic achievement
for computer Go development. This article discusses the development of
computational intelligence (CI) and its relative strength in comparison with
human intelligence for the game of Go. We first summarize the milestones
achieved for computer Go from 1998 to 2016. Then, the computer Go programs that
have participated in previous IEEE CIS competitions as well as methods and
techniques used in AlphaGo are briefly introduced. Commentaries from three
high-level professional Go players on the five AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol games
are also included. We conclude that AlphaGo beating Lee Sedol is a huge
achievement in artificial intelligence (AI) based largely on CI methods. In the
future, powerful computer Go programs such as AlphaGo are expected to be
instrumental in promoting Go education and AI real-world applications.

 <dc:title>User Cooperation for Enhanced Throughput Fairness in Wireless Powered

 <dc:description>  This paper studies a novel user cooperation method in a wireless powered
communication network (WPCN), where a pair of distributed terminal users first
harvest wireless energy broadcasted by one energy node (EN) and then use the
harvested energy to transmit information cooperatively to a destination node
(DN). In particular, the two cooperating users exchange their independent
information with each other to form a virtual antenna array and transmit
jointly to the DN. By allowing each user to allocate part of its harvested
energy to transmit the other's information, the proposed cooperation can
effectively mitigate the user unfairness problem in WPCNs, where a user may
suffer from very low data rate due to the poor energy harvesting performance
and high data transmission consumptions. We derive the maximum common
throughput achieved by the cooperation scheme through optimizing the time
allocation on wireless energy transfer, user message exchange, and joint
information transmissions. Through comparing with some representative benchmark
schemes, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed user
cooperation in enhancing the throughput performance under different setups.

 <dc:description>  Prior to seeking professional medical care it is increasingly common for
patients to use online resources such as automated symptom checkers. Many such
systems attempt to provide a differential diagnosis based on the symptoms
elucidated from the user, which may lead to anxiety if life or limb-threatening
conditions are part of the list, a phenomenon termed 'cyberchondria' [1].
Systems that provide advice on where to seek help, rather than a diagnosis, are
equally popular, and in our view provide the most useful information. In this
technical report we describe how such a triage system can be modelled
computationally, how medical insights can be translated into triage flows, and
how such systems can be validated and tested. We present babylon check, our
commercially deployed automated triage system, as a case study, and illustrate
its performance in a large, semi-naturalistic deployment study.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Quantization Matrices for HD and UHD Display Resolutions in
  Scalable HEVC</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prangnell, Lee</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sanchez, Victor</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Other Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  HEVC contains an option to enable custom quantization matrices, which are
designed based on the Human Visual System and a 2D Contrast Sensitivity
Function. Visual Display Units, capable of displaying video data at High
Definition and Ultra HD display resolutions, are frequently utilized on a
global scale. Video compression artifacts that are present due to high levels
of quantization, which are typically inconspicuous in low display resolution
environments, are clearly visible on HD and UHD video data and VDUs. The
default QM technique in HEVC does not take into account the video data
resolution, nor does it take into consideration the associated display
resolution of a VDU to determine the appropriate levels of quantization
required to reduce unwanted video compression artifacts. Based on this fact, we
propose a novel, adaptive quantization matrix technique for the HEVC standard,
including Scalable HEVC. Our technique, which is based on a refinement of the
current HVS-CSF QM approach in HEVC, takes into consideration the display
resolution of the target VDU for the purpose of minimizing video compression
artifacts. In SHVC SHM 9.0, and compared with anchors, the proposed technique
yields important quality and coding improvements for the Random Access
configuration, with a maximum of 56.5% luma BD-Rate reductions in the
enhancement layer. Furthermore, compared with the default QMs and the Sony QMs,
our method yields encoding time reductions of 0.75% and 1.19%, respectively.

 <dc:description>  This work studies path planning in two-dimensional space, in the presence of
polygonal obstacles. We specifically address the problem of building a roadmap
graph, that is, an abstract representation of all the paths that can
potentially be followed around a given set of obstacles. Our solution consists
in an original refinement algorithm for constrained Delaunay triangulations,
aimed at generating a roadmap graph suited for planning paths with arbitrary
clearance. In other words, a minimum distance to the obstacles can be
specified, and the graph does not have to be recomputed if this distance is
modified. Compared to other solutions, our approach has the advantage of being
simpler, as well as significantly more efficient.

 <dc:title>Regret Bounds for Non-decomposable Metrics with Missing Labels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of recommending relevant labels (items) for a given
data point (user). In particular, we are interested in the practically
important setting where the evaluation is with respect to non-decomposable
(over labels) performance metrics like the $F_1$ measure, and the training data
has missing labels. To this end, we propose a generic framework that given a
performance metric $\Psi$, can devise a regularized objective function and a
threshold such that all the values in the predicted score vector above and only
above the threshold are selected to be positive. We show that the regret or
generalization error in the given metric $\Psi$ is bounded ultimately by
estimation error of certain underlying parameters. In particular, we derive
regret bounds under three popular settings: a) collaborative filtering, b)
multilabel classification, and c) PU (positive-unlabeled) learning. For each of
the above problems, we can obtain precise non-asymptotic regret bound which is
small even when a large fraction of labels is missing. Our empirical results on
synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate that by explicitly modeling for
missing labels and optimizing the desired performance metric, our algorithm
indeed achieves significantly better performance (like $F_1$ score) when
compared to methods that do not model missing label information carefully.

 <dc:description>  5G wireless networks are expected to support new services with stringent
requirements on data rates, latency and reliability. One novel feature is the
ability to serve a dense crowd of devices, calling for radically new ways of
accessing the network. This is the case in machine-type communications, but
also in urban environments and hotspots. In those use cases, the high number of
devices and the relatively short channel coherence interval do not allow
per-device allocation of orthogonal pilot sequences. This article motivates the
need for random access by the devices to pilot sequences used for channel
estimation, and shows that Massive MIMO is a main enabler to achieve fast
access with high data rates, and delay-tolerant access with different data rate
levels. Three pilot access protocols along with data transmission protocols are
described, fulfilling different requirements of 5G services.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel encoding/transmission scheme called continuous chain (CC)
transmission that is able to improve the finite-length performance of a system
using spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes. In CC
transmission, instead of transmitting a sequence of independent codewords from
a terminated SC-LDPC code chain, we connect multiple chains in a layered
format, where encoding, transmission, and decoding are now performed in a
continuous fashion. The connections between chains are created at specific
points, chosen to improve the finite-length performance of the code structure
under iterative decoding. We describe the design of CC schemes for different
SC-LDPC code ensembles constructed from protographs: a (J,K)-regular SC-LDPC
code chain, a spatially-coupled repeat-accumulate (SC-RA) code, and a
spatially-coupled accumulate-repeat-jagged-accumulate (SC- ARJA) code. In all
cases, significant performance improvements are reported and, in addition, it
is shown that using CC transmission only requires a small increase in decoding
complexity and decoding delay with respect to a system employing a single
SC-LDPC code chain for transmission.

 <dc:description>  Monocular scene reconstruction is essential for modern applications such as
robotics or autonomous driving. Although stereo methods usually result in
better accuracy than monocular methods, they are more expensive and more
difficult to calibrate. In this work, we present a novel second order optimal
minimum energy filter that jointly estimates the camera motion, the disparity
map and also higher order kinematics recursively on a product Lie group
containing a novel disparity group. This mathematical framework enables to cope
with non-Euclidean state spaces, non-linear observations and high dimensions
which is infeasible for most classical filters. To be robust against outliers,
we use a generalized Charbonnier energy function in this framework rather than
a quadratic energy function as proposed in related work. Experiments confirm
that our method enables accurate reconstructions on-par with state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a novel playlist generation algorithm that focuses on the
quality of transitions using a recurrent neural network (RNN). The proposed
model assumes that optimal transitions between tracks can be modelled and
predicted by internal transitions within music tracks. We introduce modelling
sequences of high-level music descriptors using RNNs and discuss an experiment
involving different similarity functions, where the sequences are provided by a
musical structural analysis algorithm. Qualitative observations show that the
proposed approach can effectively model transitions of music tracks in
playlists.

 <dc:description>  On the Optimizing of Wireless Networks and toward improving the future 5th
Generation mobile Network Infrastructure, we propose a novel infrastructure
that can be the next Smart City Network. Our proposed Infrastructure takes into
consideration most future demands and challenges, includes Capacity,
Reliability, Scalability, and Flexibility. To deal with this issues we propose
a wireless network infrastructure that is based on latest technologies of
Massive MIMO systems. We further extend our infrastructure with many smart
features, to be capable of coping with Cloud Computing, Smartphones, IoT and
other intelligence-based services. The proposed infrastructure uses Network
Functions Virtualization (NFV), Software-Defined Networking
  (SDN), Virtual Antenna Arrays (VAA) and Joint Beamforming to afford
flexibility. We further propose a Terminal-centric rather than a Cell-centric
based Infrastructure, which optimize interference aware environment and lead to
higher capacity and reliability. The new infrastructure includes multi-purpose
nodes that run a Network Operating System (NOS). This node will afford a
scalable and flexible cost effective and semi-distributed network resources.
Other propositions that meet Power-Effective, Cost-Effective, and Scenery aware
design are discussed. Keywords - Wireless Network Infrastructure, Massive MIMO,
Joint Beamforming, Cloud-based Networks, NFV, SDN, Cloud Computing, Grid
Computing, and Distributed Systems.

 <dc:title>A general scheme for information interception in the ping pong protocol</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The existence of an undetectable eavesdropping of dense coded information has
been already demonstrated by Pavi\v{c}i\'c for the quantum direct communication
based on the ping-pong paradigm. However, a) the explicit scheme of the circuit
is only given and no design rules are provided, b) the existence of losses is
implicitly assumed, c) the attack has been formulated against qubit based
protocol only and it is not clear whether it can be adapted to higher
dimensional systems. These deficiencies are removed in the presented
contribution. A new generic eavesdropping scheme built on a firm theoretical
background is proposed. In contrast to the previous approach, it does not refer
to the properties of the vacuum state, so it is fully consistent with the
absence of losses assumption. Moreover, the scheme applies to the communication
paradigm based on signal particles of any dimensionality. It is also shown that
some well known attacks are special cases of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  Users of a personalised recommendation system face a dilemma: recommendations
can be improved by learning from data, but only if the other users are willing
to share their private information. Good personalised predictions are vitally
important in precision medicine, but genomic information on which the
predictions are based is also particularly sensitive, as it directly identifies
the patients and hence cannot easily be anonymised. Differential privacy has
emerged as a potentially promising solution: privacy is considered sufficient
if presence of individual patients cannot be distinguished. However,
differentially private learning with current methods does not improve
predictions with feasible data sizes and dimensionalities. Here we show that
useful predictors can be learned under powerful differential privacy
guarantees, and even from moderately-sized data sets, by demonstrating
significant improvements with a new robust private regression method in the
accuracy of private drug sensitivity prediction. The method combines two key
properties not present even in recent proposals, which can be generalised to
other predictors: we prove it is asymptotically consistently and efficiently
private, and demonstrate that it performs well on finite data. Good finite data
performance is achieved by limiting the sharing of private information by
decreasing the dimensionality and by projecting outliers to fit tighter bounds,
therefore needing to add less noise for equal privacy. As already the
simple-to-implement method shows promise on the challenging genomic data, we
anticipate rapid progress towards practical applications in many fields, such
as mobile sensing and social media, in addition to the badly needed precision
medicine solutions.

 <dc:title>Goal Set Inverse Optimal Control and Iterative Re-planning for

 <dc:description>  To enable safe and efficient human-robot collaboration in shared workspaces
it is important for the robot to predict how a human will move when performing
a task. While predicting human motion for tasks not known a priori is very
challenging, we argue that single-arm reaching motions for known tasks in
collaborative settings (which are especially relevant for manufacturing) are
indeed predictable. Two hypotheses underlie our approach for predicting such
motions: First, that the trajectory the human performs is optimal with respect
to an unknown cost function, and second, that human adaptation to their
partner's motion can be captured well through iterative re-planning with the
above cost function. The key to our approach is thus to learn a cost function
which &quot;explains&quot; the motion of the human. To do this, we gather example
trajectories from pairs of participants performing a collaborative assembly
task using motion capture. We then use Inverse Optimal Control to learn a cost
function from these trajectories. Finally, we predict reaching motions from the
human's current configuration to a task-space goal region by iteratively
re-planning a trajectory using the learned cost function. Our planning
algorithm is based on the trajectory optimizer STOMP, it plans for a 23 DoF
human kinematic model and accounts for the presence of a moving collaborator
and obstacles in the environment. Our results suggest that in most cases, our
method outperforms baseline methods when predicting motions. We also show that
our method outperforms baselines for predicting human motion when a human and a
robot share the workspace.

 <dc:description>  A critical challenge is to enable IoT application development with minimal
effort from various stakeholders involved in the development process. Several
approaches to tacking this challenge have been proposed in the fields of
wireless sensor networks and ubiquitous and pervasive computing, regarded as
precursors to the modern day of IoT. However, although existing approaches
provide a wide range of features, stakeholders have specific application
development requirements and choosing an appropriate approach requires thorough
evaluations on different aspects. To date, this aspect has been investigated to
a limited extend. In view of this, this paper provides an extensive set of
evaluations based on our previous work on IoT application development
framework. Specifically, we evaluate our approach in terms of (1) development
effort: the effort required to create a new application, (2) reusability: the
extend to which software artifacts can be reused during application
development, (3) expressiveness: the characteristics of IoT applications that
can be modeled using our approach, (4) memory metrics: the amount of memory and
storage a device needs to consume in order to run an application under our
framework, and (5) comparison of our approach with state of the art in IoT
application development on various dimensions, which does not only provide a
comprehensive view of state of the art, but also guides developers in selecting
an approach given application requirements in hand. We believe that the above
different aspects provide the research community with insight into evaluating,
selecting, and developing useful IoT frameworks and applications.

 <dc:description>  As alignment links are not given between English sentences and Abstract
Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs in the AMR annotation, automatic alignment
becomes indispensable for training an AMR parser. Previous studies formalize it
as a string-to-string problem and solve it in an unsupervised way, which
suffers from data sparseness due to the small size of training data for
English-AMR alignment. In this paper, we formalize it as a syntax-based
alignment problem and solve it in a supervised manner based on syntax trees,
which can address the data sparseness problem by generalizing English-AMR
tokens to syntax tags. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method not only for English-AMR alignment, but also for AMR parsing.

 <dc:description>  We examine the dimensional limitations of Licensed Shared Access (LSA)
regulatory framework for spectrum sharing and propose a solution for its more
dynamic implementation. We consider an additional dimension for sharing, beyond
those of time, space and frequency, i.e. the sharing of the infrastructure. We
explain why we believe that the emerging regulations and use-case scenarios are
limiting the potential of LSA, and with this in mind make a set of
recommendations to unlock it fully. As a specific case study, we present our
architectural work around Cloud-based Radio Access Network (C-RAN) and LSA to
demonstrate the possibility of a dynamic implementation of multiple incumbents
and multiple LSA licensees engaged in sharing. Our case study highlights
multiple ways for LSA framework to evolve into a global and flexible sharing
model, and prove that LSA and C-RAN are a good match to rethink how we look at
networks targeting a more flexible, efficient and profitable way of operating
them.

 <dc:description>  With the advent of 5G, standardization and research are currently defining
the next generation of the radio access. Considering the high constraints
imposed by the future standards, disruptive technologies such as Massive MIMO
and mmWave are being proposed. At the heart of this process are wireless
channel models that now need to cover a massive increase in design parameters,
a large variety of frequency bands, and heterogeneous deployments. This
tutorial describes how channel models address this new level of complexity and
which tools the community prepares to efficiently but accurately capture the
upcoming changes in radio access design. We analyze the main drivers behind
these new modeling tools, the challenges they pose, and survey the current
approaches to overcome them.

 <dc:description>  Estimating the temperature distribution within Li-ion batteries during
operation is critical for safety and control purposes. Although existing
control-oriented thermal models - such as thermal equivalent circuits (TEC) -
are computationally efficient, they only predict average temperatures, and are
unable to predict the spatially resolved temperature distribution throughout
the cell. We present a low-order 2D thermal model of a cylindrical battery
based on a Chebyshev spectral-Galerkin (SG) method, capable of predicting the
full temperature distribution with a similar efficiency to a TEC. The model
accounts for transient heat generation, anisotropic heat conduction, and
non-homogeneous convection boundary conditions. The accuracy of the model is
validated through comparison with finite element simulations, which show that
the 2-D temperature field (r, z) of a large format (64 mm diameter) cell can be
accurately modelled with as few as 4 states. Furthermore, the performance of
the model for a range of Biot numbers is investigated via frequency analysis.
For larger cells or highly transient thermal dynamics, the model order can be
increased for improved accuracy. The incorporation of this model in a state
estimation scheme with experimental validation against thermocouple
measurements is presented in the companion contribution (Part II).

 <dc:description>  The ability to perform pixel-wise semantic segmentation in real-time is of
paramount importance in mobile applications. Recent deep neural networks aimed
at this task have the disadvantage of requiring a large number of floating
point operations and have long run-times that hinder their usability. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture named ENet
(efficient neural network), created specifically for tasks requiring low
latency operation. ENet is up to 18$\times$ faster, requires 75$\times$ less
FLOPs, has 79$\times$ less parameters, and provides similar or better accuracy
to existing models. We have tested it on CamVid, Cityscapes and SUN datasets
and report on comparisons with existing state-of-the-art methods, and the
trade-offs between accuracy and processing time of a network. We present
performance measurements of the proposed architecture on embedded systems and
suggest possible software improvements that could make ENet even faster.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the structure of isometric subgraphs of hypercubes (i.e.,
partial cubes) which do not contain finite convex subgraphs contractible to the
3-cube minus one vertex $Q^-_3$ (here contraction means contracting the edges
corresponding to the same coordinate of the hypercube). Extending similar
results for median and cellular graphs, we show that the convex hull of an
isometric cycle of such a graph is gated and isomorphic to the Cartesian
product of edges and even cycles. Furthermore, we show that our graphs are
exactly the class of partial cubes in which any finite convex subgraph can be
obtained from the Cartesian products of edges and even cycles via successive
gated amalgams. This decomposition result enables us to establish a variety of
results. In particular, it yields that our class of graphs generalizes median
and cellular graphs, which motivates naming our graphs hypercellular.
Furthermore, we show that hypercellular graphs are tope graphs of zonotopal
complexes of oriented matroids. Finally, we characterize hypercellular graphs
as being median-cell -- a property naturally generalizing the notion of median
graphs.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the problem of designing a distributed graph
visualization algorithm for large graphs. The algorithm must be simple to
implement and the computing infrastructure must not require major hardware or
software investments. We design, implement, and experiment a force-directed
algorithm in Giraph, a popular open source framework for distributed computing,
based on a vertex-centric design paradigm. The algorithm is tested both on real
and artificial graphs with up to million edges, by using a rather inexpensive
PaaS (Platform as a Service) infrastructure of Amazon. The experiments show the
scalability and effectiveness of our technique when compared to a centralized
implementation of the same force-directed model. We show that graphs with about
one million edges can be drawn in less than 8 minutes, by spending about 1\$
per drawing in the cloud computing infrastructure.

 <dc:description>  There is a neglected fact in the traditional machine learning methods that
the data sampling can actually lead to the solution sampling. We consider this
observation to be important because having the solution sampling available
makes the variable distribution estimation, which is a problem in many
learning-related applications, more tractable. In this paper, we implement this
idea on correlation filter, which has attracted much attention in the past few
years due to its high performance with a low computational cost. More
specifically, we propose a new method, named latent constrained correlation
filters (LCCF) by mapping the correlation filters to a given latent subspace,
in which we establish a new learning framework that embeds distribution-related
constraints into the original problem. We further introduce a subspace based
alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) to efficiently solve the
optimization problem, which is proved to converge at the saddle point. Our
approach is successfully applied to two different tasks inclduing eye
localization and car detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LCCF
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods when samples are suffered from noise
and occlusion.

 <dc:description>  The calculus of finite differences is a solid foundation for the development
of operations such as the derivative and the integral for infinite sequences.
Here we showed a way to extend it for finite sequences. We could then define
convexity for finite sequences and some related concepts. To finalize, we
propose a way to go from our extension to the calculus of finite differences.

 <dc:description>  An efficient learner is one who reuses what they already know to tackle a new
problem. For a machine learner, this means understanding the similarities
amongst datasets. In order to do this, one must take seriously the idea of
working with datasets, rather than datapoints, as the key objects to model.
Towards this goal, we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder
that can learn a method for computing representations, or statistics, of
datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce
statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset. Hence the
network enables efficient learning from new datasets for both unsupervised and
supervised tasks. We show that we are able to learn statistics that can be used
for: clustering datasets, transferring generative models to new datasets,
selecting representative samples of datasets and classifying previously unseen
classes. We refer to our model as a neural statistician, and by this we mean a
neural network that can learn to compute summary statistics of datasets without
supervision.

 <dc:description>  Monitoring Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are composed of sensor nodes that
report temperature, relative humidity, and other environmental parameters. The
time between two successive measurements is a critical parameter to set during
the WSN configuration because it can impact the WSN's lifetime, the wireless
medium contention and the quality of the reported data. As trends in monitored
parameters can significantly vary between scenarios and within time,
identifying a sampling interval suitable for several cases is also challenging.
In this work, we propose a dynamic sampling rate adaptation scheme based on
reinforcement learning, able to tune sensors' sampling interval on-the-fly,
according to environmental conditions and application requirements. The primary
goal is to set the sampling interval to the best value possible so as to avoid
oversampling and save energy, while not missing environmental changes that can
be relevant for the application. In simulations, our mechanism could reduce up
to 73% the total number of transmissions compared to a fixed strategy and,
simultaneously, keep the average quality of information provided by the WSN.
The inherent flexibility of the reinforcement learning algorithm facilitates
its use in several scenarios, so as to exploit the broad scope of the Internet
of Things.

 <dc:description>  Among the many functions a Smart City must support, transportation dominates
in terms of resource consumption, strain on the environment, and frustration of
its citizens. We study transportation networks under two different routing
policies, the commonly assumed selfish user-centric routing policy and a
socially-optimal system-centric one. We consider a performance metric of
efficiency - the Price of Anarchy (PoA) - defined as the ratio of the total
travel latency cost under selfish routing over the corresponding quantity under
socially-optimal routing. We develop a data-driven approach to estimate the
PoA, which we subsequently use to conduct a case study using extensive actual
traffic data from the Eastern Massachusetts road network. To estimate the PoA,
our approach learns from data a complete model of the transportation network,
including origin-destination demand and user preferences. We leverage this
model to propose possible strategies to reduce the PoA and increase efficiency.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops an analytical method of truncating inequality constrained
Gaussian distributed variables where the constraints are themselves described
by Gaussian distributions. Existing truncation methods either assume hard
constraints, or use numerical methods to handle uncertain constraints. The
proposed approach introduces moment-based Gaussian approximations of the
truncated distribution. This method can be applied to numerous problems, with
the motivating problem being Kalman filtering with uncertain constraints. In a
simulation example, the developed method is shown to outperform unconstrained
Kalman filtering by over 40% and hard-constrained Kalman filtering by over 17%.

 <dc:description>  Given a task of predicting $Y$ from $X$, a loss function $L$, and a set of
probability distributions $\Gamma$ on $(X,Y)$, what is the optimal decision
rule minimizing the worst-case expected loss over $\Gamma$? In this paper, we
address this question by introducing a generalization of the principle of
maximum entropy. Applying this principle to sets of distributions with marginal
on $X$ constrained to be the empirical marginal from the data, we develop a
general minimax approach for supervised learning problems. While for some loss
functions such as squared-error and log loss, the minimax approach rederives
well-knwon regression models, for the 0-1 loss it results in a new linear
classifier which we call the maximum entropy machine. The maximum entropy
machine minimizes the worst-case 0-1 loss over the structured set of
distribution, and by our numerical experiments can outperform other well-known
linear classifiers such as SVM. We also prove a bound on the generalization
worst-case error in the minimax approach.

 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes the relationship between initialization error and recall
of a specific memory in the Grover algorithm for quantum database search. It is
shown that the correct memory is obtained with high probability even when the
initial state is far removed from the correct one. The analysis is done by
relating the variance of error in the initial state to the recovery of the
correct memory and the surprising result is obtained that the relationship
between the two is essentially linear.

 <dc:description>  Supervised learning of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can require very
large amounts of labeled data. Labeling thousands or millions of training
examples can be extremely time consuming and costly. One direction towards
addressing this problem is to create features from unlabeled data. In this
paper we propose a new method for training a CNN, with no need for labeled
instances. This method for unsupervised feature learning is then successfully
applied to a challenging object recognition task. The proposed algorithm is
relatively simple, but attains accuracy comparable to that of more
sophisticated methods. The proposed method is significantly easier to train,
compared to existing CNN methods, making fewer requirements on manually labeled
training data. It is also shown to be resistant to overfitting. We provide
results on some well-known datasets, namely STL-10, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100.
The results show that our method provides competitive performance compared with
existing alternative methods. Selective Convolutional Neural Network (S-CNN) is
a simple and fast algorithm, it introduces a new way to do unsupervised feature
learning, and it provides discriminative features which generalize well.

 <dc:title>Energy-Aware Relay Selection and Power Allocation for Multiple-User
  Cooperative Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the relay assignment and power allocation problem for
two different network power management policies: group lifetime maximization
(GLM) and minimum weighted total power (MWTP), with the aim of lifetime
maximization in symbol error rate (SER) constrained multipleuser cooperative
network. With optimal power allocation solution obtained for each policy, we
show that the optimal relay assignment can be obtained using bottleneck
matching (BM) algorithm and minimum weighted matching (MWM) algorithm for GLM
and MWTP policies, respectively. Since relay assignment with BM algorithm is
not power efficient, we propose a novel minimum bottleneck matching (MBM)
algorithm to solve the relay assignment problem optimally for GLM policy. To
further reduce the complexity of the relay assignment, we propose suboptimal
relay selection (SRS) algorithm which has linear complexity in number of source
and relay nodes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed relay
selection and power allocation strategies based on GLM policy have better
network lifetime performance over the strategies based on MWTP policy. Compared
to the MBM and SRS algorithm, relay assignment based on BM algorithm for GLM
policy has inferior network lifetime performance at low update interval. We
show that relay assignment based on MBM algorithm achieves maximum network
lifetime performance and relay assignment with SRS algorithm has performance
very close to it.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A non-aligned drawing of a graph is a drawing where no two vertices are in
the same row or column. Auber et al. showed that not all planar graphs have
non-aligned drawings that are straight-line, planar, and in the
minimal-possible $n\times n$-grid. They also showed that such drawings exist if
up to $n-3$ edges may have a bend. In this paper, we give algorithms for
non-aligned planar drawings that improve on the results by Auber et al. In
particular, we give such drawings in an $n\times n$-grid with significantly
fewer bends, and we study what grid-size can be achieved if we insist on having
straight-line drawings.

 <dc:description>  Security Games employ game theoretical tools to derive resource allocation
strategies in security domains. Recent works considered the presence of alarm
systems, even suffering various forms of uncertainty, and showed that
disregarding alarm signals may lead to arbitrarily bad strategies. The central
problem with an alarm system, unexplored in other Security Games, is finding
the best strategy to respond to alarm signals for each mobile defensive
resource. The literature provides results for the basic single-resource case,
showing that even in that case the problem is computationally hard. In this
paper, we focus on the challenging problem of designing algorithms scaling with
multiple resources. First, we focus on finding the minimum number of resources
assuring non-null protection to every target. Then, we deal with the
computation of multi-resource strategies with different degrees of coordination
among resources. For each considered problem, we provide a computational
analysis and propose algorithmic methods.

 <dc:title>Distributed Model Predictive Control of Spatially Interconnected Systems

 <dc:description>  This note proposes a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme with
switched cost functions for a class of spatially interconnected systems with
communication constraints. Non-iterative and parallel communication strategy is
considered to ensure that all distributed controllers complete input updates at
each single information exchange step. The proposed DMPC scheme switches the
optimization index on a switching surface generated by control invariant sets.
With the index-switching strategy, stability of the origin is ensured by a
terminal control law. Convergence conditions of the optimal cost to zero are
established taking into account the causal link between the presumed trajectory
and the optimized trajectory of the previous step. The compatibility
constraints preserve the quadratic program property that is desired in
practical applications. It is also observed that the proposed DMPC scheme has
benefits dealing with systems that need to take into account safety-related
spatial constraints.

 <dc:description>  The paper systematically studies the impact of a range of recent advances in
CNN architectures and learning methods on the object categorization (ILSVRC)
problem. The evalution tests the influence of the following choices of the
architecture: non-linearity (ReLU, ELU, maxout, compatibility with batch
normalization), pooling variants (stochastic, max, average, mixed), network
width, classifier design (convolutional, fully-connected, SPP), image
pre-processing, and of learning parameters: learning rate, batch size,
cleanliness of the data, etc.
  The performance gains of the proposed modifications are first tested
individually and then in combination. The sum of individual gains is bigger
than the observed improvement when all modifications are introduced, but the
&quot;deficit&quot; is small suggesting independence of their benefits. We show that the
use of 128x128 pixel images is sufficient to make qualitative conclusions about
optimal network structure that hold for the full size Caffe and VGG nets. The
results are obtained an order of magnitude faster than with the standard 224
pixel images.

 <dc:description>  The Internet's importance for promoting free and open communication has led
to widespread crackdowns on its use in countries around the world. In this
study, we investigate the relationship between national policies around freedom
of speech and Internet topology in countries around the world. We combine
techniques from network measurement and machine learning to identify features
of Internet structure at the national level that are the best indicators of a
country's level of freedom. We find that IP density and path lengths to other
countries are the best indicators of a country's freedom. We also find that our
methods predict freedom categories for countries with 91% accuracy.

 <dc:description>  The massive availability of digital repositories of human thought opens
radical novel way of studying the human mind. Natural language processing tools
and computational models have evolved such that many mental conditions are
predicted by analysing speech. Transcription of interviews and discourses are
analyzed using syntactic, grammatical or sentiment analysis to infer the mental
state. Here we set to investigate if classification of Bipolar and control
subjects is possible. We develop the Emotion Intensity Index based on the
Dictionary of Affect, and find that subjects categories are distinguishable.
Using classical classification techniques we get more than 75\% of labeling
performance. These results sumed to previous studies show that current
automated speech analysis is capable of identifying altered mental states
towards a quantitative psychiatry.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study how to draw trees so that they are planar,
straight-line and respect a given order of edges around each node. We focus on
minimizing the height, and show that we can always achieve a height of at most
2pw(T)+1, where pw(T) (the so-called pathwidth) is a known lower bound on the
height. Hence we give an asymptotic 2-approximation algorithm. We also create a
drawing whose height is at most 3pw(T ), but where the width can be bounded by
the number of nodes. Finally we construct trees that require height 2pw(T)+1 in
all planar order-preserving straight-line drawings.

 <dc:description>  The plethora of existing data models and specific data modeling techniques is
not only confusing but leads to complex, eclectic and inefficient designs of
systems for data management and analytics. The main goal of this paper is to
describe a unified approach to data modeling, called the concept-oriented model
(COM), by using functions as a basis for its formalization. COM tries to answer
the question what is data and to rethink basic assumptions underlying this and
related notions. Its main goal is to unify major existing views on data
(generality), using only a few main notions (simplicity) which are very close
to how data is used in real life (naturalness).

 <dc:description>  This publication presents a relation computation or calculus for
international relations using a mathematical modeling. It examined trust for
international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference,
Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic. Based on an observation in the
literature, we found no literature discussing the calculus method for the
international relations. To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation
algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method
will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and
incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to
demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will
deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to
support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense
ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense
(DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be identified as a
friendly, neutral or hostile nation.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel neural attention architecture to tackle machine
comprehension tasks, such as answering Cloze-style queries with respect to a
document. Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the query into a single
vector, instead we deploy an iterative alternating attention mechanism that
allows a fine-grained exploration of both the query and the document. Our model
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard machine comprehension
benchmarks such as CNN news articles and the Children's Book Test (CBT)
dataset.

 <dc:description>  On-demand curation (ODC) tools like Paygo, KATARA, and Mimir allow users to
defer expensive curation effort until it is necessary. In contrast to classical
databases that do not respond to queries over potentially erroneous data, ODC
systems instead answer with guesses or approximations. The quality and scope of
these guesses may vary and it is critical that an ODC system be able to
communicate this information to an end-user. The central contribution of this
paper is a preliminary user study evaluating the cognitive burden and
expressiveness of four representations of &quot;attribute-level&quot; uncertainty. The
study shows (1) insignificant differences in time taken for users to interpret
the four types of uncertainty tested, and (2) that different presentations of
uncertainty change the way people interpret and react to data. Ultimately, we
show that a set of UI design guidelines and best practices for conveying
uncertainty will be necessary for ODC tools to be effective. This paper
represents the first step towards establishing such guidelines.

 <dc:description>  Modeling the face aging process is a challenging task due to large and
non-linear variations present in different stages of face development. This
paper presents a deep model approach for face age progression that can
efficiently capture the non-linear aging process and automatically synthesize a
series of age-progressed faces in various age ranges. In this approach, we
first decompose the long-term age progress into a sequence of short-term
changes and model it as a face sequence. The Temporal Deep Restricted Boltzmann
Machines based age progression model together with the prototype faces are then
constructed to learn the aging transformation between faces in the sequence. In
addition, to enhance the wrinkles of faces in the later age ranges, the wrinkle
models are further constructed using Restricted Boltzmann Machines to capture
their variations in different facial regions. The geometry constraints are also
taken into account in the last step for more consistent age-progressed results.
The proposed approach is evaluated using various face aging databases, i.e.
FG-NET, Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD) and MORPH, and our collected
large-scale aging database named AginG Faces in the Wild (AGFW). In addition,
when ground-truth age is not available for input image, our proposed system is
able to automatically estimate the age of the input face before aging process
is employed.

 <dc:description>  We present the EpiReader, a novel model for machine comprehension of text.
Machine comprehension of unstructured, real-world text is a major research goal
for natural language processing. Current tests of machine comprehension pose
questions whose answers can be inferred from some supporting text, and evaluate
a model's response to the questions. The EpiReader is an end-to-end neural
model comprising two components: the first component proposes a small set of
candidate answers after comparing a question to its supporting text, and the
second component formulates hypotheses using the proposed candidates and the
question, then reranks the hypotheses based on their estimated concordance with
the supporting text. We present experiments demonstrating that the EpiReader
sets a new state-of-the-art on the CNN and Children's Book Test machine
comprehension benchmarks, outperforming previous neural models by a significant
margin.

 <dc:description>  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is one of the main workhorses of
probabilistic inference, but it is notoriously hard to measure the quality of
approximate posterior samples. This challenge is particularly salient in black
box inference methods, which can hide details and obscure inference failures.
In this work, we extend the recently introduced bidirectional Monte Carlo
technique to evaluate MCMC-based posterior inference algorithms. By running
annealed importance sampling (AIS) chains both from prior to posterior and vice
versa on simulated data, we upper bound in expectation the symmetrized KL
divergence between the true posterior distribution and the distribution of
approximate samples. We present Bounding Divergences with REverse Annealing
(BREAD), a protocol for validating the relevance of simulated data experiments
to real datasets, and integrate it into two probabilistic programming
languages: WebPPL and Stan. As an example of how BREAD can be used to guide the
design of inference algorithms, we apply it to study the effectiveness of
different model representations in both WebPPL and Stan.

 <dc:description>  The impact of culture in visual emotion perception has recently captured the
attention of multimedia research. In this study, we pro- vide powerful
computational linguistics tools to explore, retrieve and browse a dataset of
16K multilingual affective visual concepts and 7.3M Flickr images. First, we
design an effective crowdsourc- ing experiment to collect human judgements of
sentiment connected to the visual concepts. We then use word embeddings to
repre- sent these concepts in a low dimensional vector space, allowing us to
expand the meaning around concepts, and thus enabling insight about
commonalities and differences among different languages. We compare a variety
of concept representations through a novel evaluation task based on the notion
of visual semantic relatedness. Based on these representations, we design
clustering schemes to group multilingual visual concepts, and evaluate them
with novel metrics based on the crowdsourced sentiment annotations as well as
visual semantic relatedness. The proposed clustering framework enables us to
analyze the full multilingual dataset in-depth and also show an application on
a facial data subset, exploring cultural in- sights of portrait-related
affective visual concepts.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel semi-supervised structured output prediction method based
on local linear regression in this paper. The existing semi-supervise
structured output prediction methods learn a global predictor for all the data
points in a data set, which ignores the differences of local distributions of
the data set, and the effects to the structured output prediction. To solve
this problem, we propose to learn the missing structured outputs and local
predictors for neighborhoods of different data points jointly. Using the local
linear regression strategy, in the neighborhood of each data point, we propose
to learn a local linear predictor by minimizing both the complexity of the
predictor and the upper bound of the structured prediction loss. The
minimization problem is solved by sub-gradient descent algorithms. We conduct
experiments over two benchmark data sets, and the results show the advantages
of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been immensely successful in
many high-level computer vision tasks given large labeled datasets. However,
for video semantic object segmentation, a domain where labels are scarce,
effectively exploiting the representation power of CNN with limited training
data remains a challenge. Simply borrowing the existing pretrained CNN image
recognition model for video segmentation task can severely hurt performance. We
propose a semi-supervised approach to adapting CNN image recognition model
trained from labeled image data to the target domain exploiting both semantic
evidence learned from CNN, and the intrinsic structures of video data. By
explicitly modeling and compensating for the domain shift from the source
domain to the target domain, this proposed approach underpins a robust semantic
object segmentation method against the changes in appearance, shape and
occlusion in natural videos. We present extensive experiments on challenging
datasets that demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared
with the state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  The business elite constitutes a small but strikingly influential subset of
the population, oftentimes affecting important societal outcomes such as the
consolidation of political power, the adoption of corporate governance
practices, and the stability of national economies more broadly. Here we
analyze a unique dataset of all MBA students at a top 5 MBA program. After
matching students on all available characteristics (e.g., age, grade scores,
industry experience, etc.) - i.e. creating twin pairs - we find that the
distinguishing characteristics between students who do well in job placement
and those who do not is their network. Further, we find that the network
differences between the successful and unsuccessful students develops within
the first month of class and persists thereafter, suggesting a network
imprinting that is persistent. Finally, we find that these effects are
pronounced for students who are at the extreme ends of the distribution on
other measures of success - students with the best expected job placement do
particularly poorly without the right network (descenders), whereas students
with worst expected job placement pull themselves to the top of the placement
hierarchy (ascenders) with the right network.

 <dc:description>  It is a challenge for Phase Measurement Profilometry (PMP) to measure objects
with a large range of reflectivity variation across the surface. Saturated or
dark pixels in the deformed fringe patterns captured by the camera will lead to
phase fluctuations and errors. Jiang et al. proposed a high dynamic range
real-time 3D shape measurement method without changing camera exposures. Three
inverted phase-shifted fringe patterns are used to complement three regular
phase-shifted fringe patterns for phase retrieval when any of the regular
fringe patterns are saturated. But Jiang's method still has some drawbacks: (1)
The phases in saturated pixels are respectively estimated by different formulas
for different cases. It is shortage of an universal formula; (2) it cannot be
extended to four-step phase-shifting algorithm because inverted fringe patterns
are the repetition of regular fringe patterns; (3) only three unsaturated
intensity values at every pixel of fringe patterns are chosen for phase
demodulation, lying idle the other unsaturated ones. We proposed a method for
enhanced high dynamic range 3D shape measurement based on generalized
phase-shifting algorithm, which combines the complementary technique of
inverted and regular fringe patterns with generalized phase-shifting algorithm.
Firstly, two sets of complementary phase-shifted fringe patterns, namely
regular and inverted fringe patterns are projected and collected. Then all
unsaturated intensity values at the same camera pixel from two sets of fringe
patterns are selected, and employed to retrieve the phase by generalized
phase-shifting algorithm. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to
prove the validity of the proposed method. The results are analyzed and
compared with Jiang's method, which demonstrate that the proposed method not
only expands the scope of Jiang's method, but also improves the measurement
accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Measuring the relationship between any pair of variables is a rich and active
area of research that is central to scientific practice. In contrast,
characterizing the common information among any group of variables is typically
a theoretical exercise with few practical methods for high-dimensional data. A
promising solution would be a multivariate generalization of the famous Wyner
common information, but this approach relies on solving an apparently
intractable optimization problem. We leverage the recently introduced
information sieve decomposition to formulate an incremental version of the
common information problem that admits a simple fixed point solution, fast
convergence, and complexity that is linear in the number of variables. This
scalable approach allows us to demonstrate the usefulness of common information
in high-dimensional learning problems. The sieve outperforms standard methods
on dimensionality reduction tasks, solves a blind source separation problem
that cannot be solved with ICA, and accurately recovers structure in brain
imaging data.

 <dc:description>  Giving a formal semantic to an UML Activity diagram (UML AD) is a hard task.
The reason of this difficulty is the ambiguity and the absence of a precise
formal semantic of such semi-formal formalism. A variety of semantics exist in
the literature having tackled the aspects covered by this language. We can give
as example denotational, functional and compositional semantics. To cope with
the recent tendency which gave a heterogeneous semantic to UML diagrams, we aim
to define an algebraic presentation of the semantic of UML AD. In this work, we
define a formal semantic of UML 2.0 AD based on institution theory. For UML AD
formalism, which is a graphical language, no precise formal semantic is given
to it. We use the institution theory to define the intended semantic. Thus, the
UML AD formalism will be defined in its own natural semantic.

 <dc:description>  LSB steganography is a one of the most widely used methods for implementing
covert data channels in image file exchanges [1][2]. The low computational
complexity and implementation simplicity of the algorithm are significant
factors for its popularity with the primary reason being low image distortion.
Many attempts have been made to increase the embedding capacity of LSB
algorithms by expanding into the second or third binary layers of the image
while maintaining a low probability of detection with minimal distortive
effects [2][3][4]. In this paper, we introduce an advanced technique for
covertly embedding data within images using redundant number system
decomposition over non-standard digital bit planes. Both grayscale and
bit-mapped images are equally effective as cover files. It will be shown that
this unique steganography method has minimal visual distortive affects while
also preserving the cover file statistics, making it less susceptible to most
general steganography detection algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The ability to construct domain specific knowledge graphs (KG) and perform
question-answering or hypothesis generation is a transformative capability.
Despite their value, automated construction of knowledge graphs remains an
expensive technical challenge that is beyond the reach for most enterprises and
academic institutions. We propose an end-to-end framework for developing custom
knowledge graph driven analytics for arbitrary application domains. The
uniqueness of our system lies A) in its combination of curated KGs along with
knowledge extracted from unstructured text, B) support for advanced trending
and explanatory questions on a dynamic KG, and C) the ability to answer queries
where the answer is embedded across multiple data sources.

 <dc:title>Decentralized AP Selection in Large-Scale Wireless LANs Considering
  Multi-AP Interference</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Oni, Phillip B.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Densification of access points (APs) in wireless local area networks (WLANs)
increases the interference and the contention domains of each AP due to
multiple overlapped basic service sets (BSSs). Consequently, high interference
from multiple co-channel BSS at the target AP impairs system performance. To
improve system performance in the presence of multi-BSSs interference, we
propose a decentralized AP selection scheme that takes interference at the
candidate APs into account and selects AP that offers best
signal-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR). In the proposed algorithm, the AP
selection process is distributed at the user stations (STAs) and is based on
the estimated SINR in the downlink. Estimating SINR in the downlink helps
capture the effect of interference from neighboring BSSs or APs. Based on a
simulated large-scale 802.11 network, the proposed scheme outperforms the
strongest signal first (SSF) AP selection scheme used in current 802.11
standards as well as the mean probe delay (MPD) AP selection algorithm in [3];
it achieves 99% and 43% gains in aggregate throughput over SSF and MPD,
respectively. While increasing STA densification, the proposed scheme is shown
to increase aggregate network performance.

 <dc:title>Community detection in networks: Modularity optimization and maximum

 <dc:creator>Newman, M. E. J.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We demonstrate an exact equivalence between two widely used methods of
community detection in networks, the method of modularity maximization in its
generalized form which incorporates a resolution parameter controlling the size
of the communities discovered, and the method of maximum likelihood applied to
the special case of the stochastic block model known as the planted partition
model, in which all communities in a network are assumed to have statistically
similar properties. Among other things, this equivalence provides a
mathematically principled derivation of the modularity function, clarifies the
conditions and assumptions of its use, and gives an explicit formula for the
optimal value of the resolution parameter.

 <dc:description>  In 2001, K\'arolyi, Pach and T\'oth introduced a family of point sets to
solve an Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type problem; which have been used to solve several
other Ed\H{o}s-Szekeres type problems. In this paper we refer to these sets as
nested almost convex sets. A nested almost convex set $\mathcal{X}$ has the
property that the interior of every triangle determined by three points in the
same convex layer of $\mathcal{X}$, contains exactly one point of
$\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we introduce a characterization of nested almost
convex sets. Our characterization implies that there exists at most one (up to
order type) nested almost convex set of $n$ points. We use our characterization
to obtain a linear time algorithm to construct nested almost convex sets of $n$
points, with integer coordinates of absolute values at most $O(n^{\log_2 5})$.
Finally, we use our characterization to obtain an $O(n\log n)$-time algorithm
to determine whether a set of points is a nested almost convex set.

 <dc:description>  Cloud-Radio Access Network (C-RAN) is characterized by a hierarchical
structure in which the baseband processing functionalities of remote radio
heads (RRHs) are implemented by means of cloud computing at a Central Unit
(CU). A key limitation of C-RANs is given by the capacity constraints of the
fronthaul links connecting RRHs to the CU. In this letter, the impact of this
architectural constraint is investigated for the fundamental functions of
random access and active User Equipment (UE) identification in the presence of
a potentially massive number of UEs. In particular, the standard C-RAN approach
based on quantize-and-forward and centralized detection is compared to a scheme
based on an alternative CU-RRH functional split that enables local detection.
Both techniques leverage Bayesian sparse detection. Numerical results
illustrate the relative merits of the two schemes as a function of the system
parameters.

 <dc:title>Some Algorithmic Results on Restrained Domination in Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Pandey, Arti</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Panda, B. S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A set $D\subseteq V$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is called a restrained dominating
set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$ and to a
vertex in $V \setminus D$. The \textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem
is to find a restrained dominating set of minimum cardinality. Given a graph
$G$, and a positive integer $k$, the \textsc{Restrained Domination Decision}
problem is to decide whether $G$ has a restrained dominating set of cardinality
a most $k$. The \textsc{Restrained Domination Decision} problem is known to be
NP-complete for chordal graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this
NP-completeness result by showing that the \textsc{Restrained Domination
Decision} problem remains NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of
chordal graphs. We also propose a polynomial time algorithm to solve the
\textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem in block graphs, a subclass of
doubly chordal graphs. The \textsc{Restrained Domination Decision} problem is
also known to be NP-complete for split graphs. We propose a polynomial time
algorithm to compute a minimum restrained dominating set of threshold graphs, a
subclass of split graphs. In addition, we also propose polynomial time
algorithms to solve the \textsc{Minimum Restrained Domination} problem in
cographs and chain graphs. Finally, we give a new improved upper bound on the
restrained domination number, cardinality of a minimum restrained dominating
set in terms of number of vertices and minimum degree of graph. We also give a
randomized algorithm to find a restrained dominating set whose cardinality
satisfy our upper bound with a positive probability.

 <dc:description>  We describe a search algorithm for optimizing the number of latent states
when estimating latent-variable PCFGs with spectral methods. Our results show
that contrary to the common belief that the number of latent states for each
nonterminal in an L-PCFG can be decided in isolation with spectral methods,
parsing results significantly improve if the number of latent states for each
nonterminal is globally optimized, while taking into account interactions
between the different nonterminals. In addition, we contribute an empirical
analysis of spectral algorithms on eight morphologically rich languages:
Basque, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Korean, Polish and Swedish. Our
results show that our estimation consistently performs better or close to
coarse-to-fine expectation-maximization techniques for these languages.

 <dc:description>  We propose using five data-driven community detection approaches from social
networks to partition the label space for the task of multi-label
classification as an alternative to random partitioning into equal subsets as
performed by RAkELd: modularity-maximizing fastgreedy and leading eigenvector,
infomap, walktrap and label propagation algorithms. We construct a label
co-occurence graph (both weighted an unweighted versions) based on training
data and perform community detection to partition the label set. We include
Binary Relevance and Label Powerset classification methods for comparison. We
use gini-index based Decision Trees as the base classifier. We compare educated
approaches to label space divisions against random baselines on 12 benchmark
data sets over five evaluation measures. We show that in almost all cases seven
educated guess approaches are more likely to outperform RAkELd than otherwise
in all measures, but Hamming Loss. We show that fastgreedy and walktrap
community detection methods on weighted label co-occurence graphs are 85-92%
more likely to yield better F1 scores than random partitioning. Infomap on the
unweighted label co-occurence graphs is on average 90% of the times better than
random paritioning in terms of Subset Accuracy and 89% when it comes to Jaccard
similarity. Weighted fastgreedy is better on average than RAkELd when it comes
to Hamming Loss.

 <dc:description>  Verification of concurrent systems with thousands of multiple threads and
transactions is a challenging problem not just for simulation or emulation but
also for formal. To get designs to work correctly and provide optimal PPA the
designers often use complex optimizations requiring sharing of multiple
resources amongst active threads and transactions using FIFOs, stallers,
pipelining, out-of-order scheduling, and complex layered arbitration. This is
true of most non-trivial designs irrespective of a specific application domain
such as CPU, GPU or communication. At the outset a lot of these application
domains look diverse and complex; however at some level of detail all of these
employ common design principles of sequencing, load balancing, arbitration and
hazard prevention. We present in this paper a key abstraction based methodology
for verifying ordering correctness and arbitration across a range of designs
which are derived from different application domains. We show how by using
abstractions and supporting them with invariants one can not only find deep
corner case bugs in sequentially very deep designs; we can also build
exhaustive proofs to prove the absence of critical bugs such as deadlock,
starvation, and loss of data integrity. We present experimental results on a
range of different designs and show that on some of the designs such as FIFOs
we can verify over 100 different types of FIFOs for ordering correctness using
a single assertion in a single testbench. We also show how the methodology of
FIFO verification can be adapted to verify over half-a-dozen different types of
arbiters including a very complex memory subsystem arbiter. We verify a
multi-clocked synchronizer and a packet based design from a networking domain
using the same abstraction as used in FIFO verification. The results
demonstrate the strength of our methodology which is both reusable and compact.

 <dc:title>No Downlink Pilots are Needed in TDD Massive MIMO</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ngo, Hien Quoc</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the Massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) downlink with
maximum-ratio and zero-forcing processing and time-division duplex (TDD)
operation. To decode, the terminals must know their instantaneous effective
channel gain. Conventionally, it is assumed that by virtue of channel
hardening, this instantaneous gain is close to its average and hence that
terminals can rely on knowledge of that average (also known as statistical
channel information). However, in some propagation environments, such as
keyhole channels, channel hardening does not hold.
  We propose a blind algorithm to estimate the effective channel gain at each
user, that does not require any downlink pilots. We derive a capacity lower
bound of each user for our proposed scheme, applicable to any propagation
channel. Compared to the case of no downlink pilots (relying on channel
hardening), and compared to training-based estimation using downlink pilots,
our blind algorithm performs significantly better. The difference is especially
pronounced in environments that do not offer channel hardening.

 <dc:description>  Continual Learning in artificial neural networks suffers from interference
and forgetting when different tasks are learned sequentially. This paper
introduces the Active Long Term Memory Networks (A-LTM), a model of sequential
multi-task deep learning that is able to maintain previously learned
association between sensory input and behavioral output while acquiring knew
knowledge. A-LTM exploits the non-convex nature of deep neural networks and
actively maintains knowledge of previously learned, inactive tasks using a
distillation loss. Distortions of the learned input-output map are penalized
but hidden layers are free to transverse towards new local optima that are more
favorable for the multi-task objective. We re-frame the McClelland's seminal
Hippocampal theory with respect to Catastrophic Inference (CI) behavior
exhibited by modern deep architectures trained with back-propagation and
inhomogeneous sampling of latent factors across epochs. We present empirical
results of non-trivial CI during continual learning in Deep Linear Networks
trained on the same task, in Convolutional Neural Networks when the task shifts
from predicting semantic to graphical factors and during domain adaptation from
simple to complex environments. We present results of the A-LTM model's ability
to maintain viewpoint recognition learned in the highly controlled iLab-20M
dataset with 10 object categories and 88 camera viewpoints, while adapting to
the unstructured domain of Imagenet with 1,000 object categories.

 <dc:description>  As the demand of mobile devices (MDs) for data services is explosively
increasing, traditional offloading in the cellular networks is facing the
contradiction of energy efficiency and quality of service. Device-to-device
(D2D) communication is considered as an effective solution. This work
investigates a scenario where the MDs have the same demand for common content
and they cooperate to deliver it using multicast multihop relaying. We focus on
the problem of total power minimization by grouping the MDs in multihop D2D
networks, while maintaining the minimum rate requirement of each MD. As the
problem is shown to be NP-complete and the optimal solution can not be found
efficiently, two greedy algorithms are proposed to solve this problem in
polynomial time. Simulation results demonstrate that lots of power can be saved
in the content delivery situation using multihop D2D communication, and the
proposed algorithms are suitable for different situations with different
advantages.

 <dc:description>  The location-based services provide an interesting combination of cyber and
physical worlds. However, they can also threaten the users' privacy. Existing
privacy preserving protocols require trusted nodes, with serious security and
computational bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed
anonymizing protocol based on peer-to-peer architecture. Each mobile node is
responsible for anonymizing a specific zone. The mobile nodes collaborate in
anonymizing their queries, without the need not get access to any information
about each other. In the proposed protocol, each request will be sent with a
randomly chosen ticket. The encrypted response produced by the server is sent
to a particular mobile node (called broker node) over the network, based on the
hash value of this ticket. The user will query the broker to get the response.
All parts of the messages are encrypted except the fields required for the
anonymizer and the broker. This will secure the packet exchange over the P2P
network. The proposed protocol was implemented and tested successfully, and the
experimental results showed that it could be deployed efficiently to achieve
user privacy in location-based services.

 <dc:description>  We introduce SE3-Nets, which are deep neural networks designed to model and
learn rigid body motion from raw point cloud data. Based only on sequences of
depth images along with action vectors and point wise data associations,
SE3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion
resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors,
SE3-Nets predict SE3 transformations for different parts of the scene. Using
simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that
the structure underlying SE3-Nets enables them to generate a far more
consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks.
Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing
objects on a table show that SE3-Nets also work well on real data.

 <dc:description>  Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered as a promising technology
for improving the spectral efficiency (SE) in 5G. In this correspondence, we
study the benefit of NOMA in enhancing energy efficiency (EE) for a multi-user
downlink transmission, where the EE is defined as the ratio of the achievable
sum rate of the users to the total power consumption. Our goal is to maximize
the EE subject to a minimum required data rate for each user, which leads to a
non-convex fractional programming problem. To solve it, we first establish the
feasible range of the transmitting power that is able to support each user's
data rate requirement. Then, we propose an EE-optimal power allocation strategy
that maximizes the EE. Our numerical results show that NOMA has superior EE
performance in comparison with conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA).

 <dc:description>  Recently there has been an increasing trend to use deep learning frameworks
for both 2D consumer images and for 3D medical images. However, there has been
little effort to use deep frameworks for volumetric vascular segmentation. We
wanted to address this by providing a freely available dataset of 12 annotated
two-photon vasculature microscopy stacks. We demonstrated the use of deep
learning framework consisting both 2D and 3D convolutional filters (ConvNet).
Our hybrid 2D-3D architecture produced promising segmentation result. We
derived the architectures from Lee et al. who used the ZNN framework initially
designed for electron microscope image segmentation. We hope that by sharing
our volumetric vasculature datasets, we will inspire other researchers to
experiment with vasculature dataset and improve the used network architectures.

 <dc:description>  Like many routing protocols, the Tor anonymity network has decentralized path
selection, in clients locally and independently choose paths. As a result,
network resources may be left idle, leaving the system in a suboptimal state.
This is referred to as the price of anarchy, where agents acting in their own
self interest can make poor decisions when viewed in a global context. In this
paper we explore the cost of anarchy in Tor by examining the potential
performance increases that can be gained by centrally optimizing circuit and
relay selection using global knowledge. In experiments with both offline and
online algorithms, we show that centrally coordinated clients can achieve up to
75% higher bandwidth compared to traditional Tor. Drawing on these findings, we
design and evaluate a decentralized version of our online algorithm, in which
relays locally distribute information enabling clients to make smarter
decisions locally and perform downloads 10-60% faster. Finally, we perform a
privacy analysis of the decentralized algorithm against a passive and active
adversary trying to reduce anonymity of clients and increase their view of the
Tor network. We conclude that this decentralized algorithm does not enable new
attacks, while providing significantly higher performance.

 <dc:title>Angle-of-Attack Modulation in Trajectory Tracking for a Reusable Launch

 <dc:description>  This paper deals with the problem of angle-of-attack modulation with the aim
of enhancing transient performance of entry guidance during bank reversals,
while compensating adverse effects of fast time-varying transient disturbances.
An extended single-input/single-output system is developed in the velocity
domain by means of a dynamic extension technique, and explicitly captures the
trajectory dynamics of angle-of-attack modulation. A normal form for this
extended system is derived for the sake of employing a feedback linearization
controller. Further, the control characteristics of angle-of-attack modulation
is found to be a non-minimum phase behavior under two common conditions in a
near- equilibrium glide flight. Therefore, the issue of angle-of-attack
modulation is formulated as robust output stabilization of the non-minimum
phase system. A disturbance observer-based feedback linearization technique is
used to design a robustly dynamical output-feedback controller for
angle-of-attack modulation, and an internal-state feedback controller for
bank-angle modulation is used to stabilize the unstable internal dynamics.
Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate that the performance of the
proposed method of angle-of-attack modulation is enhanced compared to the
existing shuttle method.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel attention model that can accurately attend to target
objects of various scales and shapes in images. The model is trained to
gradually suppress irrelevant regions in an input image via a progressive
attentive process over multiple layers of a convolutional neural network. The
attentive process in each layer determines whether to pass or suppress features
at certain spatial locations for use in the next layer. We further employ local
contexts to estimate attention probability at each location since it is
difficult to infer accurate attention by observing a feature vector from a
single location only. The experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that
the proposed attention network outperforms traditional attention methods in
visual attribute prediction tasks.

 <dc:description>  We develop a semidefinite programming method for the optimization of quantum
networks, including both causal networks and networks with indefinite causal
structure. Our method applies to a broad class of performance measures, defined
operationally in terms of interactive tests set up by a verifier. We show that
the optimal performance is equal to a max relative entropy, which quantifies
the informativeness of the test. Building on this result, we extend the notion
of conditional min-entropy from quantum states to quantum causal networks. The
optimization method is illustrated in a number of applications, including the
inversion, charge conjugation, and controlization of an unknown unitary
dynamics. In the non-causal setting, we show a proof-of-principle application
to the maximization of the winning probability in a non-causal quantum game.

 <dc:description>  Learning robust value functions given raw observations and rewards is now
possible with model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. There is a third alternative, called Successor Representations
(SR), which decomposes the value function into two components -- a reward
predictor and a successor map. The successor map represents the expected future
state occupancy from any given state and the reward predictor maps states to
scalar rewards. The value function of a state can be computed as the inner
product between the successor map and the reward weights. In this paper, we
present DSR, which generalizes SR within an end-to-end deep reinforcement
learning framework. DSR has several appealing properties including: increased
sensitivity to distal reward changes due to factorization of reward and world
dynamics, and the ability to extract bottleneck states (subgoals) given
successor maps trained under a random policy. We show the efficacy of our
approach on two diverse environments given raw pixel observations -- simple
grid-world domains (MazeBase) and the Doom game engine.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for Semi-Supervised Active Clustering framework
(SSAC), where the learner is allowed to interact with a domain expert, asking
whether two given instances belong to the same cluster or not. We study the
query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework. We consider
a setting where the expert conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion
of margin. We show that there is a trade off between computational complexity
and query complexity; We prove that for the case of $k$-means clustering (i.e.,
when the expert conforms to a solution of $k$-means), having access to
relatively few such queries allows efficient solutions to otherwise NP hard
problems.
  In particular, we provide a probabilistic polynomial-time (BPP) algorithm for
clustering in this setting that asks $O\big(k^2\log k + k\log n)$ same-cluster
queries and runs with time complexity $O\big(kn\log n)$ (where $k$ is the
number of clusters and $n$ is the number of instances). The algorithm succeeds
with high probability for data satisfying margin conditions under which,
without queries, we show that the problem is NP hard. We also prove a lower
bound on the number of queries needed to have a computationally efficient
clustering algorithm in this setting.

 <dc:title>How to manipulate truthful prior-dependent mechanisms?</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tang, Pingzhong</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zeng, Yulong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the standard formulation of mechanism design, a key assumption is that the
designer has reliable information and technology to determine a prior
distribution on types of the agents. In the meanwhile, as pointed out by the
Wilson's Principle, a mechanism should reply as little as possible on the
accuracy of prior type distribution. In this paper, we put forward a model to
formalize and quantify this statement.
  In our model, each agent has a type distribution. In addition, the agent can
commit to a fake distribution and bids consistently and credibly with respect
to the fake distribution (i.e., plays Bayes equilibrium under the fake
distributions). We study the equilibria of the induced distribution-committing
games in several well-known mechanisms. Our results can be summarized as
follows: (1) the game induced by Myerson's auction under our model is
strategically equivalent to the first price auction under the standard model.
As a consequence, they are revenue-equivalent as well. (2) the second-price
auction yields weakly better revenue than several reserve-based and
virtual-value-based auctions, under our fake distribution model. These results
echo the recent literature on prior-independent mechanism design.

 <dc:description>  In decentralized networks (of sensors, connected objects, etc.), there is an
important need for efficient algorithms to optimize a global cost function, for
instance to learn a global model from the local data collected by each
computing unit. In this paper, we address the problem of decentralized
minimization of pairwise functions of the data points, where these points are
distributed over the nodes of a graph defining the communication topology of
the network. This general problem finds applications in ranking, distance
metric learning and graph inference, among others. We propose new gossip
algorithms based on dual averaging which aims at solving such problems both in
synchronous and asynchronous settings. The proposed framework is flexible
enough to deal with constrained and regularized variants of the optimization
problem. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithms preserve
the convergence rate of centralized dual averaging up to an additive bias term.
We present numerical simulations on Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) maximization
and metric learning problems which illustrate the practical interest of our
approach.

 <dc:description>  We discuss Bayesian inference (BI) for the probabilistic identification of
material parameters. This contribution aims to shed light on the use of BI for
the identification of elastoplastic material parameters. For this purpose a
single spring is considered, for which the stress-strain curves are
artificially created. Besides offering a didactic introduction to BI, this
paper proposes an approach to incorporate statistical errors both in the
measured stresses, and in the measured strains. It is assumed that the
uncertainty is only due to measurement errors and the material is homogeneous.
Furthermore, a number of possible misconceptions on BI are highlighted based on
the purely elastic case.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a generic algorithm to calculate the rotation
parameters of CORDIC angles required for the Discrete Cosine Transform
algorithm (DCT). This leads us to increase the precision of calculation meeting
any accuracy.Our contribution is to use this decomposition in CORDIC based DCT
which is appropriate for domains which require high quality and top precision.
We then propose a hardware implementation of the novel transformation, and as
expected, a substantial improvement in PSNR quality is found.

 <dc:title>Training Design and Two-stage Channel Estimation for Correlated Two-way
  MIMO Relay Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Huiming</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the training signal design for the channel estimation in
two-way multiple-input-and-multipleoutput (MIMO) relay systems, where the
channels are correlated. We first derive the backward channel estimator with
the optimal training signal sent by the relay node. Given the estimated
backward channels and the probabilistic knowledge of the estimation error, we
mainly focus on the forward channel estimation and the related training signal
design. We further propose a novel training signal. The design criterion is to
minimize the relaxation of the total mean square error (MSE) of the forward
channel estimators, which is conditioned on the estimated backward channels.
Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed training signal can
improve the MSE performance.

 <dc:title>Comparison of an open-hardware electroencephalography amplifier with
  medical grade device in brain-computer interface applications</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Frey, J&#xe9;r&#xe9;my</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are promising communication devices between
humans and machines. BCI based on non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as
electroencephalography (EEG) have many applications , however the dissemination
of the technology is limited, in part because of the price of the hardware. In
this paper we compare side by side two EEG amplifiers, the consumer grade
OpenBCI and the medical grade g.tec g.USBamp. For this purpose, we employed an
original montage, based on the simultaneous recording of the same set of
electrodes. Two set of recordings were performed. During the first experiment a
simple adapter with a direct connection between the amplifiers and the
electrodes was used. Then, in a second experiment, we attempted to discard any
possible interference that one amplifier could cause to the other by adding
&quot;ideal&quot; diodes to the adapter. Both spectral and temporal features were tested
-- the former with a workload monitoring task, the latter with an visual P300
speller task. Overall, the results suggest that the OpenBCI board -- or a
similar solution based on the Texas Instrument ADS1299 chip -- could be an
effective alternative to traditional EEG devices. Even though a medical grade
equipment still outperforms the OpenBCI, the latter gives very close EEG
readings, resulting in practice in a classification accuracy that may be
suitable for popularizing BCI uses.

 <dc:description>  Current research in lifelog data has not paid enough attention to analysis of
cognitive activities in comparison to physical activities. We argue that as we
look into the future, wearable devices are going to be cheaper and more
prevalent and textual data will play a more significant role. Data captured by
lifelogging devices will increasingly include speech and text, potentially
useful in analysis of intellectual activities. Analyzing what a person hears,
reads, and sees, we should be able to measure the extent of cognitive activity
devoted to a certain topic or subject by a learner. Test-based lifelog records
can benefit from semantic analysis tools developed for natural language
processing. We show how semantic analysis of such text data can be achieved
through the use of taxonomic subject facets and how these facets might be
useful in quantifying cognitive activity devoted to various topics in a
person's day. We are currently developing a method to automatically create
taxonomic topic vocabularies that can be applied to this detection of
intellectual activity.

 <dc:description>  We provide a systematic approach for testing self-organization (SO)
algorithms. The main challenges for such a testing domain are the strongly
ramified state space, the possible error masking, the interleaving of
mechanisms, and the oracle problem resulting from the main characteristics of
SO algorithms: their inherent non-deterministic behavior on the one hand, and
their dynamic environment on the other. A key to success for our SO algorithm
testing framework is automation, since it is rarely possible to cope with the
ramified state space manually. The test automation is based on a model-based
testing approach where probabilistic environment profiles are used to derive
test cases that are performed and evaluated on isolated SO algorithms. Besides
isolation, we are able to achieve representative test results with respect to a
specific application. For illustration purposes, we apply the concepts of our
framework to partitioning-based SO algorithms and provide an evaluation in the
context of an existing smart-grid application.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a new language learning setting relevant to building adaptive
natural language interfaces. It is inspired by Wittgenstein's language games: a
human wishes to accomplish some task (e.g., achieving a certain configuration
of blocks), but can only communicate with a computer, who performs the actual
actions (e.g., removing all red blocks). The computer initially knows nothing
about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction,
while the human adapts to the computer's capabilities. We created a game in a
blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we
analyze the humans' strategies, showing that using compositionality and
avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we
compare computer strategies, showing how to quickly learn a semantic parsing
model from scratch, and that modeling pragmatics further accelerates learning
for successful players.

 <dc:description>  Sequentially learning to place items in multi-position displays or lists is a
task that can be cast into the multiple-play semi-bandit setting. However, a
major concern in this context is when the system cannot decide whether the user
feedback for each item is actually exploitable. Indeed, much of the content may
have been simply ignored by the user. The present work proposes to exploit
available information regarding the display position bias under the so-called
Position-based click model (PBM). We first discuss how this model differs from
the Cascade model and its variants considered in several recent works on
multiple-play bandits. We then provide a novel regret lower bound for this
model as well as computationally efficient algorithms that display good
empirical and theoretical performance.

optimal translational motion (moving in the minimal acceptable time) of a
flexible object carried by a robot from its initial to its final position of
absolute quiescence with the exception of the oscillations at the end of the

for searching an optimal control. The data of experimental verification of the
control are presented using the Orthoglide robot for translational motions and

 <dc:description>  Population aging is affecting many countries, Sweden being one of them, and
it may lead to a shortage of caregivers for elderly people in near future.
Smart interconnected devices known as the Internet of Things may help elderly
to live independently at home and avoid unnecessary hospital stay. For
instance, a carephone device enables the elderly to establish a communication
link with caregivers and ask for help when it is needed. In this paper, we
describe a simulation study of the care giving system in the V\&quot;axj\&quot;o
municipality in Sweden. The simulation model can be used to address various
issues, such as, determining the lack or excess of resources or long waiting
times, and study the system behavior when the number of alarms is increased.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Organisational and government concerns about environmental sustainability
(ES) are on the increase. While a significant amount of research from a wide
range of domains has addressed various ES challenges, intuitively, Business
Process Management (BPM), with its focus on process improvement and process
performance measurement, has much to offer the ES field. In this paper we aim
to understand the BPM research contribution to ES, including specific
Environmental Performance Indicators (EPI), and the BPM concepts that have been
utilized in the ES context. To this end we conduct a systematic literature
review to capture prior research focused on BPM and ES, coding the articles
according to their contribution to EPIs and other ES concepts, while also
contrasting their focus with main challenges identified in industry reports.
Our study identifies which EPIs have been addressed in prior BPM research and
highlights areas of future contribution.

 <dc:description>  Understanding the business systems success factors has been a challenging
process for both public and private organizations. Organizational culture is
measured as a critical factor promoting knowledge sharing among employees.
Based on the competing value framework (CVF), this research shows how various
dimensions of organization culture influence knowledge sharing towards business
systems success at the individual and organization level. A quantitative
approach was applied to test the relationship between organizational cultures,
knowledge sharing and business systems success in Saudi enterprise.

 <dc:description>  This paper connects a vector-based composition model to a formal semantics,
the Dependency-based Compositional Semantics (DCS). We show theoretical
evidence that the vector compositions in our model conform to the logic of DCS.
Experimentally, we show that vector-based composition brings a strong ability
to calculate similar phrases as similar vectors, achieving near
state-of-the-art on a wide range of phrase similarity tasks and relation
classification; meanwhile, DCS can guide building vectors for structured
queries that can be directly executed. We evaluate this utility on sentence
completion task and report a new state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  Crypto-currencies like Bitcoins are relatively recent phenomena on the online
Internet landscape and an emerging force in the financial sector. While not
conforming to traditional institutional practices, they are gaining increasing
acceptance as viable commercial currencies. In this conceptual paper we discuss
the potential impact of digital currency technology on the Australian economy,
including the (i) payments sector, (ii) retail sector, and (iii) banking
sector; and explore potential ways in which Australia can take advantage of
digital currency technology to establish itself as a market leader in this
field. The emergence of this new and potentially disruptive technology provides
both opportunities as well as risks. In order to support innovation and the
needs of the growing Australian digital currency industry it is important to
define digital currencies and examine the impact regulatory frameworks could
have on the further adoption and diffusion of the technology.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of stabilizing an unstable plant driven by bounded
noise over a digital noisy communication link, a scenario at the heart of
networked control. To stabilize such a plant, one needs real-time encoding and
decoding with an error probability profile that decays exponentially with the
decoding delay. The works of Schulman and Sahai over the past two decades have
developed the notions of tree codes and anytime capacity, and provided the
theoretical framework for studying such problems. Nonetheless, there has been
little practical progress in this area due to the absence of explicit
constructions of tree codes with efficient encoding and decoding algorithms.
Recently, linear time-invariant tree codes were proposed to achieve the desired
result under maximum-likelihood decoding. In this work, we take one more step
towards practicality, by showing that these codes can be efficiently decoded
using sequential decoding algorithms, up to some loss in performance (and with
some practical complexity caveats). We supplement our theoretical results with
numerical simulations that demonstrate the effectiveness of the decoder in a
control system setting.

 <dc:title>On the Benefit of Merging Suffix Array Intervals for Parallel Pattern
  Matching</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present parallel algorithms for exact and approximate pattern matching
with suffix arrays, using a CREW-PRAM with $p$ processors. Given a static text
of length $n$, we first show how to compute the suffix array interval of a
given pattern of length $m$ in $O(\frac{m}{p}+ \lg p + \lg\lg p\cdot\lg\lg n)$
time for $p \le m$. For approximate pattern matching with $k$ differences or
mismatches, we show how to compute all occurrences of a given pattern in
$O(\frac{m^k\sigma^k}{p}\max\left(k,\lg\lg n\right)\!+\!(1+\frac{m}{p}) \lg
p\cdot \lg\lg n + \text{occ})$ time, where $\sigma$ is the size of the alphabet
and $p \le \sigma^k m^k$. The workhorse of our algorithms is a data structure
for merging suffix array intervals quickly: Given the suffix array intervals
for two patterns $P$ and $P'$, we present a data structure for computing the
interval of $PP'$ in $O(\lg\lg n)$ sequential time, or in $O(1+\lg_p\lg n)$
parallel time. All our data structures are of size $O(n)$ bits (in addition to
the suffix array).

 <dc:creator>Keuper, Margret</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Brox, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we tackle the problem of temporally consistent boundary
detection and hierarchical segmentation in videos. While finding the best
high-level reasoning of region assignments in videos is the focus of much
recent research, temporal consistency in boundary detection has so far only
rarely been tackled. We argue that temporally consistent boundaries are a key
component to temporally consistent region assignment. The proposed method is
based on the point-wise mutual information (PMI) of spatio-temporal voxels.
Temporal consistency is established by an evaluation of PMI-based point
affinities in the spectral domain over space and time. Thus, the proposed
method is independent of any optical flow computation or previously learned
motion models. The proposed low-level video segmentation method outperforms the
learning-based state of the art in terms of standard region metrics.

 <dc:description>  In order to approximate transandental functions, several algorithms were
proposed.Historically, polynomial interpolation, infinite series, $\cdots$ and
other$+,\times, -$ and $/$ based algorithms were studied for this purpose.The
CORDIC (COordinate Rotation DIgital Computer)introduced by Jack E. Volder in
1959, and generalized by J. S. Walther a few years later, is a hardware based
algorithmfor the approximation of trigonometric, hyperbolic andlogarithmic
functions.As a consequence, CORDIC is used for applications indiverse areas
such as signal and image processing.For these reasons, several modified
versions were proposed.In this article, we present anoverview of the CORDIC
algorithm for the computation of the circular functions, essentially the
scaling free version,and we will give a substential improvement to the commonly
used one.

 <dc:description>  The Social Media application Strava is used by exercisers to track running
and cycling activities. Strava is carried with the exerciser and displays
trophies and leaderboards to reward competitive performance. We were prompted
by an auto-ethnographic account of Strava use to examine the way in which a
particular stretch of running track around a lake showed up differently to the
runner once Strava was integrated into their running practice. We look to
Gibsons relational notion of affordances and niches to understand this change
in direct perception. We propose that these concepts have potential in helping
us to research and understand the ways in which groups of Social Media users
share and construct a similar experience of place in a way that is largely
invisible to non-users. We consider some of the preliminary implications of
this differentiated use of place and demonstrate the way in which a relational
view of affordances helps us to make sense of this phenomenon.

 <dc:description>  In many domains (e.g. Internet of Things, neuroimaging) signals are naturally
supported on graphs. These graphs usually convey information on similarity
between the values taken by the signal at the corresponding vertices. An
interest of using graphs is that it allows to define ad hoc operators to
perform signal processing. Among them, ones of paramount importance in many
tasks are translations. In this paper we are interested in defining
translations on graphs using a few simple properties. Namely we propose to
define translations as functions from vertices to adjacent ones, that preserve
neighborhood properties of the graph. We show that our definitions, contrary to
other works on the subject, match usual translations on grid graphs.

 <dc:description>  Australia is seen as lagging in the innovation that is needed for corporate
success and national productivity gains. There is an apparent lack of
consistent and integrated advice to managers on how to undertake innovation.
Thus, this study aims to develop and investigate a framework that relates
innovation practices to the type of innovation outcome, in the context of
Information Technology (IT) enabled innovations. An Innovation Practice
Framework was developed based on the Knowledge-Innovation Matrix (KIM) proposed
by Gregor and Hevner (2015). Eleven commonly used innovation techniques
(practices) were identified and placed in one or more of the quadrants:
invention, advancement, exaptation and exploitation. Interviews were conducted
with key informants in nine organisations in the Australian Capital Territory.
Results showed that the least used techniques were skunk works and
crowdsourcing. The most used techniques were traditional market research,
brainstorming and design thinking. The Innovation Practice Framework was given
some support, with genius grants being related to invention outcomes, design
thinking with exaptation, traditional R&amp;D with advancement and managerial
scanning with exploitation. The study contributes theoretically with the new
Innovation Practice Framework and has the potential to be useful to managers in
showing how benefits can be gained from a range of innovation practices.
Further work is in progress.

 <dc:description>  The IT Service Management (ITSM) industry has defined processes as best
practices in the widely-accepted IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) framework.
However, studies on the measurement of ITSM process improvement are scant. Our
research addressed the dual problems of the lack of transparency and the need
for efficiency in ITSM process assessment. Using the Design Science Research
methodology, we developed a Software-mediated Process Assessment (SMPA)
approach that enables assessment of ITSM processes. The SMPA approach includes
process selection; online survey to collect assessment data; measurement of
process capability; and reporting of process improvement recommendations. We
implemented a decision support system (DSS) to automate the SMPA approach and
evaluated it at two IT service providers. The evaluations indicated that the
SMPA approach supports decision-making on process improvements. The findings
provided design knowledge of virtualisation in ITSM process assessment and how
this may facilitate continual service improvement.

 <dc:description>  As robots enter human environments, they will be expected to accomplish a
tremendous range of tasks. It is not feasible for robot designers to
pre-program these behaviors or know them in advance, so one way to address this
is through end-user programming, such as via learning from demonstration (LfD).
While significant work has been done on the mechanics of enabling robot
learning from human teachers, one unexplored aspect is enabling mutual feedback
between both the human teacher and robot during the learning process, i.e.,
implicit learning. In this paper, we explore one aspect of this mutual
understanding, grounding sequences, where both a human and robot provide
non-verbal feedback to signify their mutual understanding during interaction.
We conducted a study where people taught an autonomous humanoid robot a dance,
and performed gesture analysis to measure people's responses to the robot
during correct and incorrect demonstrations.

 <dc:description>  Despite the rampant adoption of Enterprise 2.0, there is lack of empirical
evidence of how Enterprise 2.0 is aptly supporting the business objectives.
Social capital theory will be used as a theoretical lens to understand the
impact and implications of individual use of Enterprise 2.0. To ascertain the
impact from the use of Enterprise 2.0 on the various dimensions of social
capital, a single in-depth qualitative case study was conducted with a large
professional services organisation. The findings unfold the different areas of
impacts based on actual individual use and experience. The research concludes
with a framework delineating the intertwined relationship between each social
capital dimensions.

 <dc:description>  Technology mediated learning provide potentially valuable resources for
learners' academic and social development. However, according to recent
researches, as the adoption stages of ICTs advance there arise further levels
of digital divides in terms of equity of information literacy and learning
outcomes. For the last three years we have been working with the first
secondary school in New Zealand to introduce a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
policy. Our research has included a number of methods, including surveys,
interviews and classroom observations. In this paper we present the findings
from the investigation into BYOD project, which gave us insights into the
digital divide issues in the context of technology mediated learning.

 <dc:description>  Despite the success of CNNs, selecting the optimal architecture for a given
task remains an open problem. Instead of aiming to select a single optimal
architecture, we propose a &quot;fabric&quot; that embeds an exponentially large number
of architectures. The fabric consists of a 3D trellis that connects response
maps at different layers, scales, and channels with a sparse homogeneous local
connectivity pattern. The only hyper-parameters of a fabric are the number of
channels and layers. While individual architectures can be recovered as paths,
the fabric can in addition ensemble all embedded architectures together,
sharing their weights where their paths overlap. Parameters can be learned
using standard methods based on back-propagation, at a cost that scales
linearly in the fabric size. We present benchmark results competitive with the
state of the art for image classification on MNIST and CIFAR10, and for
semantic segmentation on the Part Labels dataset.

 <dc:description>  Managers are heavily engaged in strategic decision-making for businesses,
particularly in a changing environment. One of the most important decisions for
online small businesses, as part of their strategic planning, is selecting
relevant features on their websites, both to attract and interact with
consumers. However, only a few Australian small businesses use strategic tools
for selecting their website features. As a result, businesses lose potential
domestic sales in the business-to-consumer (B2C) sector. The aim of this study
is to determine the relationship between factors that influence consumers'
online purchasing, and owner/manager strategic decisions in selecting relevant
features for websites. Results from employing qualitative case studies with
small business owner/managers, and a content analysis of website features,
inform the design of a Decision Support Systems (DSS) framework. This may
assist owner/managers' strategic decisions to implement competitive features on
B2C websites that ultimately attract more consumers.

 <dc:description>  Mathematical literacy plays an important role in supporting individuals to
fulfil their professional roles in modern society. The affordances of mobile
technologies as well as the emergence of new theories in mobile learning have
the potential to promote mathematical literacy. However, implementation of
mobile learning in Indonesian society faces challenges related to perceived
ethical and learning issues in curriculum-based educational settings. This
study aims to investigate the preparedness of teachers in integrating
mathematics subject content with mobile technologies, especially in promoting
mathematical literacy. An exploratory study has been conducted using mixed
methods by performing questionnaire survey and semi-structured interviews to
understand teacher's knowledge towards mathematical literacy and identifying
opportunities and challenges of mobile learning within instruction. Findings
indicate that teachers mostly do not know about mathematical literacy,
indicating that the concept of mathematical literacy needs to be promoted.
Further, most schools prohibit the use of mobile devices in classrooms as they
are wary of inappropriate use of mobile devices which may harm students' mental
health and distract them from learning. Study finds this to be the most common
cause for teachers' reluctance in using mobile learning.

 <dc:title>Examining the social aspects of Enterprise Architecture Implementation:
  A Morphogenetic Approach</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Dobson, Philip</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper argues that existing research in Enterprise Architecture (EA)
tends to emphasise the technical aspects of implementation and neglects the
role of 'people'. The paper uses Archer's Morphogenetic Approach (MA) to
elaborate the social context of EA. This approach examines the relationships
between agency, structure and culture to understand how stakeholders affect and
are affected by EA implementation. A university just commencing an EA program
is used as a case example. The case example describes the challenging
university environment and provides an illustration of the important
situational logics that direct agency action within the complex social context
of a university.

 <dc:description>  Australia is among the leading countries that envisaged releasing
unclassified public data under open license and reusable format with no further
restriction on re/use. But, according to the Australian Information
Commissioner John McMillan, Australia's progress on open data is 'patchy' and
'transitional'. He also evidenced that although a few agencies are proactive
and have embraced the movements quite seriously, still there are &quot;many
obstacles that worked against effort to make government information and data
discoverable and usable&quot; (Hilvert 2013). Despondently, there is little
empirical evidence that could explain what makes public departments not to
release public data. Driven by the nature of the research, this study conducted
an exploratory field study in Australia by interviewing eleven employees from
six different government agencies. Applying content analysis technique, this
study identifies six important antecedents to adoption of open data in public
organisations, and proposes future research to test their relationships. As the
main theoretical contribution, this study extends organisational behaviour
toward technology diffusion. The findings of this study incite policymakers and
managers to think about and prepare future strategies on open data
developments.

the social and commercial activities and motivations of participants. This
paper explores motivations for participating in social commerce at a
micro-business level between members of a virtual community of Malay lifestyle
bloggers. The selected community was observed in order to understand the
community and 21 participants were interviewed. We used laddering techniques to
explore community attributes, the perceived consequences, and their links to
the values of participants. We found that virtual community relationship was
the main influential factor, and virtual community relationship contributed to
the sense of social support as well as customers' trust in social commerce.

 <dc:description>  This study proposes a conceptual model to link IT capabilities, industry
types, and value implications. We attempt to use a contingency analysis to
theorize that which types of IT capabilities (e.g., externally-focused,
internally-focused, and aggregate IT capability) should a firm develop and then
what benefits (e.g., firm value and firm performance) it will gain according to
its industry's value creation logic (e.g., value chain-based, value shop-based,
and value network-based industry). The empirical findings show that a value
network-based firm should develop externally-focused IT capabilities to create
its firm value and a value chain-based firm should develop aggregate IT
capabilities to improve its firm performance and create its firm value.

 <dc:description>  Information and communication technology (ICT) tools are ineffective when
assessing solutions of questions with more than one step. ICT tools assessing
these types of questions are paralleled to solving complex problems. This
conceptual paper describes the method that will be adopted to create rule based
expert system (ES) prototype implementing method marking concept (MMC) in
assessing multi-step questions (MSQ) solutions. Pragmatist views and mixed
methods will be used to conduct document analysis using undergraduate students'
solutions to past examination papers and related findings from previous
research. Design science research paradigm and ES development phases will be
used to design, construct and evaluate an artifact based on ES. The expected
functioning ES artifact will enhance the authenticity of assessment, because
evaluation of solution strategies in MSQ solution reveals how much the
comprehension of the domain under evaluation is shown. The artifact and the
conceptual framework can be applied to a similar domain with modifications or
as it is.

 <dc:description>  The explosive growth in the development of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)
has resulted in the continued increase in clinical and research data. The lack
of standardised terminology, flaws in data quality planning and management of
TCM informatics are preventing clinical decision-making, drug discovery and
education. This paper argues that the introduction of data warehousing
technologies to enhance the effectiveness and durability in TCM is paramount.
To showcase the role of data warehousing in the improvement of TCM, this paper
presents a practical model for data warehousing with detailed explanation,
which is based on the structured electronic records, for TCM clinical
researches and medical knowledge discovery.

 <dc:description>  Cloud computing opportunities have presented service options for users that
are both economical and flexible to use requirements. However, the risk
analysis for the user identifies vulnerabilities for intellectual property
ownership and vulnerabilities for the identification of rightful property
owners when cloud services are used. It is common for image owners to embed
watermarks and other security mechanisms into their property so that the
rightful ownership may be identified. In this paper we present a design that
overcomes many of the current limitations in cloud watermarking uses and
propose a schema that places responsibility on the cloud provider to have a
robust information protection program. Such a design solution lays out an

 <dc:description>  Outsourcing of information and communication technologies (ICT) and related
services is an established and growing industry. Recent trends, such as the
move toward multi-sourcing have increased the complexity and risk of these
outsourcing arrangements. There is a critical research need to identify the
risks faced by both the organisations that outsource ICT and the vendors that
provide it in this changing landscape. To address growing concerns regarding
the best way to deal with risk and control in this environment, our research
focuses on establishing a Sourcing Risk and Control Framework to assist
organisations identify these risks and develop effective mitigation strategies.
In this paper we report on the first stage of our research that sought to
document how sourcing risk is represented and considered in practice. To date,
limited empirical research has been conducted in an Australian context. Using a
series of workshops involving client and vendor representatives, we identified
a broad range of risks and developed a cohesive categorisation scheme that
incorporates functional and multi-stakeholder perspectives.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first phase of a study on using course design,
including current eLearning and social trends, to overcome challenges in
eLearning within developing countries, particularly for
vocational/non-mainstream training. The paper outlines the research and
development of an ICT artefact using the Action Design Research method. The
artefact will later be deployed and evaluated. The paper discusses the previous
research that has categorised challenges in eLearning in developing countries
and explores how these can be overcome through course and element design.
Course design includes training development, platform selection and platform
hosting, particularly in the context of developing countries. Element design
looks at the creation of content that should be available, practical and viable
to both the user and developer through the exploitation of current eLearning
and social trends. The paper concludes with the concept of the ICT artefact
that has been designed for phase two of the study.

 <dc:title>SOA Governance - Road into Maturity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Joukhadar, George</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Rabhi, Fethi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There is a general consensus that SOA benefits could be reached but it is
unclear how to achieve this. Research shows that the problems with SOA
governance in practice are among the major reasons of SOA failures. Based on a
literature review, this study first proposes a list of SOA aspects to be
considered when implementing SOA governance. By adopting an interpretive
research methodology based on interviews, this research paper makes two
contributions: it addresses the practical matters that are major concerns for
organisations to achieve a higher maturity level with their SOA, and it reveals
the importance of the key SOA aspects in building strong governance and
consequently reaching a higher maturity level. The expected result should
deliver a theoretical contribution to SOA maturity in relation to SOA
governance; it could provide organisations with new awareness in assessing
their level of maturity and provide recommendations.

 <dc:description>  We present DefExt, an easy to use semi supervised Definition Extraction Tool.
DefExt is designed to extract from a target corpus those textual fragments
where a term is explicitly mentioned together with its core features, i.e. its
definition. It works on the back of a Conditional Random Fields based
sequential labeling algorithm and a bootstrapping approach. Bootstrapping
enables the model to gradually become more aware of the idiosyncrasies of the
target corpus. In this paper we describe the main components of the toolkit as
well as experimental results stemming from both automatic and manual
evaluation. We release DefExt as open source along with the necessary files to
run it in any Unix machine. We also provide access to training and test data
for immediate use.

 <dc:title>Coordination Annotation Extension in the Penn Tree Bank</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Coordination is an important and common syntactic construction which is not
handled well by state of the art parsers. Coordinations in the Penn Treebank
are missing internal structure in many cases, do not include explicit marking
of the conjuncts and contain various errors and inconsistencies. In this work,
we initiated manual annotation process for solving these issues. We identify
the different elements in a coordination phrase and label each element with its
function. We add phrase boundaries when these are missing, unify
inconsistencies, and fix errors. The outcome is an extension of the PTB that
includes consistent and detailed structures for coordinations. We make the
coordination annotation publicly available, in hope that they will facilitate
further research into coordination disambiguation.

AODV routing protocol in Ad Hoc networks. The considered system can be
vulnerable to several attacks because of mobility and absence of
infrastructure. While the disturbance is assumed to be of the black hole type,
we purpose a control named &quot;PC-AODV-BH&quot; in order to neutralize the effects of
malicious nodes. Such a protocol is obtained by coupling hash functions,
digital signatures and fidelity concept. An implementation under NS2 simulator
will be given to compare our proposed approach with SAODV protocol, basing on
three performance metrics and taking into account the number of black hole
malicious nodes

 <dc:title>On kernels and nuclei of rank metric codes</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  For each rank metric code $\mathcal{C}\subseteq \mathbb{K}^{m\times n}$, we
associate a translation structure, the kernel of which is shown to be invariant
with respect to the equivalence on rank metric codes. When $\mathcal{C}$ is
$\mathbb{K}$-linear, we also propose and investigate other two invariants
called its middle nucleus and right nucleus. When $\mathbb{K}$ is a finite
field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\mathcal{C}$ is a maximum rank distance code with
minimum distance $d&lt;\min\{m,n\}$ or $\gcd(m,n)=1$, the kernel of the associated
translation structure is proved to be $\mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, we also show
that the middle nucleus of a linear maximum rank distance code over
$\mathbb{F}_q$ must be a finite field; its right nucleus also has to be a
finite field under the condition $\max\{d,m-d+2\} \geqslant \left\lfloor
\frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor +1$. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be the DHO-set associated with
a bilinear dimensional dual hyperoval over $\mathbb{F}_2$. The set
$\mathcal{D}$ gives rise to a linear rank metric code, and we show that its
kernel and right nucleus are is isomorphic to $\mathbb{F}_2$. Also, its middle
nucleus must be a finite field containing $\mathbb{F}_q$. Moreover, we also
consider the kernel and the nuclei of $\mathcal{D}^k$ where $k$ is a Knuth
operation.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: 24 pages. Compared with the previous versions, in the last section,
  instead of considering the rank metric codes derived from quadratic APN
  functions we investigate the more general context of dimensional dual
  hyperovals and some proofs have been simplified</dc:description>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  With the recent emergence and the explosion of users in social networks,
Internet users have come to know more about other people or companies through
information obtained from online groups or communities and therefore meet new
opportunities. An avalanche of diverse and unstructured information is created
every minute, for billions of devices connected to the Internet all the time.
Analyze, process, understand and evaluate these data, it is a challenging task,
given the volume, velocity and variety of information from these social
networks. However, a better understanding of the process of monitoring networks
and the use of tools of this kind are essential for people, companies and the
academic world. The application of monitoring systems, information management
and the possibility of bringing brands to people, are some positives that this
research will provide better knowledge of the problems. In this research will
be analyzed monitoring tool of social networks SCUP, its details, its features
and the tool related to business management. In conclusion, we present all the
peculiarities of the software and the possibilities applicable in the corporate
environment, as aid to decision making.

of high temporal and spatial resolution, which permits fine-grained cloud
observation. In this paper, we show how images taken by WSIs can be used to
estimate solar radiation. Sky cameras are useful here because they provide
additional information about cloud movement and coverage, which are otherwise
not available from weather station data. Our setup includes ground-based
weather stations at the same location as the imagers. We use their measurements
to validate our methods.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Service robots for the domestic environment are intended to autonomously
provide support for their users. However, state-of-the-art robots still often
get stuck in failure situations leading to breakdowns in the interaction flow
from which the robot cannot recover alone. We performed a multi-user
Wizard-of-Oz experiment in which we manipulated the robot's behavior in such a
way that it appeared unexpected and malfunctioning, and asked participants to
help the robot in order to restore the interaction flow. We examined how
participants reacted to the robot's error, its subsequent request for help and
how it changed their perception of the robot with respect to perceived
intelligence, likability, and task contribution. As interaction scenario we
used a game of building Lego models performed by user dyads. In total 38
participants interacted with the robot and helped in malfunctioning situations.
We report two major findings: (1) in user dyads, the user who gave the last
command followed by the user who is closer is more likely to help (2)
malfunctions that can be actively fixed by the user seem not to negatively
impact perceived intelligence and likability ratings. This work offers insights
in how far user support can be a strategy for domestic service robots to
recover from repeating malfunctions.

 <dc:description>  Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems allow people with
disabilities to provide input to devices which empower them to more fully
interact with their environment. Within AAC, switch scanning is a common
paradigm for spelling where a set of characters is highlighted and the user is
queried as to whether their target character is in the highlighted set. These
queries are used to traverse a decision tree which successively prunes away
characters until only a single one remains (the estimate). This work seeks a
decision tree which requires the fewest expected queries per decision sequence
(EQPD). In particular, we remove the constraint that the decision tree needs to
be a row-item or group-row-item style tree and minimize EQPD. We pose the
problem as a Huffman code with variable, integer cost and solve it with a mild
extension of Golin's method in &quot;A dynamic programming algorithm for
constructing optimal prefix-free codes with unequal letter costs&quot;, IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory (1998). Additionally, we model the user on
the query level by their probability of detection and false alarm to derive
their expected performance on the character level given some decision tree. We
perform experiments which show that the min EQPD decision tree (Karp) may
reduce selection times, especially for timed (single switch) switch scanning.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for
sequence labeling tasks. We propose two new variants of RNNs integrating
improvements for sequence labeling, and we compare them to the more traditional
Elman and Jordan RNNs. We compare all models, either traditional or new, on
four distinct tasks of sequence labeling: two on Spoken Language Understanding
(ATIS and MEDIA); and two of POS tagging for the French Treebank (FTB) and the
Penn Treebank (PTB) corpora. The results show that our new variants of RNNs are
always more effective than the others.

 <dc:description>  We present a new type of probabilistic model which we call DISsimilarity
COefficient Networks (DISCO Nets). DISCO Nets allow us to efficiently sample
from a posterior distribution parametrised by a neural network. During
training, DISCO Nets are learned by minimising the dissimilarity coefficient
between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. This allows us to
tailor the training to the loss related to the task at hand. We empirically
show that (i) by modeling uncertainty on the output value, DISCO Nets
outperform equivalent non-probabilistic predictive networks and (ii) DISCO Nets
accurately model the uncertainty of the output, outperforming existing
probabilistic models based on deep neural networks.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an end-to-end framework for task-oriented dialog systems
using a variant of Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN). The model is able to
interface with a relational database and jointly learn policies for both
language understanding and dialog strategy. Moreover, we propose a hybrid
algorithm that combines the strength of reinforcement learning and supervised
learning to achieve faster learning speed. We evaluated the proposed model on a
20 Question Game conversational game simulator. Results show that the proposed
method outperforms the modular-based baseline and learns a distributed
representation of the latent dialog state.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a new spoken dialog portal that connects systems
produced by the spoken dialog academic research community and gives them access
to real users. We introduce a distributed, multi-modal, multi-agent prototype
dialog framework that affords easy integration with various remote resources,
ranging from end-to-end dialog systems to external knowledge APIs. To date, the
DialPort portal has successfully connected to the multi-domain spoken dialog
system at Cambridge University, the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration) weather API and the Yelp API.

 <dc:description>  The ad-hoc querying process is slow and error prone due to inability of
business experts of accessing data directly without involving IT experts. The
problem lies in complexity of means used to query data. We propose a new
natural language- and semistar ontology-based ad-hoc querying approach which
lowers the steep learning curve required to be able to query data. The proposed
approach would significantly shorten the time needed to master the ad-hoc
querying and to gain the direct access to data by business experts, thus
facilitating the decision making process in enterprises, government
institutions and other organizations.

 <dc:title>The power of Sherali-Adams relaxations for general-valued CSPs</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We give a precise algebraic characterisation of the power of Sherali-Adams
relaxations for solvability of valued constraint satisfaction problems to
optimality. The condition is that of bounded width which has already been shown
to capture the power of local consistency methods for decision CSPs and the
power of semidefinite programming for robust approximation of CSPs.
  Our characterisation has several algorithmic and complexity consequences. On
the algorithmic side, we show that several novel and many known valued
constraint languages are tractable via the third level of the Sherali-Adams
relaxation. For the known languages, this is a significantly simpler algorithm
than the previously obtained ones. On the complexity side, we obtain a
dichotomy theorem for valued constraint languages that can express an injective
unary function. This implies a simple proof of the dichotomy theorem for
conservative valued constraint languages established by Kolmogorov and Zivny
[JACM'13], and also a dichotomy theorem for the exact solvability of
Minimum-Solution problems. These are generalisations of Minimum-Ones problems
to arbitrary finite domains. Our result improves on several previous
classifications by Khanna et al. [SICOMP'00], Jonsson et al. [SICOMP'08], and
Uppman [ICALP'13].

 <dc:description>  In this work we introduce a differentiable version of the Compositional
Pattern Producing Network, called the DPPN. Unlike a standard CPPN, the
topology of a DPPN is evolved but the weights are learned. A Lamarckian
algorithm, that combines evolution and learning, produces DPPNs to reconstruct
an image. Our main result is that DPPNs can be evolved/trained to compress the
weights of a denoising autoencoder from 157684 to roughly 200 parameters, while
achieving a reconstruction accuracy comparable to a fully connected network
with more than two orders of magnitude more parameters. The regularization
ability of the DPPN allows it to rediscover (approximate) convolutional network
architectures embedded within a fully connected architecture. Such
convolutional architectures are the current state of the art for many computer
vision applications, so it is satisfying that DPPNs are capable of discovering
this structure rather than having to build it in by design. DPPNs exhibit
better generalization when tested on the Omniglot dataset after being trained
on MNIST, than directly encoded fully connected autoencoders. DPPNs are
therefore a new framework for integrating learning and evolution.

 <dc:title>The Dark Side of Ethical Robots</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Concerns over the risks associated with advances in Artificial Intelligence
have prompted calls for greater efforts toward robust and beneficial AI,
including machine ethics. Recently, roboticists have responded by initiating
the development of so-called ethical robots. These robots would, ideally,
evaluate the consequences of their actions and morally justify their choices.
This emerging field promises to develop extensively over the next years.
However, in this paper, we point out an inherent limitation of the emerging
field of ethical robots. We show that building ethical robots also necessarily
facilitates the construction of unethical robots. In three experiments, we show
that it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves
competitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific
AI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make
unethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee
the responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we
conclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of
engineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by
legislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to
increase the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it.

 <dc:title>Fully Convolutional Networks for Dense Semantic Labelling of
  High-Resolution Aerial Imagery</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sherrah, Jamie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The trend towards higher resolution remote sensing imagery facilitates a
transition from land-use classification to object-level scene understanding.
Rather than relying purely on spectral content, appearance-based image features
come into play. In this work, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are
applied to semantic labelling of high-resolution remote sensing data. Recent
advances in fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are adapted to overhead data
and shown to be as effective as in other domains. A full-resolution labelling
is inferred using a deep FCN with no downsampling, obviating the need for
deconvolution or interpolation. To make better use of image features, a
pre-trained CNN is fine-tuned on remote sensing data in a hybrid network
context, resulting in superior results compared to a network trained from
scratch. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of labelling
high-resolution aerial imagery, where fine boundary detail is important. The
dense labelling yields state-of-the-art accuracy for the ISPRS Vaihingen and
Potsdam benchmark data sets.

 <dc:description>  We present a data-driven approach to determine the memory kernel and random
noise in generalized Langevin equations. To facilitate practical
implementations, we parameterize the kernel function in the Laplace domain by a
rational function, with coefficients directly linked to the equilibrium
statistics of the coarse-grain variables. We show that such an approximation
can be constructed to arbitrarily high order and the resulting generalized
Langevin dynamics can be embedded in an extended stochastic model without
explicit memory. We demonstrate how to introduce the stochastic noise so that
the second fluctuation-dissipation theorem is exactly satisfied. Results from
several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

 <dc:description>  The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy relies on establishing trust in distributed
networked systems, where the reliability of a user is assessed through digital
peer-review processes that aggregate ratings into reputation scores. Here we
present evidence of a network effect which biases digital reputation, revealing
that P2P networks display exceedingly high levels of reciprocity. In fact,
these are much higher than those compatible with a null assumption that
preserves the empirically observed level of agreement between all pairs of
nodes, and rather close to the highest levels structurally compatible with the
networks' reputation landscape. This indicates that the crowdsourcing process
underpinning digital reputation can be significantly distorted by the attempt
of users to mutually boost reputation, or to retaliate, through the exchange of
ratings. We uncover that the least active users are predominantly responsible
for such reciprocity-induced bias, and that this fact can be exploited to
obtain more reliable reputation estimates. Our findings are robust across
different P2P platforms, including both cases where ratings are used to vote on
the content produced by users and to vote on user profiles.

between an intelligent control plane and an overly simple, stateless data plane
results in the inability to exploit the flexibility of a software based
network. In this paper we propose SDNFV, a framework that expands the
capabilities of network processing-and-forwarding elements to flexibly manage
packet flows, while retaining both a high performance data plane and an easily
managed control plane.
  SDNFV proposes a hierarchical control framework where decisions are made
across the SDN controller, a host-level manager, and individual VMs to best
exploit state available at each level. This increases the network's flexibility
compared to existing SDNs where controllers often make decisions solely based
on the first packet header of a flow. SDNFV intelligently places network
services across hosts and connects them in sequential and parallel chains,
giving both the SDN controller and individual network functions the ability to
enhance and update flow rules to adapt to changing conditions. Our prototype
demonstrates how to efficiently and flexibly reroute flows based on data plane
state such as packet payloads and traffic characteristics.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a joint model for performing unsupervised morphological
analysis on words, and learning a character-level composition function from
morphemes to word embeddings. Our model splits individual words into segments,
and weights each segment according to its ability to predict context words. Our
morphological analysis is comparable to dedicated morphological analyzers at
the task of morpheme boundary recovery, and also performs better than
word-based embedding models at the task of syntactic analogy answering.
Finally, we show that incorporating morphology explicitly into character-level
models help them produce embeddings for unseen words which correlate better
with human judgments.

 <dc:description>  Human-Robot-Interaction (HRI) research is typically built around the premise
that the robot serves to assist a human in achieving a human-led goal or shared
task. However, there are many circumstances during HRI in which a robot may
need the assistance of a human in shared tasks or to achieve goals. We use the
ROBO-GUIDE model as a case study, and insights from social psychology, to
examine how a robot's personality can impact on user cooperation. A study of
364 participants indicates that individuals may prefer to use likable social
robots ahead of those designed to appear more capable; this outcome reflects
known social decisions in human interpersonal relationships. This work further
demonstrates the value of social psychology in developing social robots and
exploring HRI.

the current state-of-the-art, while achieving significant computational
performance gains and improved numerical stability. The use of diagonal

at a small loss of modelling quality, is also explored. Our approach is up to

 <dc:description>  Studies of social structures has been grown on the last years, because its
sharing form and content creation attracted the public in general. Such
structures are observed, as an example, in literary pieces. A featured author
is J.R.R. Tolkien, with his books that describe a fictional world and its
inhabitants. These books bring a narrative of the creation of the Middle-Earth
and all of its mythology. His main pieces are: The Silmarillion, The Hobbit and
The Lord of the rings, The objective of this article is the analysis of the
social structures emerging of the conjunction of these works, where the social
relations are described by the reference criteria, shared events and direct
bonds, with the major centrality measures together with the structural entropy
of first order. Enabling the doing of an analogy with the canonic ensemble of
the mechanics statistics and enabling analyzing the degree of homogeneity of
the bonds between the formed communities.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a method for quantifying the inherent unpredictability of a
continuous-valued time series via an extension of the differential Shannon
entropy rate. Our extension, the specific entropy rate, quantifies the amount
of predictive uncertainty associated with a specific state, rather than
averaged over all states. We relate the specific entropy rate to popular
`complexity' measures such as Approximate and Sample Entropies. We provide a
data-driven approach for estimating the specific entropy rate of an observed
time series. Finally, we consider three case studies of estimating specific
entropy rate from synthetic and physiological data relevant to the analysis of
heart rate variability.

 <dc:title>Efficient Estimation of k for the Nearest Neighbors Class of Methods</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Breuel, Thomas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) method has received much attention in the past
decades, where some theoretical bounds on its performance were identified and
where practical optimizations were proposed for making it work fairly well in
high dimensional spaces and on large datasets. From countless experiments of
the past it became widely accepted that the value of k has a significant impact
on the performance of this method. However, the efficient optimization of this
parameter has not received so much attention in literature. Today, the most
common approach is to cross-validate or bootstrap this value for all values in
question. This approach forces distances to be recomputed many times, even if
efficient methods are used. Hence, estimating the optimal k can become
expensive even on modern systems. Frequently, this circumstance leads to a
sparse manual search of k. In this paper we want to point out that a systematic
and thorough estimation of the parameter k can be performed efficiently. The
discussed approach relies on large matrices, but we want to argue, that in
practice a higher space complexity is often much less of a problem than
repetitive distance computations.

 <dc:description>  This work proposes a biologically inspired approach that focuses on attention
systems that are able to inhibit or constrain what is relevant at any one
moment. We propose a radically new approach to making progress in human-robot
joint attention called &quot;the joint guided search task&quot;. Visual guided search is
the activity of the eye as it saccades from position to position recognizing
objects in each fixation location until the target object is found. Our
research focuses on the exchange of nonverbal behavior toward changing the
fixation location while also performing object recognition. Our main goal is a
very ambitious goal of sharing attention through probing synthetic foreground
maps (i.e. what is being considered by the robotic agent) and the biological
attention system of the human.

 <dc:description>  Real-time scheduling algorithms proposed in the literature are often based on
worst-case estimates of task parameters. The performance of an open-loop scheme
can be degraded significantly if there are uncertainties in task parameters,
such as the execution times of the tasks. Therefore, to cope with such a
situation, a closed-loop scheme, where feedback is exploited to adjust the
system parameters, can be applied. We propose an optimal control framework that
takes advantage of feeding back information of finished tasks to solve a
real-time multiprocessor scheduling problem with uncertainty in task execution
times, with the objective of minimizing the total energy consumption.
Specifically, we propose a linear programming based algorithm to solve a
workload partitioning problem and adopt McNaughton's wrap around algorithm to
find the task execution order. The simulation results illustrate that our
feedback scheduling algorithm can save energy by as much as 40% compared to an
open-loop method for two processor models, i.e. a PowerPC 405LP and an XScale
processor.

textual entailment in some domains. To that end, we first create (for
experimental purposes) an entailment dataset for the clinical domain, and a
highly competitive supervised entailment system, ENT, that is effective (out of
the box) on two domains. We then explore self-training and active learning
strategies to address the lack of labeled data. With self-training, we
successfully exploit unlabeled data to improve over ENT by 15% F-score on the
newswire domain, and 13% F-score on clinical data. On the other hand, our
active learning experiments demonstrate that we can match (and even beat) ENT
using only 6.6% of the training data in the clinical domain, and only 5.8% of
the training data in the newswire domain.

 <dc:description>  Freeze LTL is a temporal logic with registers that is suitable for specifying
properties of data words. In this paper we study the model checking problem for
Freeze LTL on one-counter automata. This problem is known to be undecidable in
full generality and PSPACE-complete for the special case of deterministic
one-counter automata. Several years ago, Demri and Sangnier investigated the
model checking problem for the flat fragment of Freeze LTL on several classes
of counter automata and posed the decidability of model checking flat Freeze
LTL on one-counter automata as an open problem. In this paper we resolve this
problem positively, utilising a known reduction to a reachability problem on
one-counter automata with parameterised equality and disequality tests. Our
main technical contribution is to show decidability of the latter problem by
translation to Presburger arithmetic.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we take a fresh look at some old and new algorithms for
off-policy, return-based reinforcement learning. Expressing these in a common
form, we derive a novel algorithm, Retrace($\lambda$), with three desired
properties: (1) it has low variance; (2) it safely uses samples collected from
any behaviour policy, whatever its degree of &quot;off-policyness&quot;; and (3) it is
efficient as it makes the best use of samples collected from near on-policy
behaviour policies. We analyze the contractive nature of the related operator
under both off-policy policy evaluation and control settings and derive online
sample-based algorithms. We believe this is the first return-based off-policy
control algorithm converging a.s. to $Q^*$ without the GLIE assumption (Greedy
in the Limit with Infinite Exploration). As a corollary, we prove the
convergence of Watkins' Q($\lambda$), which was an open problem since 1989. We
illustrate the benefits of Retrace($\lambda$) on a standard suite of Atari 2600
games.

 <dc:title>Formal Semantics and Soundness of a Translation from Event-B Actions to
  SQL Statements</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Wahls, Tim</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The EventB2SQL tool translates Event-B models to persistent Java applications
that store the state of the model in a relational database. Most Event-B
assignments are translated directly to SQL database modification statements,
which can then be executed against the database. In this work, we present a
formal semantics for and prove the soundness of the translation of sets of
assignment statements representing the actions of an Event-B event. This allows
the generated code to be used with confidence in its correctness.

 <dc:title>MHCL: IPv6 Multihop Host Configuration for Low-Power Wireless Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Standard routing protocols for Low power and Lossy Networks are typically
designed to optimize bottom-up data flows, by maintaining a cycle-free network
topology. The advantage of such topologies is low memory footprint to store
routing information (only the parent's address needs to me known by each node).
The disadvantage is that other communication patterns, like top-down and
bidirectional data flows, are not easily implemented. In this work we propose
MHCL: IPv6 Multihop Host Configuration for Low-Power Wireless Networks. MHCL
employs hierarchical address allocation that explores cycle-free network
topologies and aims to enable top-down data communication with low message
overhead and memory footprint. We evaluated the performance of MHCL both
analytically and through simulations. We implemented MHCL as a subroutine of
RPL protocol on Contiki OS and showed that it significantly improves top-down
message delivery in RPL, while using a constant amount of memory (i.e.,
independent of network size) and being efficient in terms of setup time and
number of control messages.

 <dc:description>  Power spectral density (PSD) maps providing the distribution of RF power
across space and frequency are constructed using power measurements collected
by a network of low-cost sensors. By introducing linear compression and
quantization to a small number of bits, sensor measurements can be communicated
to the fusion center with minimal bandwidth requirements. Strengths of data-
and model-driven approaches are combined to develop estimators capable of
incorporating multiple forms of spectral and propagation prior information
while fitting the rapid variations of shadow fading across space. To this end,
novel nonparametric and semiparametric formulations are investigated. It is
shown that PSD maps can be obtained using support vector machine-type solvers.
In addition to batch approaches, an online algorithm attuned to real-time
operation is developed. Numerical tests assess the performance of the novel
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation has become a major alternative to widely used
phrase-based statistical machine translation. We notice however that much of
research on neural machine translation has focused on European languages
despite its language agnostic nature. In this paper, we apply neural machine
translation to the task of Arabic translation (Ar&lt;-&gt;En) and compare it against
a standard phrase-based translation system. We run extensive comparison using
various configurations in preprocessing Arabic script and show that the
phrase-based and neural translation systems perform comparably to each other
and that proper preprocessing of Arabic script has a similar effect on both of
the systems. We however observe that the neural machine translation
significantly outperform the phrase-based system on an out-of-domain test set,
making it attractive for real-world deployment.

 <dc:description>  With the spread of multi- and many-core processors more and more typical task
is to re-implement some source code written originally for a single processor
to run on more than one cores. Since it is a serious investment, it is
important to decide how much efforts pays off, and whether the resulting
implementation has as good performability as it could be. The Amdahl's law
provides some theoretical upper limits for the performance gain reachable
through parallelizing the code, but it needs the detailed architectural
knowledge of the program code, does not consider the housekeeping activity
needed for parallelization and cannot tell how the actual stage of
parallelization implementation performs. The present paper suggests a
quantitative measure for that goal. This figure of merit is derived
experimentally, from measured running time, and number of threads/cores. It can
be used to quantify the used parallelization technology, the connection between
the computing units, the acceleration technology under the given conditions,
communication method within SoC, or the performance of the software
team/compiler.

 <dc:title>Hardness of approximation for H-free edge modification problems</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The $H$-Free Edge Deletion problem asks, for a given graph $G$ and an integer
$k$, whether it is possible to delete at most $k$ edges from $G$ to make it
$H$-free, that is, not containing $H$ as an induced subgraph. The $H$-Free Edge
Completion problem is defined similarly, but we add edges instead of deleting
them. The study of these two problem families has recently been the subject of
intensive studies from the point of view of parameterized complexity and
kernelization. In particular, it was shown that the problems do not admit
polynomial kernels (under plausible complexity assumptions) for almost all
graphs $H$, with several important exceptions occurring when the class of
$H$-free graphs exhibits some structural properties.
  In this work we complement the parameterized study of edge modification
problems to $H$-free graphs by considering their approximability. We prove that
whenever $H$ is $3$-connected and has at least two non-edges, then both
$H$-Free Edge Deletion and $H$-Free Edge Completion are very hard to
approximate: they do not admit $\mathrm{poly}(\mathsf{OPT})$-approximation in
polynomial time, unless $\mathrm{P}=\mathrm{NP}$, or even in time
subexponential in $\mathsf{OPT}$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
The assumption of the existence of two non-edges appears to be important: we
show that whenever $H$ is a complete graph without one edge, then $H$-Free Edge
Deletion is tightly connected to the Min Horn problem, whose approximability is
still open. Finally, in an attempt to extend our hardness results beyond
$3$-connected graphs, we consider the cases of $H$ being a path or a cycle, and
we achieve an almost complete dichotomy there.

spoken dialogue systems. A unified neural network framework is proposed to
enable the system to first learn by supervision from a set of dialogue data and
then continuously improve its behaviour via reinforcement learning, all using
gradient-based algorithms on one single model. The experiments demonstrate the
supervised model's effectiveness in the corpus-based evaluation, with user
simulation, and with paid human subjects. The use of reinforcement learning
further improves the model's performance in both interactive settings,
especially under higher-noise conditions.

 <dc:description>  A recent IEEE Access Paper by Gunn, Allison and Abbott (GAA) proposed a new
transient attack against the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key
exchange system. The attack is valid, but it is easy to build a defense for the
KLJN system. Here we note that GAA's paper contains several invalid statements
regarding security measures and the continuity of functions in classical
physics. These deficiencies are clarified in our present paper, wherein we also
emphasize that a new version of the KLJN system is immune against all existing
attacks, including the one by GAA.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the spatial and temporal diffusion of political violence
in North and West Africa. It does so by endeavoring to represent the mental
landscape that lives in the back of a group leader's mind as he contemplates
strategic targeting. We assume that this representation is a combination of the
physical geography of the target environment, and the mental and physical cost
of following a seemingly random pattern of attacks. Focusing on the distance
and time between attacks and taking into consideration the transaction costs
that state boundaries impose, we wish to understand what constrains a group
leader to attack at a location other than the one that would seem to yield the
greatest overt payoff. By its very nature, the research problem defies the
collection of a full set of structural data. Instead, we leverage functional
data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) dataset
that, inter alia, meticulously catalogues violent extremist incidents in North
and West Africa since 1997, to generate a network whose nodes are
administrative regions. These nodes are connected by edges of qualitatively
different types: undirected edges representing geographic distance, undirected
edges representing borders, and directed edges representing consecutive attacks
by the same group at the two endpoints. We analyze the resulting network using
novel spectral embedding techniques that are able to account fully for the
different types of edges. The result is a map of North and West Africa that
depicts the permeability to violence. A better understanding of how location,
time, and borders condition attacks enables planning, prepositioning, and
response.

 <dc:description>  In high dimensional settings, sparse structures are crucial for efficiency,
both in term of memory, computation and performance. It is customary to
consider $\ell_1$ penalty to enforce sparsity in such scenarios. Sparsity
enforcing methods, the Lasso being a canonical example, are popular candidates
to address high dimension. For efficiency, they rely on tuning a parameter
trading data fitting versus sparsity. For the Lasso theory to hold this tuning
parameter should be proportional to the noise level, yet the latter is often
unknown in practice. A possible remedy is to jointly optimize over the
regression parameter as well as over the noise level. This has been considered
under several names in the literature: Scaled-Lasso, Square-root Lasso,
Concomitant Lasso estimation for instance, and could be of interest for
confidence sets or uncertainty quantification. In this work, after illustrating
numerical difficulties for the Smoothed Concomitant Lasso formulation, we
propose a modification we coined Smoothed Concomitant Lasso, aimed at
increasing numerical stability. We propose an efficient and accurate solver
leading to a computational cost no more expansive than the one for the Lasso.
We leverage on standard ingredients behind the success of fast Lasso solvers: a
coordinate descent algorithm, combined with safe screening rules to achieve
speed efficiency, by eliminating early irrelevant features.

 <dc:description>  This article examines the structure and spatial patterns of violent political
organizations in the Sahel-Sahara, a region characterized by growing political
instability over the last 20 years. Drawing on a public collection of
disaggregated data, the article uses network science to represent alliances and
conflicts of 179 organizations that were involved in violent events between
1997 and 2014. To this end, we combine two spectral embedding techniques that
have previously been considered separately: one for directed graphs
(relationships are asymmetric), and one for signed graphs (relationships are
positive or negative). Our result show that groups that are net attackers are
indistinguishable at the level of their individual behavior, but clearly
separate into pro- and anti-political violence based on the groups to which
they are close. The second part of the article maps a series of 389 events
related to nine Trans-Saharan Islamist groups between 2004 and 2014. Spatial
analysis suggests that cross-border movement has intensified following the
establishment of military bases by AQIM in Mali but reveals no evidence of a
border sanctuary. Owing to the transnational nature of conflict, the article
shows that national management strategies and foreign military interventions
have profoundly affected the movement of Islamist groups.

the solution of certain optimization problems, it also has some drawbacks. In
the VS algorithm, candidate solutions are generated around the current best
solution by using a Gaussian distribution at each iteration pass. This provides
simplicity to the algorithm but it also leads to some problems along.
Especially, for the functions those have a number of local minimum points, to
select a single point to generate candidate solutions leads the algorithm to
being trapped into a local minimum point. Due to the adaptive step-size
adjustment scheme used in the VS algorithm, the locality of the created
candidate solutions is increased at each iteration pass. Therefore, if the
algorithm cannot escape a local point as quickly as possible, it becomes much
more difficult for the algorithm to escape from that point in the latter
iterations. In this study, a modified Vortex Search algorithm (MVS) is proposed
to overcome above mentioned drawback of the existing VS algorithm. In the MVS
algorithm, the candidate solutions are generated around a number of points at
each iteration pass. Computational results showed that with the help of this
modification the global search ability of the existing VS algorithm is improved
and the MVS algorithm outperformed the existing VS algorithm, PSO2011 and ABC
algorithms for the benchmark numerical function set.

 <dc:description>  A Boltzmann machine is a stochastic neural network that has been extensively
used in the layers of deep architectures for modern machine learning
applications. In this paper, we develop a Boltzmann machine that is capable of
modelling thermodynamic observables for physical systems in thermal
equilibrium. Through unsupervised learning, we train the Boltzmann machine on
data sets constructed with spin configurations importance-sampled from the
partition function of an Ising Hamiltonian at different temperatures using
Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The trained Boltzmann machine is then used to
generate spin states, for which we compare thermodynamic observables to those
computed by direct MC sampling. We demonstrate that the Boltzmann machine can
faithfully reproduce the observables of the physical system. Further, we
observe that the number of neurons required to obtain accurate results
increases as the system is brought close to criticality.

 <dc:description>  In an exploratory study on educational child-robot interaction we investigate
the effect of alternating a learning activity with an additional shared
activity. Our aim is to enhance and enrich the relationship between child and
robot by introducing &quot;physical extracurricular activities&quot;. This enriched
relationship might ultimately influence the way the child and robot interact
with the learning material. We use qualitative measurement techniques to
evaluate the effect of the additional activity on the child-robot relationship.
We also explore how these metrics can be integrated in a highly exploratory
cumulative score for the relationship between child and robot. This cumulative
score suggests a difference in the overall child-robot relationship between
children who engage in a physical extracurricular activity with the robot, and
children who only engage in the learning activity with the robot.

 <dc:description>  We present a new open-source cosmological code, called SWIFT, designed to
solve the equations of hydrodynamics using a particle-based approach (Smooth
Particle Hydrodynamics) on hybrid shared/distributed-memory architectures.
SWIFT was designed from the bottom up to provide excellent strong scaling on
both commodity clusters (Tier-2 systems) and Top100-supercomputers (Tier-0
systems), without relying on architecture-specific features or specialized
accelerator hardware. This performance is due to three main computational
approaches: (1) Task-based parallelism for shared-memory parallelism, which
provides fine-grained load balancing and thus strong scaling on large numbers
of cores. (2) Graph-based domain decomposition, which uses the task graph to
decompose the simulation domain such that the work, as opposed to just the
data, as is the case with most partitioning schemes, is equally distributed
across all nodes. (3) Fully dynamic and asynchronous communication, in which
communication is modelled as just another task in the task-based scheme,
sending data whenever it is ready and deferring on tasks that rely on data from
other nodes until it arrives. In order to use these approaches, the code had to
be re-written from scratch, and the algorithms therein adapted to the
task-based paradigm. As a result, we can show upwards of 60% parallel
efficiency for moderate-sized problems when increasing the number of cores
512-fold, on both x86-based and Power8-based architectures.

 <dc:description>  In social networks, the collective behavior of large populations can be
shaped by a small set of influencers through a cascading process induced by
&quot;peer pressure&quot;. For large-scale networks, efficient identification of multiple
influential spreaders with a linear algorithm in threshold models that exhibit
a first-order transition still remains a challenging task. Here we address this
issue by exploring the collective influence in general threshold models of
behavior cascading. Our analysis reveals that the importance of spreaders is
fixed by the subcritical paths along which cascades propagate: the number of
subcritical paths attached to each spreader determines its contribution to
global cascades. The concept of subcritical path allows us to introduce a
linearly scalable algorithm for massively large-scale networks. Results in both
synthetic random graphs and real networks show that the proposed method can
achieve larger collective influence given same number of seeds compared with
other linearly scalable heuristic approaches.

 <dc:description>  Identifying the most influential spreaders that maximize information flow is
a central question in network theory. Recently, a scalable method called
&quot;Collective Influence (CI)&quot; has been put forward through collective influence
maximization. In contrast to heuristic methods evaluating nodes' significance
separately, CI method inspects the collective influence of multiple spreaders.
Despite that CI applies to the influence maximization problem in percolation
model, it is still important to examine its efficacy in realistic information
spreading. Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and
scientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and
LiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal
multi-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted
from data to construct &quot;virtual&quot; information spreading processes. Our results
demonstrate that the set of spreaders selected by CI can induce larger scale of
information propagation. Moreover, local measures as the number of connections
or citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance
in realistic information spreading. This result has significance for rankings
scientists in scientific networks like the APS, where the commonly used number
of citations can be a poor indicator of the collective influence of authors in
the community.

 <dc:title>Rotation Invariant Angular Descriptor Via A Bandlimited Gaussian-like

 <dc:description>  We present a new smooth, Gaussian-like kernel that allows the kernel density
estimate for an angular distribution to be exactly represented by a finite
number of its Fourier series coefficients. Distributions of angular quantities,
such as gradients, are a central part of several state-of-the-art image
processing algorithms, but these distributions are usually described via
histograms and therefore lack rotation invariance due to binning artifacts.
Replacing histograming with kernel density estimation removes these binning
artifacts and can provide a finite-dimensional descriptor of the distribution,
provided that the kernel is selected to be bandlimited. In this paper, we
present a new band-limited kernel that has the added advantage of being
Gaussian-like in the angular domain. We then show that it compares favorably to
gradient histograms for patch matching, person detection, and texture
segmentation.

 <dc:description>  From the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for
the activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning
applications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental
theoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is
constrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the
Turing Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe
itself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the
present paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy
point of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination
of learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying
agent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the
problem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in
reality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for
learning Turing machines.

 <dc:description>  We study maximum selection and sorting of $n$ numbers using pairwise
comparators that output the larger of their two inputs if the inputs are more
than a given threshold apart, and output an adversarially-chosen input
otherwise. We consider two adversarial models. A non-adaptive adversary that
decides on the outcomes in advance based solely on the inputs, and an adaptive
adversary that can decide on the outcome of each query depending on previous
queries and outcomes.
  Against the non-adaptive adversary, we derive a maximum-selection algorithm
that uses at most $2n$ comparisons in expectation, and a sorting algorithm that
uses at most $2n \ln n$ comparisons in expectation. These numbers are within
small constant factors from the best possible. Against the adaptive adversary,
we propose a maximum-selection algorithm that uses $\Theta(n\log
(1/{\epsilon}))$ comparisons to output a correct answer with probability at
least $1-\epsilon$. The existence of this algorithm affirmatively resolves an
open problem of Ajtai, Feldman, Hassadim, and Nelson.
  Our study was motivated by a density-estimation problem where, given samples
from an unknown underlying distribution, we would like to find a distribution
in a known class of $n$ candidate distributions that is close to underlying
distribution in $\ell_1$ distance. Scheffe's algorithm outputs a distribution
at an $\ell_1$ distance at most 9 times the minimum and runs in time
$\Theta(n^2\log n)$. Using maximum selection, we propose an algorithm with the
same approximation guarantee but run time of $\Theta(n\log n)$.

 <dc:description>  Optical strain is an extension of optical flow that is capable of quantifying
subtle changes on faces and representing the minute facial motion intensities
at the pixel level. This is computationally essential for the relatively new
field of spontaneous micro-expression, where subtle expressions can be
technically challenging to pinpoint. In this paper, we present a novel method
for detecting and recognizing micro-expressions by utilizing facial optical
strain magnitudes to construct optical strain features and optical strain
weighted features. The two sets of features are then concatenated to form the
resultant feature histogram. Experiments were performed on the CASME II and
SMIC databases. We demonstrate on both databases, the usefulness of optical
strain information and more importantly, that our best approaches are able to
outperform the original baseline results for both detection and recognition
tasks. A comparison of the proposed method with other existing spatio-temporal
feature extraction approaches is also presented.

 <dc:description>  An important application of interactive machine learning is extending or
amplifying the cognitive and physical capabilities of a human. To accomplish
this, machines need to learn about their human users' intentions and adapt to
their preferences. In most current research, a user has conveyed preferences to
a machine using explicit corrective or instructive feedback; explicit feedback
imposes a cognitive load on the user and is expensive in terms of human effort.
The primary objective of the current work is to demonstrate that a learning
agent can reduce the amount of explicit feedback required for adapting to the
user's preferences pertaining to a task by learning to perceive a value of its
behavior from the human user, particularly from the user's facial
expressions---we call this face valuing. We empirically evaluate face valuing
on a grip selection task. Our preliminary results suggest that an agent can
quickly adapt to a user's changing preferences with minimal explicit feedback
by learning a value function that maps facial features extracted from a camera
image to expected future reward. We believe that an agent learning to perceive
a value from the body language of its human user is complementary to existing
interactive machine learning approaches and will help in creating successful
human-machine interactive applications.

 <dc:title>On Uplink User Capacity for Massive MIMO Cellular Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sivamalai, Anand</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Evans, Jamie S.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Under the conditions where performance in a massive MIMO network is limited
by pilot contamination, the reverse link signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
exhibits different distributions when using different pilot allocation schemes.
By utilising different sets of orthogonal pilot sequences, as opposed to reused
sequences amongst adjacent cells, the resulting SIR distribution is more
favourable with respect to maximising the number of users on the network while
maintaining a given quality of service (QoS) for all users. This paper provides
a simple expression for uplink user capacity on such networks and presents
uplink user capacity figures for both pilot allocation schemes for a selection
of quality of service targets.

 <dc:description>  Ground-based whole sky cameras have opened up new opportunities for
monitoring the earth's atmosphere. These cameras are an important complement to
satellite images by providing geoscientists with cheaper, faster, and more
localized data. The images captured by whole sky imagers can have high spatial
and temporal resolution, which is an important pre-requisite for applications
such as solar energy modeling, cloud attenuation analysis, local weather
prediction, etc.
  Extracting valuable information from the huge amount of image data by
detecting and analyzing the various entities in these images is challenging.
However, powerful machine learning techniques have become available to aid with
the image analysis. This article provides a detailed walk-through of recent
developments in these techniques and their applications in ground-based
imaging. We aim to bridge the gap between computer vision and remote sensing
with the help of illustrative examples. We demonstrate the advantages of using
machine learning techniques in ground-based image analysis via three primary
applications -- segmentation, classification, and denoising.

based on the fact that urban acoustic environment consists of a variety of
sounds. Hence, location information can be inferred from the composition of
sound events/classes present in the audio. More specifically, we adopt matrix
factorization techniques to obtain semantic content of recording in terms of
different sound classes. These semantic information are then combined to
identify the location of recording.

 <dc:description>  Low-shot visual learning---the ability to recognize novel object categories
from very few examples---is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Existing
machine learning approaches fail to generalize in the same way. To make
progress on this foundational problem, we present a low-shot learning benchmark
on complex images that mimics challenges faced by recognition systems in the
wild. We then propose a) representation regularization techniques, and b)
techniques to hallucinate additional training examples for data-starved
classes. Together, our methods improve the effectiveness of convolutional
networks in low-shot learning, improving the one-shot accuracy on novel classes
by 2.3x on the challenging ImageNet dataset.

 <dc:description>  A word's sentiment depends on the domain in which it is used. Computational
social science research thus requires sentiment lexicons that are specific to
the domains being studied. We combine domain-specific word embeddings with a
label propagation framework to induce accurate domain-specific sentiment
lexicons using small sets of seed words, achieving state-of-the-art performance
competitive with approaches that rely on hand-curated resources. Using our
framework we perform two large-scale empirical studies to quantify the extent
to which sentiment varies across time and between communities. We induce and
release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and
community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the
social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons show that more than 5% of
sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity
during the last 150 years, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how
sentiment varies drastically between different communities.

 <dc:title>Cultural Shift or Linguistic Drift? Comparing Two Computational Measures

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Words shift in meaning for many reasons, including cultural factors like new
technologies and regular linguistic processes like subjectification.
Understanding the evolution of language and culture requires disentangling
these underlying causes. Here we show how two different distributional measures
can be used to detect two different types of semantic change. The first
measure, which has been used in many previous works, analyzes global shifts in
a word's distributional semantics, it is sensitive to changes due to regular
processes of linguistic drift, such as the semantic generalization of promise
(&quot;I promise.&quot; -&gt; &quot;It promised to be exciting.&quot;). The second measure, which we
develop here, focuses on local changes to a word's nearest semantic neighbors;
it is more sensitive to cultural shifts, such as the change in the meaning of
cell (&quot;prison cell&quot; -&gt; &quot;cell phone&quot;). Comparing measurements made by these two
methods allows researchers to determine whether changes are more cultural or
linguistic in nature, a distinction that is essential for work in the digital
humanities and historical linguistics.

 <dc:description>  We present a new combinatorial market maker that operates arbitrage-free
combinatorial prediction markets specified by integer programs. Although the
problem of arbitrage-free pricing, while maintaining a bound on the subsidy
provided by the market maker, is #P-hard in the worst case, we posit that the
typical case might be amenable to modern integer programming (IP) solvers. At
the crux of our method is the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm
which is used to implement a Bregman projection aligned with the market maker's
cost function, using an IP solver as an oracle. We demonstrate the tractability
and improved accuracy of our approach on real-world prediction market data from
combinatorial bets placed on the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball
Tournament, where the outcome space is of size 2^63. To our knowledge, this is
the first implementation and empirical evaluation of an arbitrage-free
combinatorial prediction market on this scale.

 <dc:description>  Feature selection is one of the most fundamental problems in machine
learning. An extensive body of work on information-theoretic feature selection
exists which is based on maximizing mutual information between subsets of
features and class labels. Practical methods are forced to rely on
approximations due to the difficulty of estimating mutual information. We
demonstrate that approximations made by existing methods are based on
unrealistic assumptions. We formulate a more flexible and general class of
assumptions based on variational distributions and use them to tractably
generate lower bounds for mutual information. These bounds define a novel
information-theoretic framework for feature selection, which we prove to be
optimal under tree graphical models with proper choice of variational
distributions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method strongly
outperforms existing information-theoretic feature selection approaches.

 <dc:description>  Spatial stochastic models have been much used for performance analysis of
wireless communication networks. This is due to the fact that the performance
of wireless networks depends on the spatial configuration of wireless nodes and
the irregularity of node locations in a real wireless network can be captured
by a spatial point process. Most works on such spatial stochastic models of
wireless networks have adopted homogeneous Poisson point processes as the
models of wireless node locations. While this adoption makes the models
analytically tractable, it assumes that the wireless nodes are located
independently of each other and their spatial correlation is ignored. Recently,
the authors have proposed to adopt the Ginibre point process---one of the
determinantal point processes---as the deployment models of base stations (BSs)
in cellular networks. The determinantal point processes constitute a class of
repulsive point processes and have been attracting attention due to their
mathematically interesting properties and efficient simulation methods. In this
tutorial, we provide a brief guide to the Ginibre point process and its
variant, $\alpha$-Ginibre point process, as the models of BS deployments in
cellular networks and show some existing results on the performance analysis of
cellular network models with $\alpha$-Ginibre deployed BSs. The authors hope
the readers to use such point processes as a tool for analyzing various
problems arising in future cellular networks.

 <dc:description>  Indoor wireless communication is an essential part of next generation
wireless communication system.For an indoor communication number of users and
their device are increasing very rapidly so as a result capacity of frequency
spectrum to accommodate further users in future is limited and also it would be
difficult for service providers to provide more user reliable and high speed
communication so this short come can be solve in future by using Li-Fi based
indoor communication system. Li-Fi which is an emerging branch of optical
wireless communication can be useful in future as a replacement and backup of
Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)for indoor communication because it can provide high
data rate of transmission along with high capacity to utilize more users as its
spectrum bandwidth is much broader than the radio spectrum. In this paper we
will look at the different aspects of the Li-Fi based indoor communication
system,summarizes some of the research conducted so far and we will also
proposed a Li-Fi based communication model keeping in mind coverage area for
multiple user and evaluate its performance under different scenarios .

 <dc:description>  Learning parameters from voluminous data can be prohibitive in terms of
memory and computational requirements. We propose a &quot;compressive learning&quot;
framework where we estimate model parameters from a sketch of the training
data. This sketch is a collection of generalized moments of the underlying
probability distribution of the data. It can be computed in a single pass on
the training set, and is easily computable on streams or distributed datasets.
The proposed framework shares similarities with compressive sensing, which aims
at drastically reducing the dimension of high-dimensional signals while
preserving the ability to reconstruct them. To perform the estimation task, we
derive an iterative algorithm analogous to sparse reconstruction algorithms in
the context of linear inverse problems. We exemplify our framework with the
compressive estimation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), providing heuristics
on the choice of the sketching procedure and theoretical guarantees of
reconstruction. We experimentally show on synthetic data that the proposed
algorithm yields results comparable to the classical Expectation-Maximization
(EM) technique while requiring significantly less memory and fewer computations
when the number of database elements is large. We further demonstrate the
potential of the approach on real large-scale data (over 10 8 training samples)
for the task of model-based speaker verification. Finally, we draw some
connections between the proposed framework and approximate Hilbert space
embedding of probability distributions using random features. We show that the
proposed sketching operator can be seen as an innovative method to design
translation-invariant kernels adapted to the analysis of GMMs. We also use this
theoretical framework to derive information preservation guarantees, in the
spirit of infinite-dimensional compressive sensing.

 <dc:description>  Spectrum sensing is a fundamental operation in cognitive radio environment.
It gives information about spectrum availability by scanning the bands. Usually
a fixed amount of time is given to scan individual bands. Most of the times,
historical information about the traffic in the spectrum bands is not used. But
this information gives the idea, how busy a specific band is. Therefore,
instead of scanning a band for a fixed amount of time, more time can be given
to less occupied bands and less time to heavily occupied ones. In this paper we
have formulated the time assignment problem as integer linear programming and
source coding problems. The time assignment problem is solved using the
associated stochastic optimization problem.

 <dc:description>  Enabling a computer to understand a document so that it can answer
comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor
impeding its solution by machine learned systems is the limited availability of
human-annotated data. Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by
creating over a million training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news
articles with their summarized bullet points, and show that a neural network
can then be trained to give good performance on this task. In this paper, we
conduct a thorough examination of this new reading comprehension task. Our
primary aim is to understand what depth of language understanding is required
to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful
hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by showing
that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 73.6% and
76.6% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by
7-10% and approaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this
task.

 <dc:title>Simultaneous Inpainting and Denoising by Directional Global Three-part
  Decomposition: Connecting Variational and Fourier Domain Based Image
  Processing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thai, Duy Hoang</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the very challenging task of restoring images (i) which have a
large number of missing pixels, (ii) whose existing pixels are corrupted by
noise and (iii) the ideal image to be restored contains both cartoon and
texture elements. The combination of these three properties makes this inverse
problem a very difficult one. The solution proposed in this manuscript is based
on directional global three-part decomposition (DG3PD) [ThaiGottschlich2016]
with directional total variation norm, directional G-norm and
$\ell_\infty$-norm in curvelet domain as key ingredients of the model. Image
decomposition by DG3PD enables a decoupled inpainting and denoising of the
cartoon and texture components. A comparison to existing approaches for
inpainting and denoising shows the advantages of the proposed method. Moreover,
we regard the image restoration problem from the viewpoint of a Bayesian
framework and we discuss the connections between the proposed solution by
function space and related image representation by harmonic analysis and
pyramid decomposition.

 <dc:description>  With the appearance of the heterogeneous platform OpenPower,many-core
accelerator devices have been coupled with Power host processors for the first
time. Towards utilizing their full potential, it is worth investigating
performance portable algorithms that allow to choose the best-fitting hardware
for each domain-specific compute task. Suiting even the high level of
parallelism on modern GPGPUs, our presented approach relies heavily on abstract
meta-programming techniques, which are essential to focus on fine-grained
tuning rather than code porting. With this in mind, the CUDA-based open-source
plasma simulation code PIConGPU is currently being abstracted to support the
heterogeneous OpenPower platform using our fast porting interface cupla, which
wraps the abstract parallel C++11 kernel acceleration library Alpaka. We
demonstrate how PIConGPU can benefit from the tunable kernel execution
strategies of the Alpaka library, achieving portability and performance with
single-source kernels on conventional CPUs, Power8 CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.

 <dc:title>Cache-enabled Device-to-Device Communications: Offloading Gain and

 <dc:description>  By caching files at users, content delivery traffic can be offloaded via
device-to-device (D2D) links if a helper user is willing to transmit the cached
file to the user who requests the file. In practice, the user device has
limited battery capacity, and may terminate the D2D connection when its battery
has little energy left. Thus, taking the battery consumption allowed by the
helper users to support D2D into account introduces a reduction in the possible
amount of offloading. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between
offloading gain of the system and energy cost of each helper user. To this end,
we introduce a user-centric protocol to control the energy cost for a helper
user to transmit the file. Then, we optimize the proactive caching policy to
maximize the offloading opportunity, and optimize the transmit power at each
helper to maximize the offloading probability. Finally, we evaluate the overall
amount of traffic offloaded to D2D links and evaluate the average energy
consumption at each helper, with the optimized caching policy and transmit
power. Simulations show that a significant amount of traffic can be offloaded
even when the energy cost is kept low.

 <dc:title>High Throughput Opportunistic Cooperative Device-to-Device

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To achieve the potential in providing high throughput for cellular networks
by device-to-device (D2D) communications, the interference among D2D links
should be carefully managed. In this paper, we propose an opportunistic
cooperation strategy for D2D transmission by exploiting the caching capability
at the users to control the interference among D2D links. We consider overlay
inband D2D, divide the D2D users into clusters, and assign different frequency
bands to cooperative and non-cooperative D2D links. To provide high opportunity
for cooperative transmission, we introduce a caching policy. To maximize the
network throughput, we jointly optimize the cluster size and bandwidth
allocation, where the closed-form expression of the bandwidth allocation factor
is obtained. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can
provide 400%-500% throughput gain over traditional D2D communications when the
content popularity distribution is skewed, and can provide 60%-80% gain even
when the content popularity distribution is uniform.

 <dc:description>  In combinatorics of words, a concatenation of $k$ consecutive equal blocks is
called a power of order $k$. In this paper we take a different point of view
and define an anti-power of order $k$ as a concatenation of $k$ consecutive
pairwise distinct blocks of the same length. As a main result, we show that
every infinite word contains powers of any order or anti-powers of any order.
That is, the existence of powers or anti-powers is an unavoidable regularity.
Indeed, we prove a stronger result, which relates the density of anti-powers to
the existence of a factor that occurs with arbitrary exponent. As a
consequence, we show that every aperiodic uniformly recurrent word begins in an
anti-power of order $k$, for any choice of $k&gt;1$. We further show that any
infinite word avoiding anti-powers of order $3$ is ultimately periodic, and
that there exist aperiodic words avoiding anti-powers of order $4$. We also
show that there exist aperiodic recurrent words avoiding anti-powers of order
$6$.

 <dc:description>  Understanding user instructions in natural language is an active research
topic in AI and robotics. Typically, natural user instructions are high-level
and can be reduced into low-level tasks expressed in common verbs (e.g.,
`take', `get', `put'). For robots understanding such instructions, one of the
key challenges is to process high-level user instructions and achieve the
specified tasks with robots' primitive actions. To address this, we propose
novel algorithms by utilizing semantic roles of common verbs defined in
semantic dictionaries and integrating multiple open knowledge to generate task
plans. Specifically, we present a new method for matching and recovering
semantics of user instructions and a novel task planner that exploits
functional knowledge of robot's action model. To verify and evaluate our
approach, we implemented a prototype system using knowledge from several open
resources. Experiments on our system confirmed the correctness and efficiency
of our algorithms. Notably, our system has been deployed in the KeJia robot,
which participated the annual RoboCup@Home competitions in the past three years
and achieved encouragingly high scores in the benchmark tests.

 <dc:description>  The area of Learning Analytics has developed enormously since the first
International Conference on Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) in 2011. It
is a field that combines different disciplines such as computer science,
statistics, psychology and pedagogy to achieve its intended objectives. The
main goals illustrate in creating convenient interventions on learning as well
as its environment and the final optimization about learning domain
stakeholders. Because the field matures and is now adapted in diverse
educational settings, we believe there is a pressing need to list its own
research methods and specify its objectives and dilemmas. This paper surveys
publications from Learning Analytics and Knowledge conference from 2013 to 2015
and lists the significant research areas in this sphere. We consider the method
profile and classify them into seven different categories with a brief
description on each. Furthermore, we show the most cited method categories
using Google scholar. Finally, the authors raise the challenges and constraints
that affect its ethical approach through the meta-analysis study. It is
believed that this paper will help researchers to identify the common methods
used in Learning Analytics, and it will assist by establishing a future
forecast towards new research work taking into account the privacy and ethical
issues of this strongly emerged field.

 <dc:description>  Context-free games are two-player rewriting games that are played on nested
strings representing XML documents with embedded function symbols. These games
were introduced to model rewriting processes for intensional documents in the
Active XML framework, where input documents are to be rewritten into a given
target schema by calls to external services.
  This paper studies the setting where dependencies between inputs and outputs
of service calls are modelled by transducers, which has not been examined
previously. It defines transducer models operating on nested words and studies
their properties, as well as the computational complexity of the winning
problem for transducer-based context-free games in several scenarios. While the
complexity of this problem is quite high in most settings (ranging from
NP-complete to undecidable), some tractable restrictions are also identified.

 <dc:description>  Biological nervous systems exhibit astonishing complexity .Neuroscientists
aim to capture this com- plexity by modeling and simulation of biological
processes. Often very comple xm odels are nec- essary to depict the processes,
which makes it dif fi cult to create these models. Powerful tools are thus
necessary ,which enable neuroscientists to express models in acomprehensi ve
and concise way and generate ef fi cient code for digital simulations. Se veral
modeling languages for computational neuroscience ha ve been proposed [Gl10,
Ra11]. Howe ver, as these languages seek simulator inde- pendence the
ytypically only support asubset of the features desired by the modeler .Int his
article, we present the modular and extensible domain speci fi cl anguage
NESTML, which provides neuro- science domain concepts as fi rst-class language
constructs and supports domain experts in creating neuron models for the neural
simulation tool NEST .N ESTML and aset of example models are publically
available on GitHub.

 <dc:description>  Evolution of large scale networks demand for efficient way of communication
in the networks. One way to propagate information in the network is to find
vertex cover. In this paper we describe a variant of vertex cover problem
naming it N-distance Vertex Minimal Cover(N-MVC) Problem to optimize
information propagation throughout the network. A minimum subset of vertices of
a unweighted and undirected graph G = (V, E) is called N-MVC if for all v in V
, v is at distance less than or equal to N from at least one of the the
vertices in N-MVC. In the following paper, this problem is defined, formulated
and an approximation algorithm is proposed with discussion on its correctness
and upper bound.

 <dc:description>  We participated in the WMT 2016 shared news translation task by building
neural translation systems for four language pairs, each trained in both
directions: English&lt;-&gt;Czech, English&lt;-&gt;German, English&lt;-&gt;Romanian and
English&lt;-&gt;Russian. Our systems are based on an attentional encoder-decoder,
using BPE subword segmentation for open-vocabulary translation with a fixed
vocabulary. We experimented with using automatic back-translations of the
monolingual News corpus as additional training data, pervasive dropout, and
target-bidirectional models. All reported methods give substantial
improvements, and we see improvements of 4.3--11.2 BLEU over our baseline
systems. In the human evaluation, our systems were the (tied) best constrained
system for 7 out of 8 translation directions in which we participated.

 <dc:title>Linguistic Input Features Improve Neural Machine Translation</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation has recently achieved impressive results, while
using little in the way of external linguistic information. In this paper we
show that the strong learning capability of neural MT models does not make
linguistic features redundant; they can be easily incorporated to provide
further improvements in performance. We generalize the embedding layer of the
encoder in the attentional encoder--decoder architecture to support the
inclusion of arbitrary features, in addition to the baseline word feature. We
add morphological features, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic dependency
labels as input features to English&lt;-&gt;German, and English-&gt;Romanian neural
machine translation systems. In experiments on WMT16 training and test sets, we
find that linguistic input features improve model quality according to three
metrics: perplexity, BLEU and CHRF3. An open-source implementation of our
neural MT system is available, as are sample files and configurations.

 <dc:title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Deep Learning Based Representation for Face
  Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ghazi, Mostafa Mehdipour</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep learning based approaches have been dominating the face recognition
field due to the significant performance improvement they have provided on the
challenging wild datasets. These approaches have been extensively tested on
such unconstrained datasets, on the Labeled Faces in the Wild and YouTube
Faces, to name a few. However, their capability to handle individual appearance
variations caused by factors such as head pose, illumination, occlusion, and
misalignment has not been thoroughly assessed till now. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive study to evaluate the performance of deep learning
based face representation under several conditions including the varying head
pose angles, upper and lower face occlusion, changing illumination of different
strengths, and misalignment due to erroneous facial feature localization. Two
successful and publicly available deep learning models, namely VGG-Face and
Lightened CNN have been utilized to extract face representations. The obtained
results show that although deep learning provides a powerful representation for
face recognition, it can still benefit from preprocessing, for example, for
pose and illumination normalization in order to achieve better performance
under various conditions. Particularly, if these variations are not included in
the dataset used to train the deep learning model, the role of preprocessing
becomes more crucial. Experimental results also show that deep learning based
representation is robust to misalignment and can tolerate facial feature
localization errors up to 10% of the interocular distance.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a new neurobiologically-inspired affective cognitive
architecture: NEUCOGAR (NEUromodulating COGnitive ARchitecture). The objective
of NEUCOGAR is the identification of a mapping from the influence of serotonin,
dopamine and noradrenaline to the computing processes based on Von Neuman's
architecture, in order to implement affective phenomena which can operate on
the Turing's machine model. As basis of the modeling we use and extend the
L\&quot;ovheim Cube of Emotion with parameters of the Von Neumann architecture.
Validation is conducted via simulation on a computing system of dopamine
neuromodulation and its effects on the Cortex. In the experimental phase of the
project, the increase of computing power and storage redistribution due to
emotion stimulus modulated by the dopamine system, confirmed the soundness of
the model.

 <dc:title>On Continuous-space Embedding of Discrete-parameter Queuing Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Karanjkar, Neha V.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Desai, Madhav P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In simulation-based optimization of queuing systems, the presence of
discrete-valued parameters (such as buffer sizes and the number of servers)
makes the optimization difficult. We propose a novel technique for embedding
such discrete parameters into a continuous space, so that optimization can be
performed efficiently using continuous-space methods. Unlike spatial
interpolation, our embedding technique is based on a randomization of the
simulation model. The interpolated value can be computed using a single
simulation of this randomized model, irrespective of the number of parameters.
We first study the theoretical properties of such a randomization scheme
applied to M/M/1 and Geom/Geom/1 queues. We prove that the randomization
produces valid interpolations of the steady-state performance functions with
respect to an integer service-time parameter. We then show that such an
embedding is possible for more complex queueing networks whose parameters can
include deterministic service times, queue capacities, and the number of
servers, and empirically demonstrate that the interpolation is well behaved. To
demonstrate the utility of the embedding technique, we solve a 6-parameter
queuing network optimization problem by embedding the discrete parameters into
a continuous space. The technique produces smooth interpolations of the
objective function, and a continuous optimizer applied directly over this
embedding converges rapidly, producing good solutions.

 <dc:description>  Generating software from abstract models is a prime activity in
model-drivenengineering. Adaptable and extendable code generators are important
to address changing technologies as well as user needs. However, theyare less
established, as variability is often designed as configuration options of
monolithic systems. Thus, code generation is often tied to a fixed set of
features, hardly reusable in different contexts, and without means for
configuration of variants. In this paper,we present an approach for developing
product lines of template-based code generators. This approach applies concepts
from feature-oriented programming to make variability explicit and manageable.
Moreover, it relies on explicit variability regions (VR) in a code generators
templates, refinements of VRs, and the aggregation of templates and refinements
into reusable layers. Aconcrete product is defined by selecting one or multiple
layers. If necessary, additional layers required due to VR refinements are
automatically selected.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of apparent age estimation. Different
from estimating the real age of individuals, in which each face image has a
single age label, in this problem, face images have multiple age labels,
corresponding to the ages perceived by the annotators, when they look at these
images. This provides an intriguing computer vision problem, since in generic
image or object classification tasks, it is typical to have a single ground
truth label per class. To account for multiple labels per image, instead of
using average age of the annotated face image as the class label, we have
grouped the face images that are within a specified age range. Using these age
groups and their age-shifted groupings, we have trained an ensemble of deep
learning models. Before feeding an input face image to a deep learning model,
five facial landmark points are detected and used for 2-D alignment. We have
employed and fine tuned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are based on
VGG-16 [24] architecture and pretrained on the IMDB-WIKI dataset [22]. The
outputs of these deep learning models are then combined to produce the final
estimation. Proposed method achieves 0.3668 error in the final ChaLearn LAP
2016 challenge test set [5].

 <dc:description>  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are the road that led to a revolution and
a new era of learning environments. Educational institutions have come under
pressure to adopt new models that assure openness in their education
distribution. Nonetheless, there is still altercation about the pedagogical
approach and the absolute information delivery to the students. On the other
side with the use of Learning Analytics, powerful tools become available which
mainly aim to enhance learning and improve learners performance. In this
chapter, the development phases of a Learning Analytics prototype and the
experiment of integrating it into a MOOC platform, called iMooX will be
presented. This chapter explores how MOOC Stakeholders may benefit from
Learning Analytics as well as it reports an exploratory analysis of some of the
offered courses and demonstrate use cases as a typical evaluation of this
prototype in order to discover hidden patterns, overture future proper
decisions and to optimize learning with applicable and convenient
interventions.

 <dc:description>  There are several approaches to analyse the worst-case response times of
sporadic packets transmitted over priority-preemptive wormhole networks. In
this paper, we provide an overview of the different approaches, discuss their
strengths and weaknesses, and propose an approach that captures all effects
considered by previous approaches while providing tight yet safe upper bounds
for packet response times. We specifically address the problems created by
buffering and backpressure in wormhole networks, which amplifies the problem of
indirect interference in a way that has not been considered by the early
analysis approaches. Didactic examples and large-scale experiments with
synthetically generated packet flow sets provide evidence of the strength of
the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  Volumetric spline parameterization and computational efficiency are two main
challenges in isogeometric analysis (IGA). To tackle this problem, we propose a
framework of computation reuse in IGA on a set of three-dimensional models with
similar semantic features. Given a template domain, B-spline based consistent
volumetric parameterization is first constructed for a set of models with
similar semantic features. An efficient quadrature-free method is investigated
in our framework to compute the entries of stiffness matrix by Bezier
extraction and polynomial approximation. In our approach, evaluation on the
stiffness matrix and imposition of the boundary conditions can be pre-computed
and reused during IGA on a set of CAD models. Examples with complex geometry
are presented to show the effectiveness of our methods, and efficiency similar
to the computation in linear finite element analysis can be achieved for IGA
taken on a set of models.

 <dc:description>  Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq) modeling has rapidly become an important
general-purpose NLP tool that has proven effective for many text-generation and
sequence-labeling tasks. Seq2seq builds on deep neural language modeling and
inherits its remarkable accuracy in estimating local, next-word distributions.
In this work, we introduce a model and beam-search training scheme, based on
the work of Daume III and Marcu (2005), that extends seq2seq to learn global
sequence scores. This structured approach avoids classical biases associated
with local training and unifies the training loss with the test-time usage,
while preserving the proven model architecture of seq2seq and its efficient
training approach. We show that our system outperforms a highly-optimized
attention-based seq2seq system and other baselines on three different sequence
to sequence tasks: word ordering, parsing, and machine translation.

 <dc:description>  It is an open problem whether the 3-coloring problem can be solved in
polynomial time in the class of graphs that do not contain an induced path on
$t$ vertices, for fixed $t$. We propose an algorithm that, given a 3-colorable
graph without an induced path on $t$ vertices, computes a coloring with
$\max\{5,2\lceil{\frac{t-1}{2}}\rceil-2\}$ many colors. If the input graph is
triangle-free, we only need $\max\{4,\lceil{\frac{t-1}{2}}\rceil+1\}$ many
colors. The running time of our algorithm is $O((3^{t-2}+t^2)m+n)$ if the input
graph has $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.

 <dc:title>Large scale biomedical texts classification: a kNN and an ESA-based
  approaches</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  With the large and increasing volume of textual data, automated methods for
identifying significant topics to classify textual documents have received a
growing interest. While many efforts have been made in this direction, it still
remains a real challenge. Moreover, the issue is even more complex as full
texts are not always freely available. Then, using only partial information to
annotate these documents is promising but remains a very ambitious issue.
MethodsWe propose two classification methods: a k-nearest neighbours
(kNN)-based approach and an explicit semantic analysis (ESA)-based approach.
Although the kNN-based approach is widely used in text classification, it needs
to be improved to perform well in this specific classification problem which
deals with partial information. Compared to existing kNN-based methods, our
method uses classical Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for ranking the labels.
Additional features are also investigated in order to improve the classifiers'
performance. In addition, the combination of several learning algorithms with
various techniques for fixing the number of relevant topics is performed. On
the other hand, ESA seems promising for this classification task as it yielded
interesting results in related issues, such as semantic relatedness computation
between texts and text classification. Unlike existing works, which use ESA for
enriching the bag-of-words approach with additional knowledge-based features,
our ESA-based method builds a standalone classifier. Furthermore, we
investigate if the results of this method could be useful as a complementary
feature of our kNN-based approach.ResultsExperimental evaluations performed on
large standard annotated datasets, provided by the BioASQ organizers, show that
the kNN-based method with the Random Forest learning algorithm achieves good
performances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, reaching a
competitive f-measure of 0.55% while the ESA-based approach surprisingly
yielded reserved results.ConclusionsWe have proposed simple classification
methods suitable to annotate textual documents using only partial information.
They are therefore adequate for large multi-label classification and
particularly in the biomedical domain. Thus, our work contributes to the
extraction of relevant information from unstructured documents in order to
facilitate their automated processing. Consequently, it could be used for
various purposes, including document indexing, information retrieval, etc.

 <dc:description>  Word embedding maps words into a low-dimensional continuous embedding space
by exploiting the local word collocation patterns in a small context window. On
the other hand, topic modeling maps documents onto a low-dimensional topic
space, by utilizing the global word collocation patterns in the same document.
These two types of patterns are complementary. In this paper, we propose a
generative topic embedding model to combine the two types of patterns. In our
model, topics are represented by embedding vectors, and are shared across
documents. The probability of each word is influenced by both its local context
and its topic. A variational inference method yields the topic embeddings as
well as the topic mixing proportions for each document. Jointly they represent
the document in a low-dimensional continuous space. In two document
classification tasks, our method performs better than eight existing methods,
with fewer features. In addition, we illustrate with an example that our method
can generate coherent topics even based on only one document.

 <dc:description>  We study nearest-neighbors walks on the two-dimensional square lattice, that
is, models of walks on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ defined by a fixed step set that is a
subset of the non-zero vectors with coordinates 0, 1 or $-1$. We concern
ourselves with the enumeration of such walks starting at the origin and
constrained to remain in the quarter plane $\mathbb{N}^2$, counted by their
length and by the position of their ending point. Bousquet-M\'elou and Mishna
[Contemp. Math., pp. 1--39, Amer. Math. Soc., 2010] identified 19 models of
walks that possess a D-finite generating function; linear differential
equations have then been guessed in these cases by Bostan and Kauers [FPSAC
2009, Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci. Proc., pp. 201--215, 2009]. We give
here the first proof that these equations are indeed satisfied by the
corresponding generating functions. As a first corollary, we prove that all
these 19 generating functions can be expressed in terms of Gauss'
hypergeometric functions that are intimately related to elliptic integrals. As
a second corollary, we show that all the 19 generating functions are
transcendental, and that among their $19 \times 4$ combinatorially meaningful
specializations only four are algebraic functions.

 <dc:description>  The emergence of mobile applications to execute sensitive operations has
brought a myriad of security threats to both enterprises and users. In order to
benefit from the large potential in smartphones there is a need to manage the
risks arising from threats, while maintaining an easy interface for the users.
In this paper we investigate the use of Trusted Platform Model (TPM) 2.0 to
develop a secure application for smartphones using Windows Phone 8.1. In
particular, we suggest a framework based on remote attestation as a proxy to
authenticate remote services, where the device is associated to the user and
replaces the users credentials. In addition, we use the TPM 2.0 to enable
secured information and data storage within the device itself. We present an
implementation and performance evaluation of the suggested architecture that
uses our novel attestation and authentication scheme and reveal the caveats of
using software TPM in todays mobile devices.

 <dc:description>  The problem of least squares regression of a $d$-dimensional unknown
parameter is considered. A stochastic gradient descent based algorithm with
weighted iterate-averaging that uses a single pass over the data is studied and
its convergence rate is analyzed. We first consider a bounded constraint set of
the unknown parameter. Under some standard regularity assumptions, we provide
an explicit $O(1/k)$ upper bound on the convergence rate, depending on the
variance (due to the additive noise in the measurements) and the size of the
constraint set. We show that the variance term dominates the error and
decreases with rate $1/k$, while the term which is related to the size of the
constraint set decreases with rate $\log k/k^2$. We then compare the asymptotic
ratio $\rho$ between the convergence rate of the proposed scheme and the
empirical risk minimizer (ERM) as the number of iterations approaches infinity.
We show that $\rho\leq 4$ under some mild conditions for all $d\geq 1$. We
further improve the upper bound by showing that $\rho\leq 4/3$ for the case of
$d=1$ and unbounded parameter set. Simulation results demonstrate strong
performance of the algorithm as compared to existing methods, and coincide with
$\rho\leq 4/3$ even for large $d$ in practice.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks such as the GRU and LSTM found wide adoption in
natural language processing and achieve state-of-the-art results for many
tasks. These models are characterized by a memory state that can be written to
and read from by applying gated composition operations to the current input and
the previous state. However, they only cover a small subset of potentially
useful compositions. We propose Multi-Function Recurrent Units (MuFuRUs) that
allow for arbitrary differentiable functions as composition operations.
Furthermore, MuFuRUs allow for an input- and state-dependent choice of these
composition operations that is learned. Our experiments demonstrate that the
additional functionality helps in different sequence modeling tasks, including
the evaluation of propositional logic formulae, language modeling and sentiment
analysis.

 <dc:description>  Most machine learning-based coronary artery segmentation methods represent
the vascular lumen surface in an implicit way by the centerline and the
associated lumen radii, which makes the subsequent modeling process to generate
a whole piece of watertight coronary artery tree model difficult. To solve this
problem, in this paper, we propose a modeling method with the learning-based
segmentation results by (1) considering mesh vertices as physical particles and
using interaction force model and particle expansion model to generate
uniformly distributed point cloud on the implicit lumen surface and; (2) doing
incremental Delaunay-based triangulation. Our method has the advantage of being
able to consider the complex shape of the coronary artery tree as a whole
piece; hence no extra stitching or intersection removal algorithm is needed to
generate a watertight model. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is
capable of generating high quality mesh model which is highly consistent with
the given implicit vascular lumen surface, with an average error of 0.08 mm.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new algorithm for online estimation of a sequence of
homographies applicable to image sequences obtained from robotic vehicles
equipped with vision sensors. The approach taken exploits the underlying
Special Linear group structure of the set of homographies along with gyroscope
measurements and direct point-feature correspondences between images to develop
temporal filter for the homography estimate. Theoretical analysis and
experimental results are provided to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
algorithm. The experimental results show excellent performance even in the case
of very fast camera motion (relative to frame rate), severe occlusion, and in
the presence of specular reflections.

 <dc:title>A strategy to implement Dirichlet boundary conditions in the context of
  ADER finite volume schemes. One-dimensional conservation laws</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Montecinos, Gino I.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  ADER schemes are numerical methods, which can reach an arbitrary order of
accuracy in both space and time. They are based on a reconstruction procedure
and the solution of generalized Riemann problems. However, for general boundary
conditions, in particular of Dirichlet type, a lack of accuracy might occur if
a suitable treatment of boundaries conditions is not properly carried out. In
this work the treatment of Dirichlet boundary conditions for conservation laws
in the context of ADER schemes, is concerned. The solution of generalized
Riemann problems at the extremes of the computational domain, provides the
correct influence of boundaries. The reconstruction procedure, for data near to
the boundaries, demands for information outside the computational domain, which
is carried out in terms of ghost cells, which are provided by using the
numerical solution of auxiliary problems. These auxiliary problems are
hyperbolic and they are constructed from the conservation laws and the
information at boundaries, which may be partially or totally known in terms of
prescribed functions. The evolution of these problems, unlike to the usual
manner, is done in space rather than in time due to that these problems are
named here, {\it reverse problems}. The methodology can be considered as a
numerical counterpart of the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for filling ghost
cells. However, the use of Taylor series expansions, as well as, Lax-Wendroff
procedure, are avoided. For the scalar case is shown that the present procedure
preserve the accuracy of the scheme which is reinforced with some numerical
results. Expected orders of accuracy for solving conservation laws by using the
proposed strategy at boundaries, are obtained up to fifth-order in both space
and time.

 <dc:description>  Building systems that possess the sensitivity and intelligence to identify
and describe high-level attributes in music audio signals continues to be an
elusive goal, but one that surely has broad and deep implications for a wide
variety of applications. Hundreds of papers have so far been published toward
this goal, and great progress appears to have been made. Some systems produce
remarkable accuracies at recognising high-level semantic concepts, such as
music style, genre and mood. However, it might be that these numbers do not
mean what they seem. In this paper, we take a state-of-the-art music content
analysis system and investigate what causes it to achieve exceptionally high
performance in a benchmark music audio dataset. We dissect the system to
understand its operation, determine its sensitivities and limitations, and
predict the kinds of knowledge it could and could not possess about music. We
perform a series of experiments to illuminate what the system has actually
learned to do, and to what extent it is performing the intended music listening
task. Our results demonstrate how the initial manifestation of music
intelligence in this state-of-the-art can be deceptive. Our work provides
constructive directions toward developing music content analysis systems that
can address the music information and creation needs of real-world users.

 <dc:title>A Minimum Spanning Tree Representation of Anime Similarities</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Retrieval</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, a new way to represent Japanese animation (anime) is presented.
We applied a minimum spanning tree to show the relation between anime. The
distance between anime is calculated through three similarity measurements,
namely crew, score histogram, and topic similarities. Finally, the centralities
are also computed to reveal the most significance anime. The result shows that
the minimum spanning tree can be used to determine the similarity anime.
Furthermore, by using centralities calculation, we found some anime that are
significant to others.

 <dc:description>  This letter is focused on quantized Compressed Sensing, assuming that Lasso
is used for signal estimation. Leveraging recent work, we provide a framework
to optimize the quantization function and show that the recovered signal
converges to the actual signal at a quadratic rate as a function of the
quantization level. We show that when the number of observations is high, this
method of quantization gives a significantly better recovery rate than standard
Lloyd-Max quantization. We support our theoretical analysis with numerical
simulations.

 <dc:description>  The networking industry, compared to the compute industry, has been slow in
evolving from a closed ecosystem with limited abstractions to a more open
ecosystem with well-defined sophisticated high level abstractions. This has
resulted in an ossified Internet architecture that inhibits innovation and is
unnecessarily complex. Fortunately, there has been an exciting flux of rapid
developments in networking in recent times with prominent trends emerging that
have brought us to the cusp of a major paradigm shift. In particular, the
emergence of technologies such as cloud computing, software defined networking
(SDN), and network virtualization are driving a new vision of `networking as a
service' (NaaS) in which networks are managed flexibly and efficiently cloud
computing style. These technologies promise to both facilitate architectural
and technological innovation while also simplifying commissioning,
orchestration, and composition of network services. In this article, we
introduce our readers to these technologies. In the coming few years, the
trends of cloud computing, SDN, and network virtualization will further
strengthen each other's value proposition symbiotically and NaaS will
increasingly become the dominant mode of commissioning new networks.

 <dc:description>  Individuals working towards a goal often exhibit time inconsistent behavior,
making plans and then failing to follow through. One well-known model of such
behavioral anomalies is present-bias discounting: individuals over-weight
present costs by a bias factor. This model explains many time-inconsistent
behaviors, but can make stark predictions in many settings: individuals either
follow the most efficient plan for reaching their goal or procrastinate
indefinitely.
  We propose a modification in which the present-bias parameter can vary over
time, drawn independently each step from a fixed distribution. Following
Kleinberg and Oren (2014), we use a weighted task graph to model task planning,
and measure the cost of procrastination as the relative expected cost of the
chosen path versus the optimal path. We use a novel connection to optimal
pricing theory to describe the structure of the worst-case task graph for any
present-bias distribution. We then leverage this structure to derive conditions
on the bias distribution under which the worst-case ratio is exponential (in
time) or constant. We also examine conditions on the task graph that lead to
improved procrastination ratios: graphs with a uniformly bounded distance to
the goal, and graphs in which the distance to the goal monotonically decreases
on any path.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we use deep neural networks for inverting face sketches to
synthesize photorealistic face images. We first construct a semi-simulated
dataset containing a very large number of computer-generated face sketches with
different styles and corresponding face images by expanding existing
unconstrained face data sets. We then train models achieving state-of-the-art
results on both computer-generated sketches and hand-drawn sketches by
leveraging recent advances in deep learning such as batch normalization, deep
residual learning, perceptual losses and stochastic optimization in combination
with our new dataset. We finally demonstrate potential applications of our
models in fine arts and forensic arts. In contrast to existing patch-based
approaches, our deep-neural-network-based approach can be used for synthesizing
photorealistic face images by inverting face sketches in the wild.

 <dc:description>  We study the {\em robust proper learning} of univariate log-concave
distributions (over continuous and discrete domains). Given a set of samples
drawn from an unknown target distribution, we want to compute a log-concave
hypothesis distribution that is as close as possible to the target, in total
variation distance. In this work, we give the first computationally efficient
algorithm for this learning problem. Our algorithm achieves the
information-theoretically optimal sample size (up to a constant factor), runs
in polynomial time, and is robust to model misspecification with nearly-optimal
error guarantees.
  Specifically, we give an algorithm that, on input $n=O(1/\eps^{5/2})$ samples
from an unknown distribution $f$, runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{8/5})$, and
outputs a log-concave hypothesis $h$ that (with high probability) satisfies
$\dtv(h, f) = O(\opt)+\eps$, where $\opt$ is the minimum total variation
distance between $f$ and the class of log-concave distributions. Our approach
to the robust proper learning problem is quite flexible and may be applicable
to many other univariate distribution families.

 <dc:description>  Directly reading documents and being able to answer questions from them is an
unsolved challenge. To avoid its inherent difficulty, question answering (QA)
has been directed towards using Knowledge Bases (KBs) instead, which has proven
effective. Unfortunately KBs often suffer from being too restrictive, as the
schema cannot support certain types of answers, and too sparse, e.g. Wikipedia
contains much more information than Freebase. In this work we introduce a new
method, Key-Value Memory Networks, that makes reading documents more viable by
utilizing different encodings in the addressing and output stages of the memory
read operation. To compare using KBs, information extraction or Wikipedia
documents directly in a single framework we construct an analysis tool,
WikiMovies, a QA dataset that contains raw text alongside a preprocessed KB, in
the domain of movies. Our method reduces the gap between all three settings. It
also achieves state-of-the-art results on the existing WikiQA benchmark.

 <dc:description>  We analyze Axelrod's model of social interactions on coevolving complex
networks. We introduce four extensions with different mechanisms of edge
rewiring. The models are intended to catch two kinds of interactions -
preferential attachment, which can be observed in scientists or actors
collaborations, and local rewiring, which can be observed in friendship
formation in everyday relations. Numerical simulations show that proposed
dynamics can lead to the power-law distribution of nodes' degree and high value
of the clustering coefficient, while still retaining the small-world effect in
three models. All models are characterized by two phase transitions of a
different nature. In case of local rewiring we obtain order-disorder
discontinuous phase transition even in the thermodynamic limit, while in case
of long-distance switching discontinuity disappears in the thermodynamic limit,
leaving one continuous phase transition. In addition, we discover a new and
universal characteristic of the second transition point - an abrupt increase of
the clustering coefficient, due to formation of many small complete subgraphs
inside the network.

 <dc:title>The Overlapped Radial Basis Function-Finite Difference (RBF-FD) Method:

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a generalization of the RBF-FD method that computes RBF-FD weights
in finite-sized neighborhoods around the centers of RBF-FD stencils by
introducing an overlap parameter $\delta \in [0,1]$ such that $\delta=1$
recovers the standard RBF-FD method and $\delta=0$ results in a full decoupling
of stencils. We provide experimental evidence to support this generalization,
and develop an automatic stabilization procedure based on local Lebesgue
functions for the stable selection of stencil weights over a wide range of
$\delta$ values. We provide an a priori estimate for the speedup of our method
over RBF-FD that serves as a good predictor for the true speedup. We apply our
method to parabolic partial differential equations with time-dependent
inhomogeneous boundary conditions-- Neumann in 2D, and Dirichlet in 3D. Our
results show that our method can achieve as high as a 60x speedup in 3D over
existing RBF-FD methods in the task of forming differentiation matrices.

 <dc:description>  For an autonomous system to be helpful to humans and to pose no unwarranted
risks, it needs to align its values with those of the humans in its environment
in such a way that its actions contribute to the maximization of value for the
humans. We propose a formal definition of the value alignment problem as
cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL). A CIRL problem is a
cooperative, partial-information game with two agents, human and robot; both
are rewarded according to the human's reward function, but the robot does not
initially know what this is. In contrast to classical IRL, where the human is
assumed to act optimally in isolation, optimal CIRL solutions produce behaviors
such as active teaching, active learning, and communicative actions that are
more effective in achieving value alignment. We show that computing optimal
joint policies in CIRL games can be reduced to solving a POMDP, prove that
optimality in isolation is suboptimal in CIRL, and derive an approximate CIRL
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the problem of semi-supervised learning with deep
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). Semi-supervised learning is motivated
on the observation that unlabeled data is cheap and can be used to improve the
accuracy of classifiers. In this paper we propose an unsupervised
regularization term that explicitly forces the classifier's prediction for
multiple classes to be mutually-exclusive and effectively guides the decision
boundary to lie on the low density space between the manifolds corresponding to
different classes of data. Our proposed approach is general and can be used
with any backpropagation-based learning method. We show through different
experiments that our method can improve the object recognition performance of
ConvNets using unlabeled data.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we explore the problem of document summarization in Persian
language from two distinct angles. In our first approach, we modify a popular
and widely cited Persian document summarization framework to see how it works
on a realistic corpus of news articles. Human evaluation on generated summaries
shows that graph-based methods perform better than the modified systems. We
carry this intuition forward in our second approach, and probe deeper into the
nature of graph-based systems by designing several summarizers based on
centrality measures. Ad hoc evaluation using ROUGE score on these summarizers
suggests that there is a small class of centrality measures that perform better
than three strong unsupervised baselines.

 <dc:description>  A high-speed random number generator (RNG) circuit based on magnetoresistive
random-access memory (MRAM) using an error-correcting code (ECC) post
processing circuit is presented. ECC post processing increases the quality of
randomness by increasing the entropy of random number. { We experimentally show
that a small error-correcting capability circuit is sufficient for this post
processing. It is shown that the ECC post processing circuit powerfully
improves the quality of randomness with minimum overhead, ending up with
high-speed random number generation. We also show that coupling with a linear
feedback shift resistor is effective for improving randomness

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the uplink of massive multipleinput multiple-output systems in a
multicell environment. Since the base station (BS) estimates the channel state
information (CSI) using the pilot signals transmitted from the users, each BS
will have imperfect CSI in practice. Assuming zero-forcing method to eliminate
the multi-user interference, we derive the exact analytical expressions for the
probability density function (PDF) of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR), the corresponding achievable rate, the outage probability, and
the symbol error rate (SER) when the BS has imperfect CSI. An upper bound of
the SER is also derived for an arbitrary number of antennas at the BS.
Moreover, we derive the upper bound of the achievable rate for the case where
the number of antennas at the BS goes to infinity, and the analysis is verified
by presenting numerical results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose to use deep policy networks which are trained with
an advantage actor-critic method for statistically optimised dialogue systems.
First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement
Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action
spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL
knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such
summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the
original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially
observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to
train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a
deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount
of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected
with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably
bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition,
convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other
deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL. All experiments are
performed on a restaurant domain derived from the Dialogue State Tracking
Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised text embeddings extraction is crucial for text understanding in
machine learning. Word2Vec and its variants have received substantial success
in mapping words with similar syntactic or semantic meaning to vectors close to
each other. However, extracting context-aware word-sequence embedding remains a
challenging task. Training over large corpus is difficult as labels are
difficult to get. More importantly, it is challenging for pre-trained models to
obtain word-sequence embeddings that are universally good for all downstream
tasks or for any new datasets. We propose a two-phased ConvDic+DeconvDec
framework to solve the problem by combining a word-sequence dictionary learning
model with a word-sequence embedding decode model. We propose a convolutional
tensor decomposition mechanism to learn good word-sequence phrase dictionary in
the learning phase. It is proved to be more accurate and much more efficient
than the popular alternating minimization method. In the decode phase, we
introduce a deconvolution framework that is immune to the problem of varying
sentence lengths. The word-sequence embeddings we extracted using
ConvDic+DeconvDec are universally good for a few downstream tasks we test on.
The framework requires neither pre-training nor prior/outside information.

 <dc:description>  A rank-$r$ matrix $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ can be written as a product
$U V^\top$, where $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times r}$ and $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times r}$. One could exploit this observation in optimization: e.g., consider
the minimization of a convex function $f(X)$ over rank-$r$ matrices, where the
set of rank-$r$ matrices is modeled via the factorization $UV^\top$. Though
such parameterization reduces the number of variables, and is more
computationally efficient (of particular interest is the case $r \ll \min\{m,
n\}$), it comes at a cost: $f(UV^\top)$ becomes a non-convex function w.r.t.
$U$ and $V$.
  We study such parameterization for optimization of generic convex objectives
$f$, and focus on first-order, gradient descent algorithmic solutions. We
propose the Bi-Factored Gradient Descent (BFGD) algorithm, an efficient
first-order method that operates on the $U, V$ factors. We show that when $f$
is (restricted) smooth, BFGD has local sublinear convergence, and linear
convergence when $f$ is both (restricted) smooth and (restricted) strongly
convex. For several key applications, we provide simple and efficient
initialization schemes that provide approximate solutions good enough for the
above convergence results to hold.

 <dc:description>  We study the role of caches in wireless interference networks. We focus on
content caching and delivery across a Gaussian interference network, where both
transmitters and receivers are equipped with caches. We provide a
constant-factor approximation of the system's degrees of freedom (DoF), for
arbitrary number of transmitters, number of receivers, content library size,
receiver cache size, and transmitter cache size (as long as the transmitters
combined can store the entire content library among them). We demonstrate
approximate optimality with respect to information-theoretic bounds that do not
impose any restrictions on the caching and delivery strategies. Our
characterization reveals three key insights. First, the approximate DoF is
achieved using a strategy that separates the physical and network layers. This
separation architecture is thus approximately optimal. Second, we show that
increasing transmitter cache memory beyond what is needed to exactly store the
entire library between all transmitters does not provide more than a
constant-factor benefit to the DoF. A consequence is that transmit zero-forcing
is not needed for approximate optimality. Third, we derive an interesting
trade-off between the receiver memory and the number of transmitters needed for
approximately maximal performance. In particular, if each receiver can store a
constant fraction of the content library, then only a constant number of
transmitters are needed. Solving the caching problem required formulating and
solving a new communication problem, the symmetric multiple multicast
X-channel, for which we provide an exact DoF characterization.

 <dc:description>  Attacks in cyberspace have got attention due to risk at privacy, breach of
trust and financial losses for individuals as well as organizations. In recent
years, these attacks have become more complex to analyze technically, as well
as to detect and prevent from accessing confidential data. Although there are
many methodologies and mechanisms which have been suggested for cyber-attack
detection and prevention, but not from the perspective of an attacker. This
paper presents the cyber-defence as hindrances, faced by the attacker, by
understanding attack thread and defence possibilities with existing security
mechanisms. Seven phases of Cyber Attack Thread are introduced and technical
aspects are discussed with reference to APT attacks. The paper aims for
security practitioner and administrators as well as for the general audience to
understand the attack scenario and defensive security measures.

 <dc:description>  Recent trends in targeted cyber-attacks has increased the interest of
research in the field of cyber security. Such attacks have massive disruptive
effects on rganizations, enterprises and governments. Cyber kill chain is a
model to describe cyber-attacks so as to develop incident response and analysis
capabilities. Cyber kill chain in simple terms is an attack chain, the path
that an intruder takes to penetrate information systems over time to execute an
attack on the target. This paper broadly categories the methodologies,
techniques and tools involved in cyber-attacks. This paper intends to help a
cyber security researcher to realize the options available to an attacker at
every stage of a cyber-attack.

 <dc:description>  We investigate the maximum happy vertices (MHV) problem and its complement,
the minimum unhappy vertices (MUHV) problem. We first show that the MHV and
MUHV problems are a special case of the supermodular and submodular
multi-labeling (Sup-ML and Sub-ML) problems, respectively, by re-writing the
objective functions as set functions. The convex relaxation on the Lov\'{a}sz
extension, originally presented for the submodular multi-partitioning (Sub-MP)
problem, can be extended for the Sub-ML problem, thereby proving that the
Sub-ML (Sup-ML, respectively) can be approximated within a factor of $2 -
\frac{2}{k}$ ($\frac{2}{k}$, respectively). These general results imply that
the MHV and the MUHV problems can also be approximated within $\frac{2}{k}$ and
$2 - \frac{2}{k}$, respectively, using the same approximation algorithms. For
MHV, this $\frac{2}{k}$-approximation algorithm improves the previous best
approximation ratio $\max \{\frac{1}{k}, \frac{1}{\Delta + 1}\}$, where
$\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree of the input graph. We also show that an
existing LP relaxation is the same as the concave relaxation on the Lov\'{a}sz
extension for the Sup-ML problem; we then prove an upper bound of $\frac{2}{k}$
on the integrality gap of the LP relaxation. These suggest that the
$\frac{2}{k}$-approximation algorithm is the best possible based on the LP
relaxation. For MUHV, we formulate a novel LP relaxation and prove that it is
the same as the convex relaxation on the Lov\'{a}sz extension for the Sub-ML
problem; we then show a lower bound of $2 - \frac{2}{k}$ on the integrality gap
of the LP relaxation. Similarly, these suggest that the $(2 -
\frac{2}{k})$-approximation algorithm is the best possible based on the LP
relaxation. Lastly, we prove that this $(2 - \frac{2}{k})$-approximation is
optimal for the MUHV problem, assuming the Unique Games Conjecture.

 <dc:title>Fuzzy-Klassen Model for Development Disparities Analysis based on Gross

 <dc:description>  Analysis of regional development imbalances quadrant has a very important
meaning in order to see the extent of achievement of the development of certain
areas as well as the difference. Factors that could be used as a tool to
measure the inequality of development is to look at the average growth and
development contribution of each sector of Gross Regional Domestic Product
(GRDP) based on the analyzed region and the reference region. This study
discusses the development of a model to determine the regional development
imbalances using fuzzy approach system, and the rules of typology Klassen. The
model is then called fuzzy-Klassen. Implications Product Mamdani fuzzy system
is used in the model as an inference engine to generate output after
defuzzyfication process. Application of MATLAB is used as a tool of analysis in
this study. The test a result of Kota Cilegon is shows that there are
significant differences between traditional Klassen typology analyses with the
results of the model developed. Fuzzy model-Klassen shows GRDP sector
inequality Cilegon City is dominated by Quadrant I (K4), where status is the
sector forward and grows exponentially. While the traditional Klassen typology,
half of GRDP sector is dominated by Quadrant IV (K4) with a sector that is
lagging relative status.

 <dc:description>  PSDVec is a Python/Perl toolbox that learns word embeddings, i.e. the mapping
of words in a natural language to continuous vectors which encode the
semantic/syntactic regularities between the words. PSDVec implements a word
embedding learning method based on a weighted low-rank positive semidefinite
approximation. To scale up the learning process, we implement a blockwise
online learning algorithm to learn the embeddings incrementally. This strategy
greatly reduces the learning time of word embeddings on a large vocabulary, and
can learn the embeddings of new words without re-learning the whole vocabulary.
On 9 word similarity/analogy benchmark sets and 2 Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, PSDVec produces embeddings that has the best average performance
among popular word embedding tools. PSDVec provides a new option for NLP
practitioners.

 <dc:title>Stabilization Theory for Active Multi Port Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a theory for designing stable interconnection of linear
active multi-port networks at the ports. Such interconnections can lead to
unstable networks even if the original networks are stable with respect to
bounded port excitations. Hence such a theory is necessary for realising
interconnections of active multiport networks. Stabilization theory of linear
feedback systems using stable coprime factorizations of transfer functions has
been well known. This theory witnessed glorious developments in recent past
culminating into the $H_{\infty}$ approach to design of feedback systems.
However these important developments have seldom been utilized for network
interconnections due to the difficulty of realizing feedback signal flow graph
for multi-port networks with inputs and outputs as port sources and responses.
This paper resolves this problem by developing the stabilization theory
directly in terms of port connection description without formulation in terms
of signal flow graph of the implicit feedback connection. The stable port
interconnection results into an affine parametrized network function in which
the free parameter is itself a stable network function and describes all
stabilizing port compensations of a given network.

 <dc:description>  In the phase retrieval problem, an unknown vector is to be recovered given
quadratic measurements. This problem has received considerable attention in
recent times. In this paper, we present an algorithm to solve a nonconvex
formulation of the phase retrieval problem, that we call $\textit{Incremental
Truncated Wirtinger Flow}$. Given random Gaussian sensing vectors, we prove
that it converges linearly to the solution, with an optimal sample complexity.
We also provide stability guarantees of the algorithm under noisy measurements.
Performance and comparisons with existing algorithms are illustrated via
numerical experiments on simulated and real data, with both random and
structured sensing vectors.

 <dc:title>Conflict Resolution in Multiple Access Channels Supporting Simultaneous
  Successful Transmissions</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>De Bonis, Annalisa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the Conflict Resolution Problem in the context of a
multiple-access system in which several stations can transmit their messages
simultaneously to the channel. We assume that there are n stations and that at
most k&lt;= n stations are active at the same time, i.e, are willing to transmit a
message. If in a certain instant at most d&lt;=k active stations transmit to the
channel then their messages are successfully transmitted, whereas if more than
d active stations transmit simultaneously then their messages are lost. In this
latter case we say that a conflict occurs. The present paper investigates
non-adaptive conflict resolution algorithms working under the assumption that
active stations receive a feedback from the channel that informs them on
whether their messages have been successfully transmitted. If a station becomes
aware that its message has been correctly sent over the channel then it becomes
immediately inactive. The measure to optimize is the number of time slots
needed to solve conflicts among all active stations. The fundamental question
is whether this measure decreases linearly with the number d of messages that
can be simultaneously transmitted with success. We give a positive answer to
this question by providing a conflict resolution algorithm that uses a 1/d
ratio of the number of time slots used by the optimal conflict resolution
algorithm for the case d=1. Moreover, we derive a lower bound on the number of
time slots needed to solve conflicts non-adaptively which is within a log (k/d)
factor from the upper bound. To this aim, we introduce a new combinatorial
structure that consists in a generalization of Komlos and Greenberg codes.
Constructions of these new codes are obtained via a new generalization of
selectors, whereas the non-existential result is implied by a non-existential
result for a new generalization of the locally thin families.

 <dc:description>  Most rigid formation controllers reported in the literature aim to only
stabilize a rigid formation shape, while the formation orientation is not
controlled. This paper studies the problem of controlling rigid formations with
prescribed orientations in both 2-D and 3-D spaces. The proposed controllers
involve the commonly-used gradient descent control for shape stabilization, and
an additional term to control the directions of certain relative position
vectors associated with certain chosen agents. In this control framework, we
show the minimal number of agents which should have knowledge of a global
coordinate system (2 agents for a 2-D rigid formation and 3 agents for a 3-D
rigid formation), while all other agents do not require any global coordinate
knowledge or any coordinate frame alignment to implement the proposed control.
The exponential convergence to the desired rigid shape and formation
orientation is also proved. Typical simulation examples are shown to support
the analysis and performance of the proposed formation controllers.

 <dc:title>Constraining the Number of Positive Responses in Adaptive, Non-Adaptive,
  and Two-Stage Group Testing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>De Bonis, Annalisa</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Group testing is a well known search problem that consists in detecting the
defective members of a set of objects O by performing tests on properly chosen
subsets (pools) of the given set O. In classical group testing the goal is to
find all defectives by using as few tests as possible. We consider a variant of
classical group testing in which one is concerned not only with minimizing the
total number of tests but aims also at reducing the number of tests involving
defective elements. The rationale behind this search model is that in many
practical applications the devices used for the tests are subject to
deterioration due to exposure to or interaction with the defective elements. In
this paper we consider adaptive, non-adaptive and two-stage group testing. For
all three considered scenarios, we derive upper and lower bounds on the number
of &quot;yes&quot; responses that must be admitted by any strategy performing at most a
certain number t of tests. In particular, for the adaptive case we provide an
algorithm that uses a number of &quot;yes&quot; responses that exceeds the given lower
bound by a small constant. Interestingly, this bound can be asymptotically
attained also by our two-stage algorithm, which is a phenomenon analogous to
the one occurring in classical group testing. For the non-adaptive scenario we
give almost matching upper and lower bounds on the number of &quot;yes&quot; responses.
In particular, we give two constructions both achieving the same asymptotic
bound. An interesting feature of one of these constructions is that it is an
explicit construction. The bounds for the non-adaptive and the two-stage cases
follow from the bounds on the optimal sizes of new variants of d-cover free
families and (p,d)-cover free families introduced in this paper, which we
believe may be of interest also in other contexts.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we develop a low-complexity transceiver design, referred to
as semi-random beam pairing (SRBP), for sparse multipath massive MIMO channels.
By exploring a sparse representation of the MIMO channel in the virtual angular
domain, we generate a set of transmit-receive beam pairs in a semi-random way
to support the simultaneous transmission of multiple data streams. These data
streams can be easily separated at the receiver via a successive interference
cancelation (SIC) technique, and the power allocation among them are optimized
based on the classical waterfilling principle. The achieved degree of freedom
(DoF) and capacity of the proposed approach are analyzed. Simulation results
show that, compared to the conventional singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based method, the proposed transceiver design can achieve near-optimal
DoF and capacity with a significantly lower computational complexity.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of using causal models to improve the rate at which good

combines multi-arm bandits and causal inference to model a novel type of bandit
feedback that is not exploited by existing approaches. We propose a new
algorithm that exploits the causal feedback and prove a bound on its simple
regret that is strictly better (in all quantities) than algorithms that do not
use the additional causal information.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional and pooling
operations along the frequency axis have been proposed to attain invariance to
frequency shifts of features. However, this is inappropriate with regard to the
fact that acoustic features vary in frequency. In this paper, we contend that
convolution along the time axis is more effective. We also propose the addition
of an intermap pooling (IMP) layer to deep CNNs. In this layer, filters in each
group extract common but spectrally variant features, then the layer pools the
feature maps of each group. As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve
insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and
utterances. The effectiveness of the IMP CNN architecture is demonstrated on
several LVCSR tasks. Even without speaker adaptation techniques, the
architecture achieved a WER of 12.7% on the SWB part of the Hub5'2000
evaluation test set, which is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>Discovery of Latent Factors in High-dimensional Data Using Tensor
  Methods</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huang, Furong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning aims at the discovery of hidden structure that drives
the observations in the real world. It is essential for success in modern
machine learning. Latent variable models are versatile in unsupervised learning
and have applications in almost every domain. Training latent variable models
is challenging due to the non-convexity of the likelihood objective. An
alternative method is based on the spectral decomposition of low order moment
tensors. This versatile framework is guaranteed to estimate the correct model
consistently. My thesis spans both theoretical analysis of tensor decomposition
framework and practical implementation of various applications. This thesis
presents theoretical results on convergence to globally optimal solution of
tensor decomposition using the stochastic gradient descent, despite
non-convexity of the objective. This is the first work that gives global
convergence guarantees for the stochastic gradient descent on non-convex
functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. This thesis
also presents large-scale deployment of spectral methods carried out on various
platforms. Dimensionality reduction techniques such as random projection are
incorporated for a highly parallel and scalable tensor decomposition algorithm.
We obtain a gain in both accuracies and in running times by several orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-art variational methods. To solve real world
problems, more advanced models and learning algorithms are proposed. This
thesis discusses generalization of LDA model to mixed membership stochastic
block model for learning user communities in social network, convolutional
dictionary model for learning word-sequence embeddings, hierarchical tensor
decomposition and latent tree structure model for learning disease hierarchy,
and spatial point process mixture model for detecting cell types in
neuroscience.

 <dc:title>Decidable Characterization of FO2(&lt;,+1) and locality of DA</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Several years ago Th\'erien and Wilke exhibited a decidable characterization
of the languages of words that are definable in FO2(&lt;,+1). Their proof relies
on three separate ingredients. The first one is the characterization of the
languages that are definable in FO2(&lt;) as those whose syntactic semigroup
belongs to the variety DA. Then, this result is combined with a wreath product
argument showing that being definable in FO2(&lt;,+1) corresponds to having a
syntactic semigroup in DA*D. Finally, proving that membership of a semigroup in
DA*D is decidable requires a third ingredient: the &quot;locality&quot; of DA, a result
proved by Almeida. In this note we present a new self-contained and simple
proof that definability in FO2(&lt;,+1) is decidable. We obtain the locality of DA
as a corollary.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a model which aim is providing a more coherent framework
for agents design. We identify three closely related anthropo-centered domains
working on separate functional levels. Abstracting from human physiology,
psychology, and philosophy we create the $P^3$ model to be used as a multi-tier
approach to deal with complex class of problems. The three layers identified in
this model have been named PhysioComputing, MindComputing, and MetaComputing.
Several instantiations of this model are finally presented related to different
IT areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed computing, software and
service engineering.

 <dc:title>Optimal Sparsification for Some Binary CSPs Using Low-degree Polynomials</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Jansen, Bart M. P.</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Pieterse, Astrid</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper analyzes to what extent it is possible to efficiently reduce the
number of clauses in NP-hard satisfiability problems, without changing the
answer. Upper and lower bounds are established using the concept of
kernelization. Existing results show that if NP is not contained in coNP/poly,
no efficient preprocessing algorithm can reduce n-variable instances of CNF-SAT
with d literals per clause, to equivalent instances with O(n^{d-e}) bits for
any e &gt; 0. For the Not-All-Equal SAT problem, a compression to size
\~O(n^{d-1}) exists. We put these results in a common framework by analyzing
the compressibility of binary CSPs. We characterize constraint types based on
the minimum degree of multivariate polynomials whose roots correspond to the
satisfying assignments, obtaining (nearly) matching upper and lower bounds in
several settings. Our lower bounds show that not just the number of
constraints, but also the encoding size of individual constraints plays an
important role. For example, for Exact Satisfiability with unbounded clause
length it is possible to efficiently reduce the number of constraints to n+1,
yet no polynomial-time algorithm can reduce to an equivalent instance with
O(n^{2-e}) bits for any e &gt; 0, unless NP is a subset of coNP/poly.

 <dc:title>Interaction and resistance: The recognition of intentions in new
  human-computer interaction</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>M&#xfc;ller, Vincent C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Just as AI has moved away from classical AI, human-computer interaction (HCI)
must move away from what I call 'good old fashioned HCI' to 'new HCI' - it must
become a part of cognitive systems research where HCI is one case of the
interaction of intelligent agents (we now know that interaction is essential
for intelligent agents anyway). For such interaction, we cannot just 'analyze
the data', but we must assume intentions in the other, and I suggest these are
largely recognized through resistance to carrying out one's own intentions.
This does not require fully cognitive agents but can start at a very basic
level. New HCI integrates into cognitive systems research and designs
intentional systems that provide resistance to the human agent.

 <dc:description>  Facial expressions are an important way through which humans interact
socially. Building a system capable of automatically recognizing facial
expressions from images and video has been an intense field of study in recent
years. Interpreting such expressions remains challenging and much research is
needed about the way they relate to human affect. This paper presents a general
overview of automatic RGB, 3D, thermal and multimodal facial expression
analysis. We define a new taxonomy for the field, encompassing all steps from
face detection to facial expression recognition, and describe and classify the
state of the art methods accordingly. We also present the important datasets
and the bench-marking of most influential methods. We conclude with a general
discussion about trends, important questions and future lines of research.

 <dc:description>  Here, we present IDNet, a user authentication framework from
smartphone-acquired motion signals. Its goal is to recognize a target user from
their way of walking, using the accelerometer and gyroscope (inertial) signals
provided by a commercial smartphone worn in the front pocket of the user's
trousers. IDNet features several innovations including: i) a robust and
smartphone-orientation-independent walking cycle extraction block, ii) a novel
feature extractor based on convolutional neural networks, iii) a one-class
support vector machine to classify walking cycles, and the coherent integration
of these into iv) a multi-stage authentication technique. IDNet is the first
system that exploits a deep learning approach as universal feature extractors
for gait recognition, and that combines classification results from subsequent
walking cycles into a multi-stage decision making framework. Experimental
results show the superiority of our approach against state-of-the-art
techniques, leading to misclassification rates (either false negatives or
positives) smaller than 0.15% with fewer than five walking cycles. Design
choices are discussed and motivated throughout, assessing their impact on the
user authentication performance.

 <dc:description>  We consider a frame asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA (FA-CSA) system for
uncoordinated multiple access, where users join the system on a slot-by-slot
basis according to a Poisson random process and, in contrast to standard frame
synchronous CSA (FS-CSA), users are not frame-synchronized. We analyze the
performance of FA-CSA in terms of packet loss rate and delay. In particular, we
derive the (approximate) density evolution that characterizes the asymptotic
performance of FA-CSA when the frame length goes to infinity. We show that, if
the receiver can monitor the system before anyone starts transmitting, a
boundary effect similar to that of spatially-coupled codes occurs, which
greatly improves the iterative decoding threshold. Furthermore, we derive tight
approximations of the error floor (EF) for the finite frame length regime,
based on the probability of occurrence of the most frequent stopping sets. We
show that, in general, FA-CSA provides better performance in both the EF and
waterfall regions as compared to FS-CSA. Moreover, FA-CSA exhibits better delay
properties than FS-CSA.

 <dc:description>  The gossip problem, in which information (known as secrets) must be shared
among a certain number of agents using the minimum number of calls, is of
interest in the conception of communication networks and protocols. We extend
the gossip problem to arbitrary epistemic depths. For example, we may require
not only that all agents know all secrets but also that all agents know that
all agents know all secrets. We give optimal protocols for various versions of
the generalised gossip problem, depending on the graph of communication links,
in the case of two-way communications, one-way communications and parallel
communication. We also study different variants which allow us to impose
negative goals such as that certain agents must not know certain secrets. We
show that in the presence of negative goals testing the existence of a
successful protocol is NP-complete whereas this is always polynomial-time in
the case of purely positive goals.

 <dc:description>  The rapid development of multi-core system and increase of data-intensive
application in recent years call for larger main memory. Traditional DRAM
memory can increase its capacity by reducing the feature size of storage cell.
Now further scaling of DRAM faces great challenge, and the frequent refresh
operations of DRAM can bring a lot of energy consumption. As an emerging
technology, Phase Change Memory (PCM) is promising to be used as main memory.
It draws wide attention due to the advantages of low power consumption, high
density and nonvolatility, while it incurs finite endurance and relatively long
write latency. To handle the problem of write, optimizing the cache replacement
policy to protect dirty cache block is an efficient way. In this paper, we
construct a systematically multilevel structure, and based on it propose a
novel cache replacement policy called MAC. MAC can effectively reduce write
traffic to PCM memory with low hardware overhead. We conduct simulation
experiments on GEM5 to evaluate the performances of MAC and other related
works. The results show that MAC performs best in reducing the amount of writes
(averagely 25.12%) without increasing the program execution time.

 <dc:description>  Decision-making is often dependent on uncertain data, e.g. data associated
with confidence scores or probabilities. We present a comparison of different
information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure
their effects on human decision-making. We show that the use of Natural
Language Generation (NLG) improves decision-making under uncertainty, compared
to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based
study with 442 adults, we found that presentations using NLG lead to 24% better
decision-making on average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better
decision-making when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women
achieve significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87%
increase on average compared to graphical presentations).

 <dc:description>  One single code change can significantly influence a wide range of software
systems and their users. For example, 1) adding a new feature can spread
defects in several modules, while 2) changing an API method can improve the
performance of all client programs. Developers often may not clearly know
whether their or others' changes are influential at commit time. Rather, it
turns out to be influential after affecting many aspects of a system later.
This paper investigates influential software changes and proposes an approach
to identify them early, i.e., immediately when they are applied. We first
conduct a post-mortem analysis to discover existing influential changes by
using intuitions such as isolated changes and changes referred by other changes
in 10 open source projects. Then we re-categorize all identified changes
through an open-card sorting process. Subsequently, we conduct a survey with 89
developers to confirm our influential change categories. Finally, from our
ground truth we extract features, including metrics such as the complexity of
changes, terms in commit logs and file centrality in co-change graphs, to build
machine learning classifiers. The experiment results show that our prediction
model achieves overall with random samples 86.8% precision, 74% recall and
80.4% F-measure respectively.

 <dc:description>  In graph modification problems, one is given a graph G and the goal is to
apply a minimum number of modification operations (such as edge deletions) to G
such that the resulting graph fulfills a certain property. For example, the
Cluster Deletion problem asks to delete as few edges as possible such that the
resulting graph is a disjoint union of cliques. Graph modification problems
appear in numerous applications, including the analysis of biological and
social networks. Typically, graph modification problems are NP-hard, making
them natural candidates for parameterized complexity studies. We discuss
several fruitful interactions between the development of fixed-parameter
algorithms and the design of heuristics for graph modification problems,
featuring quite different aspects of mutual benefits.

 <dc:description>  Ride sharing has important implications in terms of environmental, social and
individual goals by reducing carbon footprints, fostering social interactions
and economizing commuter costs. The ride sharing systems that are commonly
available lack adaptive and scalable techniques that can simultaneously learn
from the large scale data and predict in real-time dynamic fashion. In this
paper, we study such a problem towards a smart city initiative, where a generic
ride sharing system is conceived capable of making predictions about ride share
opportunities based on the historically recorded data while satisfying
real-time ride requests. Underpinning the system is an application of a
powerful machine learning convex optimization framework called Network Lasso
that uses the Alternate Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) optimization for
learning and dynamic prediction. We propose an application of a robust and
scalable unified optimization framework within the ride sharing case-study. The
application of Network Lasso framework is capable of jointly optimizing and
clustering different rides based on their spatial and model similarity. The
prediction from the framework clusters new ride requests, making accurate price
prediction based on the clusters, detecting hidden correlations in the data and
allowing fast convergence due to the network topology. We provide an empirical
evaluation of the application of ADMM network Lasso on real trip record and
simulated data, proving their effectiveness since the mean squared error of the
algorithm's prediction is minimized on the test rides.

 <dc:description>  In various areas of computer science, the problem of dealing with a set of
constraints arises. If the set of constraints is unsatisfiable, one may ask for
a minimal description of the reason for this unsatisifi- ability. Minimal
unsatisifable subsets (MUSes) and maximal satisifiable subsets (MSSes) are two
kinds of such minimal descriptions. The goal of this work is the enumeration of
MUSes and MSSes for a given constraint system. As such full enumeration may be
intractable in general, we focus on building an online algorithm, which
produces MUSes/MSSes in an on-the-fly manner as soon as they are discovered.
The problem has been studied before even in its online version. However, our
algorithm uses a novel approach that is able to outperform current state-of-the
art algorithms for online MUS/MSS enumeration. Moreover, the performance of our
algorithm can be adjusted using tunable parameters. We evaluate the algorithm
on a set of benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Reasoning on large and complex real-world models is a computationally
difficult task, yet one that is required for effective use of many AI
applications. A plethora of inference algorithms have been developed that work
well on specific models or only on parts of general models. Consequently, a
system that can intelligently apply these inference algorithms to different
parts of a model for fast reasoning is highly desirable. We introduce a new
framework called structured factored inference (SFI) that provides the
foundation for such a system. Using models encoded in a probabilistic
programming language, SFI provides a sound means to decompose a model into
sub-models, apply an inference algorithm to each sub-model, and combine the
resulting information to answer a query. Our results show that SFI is nearly as
accurate as exact inference yet retains the benefits of approximate inference
methods.

 <dc:description>  We present TransitLabel, a crowd-sensing system for automatic enrichment of
transit stations indoor floorplans with different semantics like ticket vending
machines, entrance gates, drink vending machines, platforms, cars' waiting
lines, restrooms, lockers, waiting (sitting) areas, among others. Our key
observations show that certain passengers' activities (e.g., purchasing
tickets, crossing entrance gates, etc) present identifiable signatures on one
or more cell-phone sensors. TransitLabel leverages this fact to automatically
and unobtrusively recognize different passengers' activities, which in turn are
mined to infer their uniquely associated stations semantics. Furthermore, the
locations of the discovered semantics are automatically estimated from the
inaccurate passengers' positions when these semantics are identified. We
evaluate TransitLabel through a field experiment in eight different train
stations in Japan. Our results show that TransitLabel can detect the
fine-grained stations semantics accurately with 7.7% false positive rate and
7.5% false negative rate on average. In addition, it can consistently detect
the location of discovered semantics accurately, achieving an error within 2.5m
on average for all semantics. Finally, we show that TransitLabel has a small
energy footprint on cell-phones, could be generalized to other stations, and is
robust to different phone placements; highlighting its promise as a ubiquitous
indoor maps enriching service.

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are population-based general-purpose
optimization algorithms, and have been successfully applied in various
real-world optimization tasks. However, previous theoretical studies often
employ EAs with only a parent or offspring population and focus on specific
problems. Furthermore, they often only show upper bounds on the running time,
while lower bounds are also necessary to get a complete understanding of an
algorithm. In this paper, we analyze the running time of the
($\mu$+$\lambda$)-EA (a general population-based EA with mutation only) on the
class of pseudo-Boolean functions with a unique global optimum. By applying the
recently proposed switch analysis approach, we prove the lower bound $\Omega(n
\ln n+ \mu + \lambda n\ln\ln n/ \ln n)$ for the first time. Particularly on the
two widely-studied problems, OneMax and LeadingOnes, the derived lower bound
discloses that the ($\mu$+$\lambda$)-EA will be strictly slower than the
(1+1)-EA when the population size $\mu$ or $\lambda$ is above a moderate order.
Our results imply that the increase of population size, while usually desired
in practice, bears the risk of increasing the lower bound of the running time
and thus should be carefully considered.

 <dc:description>  Modern SAT solvers have experienced a remarkable progress on solving
industrial instances. Most of the techniques have been developed after an
intensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit
the underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works
trying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure.
  The research community on complex networks has developed techniques of
analysis and algorithms to study real-world graphs that can be used by the SAT
community. Recently, there have been some attempts to analyze the structure of
industrial SAT instances in terms of complex networks, with the aim of
explaining the success of SAT solving techniques, and possibly improving them.
  In this paper, inspired by the results on complex networks, we study the
community structure, or modularity, of industrial SAT instances. In a graph
with clear community structure, or high modularity, we can find a partition of
its nodes into communities such that most edges connect variables of the same
community. In our analysis, we represent SAT instances as graphs, and we show
that most application benchmarks are characterized by a high modularity. On the
contrary, random SAT instances are closer to the classical Erd\&quot;os-R\'enyi
random graph model, where no structure can be observed. We also analyze how
this structure evolves by the effects of the execution of the SAT solver. We
detect that new clauses learnt by the solver during the search contribute to
destroy the original community structure of the formula. This partially
explains the distinct performance of SAT solvers on random and industrial SAT
instances.

 <dc:description>  Huge amounts of digital videos are being produced and broadcast every day,
leading to giant media archives. Effective techniques are needed to make such
data accessible further. Automatic meta-data labelling of broadcast media is an
essential task for multimedia indexing, where it is standard to use multi-modal
input for such purposes. This paper describes a novel method for automatic
detection of media genre and show identities using acoustic features, textual
features or a combination thereof. Furthermore the inclusion of available
meta-data, such as time of broadcast, is shown to lead to very high
performance. Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used to model both acoustics and
text, yielding fixed dimensional representations of media recordings that can
then be used in Support Vector Machines based classification. Experiments are
conducted on more than 1200 hours of TV broadcasts from the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), where the task is to categorise the broadcasts
into 8 genres or 133 show identities. On a 200-hour test set, accuracies of
98.6% and 85.7% were achieved for genre and show identification respectively,
using a combination of acoustic and textual features with meta-data.

 <dc:description>  A complex nature of big data resources demands new methods for structuring
especially for textual content. WordNet is a good knowledge source for
comprehensive abstraction of natural language as its good implementations exist
for many languages. Since WordNet embeds natural language in the form of a
complex network, a transformation mechanism WordNet2Vec is proposed in the
paper. It creates vectors for each word from WordNet. These vectors encapsulate
general position - role of a given word towards all other words in the natural
language. Any list or set of such vectors contains knowledge about the context
of its component within the whole language. Such word representation can be
easily applied to many analytic tasks like classification or clustering. The
usefulness of the WordNet2Vec method was demonstrated in sentiment analysis,
i.e. classification with transfer learning for the real Amazon opinion textual
dataset.

 <dc:description>  Signed networks have long been used to represent social relations of amity
(+) and enmity (-) between individuals. Group of individuals who are cyclically
connected are said to be balanced if the number of negative edges in the cycle
is even and unbalanced otherwise. In its earliest and most natural formulation,
the balance of a social network was thus defined from its simple cycles, cycles
which do not visit any vertex more than once. Because of the inherent
difficulty associated with finding such cycles on very large networks, social
balance has since then been studied via other means. In this article we present
the balance as measured from the simple cycles and primitive orbits of social
networks. We specifically provide two measures of balance: the proportion
$R_\ell$ of negative simple cycles of length $\ell$ for each $\ell\leq 20$
which generalises the triangle index, and a ratio $K_\ell$ which extends the
relative signed clustering coefficient introduced by Kunegis. To do so, we use
a Monte Carlo implementation of a novel exact formula for counting the simple
cycles on any weighted directed graph. Our method is free from the
double-counting problem affecting previous cycle-based approaches, does not
require edge-reciprocity of the underlying network, provides a gray-scale
measure of balance for each cycle length separately and is sufficiently
tractable that it can be implemented on a standard desktop computer. We observe
that social networks exhibit strong inter-edge correlations favouring balanced
situations and we determine the corresponding correlation length $\xi$. For
longer simple cycles, $R_\ell$ undergoes a sharp transition to values expected
from an uncorrelated model. This transition is absent from synthetic random
networks, strongly suggesting that it carries a sociological meaning warranting
further research.

 <dc:description>  Recently a variety of LSTM-based conditional language models (LM) have been
applied across a range of language generation tasks. In this work we study
various model architectures and different ways to represent and aggregate the
source information in an end-to-end neural dialogue system framework. A method
called snapshot learning is also proposed to facilitate learning from
supervised sequential signals by applying a companion cross-entropy objective
function to the conditioning vector. The experimental and analytical results
demonstrate firstly that competition occurs between the conditioning vector and
the LM, and the differing architectures provide different trade-offs between
the two. Secondly, the discriminative power and transparency of the
conditioning vector is key to providing both model interpretability and better
performance. Thirdly, snapshot learning leads to consistent performance
improvements independent of which architecture is used.

 <dc:description>  Exploiting geometric structure to improve the asymptotic complexity of
discrete assignment problems is a well-studied subject. In contrast, the
practical advantages of using geometry for such problems have not been
explored. We implement geometric variants of the Hopcroft--Karp algorithm for
bottleneck matching (based on previous work by Efrat el al.) and of the auction
algorithm by Bertsekas for Wasserstein distance computation. Both
implementations use k-d trees to replace a linear scan with a geometric
proximity query. Our interest in this problem stems from the desire to compute
distances between persistence diagrams, a problem that comes up frequently in
topological data analysis. We show that our geometric matching algorithms lead
to a substantial performance gain, both in running time and in memory
consumption, over their purely combinatorial counterparts. Moreover, our
implementation significantly outperforms the only other implementation
available for comparing persistence diagrams.

 <dc:description>  Group identification models situations where a set of individuals are asked
to determine who among themselves are socially qualified. In this paper, we
study the complexity of three group control problems, namely Group Control by
Adding Individuals, Group Control by Deleting Individuals and Group Control by
Partition of Individuals for various social rules. In these problems, an
external agent has an incentive to make a given subset of individuals socially
qualified by adding, deleting or partition of individuals. We achieve both
polynomial-time solvability results and NP-hardness results. In addition, we
study the NP-hard problems from the parameterized complexity perspective, and
obtain several fixed-parameter tractability results.

 <dc:description>  We present sec-cs, a hash-table-like data structure for file contents on
untrusted storage that is both secure and storage-efficient. We achieve
authenticity and confidentiality with zero storage overhead using deterministic
authenticated encryption. State-of-the-art data deduplication approaches
prevent redundant storage of shared parts of different contents irrespective of
whether relationships between contents are known a priori or not.
  Instead of just adapting existing approaches, we introduce novel
(multi-level) chunking strategies, ML-SC and ML-CDC, which are significantly
more storage-efficient than existing approaches in presence of high redundancy.
  We prove sec-cs's security, publish a ready-to-use implementation, and
present results of an extensive analytical and empirical evaluation that show
its suitability for, e.g., future backup systems that should preserve many
versions of files on little available cloud storage.

 <dc:description>  Common users have changed from mere consumers to active producers of
multimedia data content. Video editing plays an important role in this
scenario, calling for simple segmentation tools that can handle fast-moving and
deformable video objects with possible occlusions, color similarities with the
background, among other challenges. We present an interactive video
segmentation method, named FOMTrace, which addresses the problem in an
effective and efficient way. From a user-provided object mask in a first frame,
the method performs semi-automatic video segmentation on a spatiotemporal
superpixel-graph, and then estimates a Fuzzy Object Model (FOM), which refines
segmentation of the second frame by constraining delineation on a pixel-graph
within a region where the object's boundary is expected to be. The user can
correct/accept the refined object mask in the second frame, which is then
similarly used to improve the spatiotemporal video segmentation of the
remaining frames. Both steps are repeated alternately, within interactive
response times, until the segmentation refinement of the final frame is
accepted by the user. Extensive experiments demonstrate FOMTrace's ability for
tracing objects in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches for interactive
video segmentation, supervised, and unsupervised object tracking.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the design of precoders for single-user
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, and in particular for
finite-alphabet signals. Based on an asymptotic expression for the mutual
information of channels exhibiting line-of-sight components and rather general
antenna correlations, precoding structures that decompose the general channel
into a set of parallel subchannel pairs are proposed. Then, a low-complexity
iterative algorithm is devised to maximize the sum mutual information of all
pairs. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces the computational load of
existing approaches with only minimal loss in performance. The complexity
savings increase with the number of transmit antennas and with the cardinality
of the signal alphabet, making it possible to support values thereof that were
unmanageable with existing solutions. Most importantly, the proposed solution
does not require instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter, but only statistical CSI.

 <dc:title>A Generalized Bass Model for Product Growth in Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many products and innovations become well-known and widely adopted through
the social interactions of individuals in a population. The Bass diffusion
model has been widely used to model the temporal evolution of adoption in such
social systems. In the model, the likelihood of a new adoption is proportional
to the number of previous adopters, implicitly assuming a global (or
homogeneous) interaction among all individuals in the network. Such global
interactions do not exist in many large social networks, however. Instead,
individuals typically interact with a small part of the larger population. To
quantify the growth rate (or equivalently the adoption timing) in networks with
limited interactions, we study a stochastic adoption process where the
likelihood that each individual adopts is proportional to the number of
adopters among the small group of persons he/she interacts with (and not the
entire population of adopters). When the underlying network of interactions is
a random $k$-regular graph, we compute the sample path limit of the fraction of
adopters. We show the limit coincides with the solution of a differential
equation which can viewed as a generalization of the Bass diffusion model. When
the degree $k$ is bounded, we show the adoption curve differs significantly
from the one corresponds to the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the
adoption grows more slowly than what the Bass model projects. In addition, the
adoption curve is asymmetric, unlike that of the Bass diffusion model. Such
asymmetry has important consequences for the estimation of market potential.
Finally, we calculate the timing of early adoptions at finer scales, e.g.,
logarithmic in the population size.

 <dc:description>  This work focuses on answering single-relation factoid questions over
Freebase. Each question can acquire the answer from a single fact of form
(subject, predicate, object) in Freebase. This task, simple question answering
(SimpleQA), can be addressed via a two-step pipeline: entity linking and fact
selection. In fact selection, we match the subject entity in a fact candidate
with the entity mention in the question by a character-level convolutional
neural network (char-CNN), and match the predicate in that fact with the
question by a word-level CNN (word-CNN). This work makes two main
contributions. (i) A simple and effective entity linker over Freebase is
proposed. Our entity linker outperforms the state-of-the-art entity linker over
SimpleQA task. (ii) A novel attentive maxpooling is stacked over word-CNN, so
that the predicate representation can be matched with the predicate-focused
question representation more effectively. Experiments show that our system sets
new state-of-the-art in this task.

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework to improve performance of distantly-supervised
relation extraction, by jointly learning to solve two related tasks:
concept-instance extraction and relation extraction. We combine this with a
novel use of document structure: in some small, well-structured corpora,
sections can be identified that correspond to relation arguments, and
distantly-labeled examples from such sections tend to have good precision.
Using these as seeds we extract additional relation examples by applying label
propagation on a graph composed of noisy examples extracted from a large
unstructured testing corpus. Combined with the soft constraint that concept
examples should have the same type as the second argument of the relation, we
get significant improvements over several state-of-the-art approaches to
distantly-supervised relation extraction.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach to reduce memory consumption of the
backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm when training recurrent neural
networks (RNNs). Our approach uses dynamic programming to balance a trade-off
between caching of intermediate results and recomputation. The algorithm is
capable of tightly fitting within almost any user-set memory budget while
finding an optimal execution policy minimizing the computational cost.
Computational devices have limited memory capacity and maximizing a
computational performance given a fixed memory budget is a practical use-case.
We provide asymptotic computational upper bounds for various regimes. The
algorithm is particularly effective for long sequences. For sequences of length
1000, our algorithm saves 95\% of memory usage while using only one third more
time per iteration than the standard BPTT.

 <dc:title>Length bias in Encoder Decoder Models and a Case for Global Conditioning</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Encoder-decoder networks are popular for modeling sequences probabilistically
in many applications. These models use the power of the Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) architecture to capture the full dependence among variables, unlike
earlier models like CRFs that typically assumed conditional independence among
non-adjacent variables. However in practice encoder-decoder models exhibit a
bias towards short sequences that surprisingly gets worse with increasing beam
size.
  In this paper we show that such phenomenon is due to a discrepancy between
the full sequence margin and the per-element margin enforced by the locally
conditioned training objective of a encoder-decoder model. The discrepancy more
adversely impacts long sequences, explaining the bias towards predicting short
sequences.
  For the case where the predicted sequences come from a closed set, we show
that a globally conditioned model alleviates the above problems of
encoder-decoder models. From a practical point of view, our proposed model also
eliminates the need for a beam-search during inference, which reduces to an
efficient dot-product based search in a vector-space.

and enables communications among rescue workers. The self-rescue system groups,
schedules and positions the smartphones of trapped survivors. Such a group of
smartphones can cooperatively wake up and send out emergency messages in an
energy-efficient manner with their location and position information so as to
assist rescue operations. We have implemented TeamPhone as a prototype
application on the Android platform and deployed it on off-the-shelf
smartphones. Experimental results demonstrate that TeamPhone can properly
fulfill communication requirements and greatly facilitate rescue operations in
disaster recovery.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of distributed hypothesis testing in
multi-agent networks, where agents repeatedly collect local observations about
an unknown state of the world, and try to collaboratively detect the true state
through information exchange. We focus on the impact of failures and asynchrony
(two fundamental factors in distributed systems) on the performance of
consensus-based non-Bayesian learning. In particular, we consider the scenario
where the networked agents may suffer crash faults, and messages delay can be
arbitrarily long but finite. We identify the minimal global detectability of
the network for non-Bayesian rule to succeed. In addition, we obtain a
generalization of a celebrated result by Wolfowitz and Hajnal to submatrices,
which might be of independent interest.

 <dc:description>  Determining the interaction strength between proteins and small molecules is
key to analyzing their biological function. Quantum-mechanical calculations
such as \emph{Density Functional Theory} (DFT) give accurate and theoretically
well-founded results. With common implementations the running time of DFT
calculations increases quadratically with molecule size. Thus, numerous
subsystem-based approaches have been developed to accelerate quantum-chemical
calculations. These approaches partition the protein into different fragments,
which are treated separately. Interactions between different fragments are
approximated and introduce inaccuracies in the calculated interaction energies.
  To minimize these inaccuracies, we represent the amino acids and their
interactions as a weighted graph in order to apply graph partitioning. None of
the existing graph partitioning work can be directly used, though, due to the
unique constraints in partitioning such protein graphs. We therefore present
and evaluate several algorithms, partially building upon established concepts,
but adapted to handle the new constraints. For the special case of partitioning
a protein along the main chain, we also present an efficient dynamic
programming algorithm that yields provably optimal results. In the general
scenario our algorithms usually improve the previous approach significantly and
take at most a few seconds.

 <dc:description>  Gibbs sampling is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling technique that
iteratively samples variables from their conditional distributions. There are
two common scan orders for the variables: random scan and systematic scan. Due
to the benefits of locality in hardware, systematic scan is commonly used, even
though most statistical guarantees are only for random scan. While it has been
conjectured that the mixing times of random scan and systematic scan do not
differ by more than a logarithmic factor, we show by counterexample that this
is not the case, and we prove that that the mixing times do not differ by more
than a polynomial factor under mild conditions. To prove these relative bounds,
we introduce a method of augmenting the state space to study systematic scan
using conductance.

 <dc:title>Deep Directed Generative Models with Energy-Based Probability Estimation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Training energy-based probabilistic models is confronted with apparently
intractable sums, whose Monte Carlo estimation requires sampling from the
estimated probability distribution in the inner loop of training. This can be
approximately achieved by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, but may still face
a formidable obstacle that is the difficulty of mixing between modes with sharp
concentrations of probability. Whereas an MCMC process is usually derived from
a given energy function based on mathematical considerations and requires an
arbitrarily long time to obtain good and varied samples, we propose to train a
deep directed generative model (not a Markov chain) so that its sampling
distribution approximately matches the energy function that is being trained.
Inspired by generative adversarial networks, the proposed framework involves
training of two models that represent dual views of the estimated probability
distribution: the energy function (mapping an input configuration to a scalar
energy value) and the generator (mapping a noise vector to a generated
configuration), both represented by deep neural networks.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of super-resolution of point sources from binary
measurements, where random projections of the blurred measurement of the actual
signal are encoded using only the sign information. The threshold used for
binary quantization is not known to the decoder. We develop an algorithm that
solves convex programs iteratively and achieves signal recovery. The proposed
algorithm, which we refer to as the binary super-resolution (BSR) algorithm,
recovers point sources with reasonable accuracy, albeit up to a scale factor.
We show through simulations that the BSR algorithm is successful in recovering
the locations and the amplitudes of the point sources, even in the presence of
significant amount of blurring. We also propose a framework for handling noisy
measurements and demonstrate that BSR gives a reliable reconstruction
(correspondingly, reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of about 22 dB)
for a measurement SNR of 15 dB.

 <dc:title>On degeneracy control in overcomplete ICA</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Understanding the effects of degeneracy control mechanisms when learning
overcomplete representations is crucial for applying Independent Components
Analysis (ICA) in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. A number of
approaches to degeneracy control have been proposed which can learn
non-degenerate complete representations, however some of these methods can fall
into bad local minima when extended to overcomplete ICA. Furthermore, they may
have unintended side-effects on the distribution of learned basis elements,
which may lead to a biased exploration of the data manifold. In this work, we
identify and theoretically analyze the cause of these failures and propose a
framework that can be used to evaluate arbitrary degeneracy control mechanisms.
We evaluate different methods for degeneracy control in overcomplete ICA and
suggest two novel approaches, one of which can learn highly orthonormal bases.
Finally, we compare all methods on the task of estimating an overcomplete basis
on natural images.

 <dc:description>  Objective: Patient notes in electronic health records (EHRs) may contain
critical information for medical investigations. However, the vast majority of
medical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protect
the confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected health
information (PHI) that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manual
de-identification is impractical given the size of EHR databases, the limited
number of researchers with access to the non-de-identified notes, and the
frequent mistakes of human annotators. A reliable automated de-identification
system would consequently be of high value.
  Materials and Methods: We introduce the first de-identification system based
on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which requires no handcrafted features or
rules, unlike existing systems. We compare the performance of the system with
state-of-the-art systems on two datasets: the i2b2 2014 de-identification
challenge dataset, which is the largest publicly available de-identification
dataset, and the MIMIC de-identification dataset, which we assembled and is
twice as large as the i2b2 2014 dataset.
  Results: Our ANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. It yields an
F1-score of 97.85 on the i2b2 2014 dataset, with a recall 97.38 and a precision
of 97.32, and an F1-score of 99.23 on the MIMIC de-identification dataset, with
a recall 99.25 and a precision of 99.06.
  Conclusion: Our findings support the use of ANNs for de-identification of
patient notes, as they show better performance than previously published
systems while requiring no feature engineering.

 <dc:description>  Consider learning a policy from example expert behavior, without interaction
with the expert or access to reinforcement signal. One approach is to recover
the expert's cost function with inverse reinforcement learning, then extract a
policy from that cost function with reinforcement learning. This approach is
indirect and can be slow. We propose a new general framework for directly
extracting a policy from data, as if it were obtained by reinforcement learning
following inverse reinforcement learning. We show that a certain instantiation
of our framework draws an analogy between imitation learning and generative
adversarial networks, from which we derive a model-free imitation learning
algorithm that obtains significant performance gains over existing model-free
methods in imitating complex behaviors in large, high-dimensional environments.

 <dc:title>LANet: An Enriched Knowledgebase for Location-aware Activity
  Recommendation System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mazumder, Sahisnu</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Accumulation of large amount of location-specific reviews on web due to
escalating popularity of Location-based Social Networking platforms like Yelp,
Foursquare, Brightkite etc. in recent years, has created the opportunity to
discover location-specific activities and develop myriads of location-aware
activity recommendation applications. The performance and popularity of such
recommendation applications greatly depend on the richness and accuracy of the
back-end knowledgebase, which intern is regulated by information relevancy and
redundancy issues. Existing work on activity discovery have not made any
attempt to ensure relevancy and non-redundancy of discovered knowledge (i.e.,
location-specific activities). Moreover, majority of these work have utilized
body-worn sensors, images or human GPS traces and discovered generalized
activities that do not convey any location-specific knowledge.
  In this thesis, we address the mentioned issues with serious concern and
propose an effective solution to discover Location-specific Activity Network,
in short LANet from location-aware reviews. The information network LANet
serves as an accurate, enriched and unified knowledgebase of a Location-aware
Activity Recommendation System. While building LANet, we also introduce novel
ideas like, activity-based location similarity detection and measuring
uniqueness, generality/speciality of an activity at a particular location to
enrich the said knowledge base to a great extent. Experimental results show the
information richness and accuracy of the proposed knowledge base which is
comparable to human perception and accounts for our success in achieving the
desired solution.

 <dc:description>  Supervised machine learning models boast remarkable predictive capabilities.
But can you trust your model? Will it work in deployment? What else can it tell
you about the world? We want models to be not only good, but interpretable. And
yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse
and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer
myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this
ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further
explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on
interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in
interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then,
we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability,
identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing
notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different
notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are
interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.

 <dc:description>  Opportunistic mobile networks consisting of intermittently connected mobile
devices have been exploited for various applications, such as computational
offloading and mitigating cellular traffic load. In contrast to existing work,
in this paper, we focus on cooperatively offloading data among mobile devices
to maximally improve the probability of data delivery from a mobile device to
intermittently connected infrastructure within a given time constraint, which
is referred to as the \textit{cooperative offloading} problem. Unfortunately,
the estimation of data delivery probability over an opportunistic path is
difficult and cooperative offloading is NP-hard. To this end, we first propose
a probabilistic framework that provides the estimation of such probability.
Based on the proposed probabilistic framework, we design a heuristic algorithm
to solve cooperative offloading at a low computation cost. Due to the lack of
global information, a distributed algorithm is further proposed. The
performance of the proposed approaches is evaluated based on both synthetic
networks and real traces. Experimental results show that the probabilistic
framework can accurately estimate the data delivery probability, cooperative
offloading greatly improves the delivery probability, the heuristic algorithm
approximates the optimum, and the performance of both the heuristic algorithm
and distributed algorithm outperforms other approaches.

 <dc:description>  We present a variety of new architectural features and training procedures
that we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. We focus
on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of
images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative
models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood
to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without
using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results
in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated
images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model
generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and
CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3%. We also present
ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable
the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.

 <dc:description>  Clinical auditing requires codified data for aggregation and analysis of
patterns. However in the medical domain obtaining structured data can be
difficult as the most natural, expressive and comprehensive way to record a
clinical encounter is through natural language. The task of creating structured
data from naturally expressed information is known as information extraction.
Specialised areas of medicine use their own language and data structures; the
translation process has unique challenges, and often requires a fresh approach.
This research is devoted to creating a novel semi-automated method for
generating codified auditing data from clinical notes recorded in a
neurosurgical department in an Australian teaching hospital. The method
encapsulates specialist knowledge in rules that instantaneously make precise
decisions for the majority of the matches, followed up by dictionary-based
matching of the remaining text.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There is a considerable amount of awareness of environmental issues and
corporate responsibility for sustainability. As such, from a technological
viewpoint, Green IT has become an important topic in contemporary
organizations. Consequently, organisations are expected to be innovative in
their business practices to become more sustainable. Yet, the popularity and
adoption of such initiatives amongst employees remain low. Furthermore, the
management practices for adhering to Green IT are largely dormant, lacking
active incentives for employees to engage in Green IT initiatives. This study
observes the phenomenon of Green IT through administrative innovation. In doing
so this paper performs a comprehensive analysis of 137 papers published between
2007 and 2015. The paper reveals organizational factors for successful
implementation of Green IT as administrative innovation that can be useful to
both academia and practice.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the sample size requirement for a general class
of nuclear norm minimization methods for higher order tensor completion. We
introduce a class of tensor norms by allowing for different levels of
coherence, which allows us to leverage the incoherence of a tensor. In
particular, we show that a $k$th order tensor of rank $r$ and dimension
$d\times\cdots\times d$ can be recovered perfectly from as few as
$O((r^{(k-1)/2}d^{3/2}+r^{k-1}d)(\log(d))^2)$ uniformly sampled entries through
an appropriate incoherent nuclear norm minimization. Our results demonstrate
some key differences between completing a matrix and a higher order tensor:
They not only point to potential room for improvement over the usual nuclear
norm minimization but also highlight the importance of explicitly accounting
for incoherence, when dealing with higher order tensors.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper contributes to a better understanding of ethical concerns
regarding the deployment of complex public sector IT systems and the
information flows they instigate. The paper aims to reveal how different views
on IT and IT-enabled information flows allow us to see differently their social
implications and to construe different ethical questions. This is achieved by
i) defining two opposing views on IT-enabled information flows as
'intermediaries' and 'mediators'; ii) by analysing the controversial case of My
School - a web portal that provides performance data of 9,500 Australian
schools - that introduces new information flows in the education sector; and
iii) by revealing and explaining how some unintended negative social
implications emerge and how the articulation of ethical concerns depends on the
view on My School-enabled information flows. The paper concludes with
theoretical and practical implications, with particular emphasis on
responsibilities of all involved, setting up foundations for an important area
of future IS research.

 <dc:title>Social value and information quality in online health information search</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hameed, Tahir</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Swar, Bobby</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper extends and validates a model of value-driven online healthcare
information search in online shared contexts. Perceived value is an important
factor behind users' decisions concerning search, consumption and reuse of
products and services. The role of utilitarian, hedonic and epistemic value of
information in user satisfaction and intention to repeat online search is well
recognized, but little support has been found for social value affecting user
satisfaction critical for such decisions. Therefore, a value-based model of
online healthcare information search was extended adding detailed information
quality measures. Our survey data collected from 143 college going students
from more than 10 countries studying in South Korea demonstrated two novel
results. At first, unlike existing studies, strong support was found for
perceived social value affecting the user satisfaction. As a second substantial
finding, the significance of social value could only be appreciated by using
comprehensive constructs of information quality than simpler measures.
Therefore, this study shows for social and shared HIS, users consider access,
representation and context quality of healthcare information to be more
important from social perspective than intrinsic (or content) quality.
Therefore, developers and healthcare organizations interested in traction of
their online healthcare information delivery systems (HIS), especially those
using internet and social media networks, should focus on enhancing information
quality of their systems accordingly.

 <dc:description>  This paper reviews machine learning applications and approaches to detection,
classification and control of intelligent materials and structures with
embedded distributed computation elements. The purpose of this survey is to
identify desired tasks to be performed in each type of material or structure
(e.g., damage detection in composites), identify and compare common approaches
to learning such tasks, and investigate models and training paradigms used.
Machine learning approaches and common temporal features used in the domains of
structural health monitoring, morphable aircraft, wearable computing and
robotic skins are explored. As the ultimate goal of this research is to
incorporate the approaches described in this survey into a robotic material
paradigm, the potential for adapting the computational models used in these
applications, and corresponding training algorithms, to an amorphous network of
computing nodes is considered. Distributed versions of support vector machines,
graphical models and mixture models developed in the field of wireless sensor
networks are reviewed. Potential areas of investigation, including possible
architectures for incorporating machine learning into robotic nodes, training
approaches, and the possibility of using deep learning approaches for automatic
feature extraction, are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Our paper is research in progress that is research investigating the use of
games technology to enhance the learning of a physical skill. The Microsoft
Kinect is a system designed for gaming with the capability to track the
movement of users. Our research explored whether such a system could be used to
provide feedback when teaching sign vocabulary. Whilst there are technologies
available for teaching sign language, currently none provide feedback on the
accuracy of the users' attempts at making signs. In this paper we report how
the three-dimensional dsplay capability of the technology can enhance the
users' experience. Also, when using tracking to identify errors in physical
movements, how and when should feedback be given. A design science approach was
undertaken to find a solution to this real world problem. The design and
implementation of the solution provides interesting insights into how
technology can not only emulate but also improve upon traditional learning of
physical skills.

 <dc:description>  Despite actionable insight is widely recognized as the outcome of data
analytics, there is a lack of a systematic and commonly-shared definition for
the term. More importantly, existing definitions are generally too abstract for
informing the design of data analytics systems. This study proposes a
definition for actionable insight in data analytics. For this purpose, this
study conceptualizes actionable insight as a multi-component concept. The
components, namely analytics insight, synergic insight, and prognostic insights
are grounded in theories from multiple disciplines. Collectively, the
components provide a holistic definition for actionable insight. Based on the
multi-component view, a conceptual framework is introduced to actionable
insight in detail, at both the concept-level and component-level. Each
component's analytical, cognitive, and computational requirements are explained
and relevant design considerations are suggested. We hope this study could be a
rudimentary step toward the realization of data-centric data analytics that can
deliver the promised actionable insight.

 <dc:description>  Supply Chain Agility is important for organisations to stay competitive in
today's dynamic business environment. There is increasing interest in deploying
Business Intelligence (BI) in the Supply Chain Management (SCM) context to
improve Supply Chain (SC) Agility. However, there is limited research exploring
BI contributions to SC Agility. In this research-in-progress paper we propose a
model based on a conceptual analysis of the literature showing how BI can help
organisations achieve SC Agility by supporting the key areas of SCM (Plan,
Source, Make, Deliver and Return). In the next stage of this project, we will
conduct a series of case studies investigating how organisations use BI when
managing their SC activities and how BI contributes to SC Agility. The result
of the study will help organizations deploy BI effectively to support SCM and
improve SC Agility.

 <dc:description>  This paper critically assesses wireless broadband internet infrastructure, in
the rural and remote communities of WDR in terms of supply, demand and
utilisation. Only 8 of 20 towns have ADSL/ADSL2+, and only 3 towns have 4G
mobile network coverage. Conversely all of the towns have 2G/3G mobile network
coverage but have problems with speed, reliability of service and capacity to
handle data traffic loads at peak times. Satellite broadband internet for
remote areas is also patchy at best. Satisfaction with existing wireless
broadband internet services is highly variable across rural and remote
communities in WDR. Finally we provide suggestions to improve broadband
internet access for rural and remote communities. Public and private investment
and sharing of wired and wireless broadband internet infrastructure is needed
to provide the backhaul networks and 4G mobile and fixed wireless services to
ensure high speed, reliable and affordable broadband services for rural and
remote communities.

 <dc:description>  The present research investigated the extent of online self-disclosure (SD)
of adolescents through a systematic decadal literature review. This review
identified three major areas of research focus, with studies categorized mainly
as: (1) factors contributing to online SD of adolescents; (2) risks and
consequences of online SD; and (3) future directions of research and practical
interventions to address the problems. A detailed examination of the variables
covered by the studies indicated that only a few aspects related to
adolescents' online SD were addressed and these variables did not receive
in-depth analysis. Some aspects of online SD received too much attention while
others received none. Based on these findings, the present research argues that
further research using sophisticated scientific research designs is needed to
understand adolescents' online SD.

 <dc:description>  Dependence on information, including for some of the world's largest
organisations such as governments and multi-national corporations, has grown
rapidly in recent years. However, reports of information security breaches and
their associated consequences continue to indicate that attacks are still
escalating on organisations when conducting these information-based activities.
Clearly, more research is needed to better understand how organisations should
formulate strategy to secure their information. Through a thematic review of
academic security literature, we (1) analyse the antecedent conditions that
motivate the potential adoption of a comprehensive information security
strategy, (2) the current perspectives of strategy and (3) the yields and
benefits that could be enjoyed post-adoption. Our contributions include a
definition of information security strategy. We argue for a paradigm shift to
extend from internally-focussed protection of organisation-wide information
towards a strategic view that considers the inter-organisational level. Our
findings are then used to suggest future research directions.

 <dc:description>  Organizations are increasingly adopting digital strategies and investing
heavily in digital technologies and initiatives. However, to date, there does
not appear to be a clear understanding of digital strategies and their purpose,
which forms the motivation for this research. This research-in-progress study
aims to address this research gap by exploring 1) the various conceptions of
digital strategy, and 2) the way in which digital strategies differ from
conventional strategies, through interviews with three senior executives. We
employed thematic analysis to analyse the interview data, which resulted in the
identification of ten themes that were grouped under three theoretical
constructs. We then explored the applicability of the six dimensions of
strategy proposed by Hax (1990) in the digital context and proposed two
additional dimensions. The contribution of this study is to provide a deeper
understanding of digital strategy to support further academic research and
provide guidance to practitioners.

 <dc:description>  Using technology to persuade people to behave in a certain way is an
ever-increasing field of study. The ability to persuade individuals is quite
clear in e-commerce, where individuals are persuaded to make purchasing
decisions. However, it can also be applied to other disciplines, such as
education where improving the study behaviour of students would be particularly
useful. Forming good study habits can be a challenge for university students
who have not done so in the earlier years of their education, or where the
pressures of external commitments have eroded previously good habits. We use a
combination of the Fogg Behavioural Model and the Hook model to design features
for an app as a component of a larger persuasive system to help improve three
key areas of study habits: study scheduling, class preparation and group study.
The app will be built and tested in a university setting targeting
undergraduate students.

 <dc:description>  Digital disruption introduces technology-enabled changes at a pace and scale
that fundamentally shifts established ways in which we live and work. Given the
impact of digital disruption can span the individual, organisational, industry
and societal levels, it has received growing attention in Information Systems.
A less researched area of digital disruption, however, is the perspective of IT
managers in organisations. This paper draws on i) situational awareness theory
to identify IT managers' perceptions of digital disruption, and ii) disruptive
innovation theory to identify IT managers' responses to digital disruption. A
case study of senior IT managers in an Australian university identifies that IT
managers perceive digital disruption from the technological, learning and
sense-making perspectives. IT managers' first-order responses to digital
disruption were shown to address resource, process and value-based issues while
second-order responses focused on the need to build dynamic capabilities in
order to be prepared for future digital disruption.

 <dc:description>  The popularity of benefit realization management (BRM) in today's IT-enabled
world is fast gaining traction within IT organisations around the world.
However, there appears to be limited attention paid to the intra-organisational
practice by which benefits are identified. The purpose of this paper is
twofold: firstly, to describe and define a practice approach to the
identification of benefits that exploits a number of benefit identification
methods in an effort to more comprehensively identify IS/IT related benefits
that reflect the ongoing organisational investment. Secondly, to underline the
importance of this benefit identification process in the context of IT service
management (ITSM). This is achieved through a case study of an information
technology infrastructure library (ITIL) implementation in a multi-national
organization. The case study exposes a pragmatic practice approach of
customising such implementations in an effort to achieve a cost effective
implementation of IT services that reflects the context and requirements of
that specific organisation.

 <dc:description>  Achievement and sustenance of growth are essential themes in organizational
literature. In our paper, we develop models using systems thinking approach to
understand how firms achieve and sustain growth in a technology-intensive
product domain. We augment these to explain the possible impact of a disruptive
technological innovation. We use enterprise software industry as the context
where SAP has been acknowledged as the market leader. We find that product
differentiation and learning effects helped SAP establish itself, and this
growth was further sustained through networks and complementors. Introducing
cloud computing as the disruptive innovation, we explain its impact on a firm.
Analysis reveals that for the next wave of growth to occur, and to tap into
newer markets, it would be imperative for SAP to create attractive cloud based
offerings. We also discuss how the model can be enhanced by considering
competitor dynamics.

 <dc:description>  This paper uses a comprehensive review of the academic and professional
literature in relation to accountability in the area of cloud computing service
provision. It identifies four key conceptual factors that are necessary for an
organisation to be considered as accountable. The four factors were found to
be: responsibility, assurance, transparency and remediation. A key finding of
the paper is that in order to be considered as an accountable cloud service
provider, all four factors need to be implemented and be demonstrable by the
organisation.

 <dc:description>  In a dynamically changing world, businesses must transform themselves to
survive. Although the necessity for change may be apparent; how to change is
not. Learning from the experiences of successful pioneers in a core business
function is useful. Procurement is essential for all organisations. It is how
organisations acquire assets and inputs including facilities, materials and
people. Traditionally, the business objective from procurement was to increase
availability and reduce costs. Subsequently, the objective became more
tactical. Leading procurement practice today is disruptive; beyond cost to
creating value. The strategy for market leaders has also transformed; from
competition to collaboration. Technology-enabled business networks are now
driving business disruption globally. Through a rigorous field study of two
world-class pioneering corporations, this paper explores how disruption is
transforming Enterprise Supply Chains. Lessons, contributions and their
implications for current IS theory and practice, are discussed.

 <dc:description>  Broadband internet access is a major enabling technology for building social
capital (SC) by better connecting rural and regional communities which are
often geographically dispersed both locally nationally and internationally. The
main objectives of this paper were determine to what extent Social Networking
Sites (SNS) can build SC for households in a rural and regional context of
rural household adoption and use of broadband internet. A large scale survey of
households was used to collect empirical data regarding household adoption and
use of Broadband internet services including SNSs and their contribution to
building SC in rural communities. The results of this study confirmed that SNSs
would appear to build SC two high level dimensions bonding and bridging for
households in rural communities such as Western Downs Region. Moreover SNS
users would appear to have significantly higher levels of SC than Non-SNS users
in rural communities.

 <dc:description>  Natural language, although complex in structure, contains considerable
detail. All instances of language serve the purpose of making sense of
experience and the intent of actors. Language conveys actor's personal
reference to goals, responsibility, and values. In this paper we consider how
actors from distinct perspectives communicate when they have share common
goals. We have observed the planning of a community and cultural event where
actors are variously responsible for management and for artistic merit.
  Specifically, we consider actor's use of language as a tool to span
perspectives and how functional discourse analysis tools and techniques enable
a deeper interpretive understanding of the layers of discourse when derived
from a rich context. We will also illustrate patterns we have found in the use
of discourse and actor's ability to bridge the reasoning and logical gap
between distinct perspectives through actor's reference to metaphors and
genres.

 <dc:description>  The multi-dimensional nature of user experience warrants rigorous assessment
of the interactive experience in systems. User experience assessments are based
on product evaluations and subsequent analysis of the collected data using
quantitative and qualitative techniques. The quality of user experience
assessments are dependent on the effectiveness of the techniques deployed. This
paper presents the results of a quantitative analysis of desirability aspects
of the user experience in a comparative product evaluation study. The data
collection was conducted using 118 item Microsoft Product Reaction Cards (PRC)
tool followed by data analysis based on the Surface Measure of Overall
Performance (SMOP) approach. The results of this study suggest that the
incorporation of SMOP as an approach for PRC data analysis derive conclusive
evidence of desirability in user experience. The significance of the paper is
that it presents a novel analysis method incorporating product reaction cards
and surface measure of overall performance approach for an effective
quantitative analysis which can be used in academic research and industrial
practice.

 <dc:description>  This case study introduces a four step approach used by a Singapore small and
medium enterprise (SME) in implementing a cloud computing based integrated
management system (IMS) to meet the ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001
certification requirements. The objectives of this case study are to study: (1)
the challenges encountered by an SME during the IMS integration process at each
of the four levels of integration (2) the extent which Frugal IT Innovation and
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM3) concepts apply to our four step approach.
The four step approach was assessed against a framework of four integration
levels of the management systems (MS), and also the applicability of two IS
theories (Frugal IT Innovation and TAM3). Data was collected via: (1) direct
observations (2) participant observations; (3) interviews with key personnel
involved in the project; and (4) analysis of documents pertaining to the
project. This case study provides an exemplary model on using IS theories and
public cloud technologies to develop an effective IMS that other SMEs can learn
from.

 <dc:description>  Information privacy has gained increased attention in recent years. This
paper focuses on a particular aspect of privacy, i.e., personal information
privacy. In this paper a conceptual framework is developed based Westin's
theory of Personal Information Privacy (PIP). Concourse theory and
Q-methodology was used alongside the literature and the New Zealand Privacy Act
1993 to develop a Q-sort questionnaire. The resulting 29 statements were then
sorted by 12 students (majoring in IS Security). The results indicate that for
some, privacy priorities may be stable across contexts, and for others this
differs, suggesting that current views of privacy (e.g. Westin's theory) may
need revising for the modern digital age. The Q-sort methodology also
identified three types, each representing distinct collective perspectives on
personal information privacy. These types are discussed along with implications
and suggestions for future research.

 <dc:description>  Government organisations utilise a Citizen's Charter in order to furnish the
public with comprehensive details of their service offerings that defines how
their overall organisational goals are achieved. Studies on the implementation
of Citizen's Charter in developing countries indicated that important social
factors were not considered. Reviewed literatures indicated that social factors
could accelerate service delivery with the use of goal-oriented modelling (such
as i* organisational modeling) as it represent conditions expected from social
actors and their social dependencies. By modelling role dependencies among
actors carrying out services in a business unit and applying vulnerability and
criticality metrics, problem service areas were identified using the Citizen's
Charter as a source of these methodologies. Improvements in these problem
service areas were based on vulnerability and criticality levels of their
corresponding actors. Recommendations to address these service areas include
monitoring of key performance indicators of actors and task delegation when
necessary.

 <dc:title>Applying Adapted Big Five Teamwork Theory to Agile Software Development</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Strode, Diane</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Teamwork is a central tenet of agile software development and various
teamwork theories partially explain teamwork in that context. Big Five teamwork
theory is one of the most influential teamwork theories, but prior research
shows that the team leadership concept in this theory it is not applicable to
agile software development. This paper applies an adapted form of Big Five
teamwork theory to cases of agile software development. Three independent cases
were drawn from a single organisation. This ensured a measure of control over
contextual factors affecting the teamwork. The findings show that the adapted
form of Big Five teamwork theory, including a shared team leadership concept,
is fully applicable to some forms of agile software development, but not all.
For practitioners, insights as to which agile practices support teamwork are
provided.

 <dc:title>Improving pathology reports using business intelligence techniques: An
  experimental study</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>O'Donnell, Peter</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computers and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Health professionals use pathology reports to monitor and manage a patient's
health. Typically, pathologists diagnose patients' conditions and produce these
reports which are then used as reference by clinicians and eventually shared
with the patient. Pathology reports are difficult to interpret as the reports
are written using complex medical terminology. As patients only see their
doctors for a limited time, the complexity of report content and the manner in
which the information is presented in the reports may hinder patients'
understanding of their medical condition and prognosis. The objective of this
study was to compare patient comprehension of results from two
pathology-reporting styles: the traditional format in current widespread use
and new style developed using techniques common in business intelligence system
(BI) development. The study found that the reports prepared using a &quot;BI style&quot;
improve experimental subject's understanding and satisfaction with the reports.

 <dc:description>  Spatial visualisation skills and interpretations are critical in the design
professions, but traditionally difficult to effectively teach. Visualization
and multimedia presentation studies show positive improvements in learner
outcomes for specific learning domains. But the development and translation of
a comparative visualization pedagogy between disciplines is poorly understood.
This research seeks to identify an approach to developing comparable multimodal
and interactive visualizations and attendant student reflections for curriculum
designers in courses that can utilize visualizations and manipulations. Results
from previous use of comparative multimodal visualization pedagogy in a
multimedia 3D modelling class are used as a guide to translation of pedagogy to
architecture design. The focus is how to guide the use of comparative
multimodal visualizations through media properties, lesson sequencing, and
reflection to inform effective instruction and learning.

 <dc:description>  We conduct large-scale studies on `human attention' in Visual Question
Answering (VQA) to understand where humans choose to look to answer questions
about images. We design and test multiple game-inspired novel
attention-annotation interfaces that require the subject to sharpen regions of
a blurred image to answer a question. Thus, we introduce the VQA-HAT (Human
ATtention) dataset. We evaluate attention maps generated by state-of-the-art
VQA models against human attention both qualitatively (via visualizations) and
quantitatively (via rank-order correlation). Overall, our experiments show that
current attention models in VQA do not seem to be looking at the same regions
as humans.

 <dc:description>  We present a deep learning framework for accurate visual correspondences and
demonstrate its effectiveness for both geometric and semantic matching,
spanning across rigid motions to intra-class shape or appearance variations. In
contrast to previous CNN-based approaches that optimize a surrogate patch
similarity objective, we use deep metric learning to directly learn a feature
space that preserves either geometric or semantic similarity. Our fully
convolutional architecture, along with a novel correspondence contrastive loss
allows faster training by effective reuse of computations, accurate gradient
computation through the use of thousands of examples per image pair and faster
testing with $O(n)$ feed forward passes for $n$ keypoints, instead of $O(n^2)$
for typical patch similarity methods. We propose a convolutional spatial
transformer to mimic patch normalization in traditional features like SIFT,
which is shown to dramatically boost accuracy for semantic correspondences
across intra-class shape variations. Extensive experiments on KITTI, PASCAL,
and CUB-2011 datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of our features
over prior works that use either hand-constructed or learned features.

 <dc:description>  Social media has now become the de facto information source on real world
events. The challenge, however, due to the high volume and velocity nature of
social media streams, is in how to follow all posts pertaining to a given event
over time, a task referred to as story detection. Moreover, there are often
several different stories pertaining to a given event, which we refer to as
sub-stories and the corresponding task of their automatic detection as
sub-story detection. This paper proposes hierarchical Dirichlet processes
(HDP), a probabilistic topic model, as an effective method for automatic
sub-story detection. HDP can learn sub-topics associated with sub-stories which
enables it to handle subtle variations in sub-stories. It is compared with
state- of-the-art story detection approaches based on locality sensitive
hashing and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the superior performance of HDP
for sub-story detection on real world Twitter data sets using various
evaluation measures. The ability of HDP to learn sub-topics helps it to recall
the sub- stories with high precision. Another contribution of this paper is in
demonstrating that the conversational structures within the Twitter stream can
be used to improve sub-story detection performance significantly.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a clean, yet effective, model for word sense
disambiguation. Our approach leverage a bidirectional long short-term memory
network which is shared between all words. This enables the model to share
statistical strength and to scale well with vocabulary size. The model is
trained end-to-end, directly from the raw text to sense labels, and makes
effective use of word order. We evaluate our approach on two standard datasets,
using identical hyperparameter settings, which are in turn tuned on a third set
of held out data. We employ no external resources (e.g. knowledge graphs,
part-of-speech tagging, etc), language specific features, or hand crafted
rules, but still achieve statistically equivalent results to the best
state-of-the-art systems, that employ no such limitations.

 <dc:description>  The Inland Revenue Services is overwhelmed with gigabyte of disk capacity
containing data about tax payers in the state. The data stored on the database
increases in size at an alarming rate. This has resulted in a data rich but
information poor situation where there is a widening gap between the explosive
growth of data and its types, and the ability to analyze and interpret it
effectively, hence the need for a new generation of automated and intelligent
tools and techniques known as investigative data mining, to look for patterns
in data. These patterns can lead to new insights, competitive advantages for
business, and tangible benefits for the State Revenue services. This research
work focuses on designing effective fraud detection and deterring architecture
using investigative data mining technique. The proposed system architecture is
designed to reason using Artificial Neural Network and Machine learning
algorithm in order to detect and deter fraudulent activities. We recommend that
the architectural framework be developed using Object Oriented Programming and
Agent Oriented Programming Languages.

 <dc:title>Universal Routing in Multi-hop Radio Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article we introduce a new model to study stability in multi-hop
wireless networks in the framework of adversarial queueing. In such a model, a
routing protocol consists of three components: a transmission policy, a
scheduling policy to select the packet to transmit form a set of packets parked
at a node, and a hearing control mechanism to coordinate transmissions with
scheduling. For such a setting, we propose a definition of universal stability
that takes into account not only the scheduling policies (as in the standard
wireline adversarial model), but also the transmission policies. First, we show
that any scheduling policy that is unstable in the classical wireline
adversarial model remains unstable in the multi-hop radio network model, even
in scenarios free of inter- ferences. Then, we show that both SIS and LIS (two
well-known universally stable scheduling policies in the wireline adversarial
model) remain stable in the multi-hop radio network model, provided a proactive
hearing control is used. In contrast, such scheduling policies turn out to be
unstable when using a reactive hearing control. However, the scheduling policy
LIS can be enforced to be universally stable provided ties are resolved in a
permanent manner. Such a situation doesn't hold in the case of SIS, which
remains unstable regardless of how ties are resolved. Furthermore, for some
transmission policies which we call regular, we also show that all scheduling
policies that are universally stable when using proactive hearing control
(which include SIS and LIS) remain universally stable when using reactive
hearing control.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new differentially-private decision forest algorithm that
minimizes both the number of queries required, and the sensitivity of those
queries. To do so, we build an ensemble of random decision trees that avoids
querying the private data except to find the majority class label in the leaf
nodes. Rather than using a count query to return the class counts like the
current state-of-the-art, we use the Exponential Mechanism to only output the
class label itself. This drastically reduces the sensitivity of the query --
often by several orders of magnitude -- which in turn reduces the amount of
noise that must be added to preserve privacy. Our improved sensitivity is
achieved by using &quot;smooth sensitivity&quot;, which takes into account the specific
data used in the query rather than assuming the worst-case scenario. We also
extend work done on the optimal depth of random decision trees to handle
continuous features, not just discrete features. This, along with several other
improvements, allows us to create a differentially private decision forest with
substantially higher predictive power than the current state-of-the-art.

 <dc:title>Alternative Technique to Asymmetry Analysis-Based Overlapping for Foot
  Ulcer Examination: Scalable Scanning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Asymmetry analysis based on the overlapping of thermal images proved able to
detect inflammation and, predict foot ulceration. This technique involves three
main steps: segmentation, geometric transformation, and overlapping. However,
the overlapping technique, which consists of subtracting the intensity levels
of the right foot from those of the left foot, can also detect false abnormal
areas if the projections of the left and right feet are not the same. In this
paper, we present an alternative technique to asymmetry analysis-based
overlapping. The proposed technique, scalable scanning, allows for an effective
comparison even if the shapes and sizes of the feet projections appear
differently in the image. The tested results show that asymmetry analysis-
based scalable scanning provides fewer false abnormal areas than does asymmetry
analysis -based overlapping.

 <dc:description>  What is the minimum amount of information and time needed to solve 2SAT? When
the instance is known, it can be solved in polynomial time, but is this also
possible without knowing the instance? Bei, Chen and Zhang (STOC '13)
considered a model where the input is accessed by proposing possible
assignments to a special oracle. This oracle, on encountering some constraint
unsatisfied by the proposal, returns only the constraint index. It turns out
that, in this model, even 1SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP.
Hence, we consider a model in which the input is accessed by proposing
probability distributions over assignments to the variables. The oracle then
returns the index of the constraint that is most likely to be violated by this
distribution. We show that the information obtained this way is sufficient to
solve 1SAT in polynomial time, even when the clauses can be repeated. For 2SAT,
as long as there are no repeated clauses, in polynomial time we can even learn
an equivalent formula for the hidden instance and hence also solve it.
Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantum regime. We show that in
this setting 1QSAT can be solved in polynomial time up to constant precision,
and 2QSAT can be learnt in polynomial time up to inverse polynomial precision.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we explore several contexts where an adversary has an upper
hand over the defender by using special hardware in an attack. These include
password processing, hard-drive protection, cryptocurrency mining, resource
sharing, code obfuscation, etc.
  We suggest memory-hard computing as a generic paradigm, where every task is
amalgamated with a certain procedure requiring intensive access to RAM both in
terms of size and (very importantly) bandwidth, so that transferring the
computation to GPU, FPGA, and even ASIC brings little or no cost reduction.
Cryptographic schemes that run in this framework become \emph{egalitarian} in
the sense that both users and attackers are equal in the price-performance
ratio conditions.
  Based on existing schemes like {Argon2} and the recent generalized-birthday
proof-of-work, we suggest a generic framework and two new schemes:
  {MTP}, a memory-hard Proof-of-Work based on the memory-hard function with
fast verification and short proofs. It can be also used for memory-hard
time-lock puzzles. {MHE}, the concept of memory-hard encryption, which utilizes
available RAM to strengthen the encryption for the low-entropy keys (allowing
to bring back 6 letter passwords).

 <dc:description>  While weighted automata provide a natural framework to express quantitative
properties, many basic properties like average response time cannot be
expressed with weighted automata. Nested weighted automata extend weighted
automata and consist of a master automaton and a set of slave automata that are
invoked by the master automaton. Nested weighted automata are strictly more
expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time can be expressed
with nested weighted automata), but the basic decision questions have higher
complexity (e.g., for deterministic automata, the emptiness question for nested
weighted automata is PSPACE-hard, whereas the corresponding complexity for
weighted automata is PTIME). We consider a natural subclass of nested weighted
automata where at any point at most a bounded number k of slave automata can be
active. We focus on automata whose master value function is the limit average.
We show that these nested weighted automata with bounded width are strictly
more expressive than weighted automata (e.g., average response time with no
overlapping requests can be expressed with bound k=1, but not with non-nested
weighted automata). We show that the complexity of the basic decision problems
(i.e., emptiness and universality) for the subclass with k constant matches the
complexity for weighted automata. Moreover, when k is part of the input given
in unary we establish PSPACE-completeness.

 <dc:title>Beyond the Ultra-Dense Barrier - Paradigm shifts on the road beyond

 <dc:creator>Zander, Jens</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It has become increasingly clear that the current design paradigm for mobile
broadband systems is not a scalable and economically feasible way to solve the
expected future 'capacity crunch', in particular in indoor locations with large
user densities. 'Moore's law', e.g. state-of-the art signal processing and
advanced antenna techniques now being researched, as well as more millimeter
wave spectrum indeed provide more capacity, but are not the answer to the 3-4
orders of magnitude more capacity at today's cost, that is needed.We argue that
solving the engineering problem of providing high data rates alone is not
sufficient. Instead we need to solve the techno-economic problem to find both
business models and scalable technical solutions that provide extreme area
capacity for a given cost and energy consumption. In this paper we will show
that achieving very high capacities is indeed feasible in indoor environments.

reconstruction quality in sparse view situations. We then derive the proximal
operators for the four best methods. We show the flexibility of our framework
by deriving solvers for two noise models: Gaussian and Poisson; and by plugging
in three powerful regularizers. We compare our framework to state of the art
methods, and show superior quality on both synthetic and real datasets.

 <dc:title>Data Recombination for Neural Semantic Parsing</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Modeling crisp logical regularities is crucial in semantic parsing, making it
difficult for neural models with no task-specific prior knowledge to achieve
good results. In this paper, we introduce data recombination, a novel framework
for injecting such prior knowledge into a model. From the training data, we
induce a high-precision synchronous context-free grammar, which captures
important conditional independence properties commonly found in semantic
parsing. We then train a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network (RNN) model
with a novel attention-based copying mechanism on datapoints sampled from this
grammar, thereby teaching the model about these structural properties. Data
recombination improves the accuracy of our RNN model on three semantic parsing
datasets, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on the standard GeoQuery
dataset for models with comparable supervision.

 <dc:description>  A key goal of computational personalized medicine is to systematically
utilize genomic and other molecular features of samples to predict drug
responses for a previously unseen sample. Such predictions are valuable for
developing hypotheses for selecting therapies tailored for individual patients.
This is especially valuable in oncology, where molecular and genetic
heterogeneity of the cells has a major impact on the response. However, the
prediction task is extremely challenging, raising the need for methods that can
effectively model and predict drug responses. In this study, we propose a novel
formulation of multi-task matrix factorization that allows selective data
integration for predicting drug responses. To solve the modeling task, we
extend the state-of-the-art kernelized Bayesian matrix factorization (KBMF)
method with component-wise multiple kernel learning. In addition, our approach
exploits the known pathway information in a novel and biologically meaningful
fashion to learn the drug response associations. Our method quantitatively
outperforms the state of the art on predicting drug responses in two publicly
available cancer data sets as well as on a synthetic data set. In addition, we
validated our model predictions with lab experiments using an in-house cancer
cell line panel. We finally show the practical applicability of the proposed
method by utilizing prior knowledge to infer pathway-drug response
associations, opening up the opportunity for elucidating drug action
mechanisms. We demonstrate that pathway-response associations can be learned by
the proposed model for the well known EGFR and MEK inhibitors.

 <dc:description>  We study dynamic matching in an infinite-horizon stochastic market. While all
agents are potentially compatible with each other, some are hard-to-match and
others are easy-to-match. Agents prefer to be matched as soon as possible and
matches are formed either bilaterally or indirectly through chains. We adopt an
asymptotic approach and compute tight bounds on the limit of waiting time of
agents under myopic policies that differ in matching technology and
prioritization.
  We find that the market composition is a key factor in the desired matching
technology and prioritization level. When hard-to-match agents arrive less
frequently than easy-to-match ones (i) bilateral matching is almost as
efficient as chains (waiting times scale similarly under both, though chains
always outperform bilateral matching by a constant factor), and (ii) assigning
priorities to hard-to-match agents improves their waiting times. When
hard-to-match agents arrive more frequently, chains are much more efficient
than bilateral matching and prioritization has no impact.
  We further conduct comparative statics on arrival rates. Somewhat
surprisingly, we find that in a heterogeneous market and under bilateral
matching, increasing arrival rate has a non-monotone effect on waiting times,
due to the fact that, under some market compositions, there is an adverse
effect of competition. Our comparative statics shed light on the impact of
merging markets and attracting altruistic agents (that initiate chains) or
easy-to-match agents.
  This work uncovers fundamental differences between heterogeneous and
homogeneous dynamic markets, and potentially helps policy makers to generate
insights on the operations of matching markets such as kidney exchange
programs.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose to learn multiple local Mahalanobis distance metrics to perform
k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification of temporal sequences. Temporal
sequences are first aligned by dynamic time warping (DTW); given the alignment
path, similarity between two sequences is measured by the DTW distance, which
is computed as the accumulated distance between matched temporal point pairs
along the alignment path. Traditionally, Euclidean metric is used for distance
computation between matched pairs, which ignores the data regularities and
might not be optimal for applications at hand. Here we propose to learn
multiple Mahalanobis metrics, such that DTW distance becomes the sum of
Mahalanobis distances. We adapt the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN)
framework to our case, and formulate multiple metric learning as a linear
programming problem. Extensive sequence classification results show that our
proposed multiple metrics learning approach is effective, insensitive to the
preceding alignment qualities, and reaches the state-of-the-art performances on
UCR time series datasets.

 <dc:description>  Natural language generation plays a critical role in spoken dialogue systems.
We present a new approach to natural language generation for task-oriented
dialogue using recurrent neural networks in an encoder-decoder framework. In
contrast to previous work, our model uses both lexicalized and delexicalized
components i.e. slot-value pairs for dialogue acts, with slots and
corresponding values aligned together. This allows our model to learn from all
available data including the slot-value pairing, rather than being restricted
to delexicalized slots. We show that this helps our model generate more natural
sentences with better grammar. We further improve our model's performance by
transferring weights learnt from a pretrained sentence auto-encoder. Human
evaluation of our best-performing model indicates that it generates sentences
which users find more appealing.

 <dc:description>  A backbone of a boolean formula $F$ is a collection $S$ of its variables for
which there is a unique partial assignment $a_S$ such that $F[a_S]$ is
satisfiable [MZK+99,WGS03]. This paper studies the nontransparency of
backbones. We show that, under the widely believed assumption that integer
factoring is hard, there exist sets of boolean formulas that have obvious,
nontrivial backbones yet finding the values, $a_S$, of those backbones is
intractable. We also show that, under the same assumption, there exist sets of
boolean formulas that obviously have large backbones yet producing such a
backbone $S$ is intractable. Further, we show that if integer factoring is not
merely worst-case hard but is frequently hard, as is widely believed, then the
frequency of hardness in our two results is not too much less than that
frequency.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel BigEAR big data framework that employs
psychological audio processing chain (PAPC) to process smartphone-based
acoustic big data collected when the user performs social conversations in
naturalistic scenarios. The overarching goal of BigEAR is to identify moods of
the wearer from various activities such as laughing, singing, crying, arguing,
and sighing. These annotations are based on ground truth relevant for
psychologists who intend to monitor/infer the social context of individuals
coping with breast cancer. We pursued a case study on couples coping with
breast cancer to know how the conversations affect emotional and social well
being. In the state-of-the-art methods, psychologists and their team have to
hear the audio recordings for making these inferences by subjective evaluations
that not only are time-consuming and costly, but also demand manual data coding
for thousands of audio files. The BigEAR framework automates the audio
analysis. We computed the accuracy of BigEAR with respect to the ground truth
obtained from a human rater. Our approach yielded overall average accuracy of
88.76% on real-world data from couples coping with breast cancer.

 <dc:title>Sparse Spectrum Sensing in Infrastructure-less Cognitive Radio Networks

 <dc:description>  Compressive Sensing has been utilized in Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) to
exploit the sparse nature of the occupation of the primary users. Also,
distributed spectrum sensing has been proposed to tackle the wireless channel
problems, like node or link failures, rather than the common (centralized
approach) for spectrum sensing. In this paper, we propose a distributed
spectrum sensing framework based on consensus algorithms where SU nodes
exchange their binary decisions to take global decisions without a fusion
center to coordinate the sensing process. Each SU will share its decision with
its neighbors, and at every new iteration each SU will take a new decision
based on its current decision and the decisions it receives from its neighbors;
in the next iteration, each SU will share its new decision with its neighbors.
We show via simulations that the detection performance can tend to the
performance of majority rule Fusion Center based CRNs.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the benefits of exploring different topologies with
equal connectivity measure, or iso-connectivity topologies, in relation to the
multiagent system dynamics. The level of global information sharing ability
among agents in a multi-agent network can be quantified by a connectivity
measure, called as the Algebraic Connectivity of the associated graph
consisting of point-mass agents as nodes and inter-connection links between
them as edges. Distinct topologies with the same connectivity play profound
role in multi-agent dynamics as they offer various ways to reorganize agents
locations according to the requirement during a cooperative mission, without
sacrificing the information exchange capability of the entire network.
Determination of the distinct multi-agent graphs with identical connectivity is
a multimodal problem, in other words, there exist multiple graphs that share
the same connectivity. We present analytical solutions of determining distinct
graphs with identical connectivity. A family of isospectral graphs are found
out by utilizing an appropriate similarity transformation. Moreover, a zone of
no connectivity change in a dense graph is unraveled where an agent can move
freely without causing any change in the global connectivity. The proposed
solutions are validated with the help of sufficient examples.

 <dc:description>  Imagine coating buildings and bridges with smart particles (also coined smart
paint) that monitor structural integrity and sense and report on traffic and
wind loads, leading to technology that could do such inspection jobs faster and
cheaper and increase safety at the same time. In this paper, we study the
problem of uniformly coating objects of arbitrary shape in the context of
self-organizing programmable matter, i.e., programmable matter which consists
of simple computational elements called particles that can establish and
release bonds and can actively move in a self-organized way. Particles are
anonymous, have constant-size memory, and utilize only local interactions in
order to coat an object. We continue the study of our Universal Coating
algorithm by focusing on its runtime analysis, showing that our algorithm
terminates within a linear number of rounds with high probability. We also
present a matching linear lower bound that holds with high probability. We use
this lower bound to show a linear lower bound on the competitive gap between
fully local coating algorithms and coating algorithms that rely on global
information, which implies that our algorithm is also optimal in a competitive
sense. Simulation results show that the competitive ratio of our algorithm may
be better than linear in practice.

 <dc:description>  Multi-language virtual machines have a number of advantages. They allow
software developers to use software libraries that were written for different
programming languages. Furthermore, language implementors do not have to bother
with low-level VM functionality and their implementation can benefit from
optimizations in existing virtual machines. MagLev is an implementation of the
Ruby programming language on top of the GemStone/S virtual machine for the
Smalltalk programming language. In this work, we present how software
components written in both languages can interact. We show how MagLev unifies
the Smalltalk and the Ruby object model, taking into account Smalltalk meta
classes, Ruby singleton classes, and Ruby modules. Besides, we show how we can
call Ruby methods from Smalltalk and vice versa. We also present MagLev's
concept of bridge methods for implementing Ruby method calling conventions.
Finally, we compare our solution to other language implementations and virtual
machines.

 <dc:title>Training Recurrent Answering Units with Joint Loss Minimization for VQA</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Noh, Hyeonwoo</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Han, Bohyung</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel algorithm for visual question answering based on a
recurrent deep neural network, where every module in the network corresponds to
a complete answering unit with attention mechanism by itself. The network is
optimized by minimizing loss aggregated from all the units, which share model
parameters while receiving different information to compute attention
probability. For training, our model attends to a region within image feature
map, updates its memory based on the question and attended image feature, and
answers the question based on its memory state. This procedure is performed to
compute loss in each step. The motivation of this approach is our observation
that multi-step inferences are often required to answer questions while each
problem may have a unique desirable number of steps, which is difficult to
identify in practice. Hence, we always make the first unit in the network solve
problems, but allow it to learn the knowledge from the rest of units by
backpropagation unless it degrades the model. To implement this idea, we
early-stop training each unit as soon as it starts to overfit. Note that, since
more complex models tend to overfit on easier questions quickly, the last
answering unit in the unfolded recurrent neural network is typically killed
first while the first one remains last. We make a single-step prediction for a
new question using the shared model. This strategy works better than the other
options within our framework since the selected model is trained effectively
from all units without overfitting. The proposed algorithm outperforms other
multi-step attention based approaches using a single step prediction in VQA
dataset.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes InfoGAN, an information-theoretic extension to the
Generative Adversarial Network that is able to learn disentangled
representations in a completely unsupervised manner. InfoGAN is a generative
adversarial network that also maximizes the mutual information between a small
subset of the latent variables and the observation. We derive a lower bound to
the mutual information objective that can be optimized efficiently, and show
that our training procedure can be interpreted as a variation of the Wake-Sleep
algorithm. Specifically, InfoGAN successfully disentangles writing styles from
digit shapes on the MNIST dataset, pose from lighting of 3D rendered images,
and background digits from the central digit on the SVHN dataset. It also
discovers visual concepts that include hair styles, presence/absence of
eyeglasses, and emotions on the CelebA face dataset. Experiments show that
InfoGAN learns interpretable representations that are competitive with
representations learned by existing fully supervised methods.

 <dc:description>  Choosing a good location when opening a new store is crucial for the future
success of a business. Traditional methods include offline manual survey, which
is very time consuming, and analytic models based on census data, which are un-
able to adapt to the dynamic market. The rapid increase of the availability of
big data from various types of mobile devices, such as online query data and
offline positioning data, provides us with the possibility to develop automatic
and accurate data-driven prediction models for business store placement. In
this paper, we propose a Demand Distribution Driven Store Placement (D3SP)
framework for business store placement by mining search query data from Baidu
Maps. D3SP first detects the spatial-temporal distributions of customer demands
on different business services via query data from Baidu Maps, the largest
online map search engine in China, and detects the gaps between demand and sup-
ply. Then we determine candidate locations via clustering such gaps. In the
final stage, we solve the location optimization problem by predicting and
ranking the number of customers. We not only deploy supervised regression
models to predict the number of customers, but also learn to rank models to
directly rank the locations. We evaluate our framework on various types of
businesses in real-world cases, and the experiments results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods. D3SP as the core function for store placement has
already been implemented as a core component of our business analytics platform
and could be potentially used by chain store merchants on Baidu Nuomi.

broadcast, conditional unicast and data structures, which are essential
features for the modelling of network protocols. In this framework we model and

contrary to claims in the literature, it fails to be loop free. We also present
boundary conditions for a fix ensuring that the resulting protocol is indeed

 <dc:description>  We integrate a wireless powered communication network with a cooperative
cognitive radio network, where multiple secondary users (SUs) powered
wirelessly by a hybrid access point (HAP) help a primary user relay the data.
As a reward for the cooperation, the secondary network gains the spectrum
access where SUs transmit to HAP using time division multiple access. To
maximize the sum-throughput of SUs, we present a secondary sum-throughput
optimal resource allocation (STORA) scheme. Under the constraint of meeting
target primary rate, the STORA scheme chooses the optimal set of relaying SUs
and jointly performs the time and energy allocation for SUs. Specifically, by
exploiting the structure of the optimal solution, we find the order in which
SUs are prioritized to relay primary data. Since the STORA scheme focuses on
the sum-throughput, it becomes inconsiderate towards individual SU throughput,
resulting in low fairness. To enhance fairness, we investigate three resource
allocation schemes, which are (i) equal time allocation, (ii) minimum
throughput maximization, and (iii) proportional time allocation. Simulation
results reveal the trade-off between sum-throughput and fairness. The minimum
throughput maximization scheme is the fairest one as each SU gets the same
throughput, but yields the least SU sum-throughput.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an online popularity prediction and tracking task as a benchmark
task for reinforcement learning with a combinatorial, natural language action
space. A specified number of discussion threads predicted to be popular are
recommended, chosen from a fixed window of recent comments to track. Novel deep
reinforcement learning architectures are studied for effective modeling of the
value function associated with actions comprised of interdependent sub-actions.
The proposed model, which represents dependence between sub-actions through a
bi-directional LSTM, gives the best performance across different experimental
configurations and domains, and it also generalizes well with varying numbers
of recommendation requests.

 <dc:description>  The homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) is widely used to model spatial
distribution of base stations and mobile terminals. The same process can be
used to model underlay device-to-device (D2D) network, however, neglecting
homophilic relation for D2D pairing presents underestimated system insights. In
this paper, we model both spatial and social distributions of interfering D2D
nodes as proximity based independently marked homogeneous Poisson point
process. The proximity considers physical distance between D2D nodes whereas
social relationship is modeled as Zipf based marks. We apply these two
paradigms to analyze the effect of interference on coverage probability of
distance-proportional power-controlled cellular user. Effectively, we apply two
type of functional mappings (physical distance, social marks) to Laplace
functional of PPP. The resulting coverage probability has no closed-form
expression, however for a subset of social marks, the mark summation converges
to digamma and polygamma functions. This subset constitutes the upper and lower
bounds on coverage probability. We present numerical evaluation of these bounds
on coverage probability by varying number of different parameters. The results
show that by imparting simple power control on cellular user, ultra-dense
underlay D2D network can be realized without compromising the coverage
probability of cellular user.

 <dc:description>  Sky/cloud images captured by ground-based cameras (a.k.a. whole sky imagers)
are increasingly used nowadays because of their applications in a number of
fields, including climate modeling, weather prediction, renewable energy
generation, and satellite communications. Due to the wide variety of cloud
types and lighting conditions in such images, accurate and robust segmentation
of clouds is challenging. In this paper, we present a supervised segmentation
framework for ground-based sky/cloud images based on a systematic analysis of
different color spaces and components, using partial least squares (PLS)
regression. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, our proposed approach is
entirely learning-based and does not require any manually-defined parameters.
In addition, we release the Singapore Whole Sky IMaging SEGmentation Database
(SWIMSEG), a large database of annotated sky/cloud images, to the research
community.

 <dc:description>  Electronic microscopy has been used for morphology evaluation of different
materials structures. However, microscopy results may be affected by several
factors. Image processing methods can be used to correct and improve the
quality of these results. In this paper we propose an algorithm based on
starlets to perform the segmentation of scanning electron microscopy images. An
application is presented in order to locate gold nanoparticles in natural
rubber membranes. In this application, our method showed accuracy greater than
85% for all test images. Results given by this method will be used in future
studies, to computationally estimate the density distribution of gold
nanoparticles in natural rubber samples and to predict reduction kinetics of
gold nanoparticles at different time periods.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we will investigate the efficacy of IMAT (Iterative Method of
Adaptive Thresholding) in recovering the sparse signal (parameters) for linear
models with missing data. Sparse recovery rises in compressed sensing and
machine learning problems and has various applications necessitating viable
reconstruction methods specifically when we work with big data. This paper will
focus on comparing the power of IMAT in reconstruction of the desired sparse
signal with LASSO. Additionally, we will assume the model has random missing
information. Missing data has been recently of interest in big data and machine
learning problems since they appear in many cases including but not limited to
medical imaging datasets, hospital datasets, and massive MIMO. The dominance of
IMAT over the well-known LASSO will be taken into account in different
scenarios. Simulations and numerical results are also provided to verify the
arguments.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The paper investigates a new type of truly critical echo state networks where
individual transfer functions for every neuron can be modified to anticipate
the expected next input. Deviations from expected input are only forgotten
slowly in power law fashion. The paper outlines the theory, numerically
analyzes a one neuron model network and finally discusses technical and also
biological implications of this type of approach.

 <dc:title>External Lexical Information for Multilingual Part-of-Speech Tagging</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Morphosyntactic lexicons and word vector representations have both proven
useful for improving the accuracy of statistical part-of-speech taggers. Here
we compare the performances of four systems on datasets covering 16 languages,
two of these systems being feature-based (MEMMs and CRFs) and two of them being
neural-based (bi-LSTMs). We show that, on average, all four approaches perform
similarly and reach state-of-the-art results. Yet better performances are
obtained with our feature-based models on lexically richer datasets (e.g. for
morphologically rich languages), whereas neural-based results are higher on
datasets with less lexical variability (e.g. for English). These conclusions
hold in particular for the MEMM models relying on our system MElt, which
benefited from newly designed features. This shows that, under certain
conditions, feature-based approaches enriched with morphosyntactic lexicons are
competitive with respect to neural methods.

 <dc:description>  We present a new framework for online Least Squares algorithms for nonlinear
modeling in RKH spaces (RKHS). Instead of implicitly mapping the data to a RKHS
(e.g., kernel trick), we map the data to a finite dimensional Euclidean space,
using random features of the kernel's Fourier transform. The advantage is that,
the inner product of the mapped data approximates the kernel function. The
resulting &quot;linear&quot; algorithm does not require any form of sparsification,
since, in contrast to all existing algorithms, the solution's size remains
fixed and does not increase with the iteration steps. As a result, the obtained
algorithms are computationally significantly more efficient compared to
previously derived variants, while, at the same time, they converge at similar
speeds and to similar error floors.

 <dc:description>  The classical Dirac theorem asserts that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with
minimum degree $\delta(G) \ge \lceil n/2 \rceil$ is Hamiltonian. The lower
bound of $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ on the minimum degree of a graph is tight. In this
paper, we extend the classical Dirac theorem to the case where $\delta(G) \ge
\lfloor n/2 \rfloor $ by identifying the only non-Hamiltonian graph families in
this case. We first present a short and simple proof. We then provide an
alternative proof that is constructive and self-contained. Consequently, we
provide a polynomial-time algorithm that constructs a Hamiltonian cycle, if
exists, of a graph $G$ with $\delta(G) \ge \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$, or determines
that the graph is non-Hamiltonian. Finally, we present a self-contained proof
for our algorithm which provides insight into the structure of Hamiltonian
cycles when $\delta(G) \ge \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$ and is promising for extending
the results of this paper to the cases with smaller degree bounds.

statistical distribution of the nearest neighbour distance in hard-core point
processes. We apply this framework to Mat\'{e}rn hard-core point process (MHC)
to derive the cumulative distribution function of the contact distance in three
cases. The first case is between a point in an MHC process and its nearest
neighbour from the same process. The second case is between a point in an
independent Poisson point process and the nearest neighbour from an MHC
process. The third case is between a point in the complement of an MHC process
and its sibling MHC process. We test the analytic results against Monte-Carlo
simulations to verify their consistency.

 <dc:description>  IT governance, like global governance of projects, requires cooperation
between several actors. In general, such cooperation builds a collaboration
network between entities. Many works in the literature interested in
collaboration network, but no one of them were focused directly on how to build
a network in an IT governance perspective. In this paper, we investigate how
game theory can be exploited to provide a formal implementation of Cost
Management Process, while highlighting Actor-Network as a framework of
collaboration and its incentive stage as a key step for network construction.
Our objective is to propose an approach of network establishment, by inciting
actors through cost savings. For that, we use Shapley Value to answer the
question: For the sake of IT governance, which coalitions are likely to form in
order to ensure best cost-saving objectives in ANT mode of collaboration? A
graphical tool is developed also to visualize and simulate networks evolution.

 <dc:description>  The main challenges in large-scale people tracking are the recognition of
people density in a specific area and tracking the people flow path. To address
these challenges, we present SenseFlow, a lightweight people tracking system.
SenseFlow utilises off-the-shelf devices which sniff probe requests
periodically polled by user's smartphones in a passive manner. We demonstrate
the feasibility of SenseFlow by building a proof-of-concept prototype and
undertaking extensive evaluations in real-world settings. We deploy the system
in one laboratory to study office hours of researchers, a crowded public area
in city to evaluate the scalability and performance &quot;in the wild&quot;, and four
classrooms in the university to monitor the number of students. We also

 <dc:title>Automated Space/Time Scaling of Streaming Task Graph</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Omidian, Hossein</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Lemieux, Guy G. F.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a high-level synthesis (HLS) tool that
automatically allows area/throughput trade-offs for implementing streaming task
graphs (STG). Our tool targets a massively parallel processor array (MPPA)
architecture, very similar to the Ambric MPPA chip architecture, which is to be
implemented as an FPGA overlay. Similar to Ambric tools, our HLS tool accepts a
STG as input written in a subset of Java and a structural language in the style
of a Kahn Processing Network (KPN). Unlike the Ambric tools, our HLS tool
analyzes the parallelism internal to each Java &quot;node&quot; and evaluates the
throughput and area of several possible implementations. It then analyzes the
full graph for bottlenecks or excess compute capacity, selects an
implementation for each node, and even considers replicating or splitting nodes
while either minimizing area (for a fixed throughput target), or maximizing
throughput (for a fixed area target). In addition to traditional node selection
and replication methods used in prior work, we have uniquely implemented node
combining and splitting to find a better area/throughput trade-off. We present
two optimization approaches, a formal ILP formulation and a heuristic solution.
Results show that the heuristic is more flexible and can find design points not
available to the ILP, thereby achieving superior results.

 <dc:description>  Semantic mapping is the incremental process of &quot;mapping&quot; relevant information
of the world (i.e., spatial information, temporal events, agents and actions)
to a formal description supported by a reasoning engine. Current research
focuses on learning the semantic of environments based on their spatial
location, geometry and appearance. Many methods to tackle this problem have
been proposed, but the lack of a uniform representation, as well as standard
benchmarking suites, prevents their direct comparison. In this paper, we
propose a standardization in the representation of semantic maps, by defining
an easily extensible formalism to be used on top of metric maps of the
environments. Based on this, we describe the procedure to build a dataset
(based on real sensor data) for benchmarking semantic mapping techniques, also
hypothesizing some possible evaluation metrics. Nevertheless, by providing a
tool for the construction of a semantic map ground truth, we aim at the
contribution of the scientific community in acquiring data for populating the
dataset.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the feature correspondences
among a collection of feature sets, by using their point-wise unary features.
This is a fundamental problem in computer vision and pattern recognition, which
also closely relates to other areas such as operational research. Different
from two-set matching which can be transformed to a quadratic assignment
programming task that is known NP-hard, inclusion of merely unary attributes
leads to a linear assignment problem for matching two feature sets. This
problem has been well studied and there are effective polynomial global optimum
solvers such as the Hungarian method. However, it becomes ill-posed when the
unary attributes are (heavily) corrupted. The global optimal correspondence
concerning the best score defined by the attribute affinity/cost between the
two sets can be distinct to the ground truth correspondence since the score
function is biased by noises. To combat this issue, we devise a method for
matching a collection of feature sets by synergetically exploring the
information across the sets. In general, our method can be perceived from a
(constrained) clustering perspective: in each iteration, it assigns the
features of one set to the clusters formed by the rest of feature sets, and
updates the cluster centers in turn. Results on both synthetic data and real
images suggest the efficacy of our method against state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:title>Enhancement of Low-cost GNSS Localization in Connected Vehicle Networks

 <dc:description>  An essential function for automated vehicle technologies is accurate
localization. It is difficult, however, to achieve lane-level accuracy with
low-cost Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers due to the biased
noisy pseudo-range measurements. Approaches such as Differential GNSS can
improve the accuracy, but usually require an enormous amount of investment in
base stations. The emerging connected vehicle technologies provide an
alternative approach to improving the localization accuracy. It has been shown
in this paper that localization accuracy can be enhanced by fusing GNSS
information within a group of connected vehicles and matching the configuration
of the group to a digital map to eliminate the common bias in localization. A
Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) was used to jointly estimate the
common biases of the pseudo-ranges and the vehicles positions. Multipath
biases, which are non-common to vehicles, were mitigated by a multi-hypothesis
detection-rejection approach. The temporal correlation was exploited through
the prediction-update process. The proposed approach was compared to the
existing static and smoothed static methods in the intersection scenario.
Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduced the estimation
error by fifty percent and reduced the estimation variance by two orders of
magnitude.

public transportation in a city via the mining of complex networks representing
the supply and demand of public transport. We show how to build these networks
based upon data on smart card use in buses via the application of algorithms
that estimate an OD and reconstruct the complete itinerary of the passengers.
The overlapping of the two networks sheds light in potential overload and waste
in the offer of resources that can be mitigated with strategies for balancing

 <dc:description>  Similarity search is a key to a variety of applications including
content-based search for images and video, recommendation systems, data
deduplication, natural language processing, computer vision, databases,
computational biology, and computer graphics. At its core, similarity search
manifests as k-nearest neighbors (kNN), a computationally simple primitive
consisting of highly parallel distance calculations and a global top-k sort.
However, kNN is poorly supported by today's architectures because of its high
memory bandwidth requirements.
  This paper proposes an application-driven near-data processing accelerator
for similarity search: the Similarity Search Associative Memory (SSAM). By
instantiating compute units close to memory, SSAM benefits from the higher
memory bandwidth and density exposed by emerging memory technologies. We
evaluate the SSAM design down to layout on top of the Micron hybrid memory cube
(HMC), and show that SSAM can achieve up to two orders of magnitude
area-normalized throughput and energy efficiency improvement over multicore
CPUs; we also show SSAM is faster and more energy efficient than competing GPUs
and FPGAs. Finally, we show that SSAM is also useful for other data intensive
tasks like kNN index construction, and can be generalized to semantically
function as a high capacity content addressable memory.

 <dc:title>Location Based Performance Model for Indoor mmWave Wearable

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Simultaneous use of high-end wearable wireless devices like smart glasses is
challenging in a dense indoor environment due to the high nature of
interference. In this scenario, the millimeter wave (mmWave) band offers
promising potential for achieving gigabits per second throughput. Here we
propose a novel system model for analyzing system performance of mmWave based
communication among wearables. The proposed model accounts for the non-isotropy
of the indoor environment and the effects of reflections that are predominant
for indoor mmWave signals. The effect of human body blockages are modeled and
the system performance is shown to hugely vary depending on the user location,
body orientation and the density of the network. Closed form expressions for
spatially averaged signal to interference plus noise ratio distribution are
also derived as a function of the location and orientation of a reference user.

 <dc:description>  A straight-line drawing of a graph $G$ is a mapping which assigns to each
vertex a point in the plane and to each edge a straight-line segment connecting
the corresponding two points. The rectilinear crossing number of a graph $G$,
$\overline{cr}(G)$, is the minimum number of crossing edges in any
straight-line drawing of $G$. Determining or estimating $\overline{cr}(G)$
appears to be a difficult problem, and deciding if $\overline{cr}(G)\leq k$ is
known to be NP-hard. In fact, the asymptotic behavior of $\overline{cr}(K_n)$
is still unknown.
  In this paper, we present a deterministic $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithm that
finds a straight-line drawing of any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with
$\overline{cr}(G) + o(n^4)$ crossing edges. Together with the well-known
Crossing Lemma due to Ajtai et al. and Leighton, this result implies that for
any dense $n$-vertex graph $G$, one can efficiently find a straight-line
drawing of $G$ with $(1 + o(1))\overline{cr}(G)$ crossing edges.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel online capable method for simultaneous estimation
of human motion in terms of segment orientations and positions along with
sensor-to-segment calibration parameters from inertial sensors attached to the
body. In order to solve this ill-posed estimation problem, state-of-the-art
motion, measurement and biomechanical models are combined with new stochastic
equations and priors. These are based on the kinematics of multi-body systems,
anatomical and body shape information, as well as, parameter properties for
regularisation. This leads to a constrained weighted least squares problem that
is solved in a sliding window fashion. Magnetometer information is currently
only used for initialisation, while the estimation itself works without
magnetometers. The method was tested on simulated, as well as, on real data,
captured from a lower body configuration.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel method, the adaptive local window, for improving level set
segmentation technique. The window is estimated separately for each contour
point, over iterations of the segmentation process, and for each individual
object. Our method considers the object scale, the spatial texture, and changes
of the energy functional over iterations. Global and local statistics are
considered by calculating several gray level co-occurrence matrices. We
demonstrate the capabilities of the method in the domain of medical imaging for
segmenting 233 images with liver lesions. To illustrate the strength of our
method, those images were obtained by either Computed Tomography or Magnetic
Resonance Imaging. Moreover, we analyzed images using three different energy
models. We compare our method to a global level set segmentation and to local
framework that uses predefined fixed-size square windows. The results indicate
that our proposed method outperforms the other methods in terms of agreement
with the manual marking and dependence on contour initialization or the energy
model used. In case of complex lesions, such as low contrast lesions,
heterogeneous lesions, or lesions with a noisy background, our method shows
significantly better segmentation with an improvement of 0.25+- 0.13 in Dice
similarity coefficient, compared with state of the art fixed-size local windows
(Wilcoxon, p &lt; 0.001).

 <dc:description>  Co-segmentation is the automatic extraction of the common semantic regions
given a set of images. Different from previous approaches mainly based on
object visuals, in this paper, we propose a human centred object
co-segmentation approach, which uses the human as another strong evidence. In
order to discover the rich internal structure of the objects reflecting their
human-object interactions and visual similarities, we propose an unsupervised
fully connected CRF auto-encoder incorporating the rich object features and a
novel human-object interaction representation. We propose an efficient learning
and inference algorithm to allow the full connectivity of the CRF with the
auto-encoder, that establishes pairwise relations on all pairs of the object
proposals in the dataset. Moreover, the auto-encoder learns the parameters from
the data itself rather than supervised learning or manually assigned parameters
in the conventional CRF. In the extensive experiments on four datasets, we show
that our approach is able to extract the common objects more accurately than
the state-of-the-art co-segmentation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Learning Analytics is an emerging field in the vast areas of Educational
Technology and Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL). It provides tools and
techniques that offer researchers the ability to analyze, study, and benchmark
institutions, learners and teachers as well as online learning environments
such as MOOCs. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are considered to be a very
active and an innovative form of bringing educational content to a broad
community. Due to the reasons of being free and accessible to the public, MOOCs
attracted a large number of heterogeneous learners who differ in education
level, gender, and age. However, there are pressing demands to adjust the
quality of the hosted courses, as well as controlling the high dropout ratio
and the lack of interaction. With the help of Learning Analytics, it is
possible to contain such issues. In this publication, we discuss the principles
of engaging Learning Analytics in MOOCs learning environments and review its
potential and capabilities (the good), constraints (the bad), and fallacy
analytics (the ugly) based on our experience in last years.

 <dc:description>  One of the core components of modern spoken dialogue systems is the belief
tracker, which estimates the user's goal at every step of the dialogue.
However, most current approaches have difficulty scaling to larger, more
complex dialogue domains. This is due to their dependency on either: a) Spoken
Language Understanding models that require large amounts of annotated training
data; or b) hand-crafted lexicons for capturing some of the linguistic
variation in users' language. We propose a novel Neural Belief Tracking (NBT)
framework which overcomes these problems by building on recent advances in
representation learning. NBT models reason over pre-trained word vectors,
learning to compose them into distributed representations of user utterances
and dialogue context. Our evaluation on two datasets shows that this approach
surpasses past limitations, matching the performance of state-of-the-art models
which rely on hand-crafted semantic lexicons and outperforming them when such
lexicons are not provided.

 <dc:description>  Presented herein is a novel model for similar question ranking within
collaborative question answer platforms. The presented approach integrates a
regression stage to relate topics derived from questions to those derived from
question-answer pairs. This helps to avoid problems caused by the differences
in vocabulary used within questions and answers, and the tendency for questions
to be shorter than answers. The performance of the model is shown to outperform
translation methods and topic modelling (without regression) on several
real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  We describe MITRE's submission to the SemEval-2016 Task 6, Detecting Stance
in Tweets. This effort achieved the top score in Task A on supervised stance
detection, producing an average F1 score of 67.8 when assessing whether a tweet
author was in favor or against a topic. We employed a recurrent neural network
initialized with features learned via distant supervision on two large
unlabeled datasets. We trained embeddings of words and phrases with the
word2vec skip-gram method, then used those features to learn sentence
representations via a hashtag prediction auxiliary task. These sentence vectors
were then fine-tuned for stance detection on several hundred labeled examples.
The result was a high performing system that used transfer learning to maximize
the value of the available training data.

 <dc:description>  The evaluation and treatment of acute cerebral ischemia requires a technique
that can determine the total area of tissue at risk for infarction using
diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. Typical MRI data sets
consist of T1- and T2-weighted imaging (T1WI, T2WI) along with advanced MRI
parameters of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion weighted imaging
(PWI) methods. Each of these parameters has distinct radiological-pathological
meaning. For example, DWI interrogates the movement of water in the tissue and
PWI gives an estimate of the blood flow, both are critical measures during the
evolution of stroke. In order to integrate these data and give an estimate of
the tissue at risk or damaged, we have developed advanced machine learning
methods based on unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction (NLDR)
techniques. NLDR methods are a class of algorithms that uses mathematically
defined manifolds for statistical sampling of multidimensional classes to
generate a discrimination rule of guaranteed statistical accuracy and they can
generate a two- or three-dimensional map, which represents the prominent
structures of the data and provides an embedded image of meaningful
low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. In
this manuscript, we develop NLDR methods on high dimensional MRI data sets of
preclinical animals and clinical patients with stroke. On analyzing the
performance of these methods, we observed that there was a high of similarity
between multiparametric embedded images from NLDR methods and the ADC map and
perfusion map. It was also observed that embedded scattergram of abnormal
(infarcted or at risk) tissue can be visualized and provides a mechanism for
automatic methods to delineate potential stroke volumes and early tissue at
risk.

 <dc:description>  We present a deep convolutional neural network for estimating the relative
homography between a pair of images. Our feed-forward network has 10 layers,
takes two stacked grayscale images as input, and produces an 8 degree of
freedom homography which can be used to map the pixels from the first image to
the second. We present two convolutional neural network architectures for
HomographyNet: a regression network which directly estimates the real-valued
homography parameters, and a classification network which produces a
distribution over quantized homographies. We use a 4-point homography
parameterization which maps the four corners from one image into the second
image. Our networks are trained in an end-to-end fashion using warped MS-COCO
images. Our approach works without the need for separate local feature
detection and transformation estimation stages. Our deep models are compared to
a traditional homography estimator based on ORB features and we highlight the
scenarios where HomographyNet outperforms the traditional technique. We also
describe a variety of applications powered by deep homography estimation, thus
showcasing the flexibility of a deep learning approach.

 <dc:title>Optimal Queue Length in Torus Networks with Traffic Signals</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Inspired by the need for efficient traffic control in urban areas, we study
the problem of minimizing the longest queue length in traffic networks. In our
model cars only move forward and do not overtake each other and time is divided
in rounds of a given length. Cars always cross intersections when they have the
green signal and they are at the front of the queue, otherwise they wait. Each
car can cross at most one intersection in each round. The only means to control
the movement of the cars is by scheduling the green times at the junctions,
that allow cars to cross. The objective is to determine the green time
schedules to reach a pattern that attains the social optimum, i.e., the minimum
possible longest queue length in the network.
  We study this problem in an oriented torus of dimension $n\times n$ where
each horizontal and vertical ring has $kn$ cars arbitrarily deployed. We
introduce the concept of conflict graphs that represent the propagated negative
impact across the network when -through green time assignments - the queue
length in one segment is reduced. Using these graphs, we provide a lower bound
on the longest queue length that any algorithm can attain and show that
maximizing the number of cars that cross the intersections in every round can
prevent reaching the minimum possible longest queue length. Next, we propose a
quadratic running time algorithm that minimizes the longest queue length in
each round assuming that the number of cars in each queue is at least the size
of the round. Our technique is based on network flooding on the conflict
graphs. Finally, we propose an algorithm that guarantees that the cars
eventually form a social optimum queue length at the expense of having some
green times where no cars cross an intersection.

 <dc:description>  Often, when dealing with real-world recognition problems, we do not need, and
often cannot have, knowledge of the entire set of possible classes that might
appear during operational testing. Moreover, sometimes some of these classes
may be ill-sampled, not sampled at all or undefined. In such cases, we need to
think of robust classification methods able to deal with the &quot;unknown&quot; and
properly reject samples belonging to classes never seen during training.
Notwithstanding, almost all existing classifiers to date were mostly developed
for the closed-set scenario, i.e., the classification setup in which it is
assumed that all test samples belong to one of the classes with which the
classifier was trained. In the open-set scenario, however, a test sample can
belong to none of the known classes and the classifier must properly reject it
by classifying it as unknown. In this work, we extend upon the well-known
Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier and introduce the Specialized Support
Vector Machine (SSVM), which is suitable for recognition in open-set setups.
SSVM balances the empirical risk and the risk of the unknown and ensures that
the region of the feature space in which a test sample would be classified as
known (one of the known classes) is always bounded, ensuring a finite risk of
the unknown. The same cannot be guaranteed by the traditional SVM formulation,
even when using the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. In this work, we also
highlight the properties of the SVM classifier related to the open-set
scenario, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an RBF SVM to
have bounded open-space risk. An extensive set of experiments compares the
proposed method with existing solutions in the literature for open-set
recognition and the reported results show its effectiveness.

 <dc:title>Why Nominal-Typing Matters in OOP</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>AbdelGawad, Moez A.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The statements `inheritance is not subtyping' and `mainstream OO languages
unnecessarily place restrictions over inheritance' have rippled as mantras
through the PL research community for years. Many mainstream OO developers and
OO language designers however do not accept these statements. In
\emph{nominally-typed} OO languages that these developers and language
designers are dearly familiar with, inheritance simply is subtyping; and they
believe OO type inheritance is an inherently nominal notion not a structural
one.
  Nominally-typed OO languages are among the most used programming languages
today. However, the value of nominal typing to mainstream OO developers, as a
means for designing robust OO software, seems to be in wait for full
appreciation among PL researchers--thereby perpetuating an unnecessary schism
between many OO developers and language designers and many OO PL researchers,
with each side discounting, if not even disregarding, the views of the other.
  In this essay we strengthen earlier efforts to demonstrate the semantic value
of nominal typing by presenting a technical comparison between nominal OO type
systems and structural OO type systems. Recently, a domain-theoretic model of
nominally-typed OOP was compared to well-known models of structurally-typed
OOP. Combined, these comparisons provide a clear and deep account for the
relation between nominal and structural OO type systems that has not been
presented before, and they help demonstrate the key value of nominal typing and
nominal subtyping to OO developers and language designers.
  We believe a clearer understanding of the key semantic advantage of pure
nominal OO typing over pure structural OO typing can help remedy the existing
schism. We believe future foundational OO PL research, to further its relevance
to mainstream OOP, should be based less on structural models of OOP and more on
nominal ones instead.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of how to optimize multi-stage campaigning over
social networks. The dynamic programming framework is employed to balance the
high present reward and large penalty on low future outcome in the presence of
extensive uncertainties. In particular, we establish theoretical foundations of
optimal campaigning over social networks where the user activities are modeled
as a multivariate Hawkes process, and we derive a time dependent linear
relation between the intensity of exogenous events and several commonly used
objective functions of campaigning. We further develop a convex dynamic
programming framework for determining the optimal intervention policy that
prescribes the required level of external drive at each stage for the desired
campaigning result. Experiments on both synthetic data and the real-world
MemeTracker dataset show that our algorithm can steer the user activities for
optimal campaigning much more accurately than baselines.

 <dc:description>  The production of color language is essential for grounded language
generation. Color descriptions have many challenging properties: they can be
vague, compositionally complex, and denotationally rich. We present an
effective approach to generating color descriptions using recurrent neural
networks and a Fourier-transformed color representation. Our model outperforms
previous work on a conditional language modeling task over a large corpus of
naturalistic color descriptions. In addition, probing the model's output
reveals that it can accurately produce not only basic color terms but also
descriptors with non-convex denotations (&quot;greenish&quot;), bare modifiers (&quot;bright&quot;,
&quot;dull&quot;), and compositional phrases (&quot;faded teal&quot;) not seen in training.

 <dc:description>  Community detection has attracted considerable attention crossing many areas
as it can be used for discovering the structure and features of complex
networks. With the increasing size of social networks in real world, community
detection approaches should be fast and accurate. The Label Propagation
Algorithm (LPA) is known to be one of the near-linear solutions and benefits of
easy implementation, thus it forms a good basis for efficient community
detection methods. In this paper, we extend the update rule and propagation
criterion of LPA in the framework of belief functions. A new community
detection approach, called Evidential Label Propagation (ELP), is proposed as
an enhanced version of conventional LPA. The node influence is first defined to
guide the propagation process. The plausibility is used to determine the domain
label of each node. The update order of nodes is discussed to improve the
robustness of the method. ELP algorithm will converge after the domain labels
of all the nodes become unchanged. The mass assignments are calculated finally
as memberships of nodes. The overlapping nodes and outliers can be detected
simultaneously through the proposed method. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of ELP.

 <dc:description>  In multi-camera video surveillance, it is challenging to represent videos
from different cameras properly and fuse them efficiently for specific
applications such as human activity recognition and clustering. In this paper,
a novel representation for multi-camera video data, namely the Product
Grassmann Manifold (PGM), is proposed to model video sequences as points on the
Grassmann manifold and integrate them as a whole in the product manifold form.
Additionally, with a new geometry metric on the product manifold, the
conventional Low Rank Representation (LRR) model is extended onto PGM and the
new LRR model can be used for clustering non-linear data, such as multi-camera
video data. To evaluate the proposed method, a number of clustering experiments
are conducted on several multi-camera video datasets of human activity,
including Dongzhimen Transport Hub Crowd action dataset, ACT 42 Human action
dataset and SKIG action dataset. The experiment results show that the proposed
method outperforms many state-of-the-art clustering methods.

 <dc:description>  The use of convex regularizers allows for easy optimization, though they
often produce biased estimation and inferior prediction performance. Recently,
nonconvex regularizers have attracted a lot of attention and outperformed
convex ones. However, the resultant optimization problem is much harder. In
this paper, for a large class of nonconvex regularizers, we propose to move the
nonconvexity from the regularizer to the loss. The nonconvex regularizer is
then transformed to a familiar convex regularizer, while the resultant loss
function can still be guaranteed to be smooth. Learning with the convexified
regularizer can be performed by existing efficient algorithms originally
designed for convex regularizers (such as the proximal algorithm, Frank-Wolfe
algorithm, alternating direction method of multipliers and stochastic gradient
descent). Extensions are made when the convexified regularizer does not have
closed-form proximal step, and when the loss function is nonconvex, nonsmooth.
Extensive experiments on a variety of machine learning application scenarios
show that optimizing the transformed problem is much faster than running the
state-of-the-art on the original problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper reports a case study on the User Experience (UX)of an industrial
robotic prototype in the context of human-robot cooperation in an automotive
assembly line. The goal was to find out what kinds of suggestions the assembly
line workers, who actually use the new robotic system, propose in order to
improve the human-robot interaction (HRI). The operators working with the
robotic prototype were interviewed three weeks after the deployment using
established UX narrative interview guidelines. Our results show that the
cooperation with a robot that executes predefined working steps actually
impedes the user in terms of flexibility and individual speed. This results in
a change of working routine for the operators, impacts the UX, and potentially
leads to a decrease in productivity. We present the results of the interviews
as well as first thoughts on technical solutions in order to enhance the
adaptivity and subsequently the UX of the human-robot cooperation.

 <dc:title>Wireless Information Surveillance via Proactive Eavesdropping with
  Spoofing Relay</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zeng, Yong</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, Rui</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Wireless information surveillance, by which suspicious wireless
communications are closely monitored by legitimate agencies, is an integral
part of national security. To enhance the information surveillance capability,
we propose in this paper a new proactive eavesdropping approach via a spoofing
relay, where the legitimate monitor operates in a full-duplex manner with
simultaneous eavesdropping and spoofing relaying to vary the source
transmission rate in favor of the eavesdropping performance. To this end, a
power splitting receiver is proposed, where the signal received at each antenna
of the legitimate monitor is split into two parts for information eavesdropping
and spoofing relaying, respectively. We formulate an optimization problem to
maximize the achievable eavesdropping rate by jointly optimizing the power
splitting ratios and relay beamforming matrix at the multi-antenna monitor.
Depending on the suspicious and eavesdropping channel conditions, the optimal
solution corresponds to three possible spoofing relay strategies, namely
\emph{constructive relaying}, \emph{jamming}, and \emph{simultaneous jamming
and destructive relaying}. Numerical results show that the proposed technique
significantly improves the eavesdropping rate of the legitimate monitor as
compared to the existing passive eavesdropping and jamming-based eavesdropping
schemes.

 <dc:title>Mathematical Modeling of Dynamics for Partially Filled Shells of

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work we study the dynamic behaviour of compound shells of revolution
partially filled with an ideal incompressible fluid based on boundary-value
problems. New analytical mathematical model with corresponding discrete scheme
for the elastic displacements and the dynamic liquid pressure is developed. The
discrete scheme is based on the method of discrete singularities. A code to
perform the numerical analysis is developed. Comprehensive benchmarking of the
obtained results against other methods is done and good agreement is observed.
The convergence of the proposed numerical method is demonstrated. One of the
advantages of this new model is that the initial 3D problem is analytically
reduced to a 1D integral equation. Moreover, it can handle the behaviour of the
pressure in the vicinity of the nodes explicitly and the computational
technique used has a quick convergence requiring a negligible amount of CPU
time.

 <dc:description>  With the increasing size of digital libraries it has become a challenge to
identify author names correctly. The situation becomes more critical when
different persons share the same name (homonym problem) or when the names of
authors are presented in several different ways (synonym problem). This paper
focuses on homonym names in the computer science bibliography DBLP. The goal of
this study is to evaluate a method which uses co-authorship networks and
analyze the effect of common names on it. For this purpose we clustered the
publications of authors with the same name and measured the effectiveness of
the method against a gold standard of manually assigned DBLP records. The
results show that despite the good performance of implemented method for most
names, we should optimize for common names. Hence community detection was
employed to optimize the method. Results prove that the applied method improves
the performance for these names.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study a surprising phenomenon related to the representation of a cloud of
data points using polynomials. We start with the previously unnoticed empirical
observation that, given a collection (a cloud) of data points, the sublevel
sets of a certain distinguished polynomial capture the shape of the cloud very
accurately. This distinguished polynomial is a sum-of-squares (SOS) derived in
a simple manner from the inverse of the empirical moment matrix. In fact, this
SOS polynomial is directly related to orthogonal polynomials and the
Christoffel function. This allows to generalize and interpret extremality
properties of orthogonal polynomials and to provide a mathematical rationale
for the observed phenomenon. Among diverse potential applications, we
illustrate the relevance of our results on a network intrusion detection task
for which we obtain performances similar to existing dedicated methods reported
in the literature.

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic models analyze data by relying on a set of assumptions. Data
that exhibit deviations from these assumptions can undermine inference and
prediction quality. Robust models offer protection against mismatch between a
model's assumptions and reality. We propose a way to systematically detect and
mitigate mismatch of a large class of probabilistic models. The idea is to
raise the likelihood of each observation to a weight and then to infer both the
latent variables and the weights from data. Inferring the weights allows a
model to identify observations that match its assumptions and down-weight
others. This enables robust inference and improves predictive accuracy. We
study four different forms of mismatch with reality, ranging from missing
latent groups to structure misspecification. A Poisson factorization analysis
of the Movielens 1M dataset shows the benefits of this approach in a practical
scenario.

 <dc:description>  Many important NLP problems can be posed as dual-sequence or
sequence-to-sequence modeling tasks. Recent advances in building end-to-end
neural architectures have been highly successful in solving such tasks. In this
work we propose a new architecture for dual-sequence modeling that is based on
associative memory. We derive AM-RNNs, a recurrent associative memory (AM)
which augments generic recurrent neural networks (RNN). This architecture is
extended to the Dual AM-RNN which operates on two AMs at once. Our models
achieve very competitive results on textual entailment. A qualitative analysis
demonstrates that long range dependencies between source and target-sequence
can be bridged effectively using Dual AM-RNNs. However, an initial experiment
on auto-encoding reveals that these benefits are not exploited by the system
when learning to solve sequence-to-sequence tasks which indicates that
additional supervision or regularization is needed.

 <dc:description>  With the rapid development of social network and multimedia technology,
customized image and video stylization has been widely used for various
social-media applications. In this paper, we explore the problem of
exemplar-based photo style transfer, which provides a flexible and convenient
way to invoke fantastic visual impression. Rather than investigating some fixed
artistic patterns to represent certain styles as was done in some previous
works, our work emphasizes styles related to a series of visual effects in the
photograph, e.g. color, tone, and contrast. We propose a photo stylistic brush,
an automatic robust style transfer approach based on Superpixel-based BIpartite
Graph (SuperBIG). A two-step bipartite graph algorithm with different
granularity levels is employed to aggregate pixels into superpixels and find
their correspondences. In the first step, with the extracted hierarchical
features, a bipartite graph is constructed to describe the content similarity
for pixel partition to produce superpixels. In the second step, superpixels in
the input/reference image are rematched to form a new superpixel-based
bipartite graph, and superpixel-level correspondences are generated by a
bipartite matching. Finally, the refined correspondence guides SuperBIG to
perform the transformation in a decorrelated color space. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed method for transferring various styles of exemplar images, even for
some challenging cases, such as night images.

 <dc:description>  Analyzing the dimension of an unknown quantum system in a device-independent
manner, i.e., using only the measurement statistics, is a fundamental task in
quantum physics and quantum information theory. In this paper, we consider this
problem in the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we provide a lower
bound on the dimension of the prepared quantum systems which is a function that
only depends on the measurement statistics. Furthermore, we show that our bound
performs well on several examples. {In particular}, we show that our bound
provides new insights into the notion of dimension witness, and we also use it
to show that the sets of restricted-dimensional prepare-and-measure
correlations are not always convex.

 <dc:description>  The continued logarithm algorithm was introduced by Gosper around 1978, and
recently studied by Borwein, Calkin, Lindstrom, and Mattingly. In this note I
show that the continued logarithm algorithm terminates in at most 2 log_2 p +
O(1) steps on input a rational number p/q &gt;= 1. Furthermore, this bound is
tight, up to an additive constant.

 <dc:title>Extending E Prover with Similarity Based Clause Selection Strategies</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  E prover is a state-of-the-art theorem prover for first-order logic with
equality. E prover is built around a saturation loop, where new clauses are
derived by inference rules from previously derived clauses. Selection of
clauses for the inference provides the main source of non-determinism and an
important choice-point of the loop where the right choice can dramatically
influence the proof search. In this work we extend E Prover with several new
clause selection strategies based on similarity of a clause with the
conjecture. In particular, clauses which are more related to the conjecture are
preferred. We implement different strategies that define the relationship with
a conjecture in different ways. We provide an implementation of the proposed
selection strategies and we evaluate their efficiency on an extensive benchmark
set.

 <dc:description>  Consider the following problem: Given a planar graph $G$, what is the maximum
number $p$ such that $G$ has a planar straight-line drawing with $p$ collinear
vertices? This problem resides at the core of several graph drawing problems,
including universal point subsets, untangling, and column planarity. The
following results are known for it: Every $n$-vertex planar graph has a planar
straight-line drawing with $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ collinear vertices; for every
$n$, there is an $n$-vertex planar graph whose every planar straight-line
drawing has $O(n^\sigma)$ collinear vertices, where $\sigma&lt;0.986$; every
$n$-vertex planar graph of treewidth at most two has a planar straight-line
drawing with $\Theta(n)$ collinear vertices. We extend the linear bound to
planar graphs of treewidth at most three and to triconnected cubic planar
graphs. This (partially) answers two open problems posed by Ravsky and
Verbitsky [WG 2011:295--306]. Similar results are not possible for all bounded
treewidth planar graphs or for all bounded degree planar graphs. For planar
graphs of treewidth at most three, our results also imply asymptotically tight
bounds for all of the other above mentioned graph drawing problems.

 <dc:description>  Machine-type communications (MTC) are expected to play an essential role
within future 5G systems. In the FP7 project METIS, MTC has been further
classified into &quot;massive Machine-Type Communication&quot; (mMTC) and &quot;ultra-reliable
Machine-Type Communication&quot; (uMTC). While mMTC is about wireless connectivity
to tens of billions of machine-type terminals, uMTC is about availability, low
latency, and high reliability. The main challenge in mMTC is scalable and
efficient connectivity for a massive number of devices sending very short
packets, which is not done adequately in cellular systems designed for
human-type communications. Furthermore, mMTC solutions need to enable wide area
coverage and deep indoor penetration while having low cost and being energy
efficient. In this article, we introduce the physical (PHY) and medium access
control (MAC) layer solutions developed within METIS to address this challenge.

 <dc:description>  This work introduces a probabilistic-based model for binary CSP that provides
a fine grained analysis of its internal structure. Assuming that a domain
modification could occur in the CSP, it shows how to express, in a predictive
way, the probability that a domain value becomes inconsistent, then it express
the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values in each domain of the
constraint network. Thus, it express the expectation of the number of
arc-inconsistent values for the whole constraint network. Next, it provides
bounds for each of these three probabilistic indicators. Finally, a polytime
algorithm, which propagates the probabilistic information, is presented.

 <dc:description>  Recently, a compressed index for similar strings, called the FM-index of
alignment (FMA), has been proposed with the functionalities of pattern search
and random access. The FMA is quite efficient in space requirement and pattern
search time, but it is applicable only for an alignment of similar strings
without gaps. In this paper we propose the FM-index of alignment with gaps, a
realistic index for similar strings, which allows gaps in their alignment. For
this, we design a new version of the suffix array of alignment by using
alignment transformation and a new definition of the alignment-suffix. The new
suffix array of alignment enables us to support the LF-mapping and backward
search, the key functionalities of the FM-index, regardless of gap existence in
the alignment. We experimentally compared our index with RLCSA due to Makinen
et al. on 100 genome sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project. The index size of
our index is less than one third of that of RLCSA.

 <dc:title>The flow network method</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose an in-depth analysis of a method, called the flow
network method, which associates with any network a complete and
quasi-transitive binary relation on its vertices. Such a method, originally
proposed by Gvozdik (1987), is based on the concept of maximum flow. Given a
competition involving two or more teams, the flow network method can be used to
build a relation on the set of teams which establishes, for every ordered pair
of teams, if the first one did at least as good as the second one in the
competition. Such a relation naturally induces procedures for ranking teams and
selecting the best $k$ teams of a competition. Those procedures are proved to
satisfy many desirable properties.

 <dc:description>  With the help of information and communication technologies, studies on the
overall social networks have been extensively reported recently. However,
investigations on the directed Ego Communication Networks (ECNs) remain
insufficient, where an ECN stands for a sub network composed of a centralized
individual and his/her direct contacts. In this paper, the directed ECNs are
built on the Call Detail Records (CDRs), which cover more than 7 million people
of a provincial capital city in China for half a year. Results show that there
is a critical size for ECN at about 150, above which the average emotional
closeness between ego and alters drops, the balanced relationship between ego
and network collapses, and the proportion of strong ties decreases. This paper
not only demonstrate the significance of ECN size in affecting its properties,
but also shows accordance with the &quot;Dunbar's Number&quot;. These results can be
viewed as a cross-culture supportive evidence to the well-known Social Brain
Hypothesis (SBH).

 <dc:description>  To meet the ever-growing demand for a higher communicating rate and better
communication quality, more and more small cells are overlaid under the macro
base station (MBS) tier, thus forming the heterogeneous networks. Small cells
can ease the load pressure of MBS but lack of the guarantee of performance. On
the other hand, cooperation draws more and more attention because of the great
potential of small cell densification. Some technologies matured in wired
network can also be applied to cellular networks, such as Software-defined
networking (SDN). SDN helps simplify the structure of multi-tier networks. And
it's more reasonable for the SDN controller to implement cell coordination. In
this paper, we propose a method to offload users from MBSs through small cell
cooperation in heterogeneous networks. Association probability is the main
indicator of offloading. By using the tools from stochastic geometry, we then
obtain the coverage probabilities when users are associated with different
types of base stations (BSs). All the cell association and cooperation are
conducted by the SDN controller. Then on this basis, we compare the overall
coverage probabilities, achievable rate and energy efficiency with and without
cooperation. Numerical results show that small cell cooperation can offload
more users from MBS tier. It can also increase the system's coverage
performance. As small cells become denser, cooperation can bring more gains to
the energy efficiency of the network.

 <dc:title>Atomic RMI 2: Highly Parallel Pessimistic Distributed Transactional

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Distributed Transactional Memory (DTM) is an emerging approach to distributed
synchronization based on the application of the transaction abstraction to
distributed computation. DTM comes in several system models, but the control
flow model (CF) is particularly powerful, since it allows transactions to
delegate computation to remote nodes as well as access shared data. However,
there are no existing CF DTM systems that perform on par with state-of-the-art
systems operating in other models. Hence, we introduce a CF DTM synchronization
algorithm, OptSVA-CF. It supports fine-grained pessimistic concurrency control,
so it avoids aborts, and thus avoids problems with irrevocable operations.
Furthermore, it uses early release and asynchrony to parallelize concurrent
transactions to a high degree, while retaining strong safety properties. We
implement it as Atomic RMI 2, in effect producing a CF DTM system that, as our
evaluation shows, can outperform a state-of-the-art non-CF DTM such as HyFlow2.

descriptions are represented as rules inferred from one or more disjoint sets
of attributes, called views. As such, they support knowledge discovery process
and help domain experts in formulating new hypotheses or constructing new
knowledge bases and decision support systems. In contrast to previous
approaches that typically create one smaller set of redescriptions satisfying a
pre-defined set of constraints, we introduce a framework that creates large and
heterogeneous redescription set from which user/expert can extract compact sets
of differing properties, according to its own preferences. Construction of
large and heterogeneous redescription set relies on CLUS-RM algorithm and a
novel, conjunctive refinement procedure that facilitates generation of larger
and more accurate redescription sets. The work also introduces the variability
of redescription accuracy when missing values are present in the data, which
significantly extends applicability of the method. Crucial part of the
framework is the redescription set extraction based on heuristic
multi-objective optimization procedure that allows user to define importance
levels towards one or more redescription quality criteria. We provide both
theoretical and empirical comparison of the novel framework against current
state of the art redescription mining algorithms and show that it represents
more efficient and versatile approach for mining redescriptions from data.

 <dc:description>  In combinatorics on words, a word $w$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is said to
avoid a pattern $p$ over an alphabet $\Delta$ of variables if there is no
factor $f$ of $w$ such that $f=h(p)$ where $h:\Delta^*\to\Sigma^*$ is a
non-erasing morphism. A pattern $p$ is said to be $k$-avoidable if there exists
an infinite word over a $k$-letter alphabet that avoids $p$. We consider the
patterns such that at most two variables appear at least twice, or
equivalently, the formulas with at most two variables. For each such formula,
we determine whether it is $2$-avoidable, and if it is $2$-avoidable, we
determine whether it is avoided by exponentially many binary words.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider compressed sensing reconstruction from $M$
measurements of $K$-sparse structured signals which do not possess a writable
correlation model. Assuming that a generative statistical model, such as a
Boltzmann machine, can be trained in an unsupervised manner on example signals,
we demonstrate how this signal model can be used within a Bayesian framework of
signal reconstruction. By deriving a message-passing inference for general
distribution restricted Boltzmann machines, we are able to integrate these
inferred signal models into approximate message passing for compressed sensing
reconstruction. Finally, we show for the MNIST dataset that this approach can
be very effective, even for $M &lt; K$.

 <dc:description>  Data from the Herschel Space Observatory is freely available to the public
but no uniformly processed catalogue of the observations has been published so
far. To date, the Herschel Science Archive does not contain the exact sky
coverage (footprint) of individual observations and supports search for
measurements based on bounding circles only. Drawing on previous experience in
implementing footprint databases, we built the Herschel Footprint Database and
Web Services for the Herschel Space Observatory to provide efficient search
capabilities for typical astronomical queries. The database was designed with
the following main goals in mind: (a) provide a unified data model for
meta-data of all instruments and observational modes, (b) quickly find
observations covering a selected object and its neighbourhood, (c) quickly find
every observation in a larger area of the sky, (d) allow for finding solar
system objects crossing observation fields. As a first step, we developed a
unified data model of observations of all three Herschel instruments for all
pointing and instrument modes. Then, using telescope pointing information and
observational meta-data, we compiled a database of footprints. As opposed to
methods using pixellation of the sphere, we represent sky coverage in an exact
geometric form allowing for precise area calculations. For easier handling of
Herschel observation footprints with rather complex shapes, two algorithms were
implemented to reduce the outline. Furthermore, a new visualisation tool to
plot footprints with various spherical projections was developed. Indexing of
the footprints using Hierarchical Triangular Mesh makes it possible to quickly
find observations based on sky coverage, time and meta-data. The database is
accessible via a web site (http://herschel.vo.elte.hu) and also as a set of
REST web service functions.

Journal of Marketing Research has published from 2005 to 2014, are analysed
under a novel approach. We apply several statistical methods, such as Principal
Components Analysis and Correspondence Analysis to identify the way Marketing
vocabulary is evolving. Similarly those articles that introduce new vocabulary
are identified and the preferred words by authors are also detected. In order
to provide an easy-to-understand explanation, we provide our results
graphically. A word-cloud with the most frequent words is given first. Secondly
abstracts-words are represented on the factorial plane. Finally one
representation of word-years allows us to detect changes on the vocabulary
through the passing of time.

 <dc:description>  Applications and systems are constantly faced with decisions that require
picking from a set of actions based on contextual information.
Reinforcement-based learning algorithms such as contextual bandits can be very
effective in these settings, but applying them in practice is fraught with
technical debt, and no general system exists that supports them completely. We
address this and create the first general system for contextual learning,
called the Decision Service.
  Existing systems often suffer from technical debt that arises from issues
like incorrect data collection and weak debuggability, issues we systematically
address through our ML methodology and system abstractions. The Decision
Service enables all aspects of contextual bandit learning using four system
abstractions which connect together in a loop: explore (the decision space),
log, learn, and deploy. Notably, our new explore and log abstractions ensure
the system produces correct, unbiased data, which our learner uses for online
learning and to enable real-time safeguards, all in a fully reproducible
manner.
  The Decision Service has a simple user interface and works with a variety of
applications: we present two live production deployments for content
recommendation that achieved click-through improvements of 25-30%, another with
18% revenue lift in the landing page, and ongoing applications in tech support
and machine failure handling. The service makes real-time decisions and learns
continuously and scalably, while significantly lowering technical debt.

 <dc:description>  We describe a system to detect objects in three-dimensional space using video
and inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyrometer), ubiquitous in modern mobile
platforms from phones to drones. Inertials afford the ability to impose
class-specific scale priors for objects, and provide a global orientation
reference. A minimal sufficient representation, the posterior of semantic
(identity) and syntactic (pose) attributes of objects in space, can be
decomposed into a geometric term, which can be maintained by a
localization-and-mapping filter, and a likelihood function, which can be
approximated by a discriminatively-trained convolutional neural network. The
resulting system can process the video stream causally in real time, and
provides a representation of objects in the scene that is persistent:
Confidence in the presence of objects grows with evidence, and objects
previously seen are kept in memory even when temporarily occluded, with their
return into view automatically predicted to prime re-detection.

 <dc:description>  Caching popular content in the storage of small cells is being considered as
an efficient technique to complement limited backhaul of small cells in
ultra-dense heterogeneous cellular networks. Limited storage capacity of the
small cells renders it important to determine the optimal set of files (cache)
to be placed on each small cell. In contrast to prior works on optimal caching,
in this work we study the effect of retransmissions on the optimal cache
placement policy for both static and mobile user scenarios. With the popularity
of files modeled as a Zipf distribution and a maximum n transmissions, i.e.,
n-1 retransmissions, allowed to receive each file, we determine the optimal
caching probability of the files that maximizes the hit probability. Our
closed-form optimal solutions concretely demonstrate that the optimal caching
probabilities are very sensitive to the number of retransmissions.

 <dc:description>  There is intense interest in applying machine learning to problems of causal
inference in fields such as healthcare, economics and education. In particular,
individual-level causal inference has important applications such as precision
medicine. We give a new theoretical analysis and family of algorithms for
predicting individual treatment effect (ITE) from observational data, under the
assumption known as strong ignorability. The algorithms learn a &quot;balanced&quot;
representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look
similar. We give a novel, simple and intuitive generalization-error bound
showing that the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded
by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the
distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the
representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances
between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances. Experiments on real and simulated data show
the new algorithms match or outperform the state-of-the-art.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with the new control method developed for the pressure sewer
systems. This method eliminates the disadvantages of currently common used
on-off regulation. The major disadvantage is a transition of inconstancies of
the effluent production into the sewage system. The propose method is primarily
based on the principle of an allocation of the drawing off into the given time
slots. This control method is further improved by the extended modules provide
higher level of the optimization (learning mode and emergent drawing off).
Proposed method is able to decrease of the standard deviation of pumping even
by 80%.

 <dc:description>  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are usually launched through the
$botnet$, an &quot;army&quot; of compromised nodes hidden in the network. Inferential
tools for DDoS mitigation should accordingly enable an early and reliable
discrimination of the normal users from the compromised ones. Unfortunately,
the recent emergence of attacks performed at the application layer has
multiplied the number of possibilities that a botnet can exploit to conceal its
malicious activities. New challenges arise, which cannot be addressed by simply
borrowing the tools that have been successfully applied so far to earlier DDoS
paradigms. In this work, we offer basically three contributions: $i)$ we
introduce an abstract model for the aforementioned class of attacks, where the
botnet emulates normal traffic by continually learning admissible patterns from
the environment; $ii)$ we devise an inference algorithm that is shown to
provide a consistent (i.e., converging to the true solution as time progresses)
estimate of the botnet possibly hidden in the network; and $iii)$ we verify the
validity of the proposed inferential strategy over $real$ network traces.

 <dc:title>Limit theory for geometric statistics of point processes having fast

 <dc:description>  Let $P$ be a simple,stationary point process having fast decay of
correlations, i.e., its correlation functions factorize up to an additive error
decaying faster than any power of the separation distance. Let $P_n:= P \cap
W_n$ be its restriction to windows $W_n:= [-{1 \over 2}n^{1/d},{1 \over
2}n^{1/d}]^d \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We consider the statistic $H_n^\xi:=
\sum_{x \in P_n}\xi(x,P_n)$ where $\xi(x,P_n)$ denotes a score function
representing the interaction of $x$ with respect to $P_n$. When $\xi$ depends
on local data in the sense that its radius of stabilization has an exponential
tail, we establish expectation asymptotics, variance asymptotics, and CLT for
$H_n^{\xi}$ and, more generally, for statistics of the re-scaled, possibly
signed, $\xi$-weighted point measures $\mu_n^{\xi} := \sum_{x \in P_n}
\xi(x,P_n) \delta_{n^{-1/d}x}$, as $W_n \uparrow \mathbb{R}^d$. This gives the
limit theory for non-linear geometric statistics (such as clique counts,
intrinsic volumes of the Boolean model, and total edge length of the
$k$-nearest neighbors graph) of $\alpha$-determinantal point processes having
fast decreasing kernels extending the CLTs of Soshnikov (2002) to non-linear
statistics. It also gives the limit theory for geometric U-statistics of
$\alpha$-permanental point processes and the zero set of Gaussian entire
functions, extending the CLTs of Nazarov and Sodin (2012) and Shirai and
Takahashi (2003), which are also confined to linear statistics. The proof of
the central limit theorem relies on a factorial moment expansion originating in
Blaszczyszyn (1995), Blaszczyszyn, Merzbach, Schmidt (1997) to show the fast
decay of the correlations of $\xi$-weighted point measures. The latter property
is shown to imply a condition equivalent to Brillinger mixing and consequently
yields the CLT for $\mu_n^\xi$ via an extension of the cumulant method.
</dc:description>
 <dc:description>Comment: 62 pages. Fundamental changes to the terminology including the title.
  The earlier 'clustering' condition is now introduced as a notion of mixing
  and its connection to Brillinger mixing is remarked. Newer results for
  superposition of independent point processes have been added</dc:description>

 <dc:title>On the Role of Triadic Substructures in Complex Networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In the course of the growth of the Internet and due to increasing
availability of data, over the last two decades, the field of network science
has established itself as an own area of research. With quantitative scientists
from computer science, mathematics, and physics working on datasets from
biology, economics, sociology, political sciences, and many others, network
science serves as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research. One of the major
goals in network science is to unravel the relationship between topological
graph structure and a network's function. As evidence suggests, systems from
the same fields, i.e. with similar function, tend to exhibit similar structure.
However, it is still vague whether a similar graph structure automatically
implies likewise function. This dissertation aims at helping to bridge this
gap, while particularly focusing on the role of triadic structures. After a
general introduction to the main concepts of network science, existing work
devoted to the relevance of triadic substructures is reviewed. A major
challenge in modeling such structure is the fact that not all three-node
subgraphs can be specified independently of each other, as pairs of nodes may
participate in multiple triadic subgraphs. In order to overcome this obstacle,
a novel class of generative network models based on pair-disjoint triadic
building blocks is suggested. It is further investigated whether triad motifs -
subgraph patterns which appear significantly more frequently than expected at
random - occur homogeneously or heterogeneously distributed over graphs.
Finally, the influence of triadic substructure on the evolution of dynamical
processes acting on their nodes is studied. It is observed that certain motifs
impose clear signatures on the systems' dynamics, even when embedded in a
larger network structure.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates users' preferred interaction modalities when playing
an imitation game with KASPAR, a small child-sized humanoid robot. The study
involved 16 adult participants teaching the robot to mime a nursery rhyme via
one of three interaction modalities in a real-time Human-Robot Interaction
(HRI) experiment: voice, guiding touch and visual demonstration. The findings
suggest that the users appeared to have no preference in terms of human effort
for completing the task. However, there was a significant difference in human
enjoyment preferences of input modality and a marginal difference in the
robot's perceived ability to imitate.

 <dc:description>  The inherent inflexibility and incompleteness of commonsense knowledge bases
(KB) has limited their usefulness. We describe a system called Displacer for
performing KB queries extended with the analogical capabilities of the word2vec
distributional semantic vector space (DSVS). This allows the system to answer
queries with information which was not contained in the original KB in any
form. By performing analogous queries on semantically related terms and mapping
their answers back into the context of the original query using displacement
vectors, we are able to give approximate answers to many questions which, if
posed to the KB alone, would return no results.
  We also show how the hand-curated knowledge in a KB can be used to increase
the accuracy of a DSVS in solving analogy problems. In these ways, a KB and a
DSVS can make up for each other's weaknesses.

 <dc:description>  We look at non-classical negations and their corresponding adjustment
connectives from a modal viewpoint, over complete distributive lattices, and
apply a very general mechanism in order to offer adequate analytic proof
systems to logics that are based on them. Defining non-classical negations
within usual modal semantics automatically allows one to treat equivalent
formulas as synonymous, and to have a natural justification for a global
version of the contraposition rule. From that perspective, our study offers a
particularly useful environment in which negative modalities and their
companions may be used for dealing with inconsistency and indeterminacy. After
investigating modal logics based on arbitrary frames, we extend the results to
serial frames, reflexive frames, functional frames, and symmetric frames. In
each case we also investigate when and how classical negation may thereby be
defined.

 <dc:description>  In optical transport networks, signal lightpaths between two terminal nodes
can be different due to current network conditions. Thus the transmission
distance and accumulated dispersion in the lightpath cannot be predicted.
Therefore, the adaptive compensation of dynamic dispersion is necessary in such
networks to enable flexible routing and switching. In this paper, we present a
detailed analysis on the adaptive dispersion compensation using the
least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm in coherent optical communication networks.
It is found that the variable-step-size LMS equalizer can achieve the same
performance with a lower complexity, compared to the traditional LMS algorithm.

 <dc:title>Adaptivity vs Postselection</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Lijie</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the following problem: with the power of postselection (classically
or quantumly), what is your ability to answer adaptive queries to certain
languages? More specifically, for what kind of computational classes
$\mathcal{C}$, we have $\mathsf{P}^{\mathcal{C}}$ belongs to $\mathsf{PostBPP}$
and $\mathsf{PostBQP}$? While a complete answer to the above question seems
impossible given the development of present computational complexity theory. We
study the analogous question in query complexity, which sheds light on the
limitation of {\em relativized} methods (the relativization barrier) to the
above question.
  Informally, we show that, for a partial function $f$, if there is no
efficient (In the world of query complexity, being efficient means using
$O(\operatorname*{polylog}(n))$ time.) {\em small bounded-error} algorithm for
$f$ classically or quantumly, then there is no efficient postselection
bounded-error algorithm to answer adaptive queries to $f$ classically or
quantumly. Our results imply a new proof for the classical oracle separation
$\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{NP}^{\mathcal{O}}} \not\subset \mathsf{PP}^{\mathcal{O}}$.
They also lead to a new oracle separation
$\mathsf{P}^{\mathsf{SZK}^{\mathcal{O}}} \not\subset
\mathsf{PP}^{\mathcal{O}}$.
  Our result also implies a hardness amplification construction for polynomial
approximation: given a function $f$ on $n$ bits, we construct an
adaptive-version of $f$, denoted by $F$, on $O(m \cdot n)$ bits, such that if
$f$ requires large degree to approximate to error $2/3$ in a certain one-sided
sense, then $F$ requires large degree to approximate even to error $1/2 -
2^{-m}$. Our construction achieves the same amplification in the work of Thaler
(ICALP, 2016), by composing a function with $O(\log n)$ {\em deterministic
query complexity}.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a two-stage channel estimation scheme for two-way MIMO relay
systems with a single relay antenna is proposed. The backward channel is
estimated by using linear minimum mean square estimator (LMMSE) at the first
stage, where the optimal training signal is designed. We then mainly focus on
the forward channel estimation by using singular value decomposition (SVD)
based maximum likelihood method, and the related training signal is proposed.
We note that the forward channel estimator is nonlinear and by analyzing the
asymptotic Bayesian Cramer-rao Lower Bound (BCRLB), we seek BCRLB as the
criterion for training signal design. Finally, the numerical results show that
the proposed training signal can improve the MSE performance.

 <dc:description>  The migration of robots from the laboratory into sensitive home settings as
commercially available therapeutic agents represents a significant transition
for information privacy and ethical imperatives. We present new privacy
paradigms and apply the Fair Information Practices (FIPs) to investigate
concerns unique to the placement of therapeutic robots in private home
contexts. We then explore the importance and utility of research ethics as
operationalized by existing human subjects research frameworks to guide the
consideration of therapeutic robotic users -- a step vital to the continued
research and development of these platforms. Together, privacy and research
ethics frameworks provide two complementary approaches to protect users and
ensure responsible yet robust information sharing for technology development.
We make recommendations for the implementation of these principles -- paying
particular attention to specific principles that apply to vulnerable
individuals (i.e., children, disabled, or elderly persons)--to promote the
adoption and continued improvement of long-term, responsible, and
research-enabled robotics in private settings.

computing that has recently started gaining popularity. Before presenting the
current state-of-the-art in the field, this chapter reviews the history of
software architecture, the reasons that led to the diffusion of objects and

 <dc:description>  We propose a framework for training multiple neural networks simultaneously.
The parameters from all models are regularised by the tensor trace norm, so
that each neural network is encouraged to reuse others' parameters if possible
-- this is the main motivation behind multi-task learning. In contrast to many
deep multi-task learning models, we do not predefine a parameter sharing
strategy by specifying which layers have tied parameters. Instead, our
framework considers sharing for all shareable layers, and the sharing strategy
is learned in a data-driven way.

 <dc:subject>E.1</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new kind of self-balancing ternary search trie that
uses a randomized balancing strategy adapted from Aragon and Seidel's
randomized binary search trees (&quot;treaps&quot;). After any sequence of insertions and
deletions of strings, the tree looks like a ternary search trie built by
inserting strings in random order. As a result, the time cost of searching,
inserting, or deleting a string of length k in a tree with n strings is at most
O(k + log n) with high probability.

 <dc:title>Dialog state tracking, a machine reading approach using Memory Network</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In an end-to-end dialog system, the aim of dialog state tracking is to
accurately estimate a compact representation of the current dialog status from
a sequence of noisy observations produced by the speech recognition and the
natural language understanding modules. This paper introduces a novel method of
dialog state tracking based on the general paradigm of machine reading and
proposes to solve it using an End-to-End Memory Network, MemN2N, a
memory-enhanced neural network architecture. We evaluate the proposed approach
on the second Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC-2) dataset. The corpus has
been converted for the occasion in order to frame the hidden state variable
inference as a question-answering task based on a sequence of utterances
extracted from a dialog. We show that the proposed tracker gives encouraging
results. Then, we propose to extend the DSTC-2 dataset with specific reasoning
capabilities requirement like counting, list maintenance, yes-no question
answering and indefinite knowledge management. Finally, we present encouraging
results using our proposed MemN2N based tracking model.

 <dc:description>  The Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) is one of the metaheuristics
algorithms that most widely used to solve optimization problems. The BFO is
imitated from the behavior of the foraging bacteria group such as Ecoli. The
main aim of algorithm is to eliminate those bacteria that have weak foraging
methods and maintaining those bacteria that have strong foraging methods. In
this extent, each bacterium communicates with other bacteria by sending signals
such that bacterium change the position in the next step if prior factors have
been satisfied. In fact, the process of algorithm allows bacteria to follow up
nutrients toward the optimal. In this paper, the BFO is used for the solutions
of Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), and multi- objective QAP (mQAP) by using
updating mechanisms including mutation, crossover, and a local search.

 <dc:title>On the exact learnability of graph parameters: The case of partition

 <dc:description>  We study the exact learnability of real valued graph parameters $f$ which are
known to be representable as partition functions which count the number of
weighted homomorphisms into a graph $H$ with vertex weights $\alpha$ and edge
weights $\beta$. M. Freedman, L. Lov\'asz and A. Schrijver have given a
characterization of these graph parameters in terms of the $k$-connection
matrices $C(f,k)$ of $f$. Our model of learnability is based on D. Angluin's
model of exact learning using membership and equivalence queries. Given such a
graph parameter $f$, the learner can ask for the values of $f$ for graphs of
their choice, and they can formulate hypotheses in terms of the connection
matrices $C(f,k)$ of $f$. The teacher can accept the hypothesis as correct, or
provide a counterexample consisting of a graph. Our main result shows that in
this scenario, a very large class of partition functions, the rigid partition
functions, can be learned in time polynomial in the size of $H$ and the size of
the largest counterexample in the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation over the
reals with unit cost.

 <dc:description>  We prove graded bounds on the individual Betti numbers of affine and
projective complex varieties. In particular, we give for each $p,d,r$, explicit
bounds on the $p$-th Betti numbers of affine and projective subvarieties of
$\mathrm{C}^k$, $\mathbb{P}^k_{\mathrm{C}}$, as well as products of projective
spaces, defined by $r$ polynomials of degrees at most $d$ as a function of
$p,d$ and $r$. Unlike previous bounds these bounds are independent of $k$, the
dimension of the ambient space. We also prove as consequences of our technique
certain homological and representational stability results for sequences of
complex projective varieties which could be of independent interest. Finally,
we highlight differences in computational complexities of the problem of
computing Betti numbers of complex as opposed to real projective varieties.

 <dc:title>On Probabilistic Shaping of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation for the
  Nonlinear Fiber Channel</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Different aspects of probabilistic shaping for a multi-span optical
communication system are studied. First, a numerical analysis of the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel investigates the effect of using a small
number of input probability mass functions (PMFs) for a range of
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), instead of optimizing the constellation shaping
for each SNR. It is shown that if a small penalty of at most 0.1 dB SNR to the
full shaping gain is acceptable, just two shaped PMFs are required per
quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) over a large SNR range. For a multi-span
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical fiber system with 64QAM input,
it is shown that just one PMF is required to achieve large gains over uniform
input for distances from 1,400 km to 3,000 km. Using recently developed
theoretical models that extend the Gaussian noise (GN) model and full-field
split-step simulations, we illustrate the ramifications of probabilistic
shaping on the effective SNR after fiber propagation. Our results show that,
for a fixed average optical launch power, a shaping gain is obtained for the
noise contributions from fiber amplifiers and modulation-independent nonlinear
interference (NLI), whereas shaping simultaneously causes a penalty as it leads
to an increased NLI. However, this nonlinear shaping loss is found to have a
relatively minor impact, and optimizing the shaped PMF with a
modulation-dependent GN model confirms that the PMF found for AWGN is also a
good choice for a multi-span fiber system.

 <dc:description>  Promoting energy efficiency to a first class system design goal is an
important research challenge. Although more energy-efficient hardware can be
designed, it is software that controls the hardware; for a given system the
potential for energy savings is likely to be much greater at the higher levels
of abstraction in the system stack. Thus the greatest savings are expected from
energy-aware software development, which is the vision of the EU ENTRA project.
This article presents the concept of energy transparency as a foundation for
energy-aware software development. We show how energy modelling of hardware is
combined with static analysis to allow the programmer to understand the energy
consumption of a program without executing it, thus enabling exploration of the
design space taking energy into consideration. The paper concludes by
summarising the current and future challenges identified in the ENTRA project.

 <dc:description>  Learning from a few examples remains a key challenge in machine learning.
Despite recent advances in important domains such as vision and language, the
standard supervised deep learning paradigm does not offer a satisfactory
solution for learning new concepts rapidly from little data. In this work, we
employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent
advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework
learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled
example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class
types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot,
ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on
ImageNet from 87.6% to 93.2% and from 88.0% to 93.8% on Omniglot compared to
competing approaches. We also demonstrate the usefulness of the same model on
language modeling by introducing a one-shot task on the Penn Treebank.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose a graph-community detection approach to identify
cross-document relationships at the topic segment level. Given a set of related
documents, we automatically find these relationships by clustering segments
with similar content (topics). In this context, we study how different
weighting mechanisms influence the discovery of word communities that relate to
the different topics found in the documents. Finally, we test different mapping
functions to assign topic segments to word communities, determining which topic
segments are considered equivalent.
  By performing this task it is possible to enable efficient multi-document
browsing, since when a user finds relevant content in one document we can
provide access to similar topics in other documents. We deploy our approach in
two different scenarios. One is an educational scenario where equivalence
relationships between learning materials need to be found. The other consists
of a series of dialogs in a social context where students discuss commonplace
topics. Results show that our proposed approach better discovered equivalence
relationships in learning material documents and obtained close results in the
social speech domain, where the best performing approach was a clustering
technique.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a method for transforming low-order tensors into higher-order
tensors and apply it to tensors defined by graphs and hypergraphs. The
transformation proceeds according to a surgery-like procedure that splits
vertices, creates and absorbs virtual edges and inserts new vertices and edges.
We show that tensor surgery is capable of preserving the low rank structure of
an initial tensor decomposition and thus allows to prove nontrivial upper
bounds on tensor rank, border rank and asymptotic rank of the final tensors. We
illustrate our method with a number of examples. Tensor surgery on the triangle
graph, which corresponds to the matrix multiplication tensor, leads to
nontrivial rank upper bounds for all odd cycle graphs, which correspond to the
tensors of iterated matrix multiplication. In the asymptotic setting we obtain
upper bounds in terms of the matrix multiplication exponent $\omega$ and the
rectangular matrix multiplication parameter $\alpha$. These bounds are optimal
if $\omega$ equals two. We also give examples that illustrate that tensor
surgery on general graphs might involve the absorption of virtual hyperedges
and we provide an example of tensor surgery on a hypergraph. Besides its
relevance in algebraic complexity theory, our work has applications in quantum
information theory and communication complexity.

 <dc:description>  Developing intelligent systems requires combining results from both industry
and academia. In this report you find an overview of relevant research fields
and industrially applicable technologies for building very large scale cyber
physical systems. A concept architecture is used to illustrate how existing
pieces may fit together, and the maturity of the subsystems is estimated.
  The goal is to structure the developments and the challenge of machine
intelligence for Consumer and Industrial Internet technologists, cyber physical
systems researchers and people interested in the convergence of data &amp; Internet
of Things. It can be used for planning developments of intelligent systems.

 <dc:description>  In computable analysis testing a real number for being zero is a fundamental
example of a non-computable task. This causes problems for division: We cannot
ensure that the number we want to divide by is not zero. In many cases, any
real number would be an acceptable outcome if the divisor is zero - but even
this cannot be done in a computable way.
  In this note we investigate the strength of the computational problem &quot;Robust
division&quot;: Given a pair of real numbers, the first not greater than the other,
output their quotient if well-defined and any real number else. The formal
framework is provided by Weihrauch reducibility. One particular result is that
having later calls to the problem depending on the outcomes of earlier ones is
strictly more powerful than performing all calls concurrently. However, having
a nesting depths of two already provides the full power. This solves an open
problem raised at a recent Dagstuhl meeting on Weihrauch reducibility.
  As application for &quot;Robust division&quot;, we show that it suffices to execute
Gaussian elimination.

 <dc:description>  We demonstrate a simple strategy to cope with missing data in sequential
inputs, addressing the task of multilabel classification of diagnoses given
clinical time series. Collected from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU)
at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, our data consists of multivariate time
series of observations. The measurements are irregularly spaced, leading to
missingness patterns in temporally discretized sequences. While these artifacts
are typically handled by imputation, we achieve superior predictive performance
by treating the artifacts as features. Unlike linear models, recurrent neural
networks can realize this improvement using only simple binary indicators of
missingness. For linear models, we show an alternative strategy to capture this
signal. Training models on missingness patterns only, we show that for some
diseases, what tests are run can be as predictive as the results themselves.

 <dc:title>Myopic Policies for Non-Preemptive Scheduling of Jobs with Decaying

 <dc:description>  In many scheduling applications, minimizing delays is of high importance. One
adverse effect of such delays is that the reward for completion of a job may
decay over time. Indeed in healthcare settings, delays in access to care can
result in worse outcomes, such as an increase in mortality risk. Motivated by
managing hospital operations in disaster scenarios, as well as other
applications in perishable inventory control and information services, we
consider non-preemptive scheduling of jobs whose internal value decays over
time. Because solving for the optimal scheduling policy is computationally
intractable, we focus our attention on the performance of three intuitive
heuristics: (1) a policy which maximizes the expected immediate reward, (2) a
policy which maximizes the expected immediate reward rate, and (3) a policy
which prioritizes jobs with imminent deadlines. We provide performance
guarantees for all three policies and show that many of these performance
bounds are tight. In addition, we provide numerical experiments and simulations
to compare how the policies perform in a variety of scenarios. Our theoretical
and numerical results allow us to establish rules-of-thumb for applying these
heuristics in a variety of situations, including patient scheduling scenarios.

 <dc:description>  Some research institutions demand researchers to distribute the incomes they
earn from publishing papers to their researchers and/or co-authors. In this
study, we deal with the Impact Factor-based ranking journal as a criteria for
the correct distribution of these incomes. We also include the Authorship
Credit factor for distribution of the incomes among authors, using the
geometric progression of Cantor's theory and the Harmonic Credit Index.
Depending on the ranking of the journal, the proposed model develops a proper
publication credit allocation among all authors. Moreover, our tool can be
deployed in the evaluation of an institution for a funding program, as well as
calculating the amounts necessary to incentivize research among personnel.

 <dc:description>  Factorizing low-rank matrices has many applications in machine learning and
statistics. For probabilistic models in the Bayes optimal setting, a general
expression for the mutual information has been proposed using heuristic
statistical physics computations, and proven in few specific cases. Here, we
show how to rigorously prove the conjectured formula for the symmetric rank-one
case. This allows to express the minimal mean-square-error and to characterize
the detectability phase transitions in a large set of estimation problems
ranging from community detection to sparse PCA. We also show that for a large
set of parameters, an iterative algorithm called approximate message-passing is
Bayes optimal. There exists, however, a gap between what currently known
polynomial algorithms can do and what is expected information theoretically.
Additionally, the proof technique has an interest of its own and exploits three
essential ingredients: the interpolation method introduced in statistical
physics by Guerra, the analysis of the approximate message-passing algorithm
and the theory of spatial coupling and threshold saturation in coding. Our
approach is generic and applicable to other open problems in statistical
estimation where heuristic statistical physics predictions are available.

 <dc:description>  The design of revenue-maximizing combinatorial auctions, i.e. multi-item
auctions over bundles of goods, is one of the most fundamental problems in
computational economics, unsolved even for two bidders and two items for sale.
In the traditional economic models, it is assumed that the bidders' valuations
are drawn from an underlying distribution and that the auction designer has
perfect knowledge of this distribution. Despite this strong and oftentimes
unrealistic assumption, it is remarkable that the revenue-maximizing
combinatorial auction remains unknown. In recent years, automated mechanism
design has emerged as one of the most practical and promising approaches to
designing high-revenue combinatorial auctions. The most scalable automated
mechanism design algorithms take as input samples from the bidders' valuation
distribution and then search for a high-revenue auction in a rich auction
class. In this work, we provide the first sample complexity analysis for the
standard hierarchy of deterministic combinatorial auction classes used in
automated mechanism design. In particular, we provide tight sample complexity
bounds on the number of samples needed to guarantee that the empirical revenue
of the designed mechanism on the samples is close to its expected revenue on
the underlying, unknown distribution over bidder valuations, for each of the
auction classes in the hierarchy. In addition to helping set automated
mechanism design on firm foundations, our results also push the boundaries of
learning theory. In particular, the hypothesis functions used in our contexts
are defined through multi-stage combinatorial optimization procedures, rather
than simple decision boundaries, as are common in machine learning.

 <dc:description>  Prediction without justification has limited applicability. As a remedy, we
learn to extract pieces of input text as justifications -- rationales -- that
are tailored to be short and coherent, yet sufficient for making the same
prediction. Our approach combines two modular components, generator and
encoder, which are trained to operate well together. The generator specifies a
distribution over text fragments as candidate rationales and these are passed
through the encoder for prediction. Rationales are never given during training.
Instead, the model is regularized by desiderata for rationales. We evaluate the
approach on multi-aspect sentiment analysis against manually annotated test
cases. Our approach outperforms attention-based baseline by a significant
margin. We also successfully illustrate the method on the question retrieval
task.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study a convergence condition for asynchronous consensus
problems in multi-agent systems. The convergence in this context implies the
asynchronous consensus value converges to the synchronous one and is unique.
Although it is reported in the literature that the consensus value under
asynchronous communications may not coincide with the synchronous consensus
value, it has not received much attention. In some applications, the
discrepancy between them may result in serious consequences. For such
applications it is critical to determine under what conditions the asynchronous
consensus value is the same as the synchronous consensus value. We illustrate
these issues with a few examples and then provide a condition, which guarantees
that the asynchronous consensus value converges to the synchronous one. The
validity of the proposed result is verified with simulations.

 <dc:description>  We consider the single machine scheduling problem with job-dependent machine
deterioration. In the problem, we are given a single machine with an initial
non-negative maintenance level, and a set of jobs each with a non-preemptive
processing time and a machine deterioration. Such a machine deterioration
quantifies the decrement in the machine maintenance level after processing the
job. To avoid machine breakdown, one should guarantee a non-negative
maintenance level at any time point; and whenever necessary, a maintenance
activity must be allocated for restoring the machine maintenance level. The
goal of the problem is to schedule the jobs and the maintenance activities such
that the total completion time of jobs is minimized. There are two variants of
maintenance activities: in the partial maintenance case each activity can be
allocated to increase the machine maintenance level to any level not exceeding
the maximum; in the full maintenance case every activity must be allocated to
increase the machine maintenance level to the maximum. In a recent work, the
problem in the full maintenance case has been proven NP-hard; several special
cases of the problem in the partial maintenance case were shown solvable in
polynomial time, but the complexity of the general problem is left open. In
this paper we first prove that the problem in the partial maintenance case is
NP-hard, thus settling the open problem; we then design a $2$-approximation
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  It is usual to consider data protection and learnability as conflicting
objectives. This is not always the case: we show how to jointly control
inference --- seen as the attack --- and learnability by a noise-free process
that mixes training examples, the Crossover Process (cp). One key point is that
the cp~is typically able to alter joint distributions without touching on
marginals, nor altering the sufficient statistic for the class. In other words,
it saves (and sometimes improves) generalization for supervised learning, but
can alter the relationship between covariates --- and therefore fool measures
of nonlinear independence and causal inference into misleading ad-hoc
conclusions. For example, a cp~can increase / decrease odds ratios, bring
fairness or break fairness, tamper with disparate impact, strengthen, weaken or
reverse causal directions, change observed statistical measures of dependence.
For each of these, we quantify changes brought by a cp, as well as its
statistical impact on generalization abilities via a new complexity measure
that we call the Rademacher cp~complexity. Experiments on a dozen readily
available domains validate the theory.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an intracellular feedback control strategy, to regulate
the gene expression process dynamics. For this purpose, two types of genetic
circuits are designed in order to compare concentrations of the input
transcription factor (the desired input) and the protein produced by the
expression of target gene (process output). Genetic Relay Switch and Shifted
Subtractor are proposed and employed to design Discrete Comparator. Also,
another type of genetic comparator is presented named Bistable Comparator.
These synthetic comparators are used to produce the required amount of the
protein that activates the expression of the target gene. Numerical simulation
results, demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controllers.

introduced multi-way, mulitlingual neural machine translate that enables
zero-resource machine translation. When used together with novel many-to-one
translation strategies, we empirically show that this finetuning algorithm
allows the multi-way, multilingual model to translate a zero-resource language
pair (1) as well as a single-pair neural translation model trained with up to

 <dc:description>  Human interactions are characterized by explicit as well as implicit channels
of communication. While the explicit channel transmits overt messages, the
implicit ones transmit hidden messages about the communicator (e.g., his/her
intentions and attitudes). There is a growing consensus that providing a
computer with the ability to manipulate implicit affective cues should allow
for a more meaningful and natural way of studying particular non-verbal signals
of human-human communications by human-computer interactions. In this pilot
study, we created a non-dynamic human-computer interaction while manipulating
three specific non-verbal channels of communication: gaze pattern, facial
expression, and gesture. Participants rated the virtual agent on affective
dimensional scales (pleasure, arousal, and dominance) while their physiological
signal (electrodermal activity, EDA) was captured during the interaction.
Assessment of the behavioral data revealed a significant and complex three-way
interaction between gaze, gesture, and facial configuration on the dimension of
pleasure, as well as a main effect of gesture on the dimension of dominance.
These results suggest a complex relationship between different non-verbal cues
and the social context in which they are interpreted. Qualifying considerations
as well as possible next steps are further discussed in light of these
exploratory findings.

 <dc:description>  We present a first procedure that can estimate -- with statistical
consistency guarantees -- any local-maxima of a density, under benign
distributional conditions. The procedure estimates all such local maxima, or
$\textit{modal-sets}$, of any bounded shape or dimension, including usual
point-modes. In practice, modal-sets can arise as dense low-dimensional
structures in noisy data, and more generally serve to better model the rich
variety of locally-high-density structures in data.
  The procedure is then shown to be competitive on clustering applications, and
moreover is quite stable to a wide range of settings of its tuning parameter.

 <dc:description>  Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new cellular technology
introduced in 3GPP Release 13 for providing wide-area coverage for the Internet
of Things (IoT). This article provides an overview of the air interface of
NB-IoT. We describe how NB-IoT addresses key IoT requirements such as
deployment flexibility, low device complexity, long battery life time, support
of massive number of devices in a cell, and significant coverage extension
beyond existing cellular technologies. We also share the various design
rationales during the standardization of NB-IoT in Release 13 and point out
several open areas for future evolution of NB-IoT.

 <dc:description>  In the coming years, usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is expected to
grow tremendously. Maintaining security of UAVs under cyber attacks is an
important yet challenging task, as these attacks are often erratic and
difficult to predict. Secure estimation problems study how to estimate the
states of a dynamical system from a set of noisy and maliciously corrupted
sensor measurements. The fewer assumptions that an estimator makes about the
attacker, the larger the set of attacks it can protect the system against. In
this paper, we focus on sensor attacks on UAVs and attempt to design a secure
estimator for linear time-invariant systems based on as few assumptions about
the attackers as possible. We propose a computationally efficient estimator
that protects the system against arbitrary and unbounded attacks, where the set
of attacked sensors can also change over time. In addition, we propose to
combine our secure estimator with a Kalman Filter for improved practical
performance and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations of two
scenarios where an UAV is under adversarial cyber attack.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have dramatically advanced the state of the art for many
areas of machine learning. Recently they have been shown to have a remarkable
ability to generate highly complex visual artifacts such as images and text
rather than simply recognize them.
  In this work we use neural networks to effectively invert low-dimensional
face embeddings while producing realistically looking consistent images. Our
contribution is twofold, first we show that a gradient ascent style approaches
can be used to reproduce consistent images, with a help of a guiding image.
Second, we demonstrate that we can train a separate neural network to
effectively solve the minimization problem in one pass, and generate images in
real-time. We then evaluate the loss imposed by using a neural network instead
of the gradient descent by comparing the final values of the minimized loss
function.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we describe a case study in a big metropolis, in which from
data collected by digital sensors, we tried to understand mobility patterns of
persons using buses and how this can generate knowledge to suggest
interventions that are applied incrementally into the transportation network in
use. We have first estimated an Origin-Destination matrix of buses users from
datasets about the ticket validation and GPS positioning of buses. Then we
represent the supply of buses with their routes through bus stops as a complex
network, which allowed us to understand the bottlenecks of the current scenario
and, in particular, applying community discovery techniques, to identify
clusters that the service supply infrastructure has. Finally, from the
superimposing of the flow of people represented in the OriginDestination matrix
in the supply network, we exemplify how micro-interventions can be prospected
by means of an example of the introduction of express routes.

 <dc:description>  We consider the joint design of transmit beamforming and receive
signal-splitting ratios in the downlink of a wireless network with simultaneous
radio-frequency (RF) information and energy transfer. Under constraints on the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at each user and the total
transmit power at the base station, the design objective is to maximize either
the sum harvested energy or the minimum harvested energy. We develop a
computationally efficient path-following method to solve these challenging
nonconvex optimization problems. We mathematically show that the proposed
algorithms iteratively progress and converge to locally optimal solutions.
Simulation results further show that these locally optimal solutions are the
same as the globally optimal solutions for the considered practical network
settings.

 <dc:description>  Mobile online social network services have seen a rapid increase, in which
the huge amount of user-generated social media contents propagating between
users via social connections has significantly challenged the traditional
content delivery paradigm: First, replicating all of the contents generated by
users to edge servers that well &quot;fit&quot; the receivers becomes difficult due to
the limited bandwidth and storage capacities. Motivated by device-to-device
(D2D) communication that allows users with smart devices to transfer content
directly, we propose replicating bandwidth-intensive social contents in a
device-to-device manner. Based on large-scale measurement studies on social
content propagation and user mobility patterns in edge-network regions, we
observe that (1) Device-to-device replication can significantly help users
download social contents from nearby neighboring peers; (2) Both social
propagation and mobility patterns affect how contents should be replicated; (3)
The replication strategies depend on regional characteristics ({\em e.g.}, how
users move across regions).
  Using these measurement insights, we propose a joint \emph{propagation- and
mobility-aware} content replication strategy for edge-network regions, in which
social contents are assigned to users in edge-network regions according to a
joint consideration of social graph, content propagation and user mobility. We
formulate the replication scheduling as an optimization problem and design
distributed algorithm only using historical, local and partial information to
solve it. Trace-driven experiments further verify the superiority of our
proposal: compared with conventional pure movement-based and popularity-based
approach, our design can significantly ($2-4$ times) improve the amount of
social contents successfully delivered by device-to-device replication.

 <dc:title>Cloud Radio Access meets Heterogeneous Small Cell Networks: A Cognitive
  Hierarchy Perspective</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Abuzainab, Nof</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Saad, Walid</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the problem of distributed power allocation is considered for
the downlink of a cloud radio access network (CRAN) that is coexisting with a
heterogeneous network. In this multi-tier system, the heterogeneous network
base stations (BSs) as well as the CRAN remote radio heads seek to choose their
optimal power to maximize their users' rates. The problem is formulated as a
noncooperative game in which the players are the CRAN's cloud and the BSs.
Given the difference of capabilities between the CRAN and the various BSs, the
game is cast within the framework of cognitive hierarchy theory. In this
framework, players are organized in a hierarchy in such a way that a player can
choose its strategy while considering players of only similar or lower
hierarchies. Using such a hierarchical design, one can reduce the interference
caused by the CRAN and high-powered base stations on low-powered BSs. For this
game, the properties of the Nash equilibrium and the cognitive hierarchy
equilibrium are analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed cognitive
hierarchy model yields significant performance gains, in terms of the total
rate, reaching up to twice the rate achieved by a classical noncooperative
game's Nash equilibrium.

 <dc:description>  Neural machine translation (NMT) aims at solving machine translation (MT)
problems using neural networks and has exhibited promising results in recent
years. However, most of the existing NMT models are shallow and there is still
a performance gap between a single NMT model and the best conventional MT
system. In this work, we introduce a new type of linear connections, named
fast-forward connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks,
and an interleaved bi-directional architecture for stacking the LSTM layers.
Fast-forward connections play an essential role in propagating the gradients
and building a deep topology of depth 16. On the WMT'14 English-to-French task,
we achieve BLEU=37.7 with a single attention model, which outperforms the
corresponding single shallow model by 6.2 BLEU points. This is the first time
that a single NMT model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms
the best conventional model by 0.7 BLEU points. We can still achieve BLEU=36.3
even without using an attention mechanism. After special handling of unknown
words and model ensembling, we obtain the best score reported to date on this
task with BLEU=40.4. Our models are also validated on the more difficult WMT'14
English-to-German task.

 <dc:description>  Agrawal and Vinay [AV08] showed how any polynomial size arithmetic circuit
can be thought of as a depth four arithmetic circuit of subexponential size.
The resulting circuit size in this simulation was more carefully analyzed by
Korian [Koiran] and subsequently by Tavenas [Tav13]. We provide a simple proof
of this chain of results. We then abstract the main ingredient to apply it to
formulas and constant depth circuits, and show more structured depth reductions
for them.
  In an apriori surprising result, Raz [Raz10] showed that for any $n$ and $d$,
such that $ \omega(1) \leq d \leq O\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$,
constructing explicit tensors $T:[n]^d \rightarrow F$ of high enough rank would
imply superpolynomial lower bounds for arithmetic formulas over the field $F$.
Using the additional structure we obtain from our proof of the depth reduction
for arithmetic formulas, we give a new and arguably simpler proof of this
connection. We also extend this result for homogeneous formulas to show that,
in fact, the connection holds for any $d$ such that $\omega(1) \leq d \leq
n^{o(1)}$.

leveraging network load-balancing in the form of localized content storage and
delivery. In this work, we consider a cache-aided network where the cache
storage phase is assisted by a central server and users can demand multiple
files at each transmission interval. To service these demands, we consider two
delivery models - $(1)$ centralized content delivery where user demands at each
transmission interval are serviced by the central server via multicast
transmissions; and $(2)$ device-to-device (D2D) assisted distributed delivery
where users multicast to each other in order to service file demands. For such
cache-aided networks, we present new results on the fundamental cache storage
vs. transmission rate tradeoff. Specifically, we develop a new technique for
characterizing information theoretic lower bounds on the storage-rate tradeoff
and show that the new lower bounds are strictly tighter than cut-set bounds
from literature. Furthermore, using the new lower bounds, we establish the
optimal storage-rate tradeoff to within a constant multiplicative gap. We show
that, for multiple demands per user, achievable schemes based on repetition of
schemes for single demands are order-optimal under both delivery models.

 <dc:title>Order-2 Asymptotic Optimality of the Fully Distributed Sequential

 <dc:description>  This work analyzes the asymptotic performances of fully distributed
sequential hypothesis testing procedures as the type-I and type-II error rates
approach zero, in the context of a sensor network without a fusion center. In
particular, the sensor network is defined by an undirected graph, where each
sensor can observe samples over time, access the information from the adjacent
sensors, and perform the sequential test based on its own decision statistic.
Different from most literature, the sampling process and the information
exchange process in our framework take place simultaneously (or, at least in
comparable time-scales), thus cannot be decoupled from one another. Two
message-passing schemes are considered, based on which the distributed
sequential probability ratio test (DSPRT) is carried out respectively. The
first scheme features the dissemination of the raw samples. Although the sample
propagation based DSPRT is shown to yield the asymptotically optimal
performance at each sensor, it incurs excessive inter-sensor communication
overhead due to the exchange of raw samples with index information. The second
scheme adopts the consensus algorithm, where the local decision statistic is
exchanged between sensors instead of the raw samples, thus significantly
lowering the communication requirement compared to the first scheme. In
particular, the decision statistic for DSPRT at each sensor is updated by the
weighted average of the decision statistics in the neighbourhood at every
message-passing step. We show that, under certain regularity conditions, the
consensus algorithm based DSPRT also yields the order-2 asymptotically optimal
performance at all sensors.

 <dc:title>Robust And Optimal Opportunistic Scheduling For Downlink 2-Flow Network
  Coding With Varying Channel Quality and Rate Adaptation (New Simulation
  Figures)</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the downlink traffic from a base station to two
different clients. When assuming infinite backlog, it is known that
inter-session network coding (INC) can significantly increase the throughput.
However, the corresponding scheduling solution (when assuming dynamic arrivals
instead and requiring bounded delay) is still nascent. For the 2-flow downlink
scenario, we propose the first opportunistic INC + scheduling solution that is
provably optimal for time-varying channels, i.e., the corresponding stability
region matches the optimal Shannon capacity. Specifically, we first introduce a
new binary INC operation, which is distinctly different from the traditional
wisdom of XORing two overheard packets. We then develop a queue-length-based
scheduling scheme and prove that it, with the help of the new INC operation,
achieves the optimal stability region with time-varying channel quality. The
proposed algorithm is later generalized to include the capability of rate
adaptation. Simulation results show that it again achieves the optimal
throughput with rate adaptation. A byproduct of our results is a scheduling
scheme for stochastic processing networks (SPNs) with random departure, which
relaxes the of deterministic departure in the existing results.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the state of the art solution for
many computer vision problems, and many researchers have explored optimized
implementations. Most implementations heuristically block the computation to
deal with the large data sizes and high data reuse of CNNs. This paper explores
how to block CNN computations for memory locality by creating an analytical
model for CNN-like loop nests. Using this model we automatically derive
optimized blockings for common networks that improve the energy efficiency of
custom hardware implementations by up to an order of magnitude. Compared to
traditional CNN CPU implementations based on highly-tuned, hand-optimized BLAS
libraries,our x86 programs implementing the optimal blocking reduce the number
of memory accesses by up to 90%.

 <dc:title>Active Discriminative Text Representation Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:creator>Wallace, Byron C.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a new active learning (AL) method for text classification with
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In AL, one selects the instances to be
manually labeled with the aim of maximizing model performance with minimal
effort. Neural models capitalize on word embeddings as representations
(features), tuning these to the task at hand. We argue that AL strategies for
multi-layered neural models should focus on selecting instances that most
affect the embedding space (i.e., induce discriminative word representations).
This is in contrast to traditional AL approaches (e.g., entropy-based
uncertainty sampling), which specify higher level objectives. We propose a
simple approach for sentence classification that selects instances containing
words whose embeddings are likely to be updated with the greatest magnitude,
thereby rapidly learning discriminative, task-specific embeddings. We extend
this approach to document classification by jointly considering: (1) the
expected changes to the constituent word representations; and (2) the model's
current overall uncertainty regarding the instance. The relative emphasis
placed on these criteria is governed by a stochastic process that favors
selecting instances likely to improve representations at the outset of
learning, and then shifts toward general uncertainty sampling as AL progresses.
Empirical results show that our method outperforms baseline AL approaches on
both sentence and document classification tasks. We also show that, as
expected, the method quickly learns discriminative word embeddings. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work on AL addressing neural models for
text classification.

 <dc:description>  Spreadsheet workbook contents are simple programs. Because of this,
probabilistic programming techniques can be used to perform Bayesian inversion
of spreadsheet computations. What is more, existing execution engines in
spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel can be made to do this using
only built-in functionality. We demonstrate this by developing a native Excel
implementation of both a particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo variant and
black-box variational inference for spreadsheet probabilistic programming. The
resulting engine performs probabilistically coherent inference over spreadsheet
computations, notably including spreadsheets that include user-defined
black-box functions. Spreadsheet engines that choose to integrate the
functionality we describe in this paper will give their users the ability to
both easily develop probabilistic models and maintain them over time by
including actuals via a simple user-interface mechanism. For spreadsheet
end-users this would mean having access to efficient and probabilistically
coherent probabilistic modeling and inference for use in all kinds of decision
making under uncertainty.

 <dc:description>  Dealing with the complex word forms in morphologically rich languages is an
open problem in language processing, and is particularly important in
translation. In contrast to most modern neural systems of translation, which
discard the identity for rare words, in this paper we propose several
architectures for learning word representations from character and morpheme
level word decompositions. We incorporate these representations in a novel
machine translation model which jointly learns word alignments and translations
via a hard attention mechanism. Evaluating on translating from several
morphologically rich languages into English, we show consistent improvements
over strong baseline methods, of between 1 and 1.5 BLEU points.

 <dc:description>  Maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has been successfully applied to learn deep
generative models for characterizing a joint distribution of variables via
kernel mean embedding. In this paper, we present conditional generative moment-
matching networks (CGMMN), which learn a conditional distribution given some
input variables based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD)
criterion. The learning is performed by stochastic gradient descent with the
gradient calculated by back-propagation. We evaluate CGMMN on a wide range of
tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark
knowledge, which distills knowledge from a Bayesian model by learning a
relatively small CGMMN student network. Our results demonstrate competitive
performance in all the tasks.

 <dc:description>  With the ubiquitous sensing enabled by wireless sensor network technologies,
Internet of Things (IoT) is developed to many areas of modern day living. The
inexpensive IoT devices and platforms capable of wireless communications enable
the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from
delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. In this paper,
we firstly investigate a scalable multimode-based MAC protocol, IoT-MAC, which
consists of a channel contention period and a data transmission period, to
reduce contention of channel access due to coexist of many IoT devices.
Secondly, we study a data transmission scheduling algorithm to maximise data
collection under the constraints of radio link quality and remaining energy of
the IoT node, while ensuring a fair access to the radio channel. To study the
performance of data reception rate, packet loss rate and latency, we evaluate
the IoT-MAC and scheduling algorithm with varying data rate and different
network scale.

 <dc:description>  Optimization of fluid transport in the slime mold Physarum polycephalum has
been the subject of several modeling efforts in recent literature. Existing
models assume that the tube adaptation mechanism in P. polycephalum's tubular
network is controlled by the sheer amount of fluid flow through the tubes. We
put forward the hypothesis that the controlling variable may instead be the
flow's pressure gradient along the tube. We carry out the stability analysis of
such a revised mathematical model for a parallel-edge network, proving that the
revised model supports the global flow-optimizing behavior of the slime mold
for a substantially wider class of response functions compared to previous
models. Simulations also suggest that the same conclusion may be valid for
arbitrary network topologies.

 <dc:description>  Large-scale supervised classification algorithms, especially those based on
deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), require vast amounts of training
data to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Decreasing this data requirement
would significantly speed up the training process and possibly improve
generalization. Motivated by this objective, we consider the task of adaptively
finding concise training subsets which will be iteratively presented to the
learner. We use convex optimization methods, based on an objective criterion
and feedback from the current performance of the classifier, to efficiently
identify informative samples to train on. We propose an algorithm to decompose
the optimization problem into smaller per-class problems, which can be solved
in parallel. We test our approach on standard classification tasks and
demonstrate its effectiveness in decreasing the training set size without
compromising performance. We also show that our approach can make the
classifier more robust in the presence of label noise and class imbalance.

 <dc:description>  Content caching in small base stations or wireless infostations is considered
to be a suitable approach to improve the efficiency in wireless content
delivery. Placing the optimal content into local caches is crucial due to
storage limitations, but it requires knowledge about the content popularity
distribution, which is often not available in advance. Moreover, local content
popularity is subject to fluctuations since mobile users with different
interests connect to the caching entity over time. Which content a user prefers
may depend on the user's context. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
for context-aware proactive caching. The algorithm learns context-specific
content popularity online by regularly observing context information of
connected users, updating the cache content and observing cache hits
subsequently. We derive a sublinear regret bound, which characterizes the
learning speed and proves that our algorithm converges to the optimal cache
content placement strategy in terms of maximizing the number of cache hits.
Furthermore, our algorithm supports service differentiation by allowing
operators of caching entities to prioritize customer groups. Our numerical
results confirm that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in a
real world data set, with an increase in the number of cache hits of at least
14%.

 <dc:description>  We establish existence of Markov chains of mean-field type with unbounded
jump intensities by means of a fixed point argument using the Total Variation
distance. We further show existence of nearly-optimal controls and, using a
Markov chain backward SDE approach, we suggest conditions for existence of an
optimal control and a saddle-point for respectively a control problem and a
zero-sum differential game associated with payoff functionals of mean-field
type, under dynamics driven by such Markov chains of mean-field type.

 <dc:description>  The amount of digitally available but heterogeneous information about the
world is remarkable, and new technologies such as self-driving cars, smart
homes, or the internet of things may further increase it. In this paper we
examine certain aspects of the problem of how such heterogeneous information
can be harnessed by autonomous agents. After discussing potentials and
limitations of some existing approaches, we investigate how \emph{experiments}
can help to obtain a better understanding of the problem. Specifically, we
present a simple agent that integrates video data from a different agent, and
implement and evaluate a version of it on the novel experimentation platform
\emph{Malmo}. The focus of a second investigation is on how information about
the hardware of different agents, the agents' sensory data, and \emph{causal}
information can be utilized for knowledge transfer between agents and
subsequently more data-efficient decision making. Finally, we discuss potential
future steps w.r.t.\ theory and experimentation, and formulate open questions.

 <dc:description>  An important building block in all current asymptotically fast algorithms for
matrix multiplication are tensors with low border rank, that is, tensors whose
border rank is equal or very close to their size. To find new asymptotically
fast algorithms for matrix multiplication, it seems to be important to
understand those tensors whose border rank is as small as possible, so called
tensors of minimal border rank.
  We investigate the connection between degenerations of associative algebras
and degenerations of their structure tensors in the sense of Strassen. It
allows us to describe an open subset of $n \times n \times n$ tensors of
minimal border rank in terms of smoothability of commutative algebras. We
describe the smoothable algebra associated to the Coppersmith-Winograd tensor
and prove a lower bound for the border rank of the tensor used in the &quot;easy
construction&quot; of Coppersmith and Winograd.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the problem of hidden common variables discovery
from multimodal data sets of nonlinear high-dimensional observations. We
present a metric based on local applications of canonical correlation analysis
(CCA) and incorporate it in a kernel-based manifold learning technique.We show
that this metric discovers the hidden common variables underlying the
multimodal observations by estimating the Euclidean distance between them. Our
approach can be viewed both as an extension of CCA to a nonlinear setting as
well as an extension of manifold learning to multiple data sets. Experimental
results show that our method indeed discovers the common variables underlying
high-dimensional nonlinear observations without assuming prior rigid model
assumptions.

 <dc:description>  Exposing latent knowledge in geospatial trajectories has the potential to
provide a better understanding of the movements of individuals and groups.
Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree, a new
hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind user actions in
a single model. We propose a method for context tree construction that augments
geospatial trajectories with land usage data to identify such contexts. Through
evaluation of the construction method and analysis of the properties of
generated context trees, we demonstrate the foundation for understanding and
modelling behaviour afforded. Summarising user contexts into a single data
structure gives easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent,
providing the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and
behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method for
pruning context trees, for use in applications where it is desirable to reduce
the size of the tree while retaining useful information.

 <dc:description>  Pairwise learning or dyadic prediction concerns the prediction of properties
for pairs of objects. It can be seen as an umbrella covering various machine
learning problems such as matrix completion, collaborative filtering,
multi-task learning, transfer learning, network prediction and zero-shot
learning. In this work we analyze kernel-based methods for pairwise learning,
with a particular focus on a recently-suggested two-step method. We show that
this method offers an appealing alternative for commonly-applied
Kronecker-based methods that model dyads by means of pairwise feature
representations and pairwise kernels. In a series of theoretical results, we
establish correspondences between the two types of methods in terms of linear
algebra and spectral filtering, and we analyze their statistical consistency.
In addition, the two-step method allows us to establish novel algorithmic
shortcuts for efficient training and validation on very large datasets. Putting
those properties together, we believe that this simple, yet powerful method can
become a standard tool for many problems. Extensive experimental results for a
range of practical settings are reported.

 <dc:description>  The opening up of the top-level domain name market in 2012 has offered new
perspectives for companies, administrations and individuals to include a
geographic component within the domain name of their website. Little to no
research has been carried out since then to analyse the uptake of the new
top-level domain names (TLDN). Based on the specific case of the TLDN
.brussels, this article proposes an empirical study of how the opening up of
the top-level domain name market actually impacts registration practices. By
making use of freely available software tools such as OpenRefine and Natural
Language Processing (NLP) methods, the entire corpus of the .brussels domain
names (6300) was analysed from a quantitative perspective. Based on a
statistically representative sample, a qualitative interpretation allowed for a
more fine-grained analysis of how the new TLDN is being used in practice. By
doing so, the article gives a detailed insight into the impact of the recent
changes of the rules concerning domain name registration. Researchers, policy
makers, investors and anyone who cares about the Brussels identity in the
digital realm can gain through this analysis a better understanding of the
state of play of the .brussels TLDN.

 <dc:description>  Many complex multi-target prediction problems that concern large target
spaces are characterised by a need for efficient prediction strategies that
avoid the computation of predictions for all targets explicitly. Examples of
such problems emerge in several subfields of machine learning, such as
collaborative filtering, multi-label classification, dyadic prediction and
biological network inference. In this article we analyse efficient and exact
algorithms for computing the top-$K$ predictions in the above problem settings,
using a general class of models that we refer to as separable linear relational
models. We show how to use those inference algorithms, which are modifications
of well-known information retrieval methods, in a variety of machine learning
settings. Furthermore, we study the possibility of scoring items incompletely,
while still retaining an exact top-K retrieval. Experimental results in several
application domains reveal that the so-called threshold algorithm is very
scalable, performing often many orders of magnitude more efficiently than the
naive approach.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Morphologically rich languages often lack the annotated linguistic resources
required to develop accurate natural language processing tools. We propose
models suitable for training morphological taggers with rich tagsets for
low-resource languages without using direct supervision. Our approach extends
existing approaches of projecting part-of-speech tags across languages, using
bitext to infer constraints on the possible tags for a given word type or
token. We propose a tagging model using Wsabie, a discriminative
embedding-based model with rank-based learning. In our evaluation on 11
languages, on average this model performs on par with a baseline
weakly-supervised HMM, while being more scalable. Multilingual experiments show
that the method performs best when projecting between related language pairs.
Despite the inherently lossy projection, we show that the morphological tags
predicted by our models improve the downstream performance of a parser by +0.6
LAS on average.

 <dc:description>  Task-based programming models have become very popular, as they offer an
attractive solution to parallelize serial application code with task and data
annotations. They usually depend on a runtime system that schedules the tasks
to multiple cores in parallel while resolving any data hazards. However,
existing runtime system implementations are not ready to scale well on emerging
manycore processors, as they often rely on centralized structures and/or locks
on shared structures in a cache-coherent memory. We propose design choices,
policies and mechanisms to enhance runtime system scalability for single-chip
processors with hundreds of cores. Based on these concepts, we create and
evaluate Myrmics, a runtime system for a dependency-aware, task-based
programming model on a heterogeneous hardware prototype platform that emulates
a single-chip processor of 8 latency-optimized and 512 throughput-optimized
CPUs. We find that Myrmics scales successfully to hundreds of cores. Compared
to MPI versions of the same benchmarks with hand-tuned message passing, Myrmics
achieves similar scalability with a 10-30% performance overhead, but with less
programming effort. We analyze the scalability of the runtime system in detail
and identify the key factors that contribute to it.

 <dc:description>  Business process design and monitoring are essential elements of Business
Process Management (BPM), often relying on Service Oriented Architectures
(SOA). However the current BPM approaches and standards have not sufficiently
reduced the Business-IT gap. Today's solutions are mostly domain-independent
and platform-dependent, which limits the ability of business matter experts to
express business intent and enact process change. In contrast, the approach
presented in this paper focuses on BPM and SOA environments in a
domain-dependent and platform-independent way. We propose to add a domain
specific-layer on top of current solutions so business stakeholders can design
and understand their processes in a more intuitive way. We rely on previously
proposed technical solutions and integrate them in an end-to-end methodology
(from design to monitoring and back). The appropriateness and the feasibility
of the approach is justified through a use case and a complete prototype
implementation.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents BDDT-SCC, a task-parallel runtime system for non
cache-coherent multicore processors, implemented for the Intel Single-Chip
Cloud Computer. The BDDT-SCC runtime includes a dynamic dependence analysis and
automatic synchronization, and executes OpenMP-Ss tasks on a non cache-coherent
architecture. We design a runtime that uses fast on-chip inter-core
communication with small messages. At the same time, we use non coherent shared
memory to avoid large core-to-core data transfers that would incur a high
volume of unnecessary copying. We evaluate BDDT-SCC on a set of representative
benchmarks, in terms of task granularity, locality, and communication. We find
that memory locality and allocation plays a very important role in performance,
as the architecture of the SCC memory controllers can create strong contention
effects. We suggest patterns that improve memory locality and thus the
performance of applications, and measure their impact.

 <dc:description>  Automated Text Scoring (ATS) provides a cost-effective and consistent
alternative to human marking. However, in order to achieve good performance,
the predictive features of the system need to be manually engineered by human
experts. We introduce a model that forms word representations by learning the
extent to which specific words contribute to the text's score. Using Long-Short
Term Memory networks to represent the meaning of texts, we demonstrate that a
fully automated framework is able to achieve excellent results over similar
approaches. In an attempt to make our results more interpretable, and inspired
by recent advances in visualizing neural networks, we introduce a novel method
for identifying the regions of the text that the model has found more
discriminative.

 <dc:description>  Trying to cope with the constantly growing number of cores per processor,
hardware architects are experimenting with modular non-cache-coherent
architectures. Such architectures delegate the memory coherency to the
software. On the contrary, high productivity languages, like Java, are designed
to abstract away the hardware details and allow developers to focus on the
implementation of their algorithm. Such programming languages rely on a process
virtual machine to perform the necessary operations to implement the
corresponding memory model. Arguing about the correctness of such
implementations is not trivial though.
  In this work we present our implementation of the Java Memory Model in a Java
Virtual Machine targeting a 512-core non-cache-coherent memory architecture. We
shortly discuss design decisions and present early evaluation results, which
demonstrate that our implementation scales with the number of cores. We model
our implementation as the operational semantics of a Java Core Calculus that we
extend with synchronization actions, and prove its adherence to the Java Memory
Model.

 <dc:title>Neural Word Segmentation Learning for Chinese</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most previous approaches to Chinese word segmentation formalize this problem
as a character-based sequence labeling task where only contextual information
within fixed sized local windows and simple interactions between adjacent tags
can be captured. In this paper, we propose a novel neural framework which
thoroughly eliminates context windows and can utilize complete segmentation
history. Our model employs a gated combination neural network over characters
to produce distributed representations of word candidates, which are then given
to a long short-term memory (LSTM) language scoring model. Experiments on the
benchmark datasets show that without the help of feature engineering as most
existing approaches, our models achieve competitive or better performances with
previous state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  We generalize Richardson-Lucy (RL) deblurring to 4-D light fields by
replacing the convolution steps with light field rendering of motion blur. The
method deals correctly with blur caused by 6-degree-of-freedom camera motion in
complex 3-D scenes, without performing depth estimation. We introduce a novel
regularization term that maintains parallax information in the light field
while reducing noise and ringing. We demonstrate the method operating
effectively on rendered scenes and scenes captured using an off-the-shelf light
field camera. An industrial robot arm provides repeatable and known
trajectories, allowing us to establish quantitative performance in complex 3-D
scenes. Qualitative and quantitative results confirm the effectiveness of the
method, including commonly occurring cases for which previously published
methods fail. We include mathematical proof that the algorithm converges to the
maximum-likelihood estimate of the unblurred scene under Poisson noise. We
expect extension to blind methods to be possible following the generalization
of 2-D Richardson-Lucy to blind deconvolution.

 <dc:title>An Ancilla Based Quantum Simulation Framework for Non-Unitary Matrices</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The success probability in an ancilla based circuit generally decreases
exponentially in the number of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the
probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the
input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially
combine two or more ancilla based circuits. A new version of the amplitude
amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently
of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine
two or more ancilla based circuits. However, this type of the amplification
only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow
close to a unitary.
  In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary
matrices on ancilla based quantum circuits in which the success probability is
maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we
show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then
simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla based circuit design along
with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the
produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the
fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification
process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different
sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified
probabilities are generally around 0.75 and the fidelity of the final state is
mostly high and around 0.95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis
and show that combining two such ancilla based circuits, a matrix product can
be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions
represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers.

 <dc:description>  The machine learning community adopted the use of null hypothesis
significance testing (NHST) in order to ensure the statistical validity of
results. Many scientific fields however realized the shortcomings of
frequentist reasoning and in the most radical cases even banned its use in
publications. We should do the same: just as we have embraced the Bayesian
paradigm in the development of new machine learning methods, so we should also
use it in the analysis of our own results. We argue for abandonment of NHST by
exposing its fallacies and, more importantly, offer better - more sound and
useful - alternatives for it.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the probabilistic properties of the posteriors in a
speech recognition system that uses a deep neural network (DNN) for acoustic
modeling. We do this by reducing Kaldi's DNN shared pdf-id posteriors to phone
likelihoods, and using test set forced alignments to evaluate these using a
calibration sensitive metric. Individual frame posteriors are in principle
well-calibrated, because the DNN is trained using cross entropy as the
objective function, which is a proper scoring rule. When entire phones are
assessed, we observe that it is best to average the log likelihoods over the
duration of the phone. Further scaling of the average log likelihoods by the
logarithm of the duration slightly improves the calibration, and this
improvement is retained when tested on independent test data.

 <dc:description>  Using bibliometric data artificially generated through a model of citation
dynamics calibrated on empirical data, we compare several indicators for the
scientific impact of individual researchers. The use of such a controlled setup
has the advantage of avoiding the biases present in real databases, and allows
us to assess which aspects of the model dynamics and which traits of individual
researchers a particular indicator actually reflects. We find that the simple
citation average performs well in capturing the intrinsic scientific ability of
researchers, whatever the length of their career. On the other hand, when
productivity complements ability in the evaluation process, the notorious $h$
and $g$ indices reveal their potential, yet their normalized variants do not
always yield a fair comparison between researchers at different career stages.
Notably, the use of logarithmic units for citation counts allows us to build
simple indicators with performance equal to that of $h$ and $g$. Our analysis
may provide useful hints for a proper use of bibliometric indicators.
Additionally, our framework can be extended by including other aspects of the
scientific production process and citation dynamics, with the potential to
become a standard tool for the assessment of impact metrics.

 <dc:description>  Sparse code multiple access (SCMA) has been recently proposed for the future
wireless networks, which allows non-orthogonal spectrum resource sharing and
enables system overloading. In this paper, we apply SCMA into device-to-device
(D2D) communication and cellular hybrid network, targeting at using the
overload feature of SCMA to support massive device connectivity and expand
network capacity. Particularly, we develop a stochastic geometry based
framework to model and analyze SCMA, considering underlaid and overlaid mode.
Based on the results, we analytically compare SCMA with orthogonal
frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) using area spectral efficiency (ASE)
and quantify closed-form ASE gain of SCMA over OFDMA. Notably, it is shown that
system ASE can be significantly improved using SCMA and the ASE gain scales
linearly with the SCMA codeword dimension. Besides, we endow D2D users with an
activated probability to balance cross-tier interference in the underlaid mode
and derive the optimal activated probability. Meanwhile, we study resource
allocation in the overlaid mode and obtain the optimal codebook allocation
rule. It is interestingly found that the optimal SCMA codebook allocation rule
is independent of cellular network parameters when cellular users are densely
deployed. The results are helpful in the implementation of SCMA in the hybrid
system.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce Entropy/IP: a system that discovers Internet
address structure based on analyses of a subset of IPv6 addresses known to be
active, i.e., training data, gleaned by readily available passive and active
means. The system is completely automated and employs a combination of
information-theoretic and machine learning techniques to probabilistically
model IPv6 addresses. We present results showing that our system is effective
in exposing structural characteristics of portions of the IPv6 Internet address
space populated by active client, service, and router addresses.
  In addition to visualizing the address structure for exploration, the system
uses its models to generate candidate target addresses for scanning. For each
of 15 evaluated datasets, we train on 1K addresses and generate 1M candidates
for scanning. We achieve some success in 14 datasets, finding up to 40% of the
generated addresses to be active. In 11 of these datasets, we find active
network identifiers (e.g., /64 prefixes or `subnets') not seen in training.
Thus, we provide the first evidence that it is practical to discover subnets
and hosts by scanning probabilistically selected areas of the IPv6 address
space not known to contain active hosts a priori.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks and especially convolutional neural networks are of great
interest in current computer vision research. However, many techniques,
extensions, and modifications have been published in the past, which are not
yet used by current approaches. In this paper, we study the application of a
method called QuickProp for training of deep neural networks. In particular, we
apply QuickProp during learning and testing of fully convolutional networks for
the task of semantic segmentation. We compare QuickProp empirically with
gradient descent, which is the current standard method. Experiments suggest
that QuickProp can not compete with standard gradient descent techniques for
complex computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Let $OWRN = \left\langle W_x,W_y \right\rangle$ be a One Way Road Network
where $W_x$ and $W_y$ are the sets of directed horizontal and vertical roads
respectively. $OWRN$ can be considered as a variation of directed grid graph.
The intersections of the horizontal and vertical roads are the vertices of
$OWRN$ and any two consecutive vertices on a road are connected by an edge. In
this work, we analyze the problem of collision free traffic configuration in a
$OWRN$. A traffic configuration is a two-tuple $TC=\left\langle OWRN,
C\right\rangle$, where $C$ is a set of cars travelling on a pre-defined path.
We prove that finding a maximum cardinality subset $C_{sub}\subseteq C$ such
that $TC=\left\langle OWRN, C_{sub}\right\rangle$ is collision-free, is
NP-hard. Lastly we investigate the properties of connectedness, shortest paths
in a $OWRN$.

 <dc:description>  The purpose if this master's thesis is to study and develop a new algorithmic
framework for Collaborative Filtering to produce recommendations in the top-N
recommendation problem. Thus, we propose Lanczos Latent Factor Recommender
(LLFR); a novel &quot;big data friendly&quot; collaborative filtering algorithm for top-N
recommendation. Using a computationally efficient Lanczos-based procedure, LLFR
builds a low dimensional item similarity model, that can be readily exploited
to produce personalized ranking vectors over the item space. A number of
experiments on real datasets indicate that LLFR outperforms other
state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods from a computational as well as a
qualitative perspective. Our experimental results also show that its relative
performance gains, compared to competing methods, increase as the data get
sparser, as in the Cold Start Problem. More specifically, this is true both
when the sparsity is generalized - as in the New Community Problem, a very
common problem faced by real recommender systems in their beginning stages,
when there is not sufficient number of ratings for the collaborative filtering
algorithms to uncover similarities between items or users - and in the very
interesting case where the sparsity is localized in a small fraction of the
dataset - as in the New Users Problem, where new users are introduced to the
system, they have not rated many items and thus, the CF algorithm can not make
reliable personalized recommendations yet.

 <dc:description>  For an artificial creative agent, an essential driver of the search for
novelty is a value function which is often provided by the system designer or
users. We argue that an important barrier for progress in creativity research
is the inability of these systems to develop their own notion of value for
novelty. We propose a notion of knowledge-driven creativity that circumvent the
need for an externally imposed value function, allowing the system to explore
based on what it has learned from a set of referential objects. The concept is
illustrated by a specific knowledge model provided by a deep generative
autoencoder. Using the described system, we train a knowledge model on a set of
digit images and we use the same model to build coherent sets of new digits
that do not belong to known digit types.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the participation of the team &quot;TwiSE&quot; in the SemEval
2016 challenge. Specifically, we participated in Task 4, namely &quot;Sentiment
Analysis in Twitter&quot; for which we implemented sentiment classification systems
for subtasks A, B, C and D. Our approach consists of two steps. In the first
step, we generate and validate diverse feature sets for twitter sentiment
evaluation, inspired by the work of participants of previous editions of such
challenges. In the second step, we focus on the optimization of the evaluation
measures of the different subtasks. To this end, we examine different learning
strategies by validating them on the data provided by the task organisers. For
our final submissions we used an ensemble learning approach (stacked
generalization) for Subtask A and single linear models for the rest of the
subtasks. In the official leaderboard we were ranked 9/35, 8/19, 1/11 and 2/14
for subtasks A, B, C and D respectively.\footnote{We make the code available

 <dc:subject>F.2.0</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper we study the complexity of the following problems:
  Given a colored graph X=(V,E,c), compute a minimum cardinality set S of
vertices such that no nontrivial automorphism of X fixes all vertices in S. A
closely related problem is computing a minimum base S for a permutation group G
on [n] given by generators, i.e., a minimum cardinality subset S of [n] such
that no nontrivial permutation in G fixes all elements of S. Our focus is
mainly on the parameterized complexity of these problems. We show that when
k=|S| is treated as parameter, then both problems are MINI[1]-hard. For the
dual problems, where k=n-|S| is the parameter, we give FPT algorithms.
  A notion closely related to fixing is called individualization.
Individualization combined with the Weisfeiler-Leman procedure is a fundamental
technique in algorithms for Graph Isomorphism. Motivated by the power of
individualization, in the present paper we explore the complexity of
individualization: what is the minimum number of vertices we need to
individualize in a given graph such that color refinement &quot;succeeds&quot; on it.
Here &quot;succeeds&quot; could have different interpretations, and we consider the
following: It could mean the individualized graph becomes: (a) discrete, (b)
amenable, (c) compact, or (d) refinable. In particular, we study the
parameterized versions of these problems where the parameter is the number of
vertices individualized. We show a dichotomy: For graphs with color classes of
size at most 3 these problems can be solved in polynomial time (even in
logspace), while starting from color class size 4 they become W[P]-hard.

 <dc:title>A Note on the Period Enforcer Algorithm for Self-Suspending Tasks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The period enforcer algorithm for self-suspending real-time tasks is a
technique for suppressing the &quot;back-to-back&quot; scheduling penalty associated with
deferred execution. Originally proposed in 1991, the algorithm has attracted
renewed interest in recent years. This note revisits the algorithm in the light
of recent developments in the analysis of self-suspending tasks, carefully
re-examines and explains its underlying assumptions and limitations, and points
out three observations that have not been made in the literature to date: (i)
period enforcement is not strictly superior (compared to the base case without
enforcement) as it can cause deadline misses in self-suspending task sets that
are schedulable without enforcement; (ii) to match the assumptions underlying
the analysis of the period enforcer, a schedulability analysis of
self-suspending tasks subject to period enforcement requires a task set
transformation for which no solution is known in the general case, and which is
subject to exponential time complexity (with current techniques) in the limited
case of a single self-suspending task; and (iii) the period enforcer algorithm
is incompatible with all existing analyses of suspension-based locking
protocols, and can in fact cause ever-increasing suspension times until a
deadline is missed.

 <dc:description>  Taking inspiration from biological evolution, we explore the idea of &quot;Can
deep neural networks evolve naturally over successive generations into highly
efficient deep neural networks?&quot; by introducing the notion of synthesizing new
highly efficient, yet powerful deep neural networks over successive generations
via an evolutionary process from ancestor deep neural networks. The
architectural traits of ancestor deep neural networks are encoded using
synaptic probability models, which can be viewed as the `DNA' of these
networks. New descendant networks with differing network architectures are
synthesized based on these synaptic probability models from the ancestor
networks and computational environmental factor models, in a random manner to
mimic heredity, natural selection, and random mutation. These offspring
networks are then trained into fully functional networks, like one would train
a newborn, and have more efficient, more diverse network architectures than
their ancestor networks, while achieving powerful modeling capabilities.
Experimental results for the task of visual saliency demonstrated that the
synthesized `evolved' offspring networks can achieve state-of-the-art
performance while having network architectures that are significantly more
efficient (with a staggering $\sim$48-fold decrease in synapses by the fourth
generation) compared to the original ancestor network.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification across disjoint camera views has been widely applied
in video surveillance yet it is still a challenging problem. One of the major
challenges lies in the lack of spatial and temporal cues, which makes it
difficult to deal with large variations of lighting conditions, viewing angles,
body poses and occlusions. Recently, several deep learning based person
re-identification approaches have been proposed and achieved remarkable
performance. However, most of those approaches extract discriminative features
from the whole frame at one glimpse without differentiating various parts of
the persons to identify. It is essentially important to examine multiple highly
discriminative local regions of the person images in details through multiple
glimpses for dealing with the large appearance variance. In this paper, we
propose a new soft attention based model, i.e., the end to-end Comparative
Attention Network (CAN), specifically tailored for the task of person
re-identification. The end-to-end CAN learns to selectively focus on parts of
pairs of person images after taking a few glimpses of them and adaptively
comparing their appearance. The CAN model is able to learn which parts of
images are relevant for discerning persons and automatically integrates
information from different parts to determine whether a pair of images belongs
to the same person. In other words, our proposed CAN model simulates the human
perception process to verify whether two images are from the same person.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark person re-identification datasets,
including CUHK01, CHUHK03 and Market-1501, clearly demonstrate that our
proposed end-to-end CAN for person re-identification outperforms well
established baselines significantly and offer new state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Modeling the locations of nodes as a uniform binomial point process (BPP), we
present a generic mathematical framework to characterize the performance of an
arbitrarily-located reference receiver in a finite wireless network. Different
from most of the prior works where the serving transmitter (TX) node is located
at the fixed distance from the reference receiver, we consider two general
TX-selection policies: i) uniform TX-selection: the serving node is chosen
uniformly at random amongst transmitting nodes, and ii) k-closest TX-selection:
the serving node is the k-th closest node out of transmitting nodes to the
reference receiver. The key intermediate step in our analysis is the derivation
of a new set of distance distributions that lead not only to the tractable
analysis of coverage probability but also enable the analyses of wide range of
classical and currently trending problems in wireless networks. Using this new
set of distance distributions, we first investigate the diversity loss due to
SIR correlation in a finite network. We then obtain the optimal number of links
that can be simultaneously activated to maximize network spectral efficiency.
Finally, we evaluate optimal caching probability to maximize the total hit
probability in cache-enabled finite networks.

 <dc:title>The Infinity Mirror Test for Analyzing the Robustness of Graph
  Generators</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Graph generators learn a model from a source graph in order to generate a new
graph that has many of the same properties. The learned models each have
implicit and explicit biases built in, and its important to understand the
assumptions that are made when generating a new graph. Of course, the
differences between the new graph and the original graph, as compared by any
number of graph properties, are important indicators of the biases inherent in
any modelling task. But these critical differences are subtle and not
immediately apparent using standard performance metrics. Therefore, we
introduce the infinity mirror test for the analysis of graph generator
performance and robustness. This stress test operates by repeatedly,
recursively fitting a model to itself. A perfect graph generator would have no
deviation from the original or ideal graph, however the implicit biases and
assumptions that are cooked into the various models are exaggerated by the
infinity mirror test allowing for new insights that were not available before.
We show, via hundreds of experiments on 6 real world graphs, that several
common graph generators do degenerate in interesting and informative ways. We
believe that the observed degenerative patterns are clues to future development
of better graph models.

 <dc:description>  In many applications of black-box optimization, one can evaluate multiple
points simultaneously, e.g. when evaluating the performances of several
different neural network architectures in a parallel computing environment. In
this paper, we develop a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm --- the
parallel knowledge gradient method. By construction, this method provides the
one-step Bayes optimal batch of points to sample. We provide an efficient
strategy for computing this Bayes-optimal batch of points, and we demonstrate
that the parallel knowledge gradient method finds global optima significantly
faster than previous batch Bayesian optimization algorithms on both synthetic
test functions and when tuning hyperparameters of practical machine learning
algorithms, especially when function evaluations are noisy.

 <dc:description>  We propose Logic Tensor Networks: a uniform framework for integrating
automatic learning and reasoning. A logic formalism called Real Logic is
defined on a first-order language whereby formulas have truth-value in the
interval [0,1] and semantics defined concretely on the domain of real numbers.
Logical constants are interpreted as feature vectors of real numbers. Real
Logic promotes a well-founded integration of deductive reasoning on a
knowledge-base and efficient data-driven relational machine learning. We show
how Real Logic can be implemented in deep Tensor Neural Networks with the use
of Google's tensorflow primitives. The paper concludes with experiments
applying Logic Tensor Networks on a simple but representative example of
knowledge completion.

numerical simulations, it is of primary importance for scientists to be able to
exploit all available hardware in heterogenous High Performance Computing
environments for increased throughput and efficiency. We focus on the porting
and optimization of Splotch, a scalable visualization algorithm, to utilize the
Xeon Phi, Intel's coprocessor based upon the new Many Integrated Core
architecture. We discuss steps taken to offload data to the coprocessor and
algorithmic modifications to aid faster processing on the many-core
architecture and make use of the uniquely wide vector capabilities of the
device, with accompanying performance results using multiple Xeon Phi. Finally
performance is compared against results achieved with the GPU implementation of
Splotch.

 <dc:description>  The selection of a suitable document representation approach plays a crucial
role in the performance of a document clustering task. Being able to pick out
representative words within a document can lead to substantial improvements in
document clustering. In the case of web documents, the HTML markup that defines
the layout of the content provides additional structural information that can
be further exploited to identify representative words. In this paper we
introduce a fuzzy term weighing approach that makes the most of the HTML
structure for document clustering. We set forth and build on the hypothesis
that a good representation can take advantage of how humans skim through
documents to extract the most representative words. The authors of web pages
make use of HTML tags to convey the most important message of a web page
through page elements that attract the readers' attention, such as page titles
or emphasized elements. We define a set of criteria to exploit the information
provided by these page elements, and introduce a fuzzy combination of these
criteria that we evaluate within the context of a web page clustering task. Our
proposed approach, called Abstract Fuzzy Combination of Criteria (AFCC), can
adapt to datasets whose features are distributed differently, achieving good
results compared to other similar fuzzy logic based approaches and TF-IDF
across different datasets.

 <dc:title>Decentralized Simultaneous Information and Energy Transmission in K-User
  Multiple Access Channels</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, the fundamental limits of decentralized simultaneous
information and energy transmission in the $K$-user Gaussian multiple access
channel (G-MAC), with an arbitrary $K \geqslant 2$ and one non-colocated energy
harvester (EH), are fully characterized.
  The objective of the transmitters is twofold. First, they aim to reliably
communicate their message indices to the receiver; and second, to harvest
energy at the EH at a rate not less than a minimum rate requirement $b$. The
information rates $R_1,\dots,R_K$, in bits per channel use, are measured at the
receiver and the energy rate $B$ is measured at an EH.
  Stability is considered in the sense of an $\eta$-Nash equilibrium
($\eta$-NE), with $\eta &gt; 0$.
  The main result is a full characterization of the $\eta$-NE
information-energy region, i.e., the set of information-energy rate tuples
$(R_1,\dots,R_K,B)$ that are achievable and stable in the G-MAC when:
  $(a)$ all the transmitters autonomously and independently tune their own
transmit configurations seeking to maximize their own information transmission
rates $R_1,\dots, R_K$; and
  $(b)$ all the transmitters jointly guarantee an energy transmission rate $B$
at the EH, such that $B \geqslant b$.
  Therefore, any rate tuple outside the $\eta$-NE region is not stable as there
always exists at least one transmitter able to increase by at least $\eta$ bits
per channel use its own information transmission rate by updating its own
transmit configuration.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks, like many other machine learning models, have recently
been shown to lack robustness against adversarially crafted inputs. These
inputs are derived from regular inputs by minor yet carefully selected
perturbations that deceive machine learning models into desired
misclassifications. Existing work in this emerging field was largely specific
to the domain of image classification, since the high-entropy of images can be
conveniently manipulated without changing the images' overall visual
appearance. Yet, it remains unclear how such attacks translate to more
security-sensitive applications such as malware detection - which may pose
significant challenges in sample generation and arguably grave consequences for
failure.
  In this paper, we show how to construct highly-effective adversarial sample
crafting attacks for neural networks used as malware classifiers. The
application domain of malware classification introduces additional constraints
in the adversarial sample crafting problem when compared to the computer vision
domain: (i) continuous, differentiable input domains are replaced by discrete,
often binary inputs; and (ii) the loose condition of leaving visual appearance
unchanged is replaced by requiring equivalent functional behavior. We
demonstrate the feasibility of these attacks on many different instances of
malware classifiers that we trained using the DREBIN Android malware data set.
We furthermore evaluate to which extent potential defensive mechanisms against
adversarial crafting can be leveraged to the setting of malware classification.
While feature reduction did not prove to have a positive impact, distillation
and re-training on adversarially crafted samples show promising results.

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework for classification of sparse and
irregularly-sampled time series. The properties of such time series can result
in substantial uncertainty about the values of the underlying temporal
processes, while making the data difficult to deal with using standard
classification methods that assume fixed-dimensional feature spaces. To address
these challenges, we propose an uncertainty-aware classification framework
based on a special computational layer we refer to as the Gaussian process
adapter that can connect irregularly sampled time series data to any black-box
classifier learnable using gradient descent. We show how to scale up the
required computations based on combining the structured kernel interpolation
framework and the Lanczos approximation method, and how to discriminatively
train the Gaussian process adapter in combination with a number of classifiers
end-to-end using backpropagation.

 <dc:title>Attend Refine Repeat: Active Box Proposal Generation via In-Out

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of computing category agnostic bounding box proposals is utilized
as a core component in many computer vision tasks and thus has lately attracted
a lot of attention. In this work we propose a new approach to tackle this
problem that is based on an active strategy for generating box proposals that
starts from a set of seed boxes, which are uniformly distributed on the image,
and then progressively moves its attention on the promising image areas where
it is more likely to discover well localized bounding box proposals. We call
our approach AttractioNet and a core component of it is a CNN-based category
agnostic object location refinement module that is capable of yielding accurate
and robust bounding box predictions regardless of the object category.
  We extensively evaluate our AttractioNet approach on several image datasets
(i.e. COCO, PASCAL, ImageNet detection and NYU-Depth V2 datasets) reporting on
all of them state-of-the-art results that surpass the previous work in the
field by a significant margin and also providing strong empirical evidence that
our approach is capable to generalize to unseen categories. Furthermore, we
evaluate our AttractioNet proposals in the context of the object detection task
using a VGG16-Net based detector and the achieved detection performance on COCO
manages to significantly surpass all other VGG16-Net based detectors while even
being competitive with a heavily tuned ResNet-101 based detector. Code as well
as box proposals computed for several datasets are available at::

stochastic gradient descent (PSGD) algorithm on recurrent neural network (RNN)
training. PSGD adaptively estimates a preconditioner to accelerate gradient
descent, and is designed to be simple, general and easy to use, as stochastic
gradient descent (SGD). RNNs, especially the ones requiring extremely long term
memories, are difficult to train. We have tested PSGD on a set of synthetic
pathological RNN learning problems and the real world MNIST handwritten digit
recognition task. Experimental results suggest that PSGD is able to achieve
highly competitive performance without using any trick like preprocessing,
pretraining or parameter tweaking.

 <dc:description>  Multiple human tracking (MHT) is a fundamental task in many computer vision
applications. Appearance-based approaches, primarily formulated on RGB data,
are constrained and affected by problems arising from occlusions and/or
illumination variations. In recent years, the arrival of cheap RGB-Depth
(RGB-D) devices has {led} to many new approaches to MHT, and many of these
integrate color and depth cues to improve each and every stage of the process.
In this survey, we present the common processing pipeline of these methods and
review their methodology based (a) on how they implement this pipeline and (b)
on what role depth plays within each stage of it. We identify and introduce
existing, publicly available, benchmark datasets and software resources that
fuse color and depth data for MHT. Finally, we present a brief comparative
evaluation of the performance of those works that have applied their methods to
these datasets.

 <dc:title>Towards Operator-less Data Centers Through Data-Driven, Predictive,
  Proactive Autonomics</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Continued reliance on human operators for managing data centers is a major
impediment for them from ever reaching extreme dimensions. Large computer
systems in general, and data centers in particular, will ultimately be managed
using predictive computational and executable models obtained through
data-science tools, and at that point, the intervention of humans will be
limited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing
low-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are
based on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using live data,
opens one possible path towards limiting the role of operators in data centers.
In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google dataset
collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and evaluating
predictive models for node failures. Our results support the practicality of a
data-driven approach by showing the effectiveness of predictive models based on
data found in typical data center logs. We use BigQuery, the big data SQL
platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data and
generate a rich feature set characterizing node state over time. We describe
how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest classifiers
each trained on these features, to predict if nodes will fail in a future
24-hour window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive rates to
5%, we can achieve true positive rates between 27% and 88% with precision
varying between 50% and 72%.This level of performance allows us to recover
large fraction of jobs' executions (by redirecting them to other nodes when a
failure of the present node is predicted) that would otherwise have been wasted
due to failures. [...]

 <dc:title>Secure Compute-and-Forward Transmission With Artificial Noise and
  Full-Duplex Devices</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tomasin, Stefano</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a wiretap channel with an eavesdropper (Eve) and an honest but
curious relay (Ray). Ray and the destination (Bob) are full-duplex (FD)
devices. Since we aim at not revealing information on the secret message to the
relay, we consider the scaled compute-and-forward (SCF) where scaled lattice
coding is used in the transmission by both the source (Alice) and Bob in order
to allow Ray to decode only a linear combination of the two messages. At the
same time Ray transmits artificial noise (AN) to confuse Eve. When Ray relays
the decoded linear combination, Alice and Bob are transmitting AN against Eve.
This can be a 5G cellular communication scenario where a mobile terminal (MT)
aims at transmitting a secret message to a FD base station (BS), with the
assistance of a network FD relay. With respect to existing literature the
innovations of this paper are: a) Bob and Ray are FD devices; b) Alice, Ray and
Bob transmit also AN; and c) the channel to Eve is not known to Alice, Bob and
Ray. For this scenario we derive bounds on both the secrecy outage probability
under Rayleigh fading conditions of the channels to Eve, and the achievable
secrecy-outage rates.

 <dc:description>  State of the art deep reinforcement learning algorithms take many millions of
interactions to attain human-level performance. Humans, on the other hand, can
very quickly exploit highly rewarding nuances of an environment upon first
discovery. In the brain, such rapid learning is thought to depend on the
hippocampus and its capacity for episodic memory. Here we investigate whether a
simple model of hippocampal episodic control can learn to solve difficult
sequential decision-making tasks. We demonstrate that it not only attains a
highly rewarding strategy significantly faster than state-of-the-art deep
reinforcement learning algorithms, but also achieves a higher overall reward on
some of the more challenging domains.

 <dc:description>  Subsurface applications including geothermal, geological carbon
sequestration, oil and gas, etc., typically involve maximizing either the
extraction of energy or the storage of fluids. Characterizing the subsurface is
extremely complex due to heterogeneity and anisotropy. Due to this complexity,
there are uncertainties in the subsurface parameters, which need to be
estimated from multiple diverse as well as fragmented data streams. In this
paper, we present a non-intrusive sequential inversion framework, for
integrating data from geophysical and flow sources to constraint subsurface
Discrete Fracture Networks (DFN). In this approach, we first estimate bounds on
the statistics for the DFN fracture orientations using microseismic data. These
bounds are estimated through a combination of a focal mechanism (physics-based
approach) and clustering analysis (statistical approach) of seismic data. Then,
the fracture lengths are constrained based on the flow data. The efficacy of
this multi-physics based sequential inversion is demonstrated through a
representative synthetic example.

 <dc:title>Neural Networks and Continuous Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Stolzenburg, Frieder</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The fields of neural computation and artificial neural networks have
developed much in the last decades. Most of the works in these fields focus on
implementing and/or learning discrete functions or behavior. However,
technical, physical, and also cognitive processes evolve continuously in time.
This cannot be described directly with standard architectures of artificial
neural networks such as multi-layer feed-forward perceptrons. Therefore, in
this paper, we will argue that neural networks modeling continuous time are
needed explicitly for this purpose, because with them the synthesis and
analysis of continuous and possibly periodic processes in time are possible
(e.g. for robot behavior) besides computing discrete classification functions
(e.g. for logical reasoning). We will relate possible neural network
architectures with (hybrid) automata models that allow to express continuous
processes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, three outer bounds on the normalized storage-repair bandwidth
(S-RB) tradeoff of regenerating codes having parameter set
$\{(n,k,d),(\alpha,\beta)\}$ under the exact-repair (ER) setting are presented.
The first outer bound is applicable for every parameter set $(n,k,d)$ and in
conjunction with a code construction known as {\em improved layered codes}, it
characterizes the normalized ER tradeoff for the case $(n,k=3,d=n-1)$. It
establishes a non-vanishing gap between the ER and functional-repair (FR)
tradeoffs for every $(n,k,d)$. The second bound is an improvement upon an
existing bound due to Mohajer et al. and is tighter than the first bound, in a
regime away from the Minimum Storage Regeneraing (MSR) point. The third bound
is for the case of $k=d$, under the linear setting. This outer bound matches
with the achievable region of {\em layered codes} thereby characterizing the
normalized ER tradeoff of linear ER codes when $k=d=n-1$.

 <dc:title>Finite-time Stability Analysis for Random Nonlinear Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper presents an analysis approach to finite-time attraction in
probability concerns with nonlinear systems described by nonlinear random
differential equations (RDE). RDE provide meticulous physical interpreted
models for some applications contain stochastic disturbance. The existence and
the path-wise uniqueness of the finite-time solution are investigated through
nonrestrictive assumptions. Then a finite-time attraction analysis is
considered through the definition of the stochastic settling time function and
a Lyapunov based approach. A Lyapunov theorem provides sufficient conditions to
guarantee finite-time attraction in probability of random nonlinear systems. A
Lyapunov function ensures stability in probability and a finiteness of the
expectation of the stochastic settling time function. Results are demonstrated
employing the method for two examples to show potential of the proposed
technique.

 <dc:description>  Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are becoming popular accelerators in modern
High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. Installing GPUs on each node of the
cluster is not efficient resulting in high costs and power consumption as well
as underutilisation of the accelerator. The research reported in this paper is
motivated towards the use of few physical GPUs by providing cluster nodes
access to remote GPUs on-demand for a financial risk application. We
hypothesise that sharing GPUs between several nodes, referred to as
multi-tenancy, reduces the execution time and energy consumed by an
application. Two data transfer modes between the CPU and the GPUs, namely
concurrent and sequential, are explored. The key result from the experiments is
that multi-tenancy with few physical GPUs using sequential data transfers
lowers the execution time and the energy consumed, thereby improving the
overall performance of the application.

 <dc:description>  The move from hand-designed features to learned features in machine learning
has been wildly successful. In spite of this, optimization algorithms are still
designed by hand. In this paper we show how the design of an optimization
algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to
exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. Our learned
algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors
on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks
with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including
simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with
neural art.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we investigate the downlink signal-to-interference plus noise
ratio (SINR) performance of a massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
system that employs superimposed pilots for channel estimation. The
mean-squared error (MSE) of the channel estimate is compared with the Bayesian
Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound that is derived for the system, and the former is
shown to diminish with increasing number of antennas at the base station (BS).
The component of downlink (DL) interference that results from transmitting data
alongside pilots in the uplink (UL) is also shown to decrease at a rate
proportional to the square root of the number of antennas at the BS.
Furthermore, we show that staggered pilots are a particular case of
superimposed pilots and therefore, offer higher downlink throughput while
retaining the UL spectral and energy efficiency of time-multiplexed pilots. We
also extend the framework for designing a hybrid system, consisting of users
that transmit either time-multiplexed or superimposed pilots, to minimize both
the UL and DL interference. The improved MSE and DL SINR performances of the
channel estimator based on superimposed pilots are demonstrated by means of
simulations.

demon- strated the possibility to perform very efficient inference in
highly-connected, but symmetric probabilistic models models. This raises the
question, whether this holds for optimisation problems in general. Here we show
that for a large class of optimisation methods this is actually the case. More
precisely, we introduce the concept of fractional symmetries of convex
quadratic programs (QPs), which lie at the heart of many machine learning
approaches, and exploit it to lift, i.e., to compress QPs. These lifted QPs can
then be tackled with the usual optimization toolbox (off-the-shelf solvers,
cutting plane algorithms, stochastic gradients etc.). If the original QP
exhibits symmetry, then the lifted one will generally be more compact, and
hence their optimization is likely to be more efficient.

 <dc:description>  We study the factors affecting training time in multi-device deep learning
systems. Given a specification of a convolutional neural network, our goal is
to minimize the time to train this model on a cluster of commodity CPUs and
GPUs. We first focus on the single-node setting and show that by using standard
batching and data-parallel techniques, throughput can be improved by at least
5.5x over state-of-the-art systems on CPUs. This ensures an end-to-end training
speed directly proportional to the throughput of a device regardless of its
underlying hardware, allowing each node in the cluster to be treated as a black
box. Our second contribution is a theoretical and empirical study of the
tradeoffs affecting end-to-end training time in a multiple-device setting. We
identify the degree of asynchronous parallelization as a key factor affecting
both hardware and statistical efficiency. We see that asynchrony can be viewed
as introducing a momentum term. Our results imply that tuning momentum is
critical in asynchronous parallel configurations, and suggest that published
results that have not been fully tuned might report suboptimal performance for
some configurations. For our third contribution, we use our novel understanding
of the interaction between system and optimization dynamics to provide an
efficient hyperparameter optimizer. Our optimizer involves a predictive model
for the total time to convergence and selects an allocation of resources to
minimize that time. We demonstrate that the most popular distributed deep
learning systems fall within our tradeoff space, but do not optimize within the
space. By doing this optimization, our prototype runs 1.9x to 12x faster than
the fastest state-of-the-art systems.

 <dc:description>  Wireless communication provides a wide coverage at the cost of exposing
information to unintended users. As an information-theoretic paradigm, secrecy
rate derives bounds for secure transmission when the channel to the
eavesdropper is known. However, such bounds are shown to be restrictive in
practice and may require exploitation of specialized coding schemes. In this
paper, we employ the concept of directional modulation and follow a signal
processing approach to enhance the security of multi-user MIMO communication
systems when a multi-antenna eavesdropper is present. Enhancing the security is
accomplished by increasing the symbol error rate at the eavesdropper. Unlike
the information-theoretic secrecy rate paradigm, we assume that the legitimate
transmitter is not aware of its channel to the eavesdropper, which is a more
realistic assumption. We examine the applicability of MIMO receiving algorithms
at the eavesdropper. Using the channel knowledge and the intended symbols for
the users, we design security enhancing symbol-level precoders for different
transmitter and eavesdropper antenna configurations. We transform each design
problem to a linearly constrained quadratic program and propose two solutions,
namely the iterative algorithm and one based on non-negative least squares, at
each scenario for a computationally-efficient modulation. Simulation results
verify the analysis and show that the designed precoders outperform the
benchmark scheme in terms of both power efficiency and security enhancement.

 <dc:description>  Karpinski and Nekrich (2008) introduced the problem of parameterized range
majority, which asks us to preprocess a string of length $n$ such that, given
the endpoints of a range, one can quickly find all the distinct elements whose
relative frequencies in that range are more than a threshold $\tau$. Subsequent
authors have reduced their time and space bounds such that, when $\tau$ is
fixed at preprocessing time, we need either $O(n \log (1 / \tau))$ space and
optimal $O(1 / \tau)$ query time or linear space and $O((1 / \tau) \log \log
\sigma)$ query time, where $\sigma$ is the alphabet size. In this paper we give
the first linear-space solution with optimal $O(1 / \tau)$ query time, even
with variable $\tau$ (i.e., specified with the query). For the case when
$\sigma$ is polynomial on the computer word size, our space is optimally
compressed according to the symbol frequencies in the string. Otherwise, either
the compressed space is increased by an arbitrarily small constant factor or
the time rises to any function in $(1/\tau)\cdot\omega(1)$. We obtain the same
results on the complementary problem of parameterized range minority introduced
by Chan et al. (2015), who had achieved linear space and $O(1 / \tau)$ query
time with variable $\tau$.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes the Georgia Tech team's approach to the CoNLL-2016
supplementary evaluation on discourse relation sense classification. We use
long short-term memories (LSTM) to induce distributed representations of each
argument, and then combine these representations with surface features in a
neural network. The architecture of the neural network is determined by
Bayesian hyperparameter search.

 <dc:title>Max-Margin Feature Selection</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Many machine learning applications such as in vision, biology and social
networking deal with data in high dimensions. Feature selection is typically
employed to select a subset of features which im- proves generalization
accuracy as well as reduces the computational cost of learning the model. One
of the criteria used for feature selection is to jointly minimize the
redundancy and maximize the rele- vance of the selected features. In this
paper, we formulate the task of feature selection as a one class SVM problem in
a space where features correspond to the data points and instances correspond
to the dimensions. The goal is to look for a representative subset of the
features (support vectors) which describes the boundary for the region where
the set of the features (data points) exists. This leads to a joint
optimization of relevance and redundancy in a principled max-margin framework.
Additionally, our formulation enables us to leverage existing techniques for
optimizing the SVM objective resulting in highly computationally efficient
solutions for the task of feature selection. Specifically, we employ the dual
coordinate descent algorithm (Hsieh et al., 2008), originally proposed for
SVMs, for our formulation. We use a sparse representation to deal with data in
very high dimensions. Experiments on seven publicly available benchmark
datasets from a variety of domains show that our approach results in orders of
magnitude faster solutions even while retaining the same level of accuracy
compared to the state of the art feature selection techniques.
