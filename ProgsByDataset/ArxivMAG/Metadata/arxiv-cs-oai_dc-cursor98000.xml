 <dc:title>On the boosting ability of top-down decision tree learning algorithm for

 <dc:description>  We analyze the performance of the top-down multiclass classification
algorithm for decision tree learning called LOMtree, recently proposed in the
literature Choromanska and Langford (2014) for solving efficiently
classification problems with very large number of classes. The algorithm online
optimizes the objective function which simultaneously controls the depth of the
tree and its statistical accuracy. We prove important properties of this
objective and explore its connection to three well-known entropy-based decision
tree objectives, i.e. Shannon entropy, Gini-entropy and its modified version,
for which instead online optimization schemes were not yet developed. We show,
via boosting-type guarantees, that maximizing the considered objective leads
also to the reduction of all of these entropy-based objectives. The bounds we
obtain critically depend on the strong-concavity properties of the
entropy-based criteria, where the mildest dependence on the number of classes
(only logarithmic) corresponds to the Shannon entropy.

 <dc:description>  Preventable medical errors are a severe problem in healthcare, causing over
400,000 deaths per year in the US in hospitals alone. In acute care, the branch
of medicine encompassing the emergency department (ED) and intensive care units
(ICU), error rates may be higher to due low situational awareness among
clinicians performing resuscitation on patients. To support cognition, novice
team leaders may rely on reference guides to direct and anticipate future
steps. However, guides often act as a fixation point, diverting the leader's
attention away from the team. To address this issue, we conducted a qualitative
study that evaluates a collaborative cognitive aid co-designed with clinicians
called Visual TASK. Our study explored the use of Visual TASK in three
simulations employing a projected shared display with two different interaction
modalities: the Microsoft Kinect and a touchscreen. Our results suggest that
tools like the Kinect, while useful in other areas of acute care like the OR,
are unsuitable for use in high-stress situations like resuscitation. We also
observed that fixation may not be constrained to reference guides alone, and
may extend to other objects in the room. We present our findings, and a
discussion regarding future avenues in which collaborative cognitive aids may
help in improving situational awareness in resuscitation.

 <dc:title>Revisiting XOR-based Network Coding for Energy Efficient Broadcasting in

 <dc:description>  Network coding is commonly used to improve the energy efficiency of
network-wide broadcasting in wireless multi-hop networks. In this work, we
focus on XOR-based broadcasting in mobile ad hoc networks with multiple
sources. We make the observation that the common approach, which is to benefit
from the synergy of XOR network coding with a CDS-based broadcast algorithm,
suffers performance breakdowns. After delving into the details of this synergy,
we attribute this behavior to an important mechanism of the underlying
broadcast algorithm, known as the &quot;termination criterion&quot;. To tackle the
problem, we propose a termination criterion that is fully compatible with XOR
coding. In addition to that, we revisit the internals of XOR coding. We first
enhance the synergy of XOR coding with the underlying broadcast algorithm by
allowing each mechanism to benefit from information available by the other. In
this way, we manage to improve the pruning efficiency of the CDS-based
algorithm while at the same time we come up with a method for detecting coding
opportunities that has minimal storage and processing requirements compared to
current approaches. Then, for the first time, we use XOR coding as a mechanism
not only for enhancing energy efficiency but also for reducing the
end-to-end-delay. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm
through extensive simulations on a diverse set of scenarios.

 <dc:description>  This project is aimed at designing the fast forward projection algorithm and
also the backprojection algorithm for cone beam CT imaging systems with
circular X-ray source trajectory. The principle of the designs is based on
utilizing the potential computational efficiency which the Fourier Slice
Theorem and the Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) will bring forth. In
this Masters report, the detailed design of the NUFFT based forward projector
including a novel 3D (derivative of) Radon space resampling method will be
given. Meanwhile the complexity of the NUFFT based forward projector is
analysed and compared with the non-Fourier based CT projector, and the
advantage of the NUFFT based forward projection in terms of the computational
efficiency is demonstrated in this report. Base on the design of the forward
algorithm, the NUFFT based 3D direct reconstruction algorithm will be derived.
The experiments will be taken to test the performance of the forward algorithm
and the backprojection algorithm to show the practicability and accuracy of
these designs by comparing them jointly with the well-acknowledged cone beam CT
operators: the CT linear interpolation forward projector and the FDK algorithm.
This Master report will demonstrate a novel and efficient way of implementing
the cone beam CT operator, a detailed summary of the project, and the future
research prospects of the NUFFT based cone beam CT algorithms.

 <dc:title>An Energy-Aware Programming Approach for Mobile Application Development
  Guided by a Fine-Grained Energy Model</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Energy efficiency has a significant influence on user experience of
battery-driven devices such as smartphones and tablets. It is shown that
software optimization plays an important role in reducing energy consumption of
system. However, in mobile devices, the conventional nature of compiler
considers not only energy-efficiency but also limited memory usage and
real-time response to user inputs, which largely limits the compiler's positive
impact on energy-saving. As a result, the code optimization relies more on
developers. In this paper, we propose an energy-aware programming approach,
which is guided by an operation-based source-code-level energy model. And this
approach is placed at the end of software engineering life cycle to avoid
distracting developers from guaranteeing the correctness of system. The
experimental result shows that our approach is able to save from 6.4% to 50.2%
of the overall energy consumption depending on different scenarios.

 <dc:title>Fast Concurrent Cuckoo Kick-Out Eviction Schemes for High-Density Tables</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Cuckoo hashing guarantees constant-time lookups regardless of table density,
making it a viable candidate for high-density tables. Cuckoo hashing insertions
perform poorly at high table densities, however. In this paper, we mitigate
this problem through the introduction of novel kick-out eviction algorithms.
Experimentally, our algorithms reduce the number of bins viewed per insertion
for high-density tables by as much as a factor of ten.
  We also introduce an optimistic concurrency scheme for transactional
multi-writer cuckoo hash tables (not using hardware transactional memory). For
delete-light workloads, one of our kick-out algorithms avoids all competition
between insertions with high probability, and significantly reduces
transaction-abort frequency. This result is extended to arbitrary workloads
using a new synchronization mechanism called a claim flag.

 <dc:description>  Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an important task for modern
communication systems; however, it is a challenging problem when signal
features and precise models for generating each modulation may be unknown. We
present a new biologically-inspired AMC method without the need for models or
manually specified features --- thus removing the requirement for expert prior
knowledge. We accomplish this task using regularized stacked sparse denoising
autoencoders (SSDAs). Our method selects efficient classification features
directly from raw in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) radio signals in an unsupervised
manner. These features are then used to construct higher-complexity abstract
features which can be used for automatic modulation classification. We
demonstrate this process using a dataset generated with a software defined
radio, consisting of random input bits encoded in 100-sample segments of
various common digital radio modulations. Our results show correct
classification rates of &gt; 99% at 7.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and &gt; 92%
at 0 dB SNR in a 6-way classification test. Our experiments demonstrate a
dramatically new and broadly applicable mechanism for performing AMC and
related tasks without the need for expert-defined or modulation-specific signal
information.

 <dc:description>  Apnea-bradycardia is one of the major clinical early indicators of late-onset
sepsis occurring in approximately 7% to 10% of all neonates and in more than
25% of very low birth weight infants in NICU. The objective of this paper was
to determine if HRV, respiration and their relationships help to diagnose
infection in premature infants via non-invasive ways in NICU. Therefore, we
implement Mono-Channel (MC) and Bi-Channel (BC) Analysis in two groups: sepsis
(S) vs. non-sepsis (NS). Firstly, we studied RR series not only by linear
methods: time domain and frequency domain, but also by non-linear methods:
chaos theory and information theory. The results show that alpha Slow, alpha
Fast and Sample Entropy are significant parameters to distinguish S from NS.
Secondly, the question about the functional coupling of HRV and nasal
respiration is addressed. Local linear correlation coefficient r2t,f has been
explored, while non-linear regression coefficient h2 was calculated in two
directions. It is obvious that r2t,f within the third frequency band (0.2&lt;f&lt;0.4
Hz) and h2 in two directions were complementary approaches to diagnose sepsis.
Thirdly, feasibility study is carried out on the candidate parameters selected
from MC and BC respectively. We discovered that the proposed test based on
optimal fusion of 6 features shows good performance with the largest AUC and a
reduced probability of false alarm (PFA).

 <dc:description>  Signal processing on graphs has received a lot of attention in the recent
years. A lot of techniques have arised, inspired by classical signal processing
ones, to allow studying signals on any kind of graph. A common aspect of these
technique is that they require a graph correctly modeling the studied support
to explain the signals that are observed on it. However, in many cases, such a
graph is unavailable or has no real physical existence. An example of this
latter case is a set of sensors randomly thrown in a field which obviously
observe related information. To study such signals, there is no intuitive
choice for a support graph. In this document, we address the problem of
inferring a graph structure from the observation of signals, under the
assumption that they were issued of the diffusion of initially i.i.d. signals.
To validate our approach, we design an experimental protocol, in which we
diffuse signals on a known graph. Then, we forget the graph, and show that we
are able to retrieve it very precisely from the only knowledge of the diffused
signals.

 <dc:description>  Estimation eye gaze direction is useful in various human-computer interaction
tasks. Knowledge of gaze direction can give valuable information regarding
users point of attention. Certain patterns of eye movements known as eye
accessing cues are reported to be related to the cognitive processes in the
human brain. We propose a real-time framework for the classification of eye
gaze direction and estimation of eye accessing cues. In the first stage, the
algorithm detects faces using a modified version of the Viola-Jones algorithm.
A rough eye region is obtained using geometric relations and facial landmarks.
The eye region obtained is used in the subsequent stage to classify the eye
gaze direction. A convolutional neural network is employed in this work for the
classification of eye gaze direction. The proposed algorithm was tested on Eye
Chimera database and found to outperform state of the art methods. The
computational complexity of the algorithm is very less in the testing phase.
The algorithm achieved an average frame rate of 24 fps in the desktop
environment.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we employ the so-called semi-bent functions to achieve
significant improvements over currently known methods regarding the number of
orthogonal sequences per cell that can be assigned to a regular tessellation of
hexagonal cells, typical for certain code-division multiple-access (CDMA)
systems. Our initial design method generates a large family of orthogonal sets
of sequences derived from vectorial semi-bent functions. A modification of the
original approach is proposed to avoid a hard combinatorial problem of
allocating several such orthogonal sets to a single cell of a regular hexagonal
network, while preserving the orthogonality to adjacent cells. This
modification increases the number of users per cell by starting from shorter
codewords and then extending the length of these codewords to the desired
length. The specification and assignment of these orthogonal sets to a regular
tessellation of hexagonal cells have been solved regardless of the parity and
size of $m$ (where $2^m$ is the length of the codewords). In particular, when
the re-use distance is $D=4$ the number of users per cell is $2^{m-2}$ for
almost all $m$, which is twice as many as can be obtained by the best known
methods.

 <dc:title>Fast and Accurate Algorithm for Eye Localization for Gaze Tracking in
  Low Resolution Images</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Iris centre localization in low-resolution visible images is a challenging
problem in computer vision community due to noise, shadows, occlusions, pose
variations, eye blinks, etc. This paper proposes an efficient method for
determining iris centre in low-resolution images in the visible spectrum. Even
low-cost consumer-grade webcams can be used for gaze tracking without any
additional hardware. A two-stage algorithm is proposed for iris centre
localization. The proposed method uses geometrical characteristics of the eye.
In the first stage, a fast convolution based approach is used for obtaining the
coarse location of iris centre (IC). The IC location is further refined in the
second stage using boundary tracing and ellipse fitting. The algorithm has been
evaluated in public databases like BioID, Gi4E and is found to outperform the
state of the art methods.

 <dc:description>  Numerous important problems can be framed as learning from graph data. We
propose a framework for learning convolutional neural networks for arbitrary
graphs. These graphs may be undirected, directed, and with both discrete and
continuous node and edge attributes. Analogous to image-based convolutional
networks that operate on locally connected regions of the input, we present a
general approach to extracting locally connected regions from graphs. Using
established benchmark data sets, we demonstrate that the learned feature
representations are competitive with state of the art graph kernels and that
their computation is highly efficient.

 <dc:description>  This paper describes a reduction from the halting problem of Turing machines
to subtype checking in Java. It follows that subtype checking in Java is
undecidable, which answers a question posed by Kennedy and Pierce in 2007. It
also follows that Java's type checker can recognize any recursive language,
which improves a result of Gil and Levy from 2016. The latter point is
illustrated by a parser generator for fluent interfaces.

 <dc:description>  In this article, we explored orthogonal methods to analyze malware motivated
by signal and image processing. Malware samples are represented as images or
signals. Image and signal-based features are extracted to characterize malware.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our methods on malware

 <dc:title>$d$-imbalance WOM Codes for Reduced Inter-Cell Interference in
  Multi-Level NVMs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hemo, Evyatar</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Cassuto, Yuval</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, due to the spread of multi-level non-volatile memories
(NVM), $q$-ary write-once memories (WOM) codes have been extensively studied.
By using WOM codes, it is possible to rewrite NVMs $t$ times before erasing the
cells. The use of WOM codes enables to improve the performance of the storage
device, however, it may also increase errors caused by inter-cell interference
(ICI). This work presents WOM codes that restrict the imbalance between code
symbols throughout the write sequence, hence decreasing ICI. We first specify
the imbalance model as a bound $d$ on the difference between codeword levels.
Then a $2$-cell code construction for general $q$ and input size is proposed.
An upper bound on the write count is also derived, showing the optimality of
the proposed construction. In addition to direct WOM constructions, we derive
closed-form optimal write regions for codes constructed with continuous
lattices. On the coding side, the proposed codes are shown to be competitive
with known codes not adhering to the bounded imbalance constraint. On the
memory side, we show how the codes can be deployed within flash wordlines, and
quantify their BER advantage using accepted ICI models.

 <dc:description>  Dictionary learning is the problem of estimating the collection of atomic
elements that provide a sparse representation of measured/collected signals or
data. This paper finds fundamental limits on the sample complexity of
estimating dictionaries for tensor data by proving a lower bound on the minimax
risk. This lower bound depends on the dimensions of the tensor and parameters
of the generative model. The focus of this paper is on second-order tensor
data, with the underlying dictionaries constructed by taking the Kronecker
product of two smaller dictionaries and the observed data generated by sparse
linear combinations of dictionary atoms observed through white Gaussian noise.
In this regard, the paper provides a general lower bound on the minimax risk
and also adapts the proof techniques for equivalent results using sparse and
Gaussian coefficient models. The reported results suggest that the sample
complexity of dictionary learning for tensor data can be significantly lower
than that for unstructured data.

 <dc:description>  Neural correlates of movement planning onset and direction may be present in
human electrocorticography in the signal dynamics of both motor and non-motor
cortical regions. We use a three-stage model of jPCA reduced-rank hidden Markov
model (jPCA-RR-HMM), regularized shrunken-centroid discriminant analysis (RDA),
and LASSO regression to extract direction-sensitive planning information and
movement onset in an upper-limb 3D isometric force task in a human subject.
This mode achieves a relatively high true positive force-onset prediction rate
of 60% within 250ms, and an above-chance 36% accuracy (17% chance) in
predicting one of six planned 3D directions of isometric force using
pre-movement signals. We also find direction-distinguishing information up to
400ms before force onset in the pre-movement signals, captured by electrodes
placed over the limb-ipsilateral dorsal premotor regions. This approach can
contribute to more accurate decoding of higher-level movement goals, at earlier
timescales, and inform sensor placement. Our results also contribute to further
understanding of the spatiotemporal features of human motor planning.

 <dc:description>  Dataflow matrix machines are a powerful generalization of recurrent neural
networks. They work with multiple types of linear streams and multiple types of
neurons, including higher-order neurons which dynamically update the matrix
describing weights and topology of the network in question while the network is
running. It seems that the power of dataflow matrix machines is sufficient for
them to be a convenient general purpose programming platform. This paper
explores a number of useful programming idioms and constructions arising in
this context.

 <dc:description>  We explore the implications of using fuzzy techniques (mainly those commonly
used in the linguistic description/summarization of data discipline) from a
natural language generation perspective. For this, we provide an extensive
discussion of some general convergence points and an exploration of the
relationship between the different tasks involved in the standard NLG system
pipeline architecture and the most common fuzzy approaches used in linguistic
summarization/description of data, such as fuzzy quantified statements,
evaluation criteria or aggregation operators. Each individual discussion is
illustrated with a related use case. Recent work made in the context of
cross-fertilization of both research fields is also referenced. This paper
encompasses general ideas that emerged as part of the PhD thesis &quot;Application
of fuzzy sets in data-to-text systems&quot;. It does not present a specific
application or a formal approach, but rather discusses current high-level
issues and potential usages of fuzzy sets (focused on linguistic summarization
of data) in natural language generation.

 <dc:description>  Game tree search algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), require
access to a forward model (or &quot;simulator&quot;) of the game at hand. However, in
some games such forward model is not readily available. This paper presents
three forward models for two-player attrition games, which we call &quot;combat
models&quot;, and show how they can be used to simulate combat in RTS games. We also
show how these combat models can be learned from replay data. We use StarCraft
as our application domain. We report experiments comparing our combat models
predicting a combat output and their impact when used for tactical decisions
during a real game.

 <dc:title>Lossless Intra Coding in HEVC with Integer-to-Integer DST</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Kamisli, Fatih</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multimedia</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  It is desirable to support efficient lossless coding within video coding
standards, which are primarily designed for lossy coding, with as little
modification as possible. A simple approach is to skip transform and
quantization, and directly entropy code the prediction residual, but this is
inefficient for compression. A more efficient and popular approach is to
process the residual block with DPCM prior to entropy coding. This paper
explores an alternative approach based on processing the residual block with
integer-to-integer (i2i) transforms. I2i transforms map integers to integers,
however, unlike the integer transforms used in HEVC for lossy coding, they do
not increase the dynamic range at the output and can be used in lossless
coding. We use both an i2i DCT from the literature and a novel i2i
approximation of the DST. Experiments with the HEVC reference software show
competitive results.

 <dc:description>  MobilitApp is an Android application whose objective is to obtain mobility
data from the citizens of the metropolitan area of Barcelona. The current
project is based on the research of more trustful and stronger transport
decision algorithms using advantages of accelerometry techniques. The developed
algorithm reads data from the mobile's accelerometer and gyroscope and writes
it in a file that is afterwards sent to the server. This process is executed in
background without interfering in the main application activity. Collected data
has been processed and used to analyze the behaviour of the mobility pattern of
the distinct transport modalities. The obtained result has been parameters
which allow us to configure a model for each mean activity and designing a
transport mode detection algorithm which would use information obtained from
the mobile's own sensors. MobilitApp is still executing its main functionality,
monitoring mobility data from the citizens. In future versions the solution
proposed to detect the transport systems will be integrated into the
application, in this way the app will work with information obtained from the
device and will not depend on any other services.

 <dc:title>Hardware Based Projection onto The Parity Polytope and Probability

 <dc:creator>Wasson, Mitchell</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper is concerned with the adaptation to hardware of methods for
Euclidean norm projections onto the parity polytope and probability simplex. We
first refine recent efforts to develop efficient methods of projection onto the
parity polytope. Our resulting algorithm can be configured to have either
average computational complexity $\mathcal{O}\left(d\right)$ or worst case
complexity $\mathcal{O}\left(d\log{d}\right)$ on a serial processor where $d$
is the dimension of projection space. We show how to adapt our projection
routine to hardware. Our projection method uses a sub-routine that involves
another Euclidean projection; onto the probability simplex. We therefore
explain how to adapt to hardware a well know simplex projection algorithm. The
hardware implementations of both projection algorithms achieve area scalings of
$\mathcal{O}(d\left(\log{d}\right)^2)$ at a delay of
$\mathcal{O}(\left(\log{d}\right)^2)$. Finally, we present numerical results in
which we evaluate the fixed-point accuracy and resource scaling of these
algorithms when targeting a modern FPGA.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces an automated skill acquisition framework in
reinforcement learning which involves identifying a hierarchical description of
the given task in terms of abstract states and extended actions between
abstract states. Identifying such structures present in the task provides ways
to simplify and speed up reinforcement learning algorithms. These structures
also help to generalize such algorithms over multiple tasks without relearning
policies from scratch. We use ideas from dynamical systems to find metastable
regions in the state space and associate them with abstract states. The
spectral clustering algorithm PCCA+ is used to identify suitable abstractions
aligned to the underlying structure. Skills are defined in terms of the
sequence of actions that lead to transitions between such abstract states. The
connectivity information from PCCA+ is used to generate these skills or
options. These skills are independent of the learning task and can be
efficiently reused across a variety of tasks defined over the same model. This
approach works well even without the exact model of the environment by using
sample trajectories to construct an approximate estimate. We also present our
approach to scaling the skill acquisition framework to complex tasks with large
state spaces for which we perform state aggregation using the representation
learned from an action conditional video prediction network and use the skill
acquisition framework on the aggregated state space.

 <dc:description>  Review websites, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp, allow users to post online
reviews for various businesses, products and services, and have been recently
shown to have a significant influence on consumer shopping behaviour. An online
review typically consists of free-form text and a star rating out of 5. The
problem of predicting a user's star rating for a product, given the user's text
review for that product, is called Review Rating Prediction and has lately
become a popular, albeit hard, problem in machine learning. In this paper, we
treat Review Rating Prediction as a multi-class classification problem, and
build sixteen different prediction models by combining four feature extraction
methods, (i) unigrams, (ii) bigrams, (iii) trigrams and (iv) Latent Semantic
Indexing, with four machine learning algorithms, (i) logistic regression, (ii)
Naive Bayes classification, (iii) perceptrons, and (iv) linear Support Vector
Classification. We analyse the performance of each of these sixteen models to
come up with the best model for predicting the ratings from reviews. We use the
dataset provided by Yelp for training and testing the models.

 <dc:description>  A binary code is called a superimposed cover-free $(s,\ell)$-code if the code
is identified by the incidence matrix of a family of finite sets in which no
intersection of $\ell$ sets is covered by the union of $s$ others. A binary
code is called a superimposed list-decoding $s_L$-code if the code is
identified by the incidence matrix of a family of finite sets in which the
union of any $s$ sets can cover not more than $L-1$ other sets of the family.
For $L=\ell=1$, both of the definitions coincide and the corresponding binary
code is called a superimposed $s$-code. Our aim is to obtain new lower and
upper bounds on the rate of the given codes. In particular, we derive lower
bounds on the rates of a superimposed cover-free $(s,\ell)$-code and
list-decoding $s_L$-code based on the ensemble of constant weight binary codes.
Also, we establish an upper bound on the rate of superimposed list-decoding
$s_L$-code.

 <dc:description>  Deep Reinforcement Learning methods have achieved state of the art
performance in learning control policies for the games in the Atari 2600
domain. One of the important parameters in the Arcade Learning Environment
(ALE) is the frame skip rate. It decides the granularity at which agents can
control game play. A frame skip value of $k$ allows the agent to repeat a
selected action $k$ number of times. The current state of the art architectures
like Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Dueling Network Architectures (DuDQN) consist of
a framework with a static frame skip rate, where the action output from the
network is repeated for a fixed number of frames regardless of the current
state. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, Dynamic Frame skip Deep
Q-Network (DFDQN) which makes the frame skip rate a dynamic learnable
parameter. This allows us to choose the number of times an action is to be
repeated based on the current state. We show empirically that such a setting
improves the performance on relatively harder games like Seaquest.

 <dc:description>  Deep learning became the method of choice in recent year for solving a wide
variety of predictive analytics tasks. For sequence prediction, recurrent
neural networks (RNN) are often the go-to architecture for exploiting
sequential information where the output is dependent on previous computation.
However, the dependencies of the computation lie in the latent domain which may
not be suitable for certain applications involving the prediction of a
step-wise transformation sequence that is dependent on the previous computation
only in the visible domain. We propose that a hybrid architecture of
convolution neural networks (CNN) and stacked autoencoders (SAE) is sufficient
to learn a sequence of actions that nonlinearly transforms an input shape or
distribution into a target shape or distribution with the same support. While
such a framework can be useful in a variety of problems such as robotic path
planning, sequential decision-making in games, and identifying material
processing pathways to achieve desired microstructures, the application of the
framework is exemplified by the control of fluid deformations in a microfluidic
channel by deliberately placing a sequence of pillars. Learning of a multistep
topological transform has significant implications for rapid advances in
material science and biomedical applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider compressive sensing (CS)-based recovery of delays
and Doppler frequencies of targets in high resolution radars. We propose a
novel sub-Nyquist sampling method in the Fourier domain based on difference
sets (DS), called DS-sampling, to create dictionaries with highly incoherent
atoms. The coherence of the dictionary reaches the Welch minimum bound if the
DS-sampling is employed. This property let us to implement sub-Nyquist high
resolution radars with minimum number of samples. We also develop a low
complexity recovery method, based on structured CS and propose a new waveform,
called difference set--frequency coded modulated (DS-FCM) waveform, to boost
the recovery performance of the sub-Nyquist radar in noisy environments. The
proposed method solves some of the common problems in many CS-based radars and
overcome disadvantages of the conventional Nyquist processing, i.e. matched
filtering in high resolution radar systems. The proposed method allows us to
design sub-Nyquist radars, which require less than 2% of Nyquist samples and
recover targets without resolution degradation in comparison to the
conventional Nyquist processing.

that will provide improved coverage for massive number of low-throughput
low-cost devices with low device power consumption in delay-tolerant
applications. A new single tone signal with frequency hopping has been designed
for NB-IoT physical random access channel (NPRACH). In this letter we describe
this new NPRACH design and explain in detail the design rationale. We further
propose possible receiver algorithms for NPRACH detection and time-of-arrival
estimation. Simulation results on NPRACH performance including detection rate,
false alarm rate, and time-of-arrival estimation accuracy are presented to shed
light on the overall potential of NB-IoT systems.

 <dc:description>  The information flow problem on a network asks whether $r$ senders, $v_1,v_2,

\ldots ,v_{n+r}$ via intermediate nodes $v_{r+1}, \ldots ,v_n$. For a given

on $N_n(\{1,2, \ldots ,r\})$ can be solved for all $n \geq r$. We also show
that for any finite $R$ such that $\gcd(R)=1$ and $r = \max(R)$, we show that

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art methods for zero-shot visual recognition formulate learning
as a joint embedding problem of images and side information. In these
formulations the current best complement to visual features are attributes:
manually encoded vectors describing shared characteristics among categories.
Despite good performance, attributes have limitations: (1) finer-grained
recognition requires commensurately more attributes, and (2) attributes do not
provide a natural language interface. We propose to overcome these limitations
by training neural language models from scratch; i.e. without pre-training and
only consuming words and characters. Our proposed models train end-to-end to
align with the fine-grained and category-specific content of images. Natural
language provides a flexible and compact way of encoding only the salient
visual aspects for distinguishing categories. By training on raw text, our
model can do inference on raw text as well, providing humans a familiar mode
both for annotation and retrieval. Our model achieves strong performance on
zero-shot text-based image retrieval and significantly outperforms the
attribute-based state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the Caltech
UCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset.

 <dc:description>  Automatic synthesis of realistic images from text would be interesting and
useful, but current AI systems are still far from this goal. However, in recent
years generic and powerful recurrent neural network architectures have been
developed to learn discriminative text feature representations. Meanwhile, deep
convolutional generative adversarial networks (GANs) have begun to generate
highly compelling images of specific categories, such as faces, album covers,
and room interiors. In this work, we develop a novel deep architecture and GAN
formulation to effectively bridge these advances in text and image model- ing,
translating visual concepts from characters to pixels. We demonstrate the
capability of our model to generate plausible images of birds and flowers from
detailed text descriptions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to measure the impact of the
'woman card' exchange between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Building from a
unique dataset of the two candidates' Twitter followers, we first examine the
transition dynamics of the two candidates' Twitter followers one week before
the exchange and one week after. Then we train a convolutional neural network
to classify the gender of the followers and unfollowers, and study how women in
particular are reacting to the 'woman card' exchange. Our study suggests that
the 'woman card' comment has made women more likely to follow Hillary Clinton,
less likely to unfollow her and that it has apparently not affected the gender
composition of Trump followers.

 <dc:description>  We present a statistical mechanical theory of the process of annotating an
object with terms selected from an ontology. The term selection process is
formulated as an ideal lattice gas model, but in a highly structured
inhomogeneous field. The model enables us to explain patterns recently observed
in real-world annotation data sets, in terms of the underlying graph structure
of the ontology. By relating the external field strengths to the information
content of each node in the ontology graph, the statistical mechanical model
also allows us to propose a number of practical metrics for assessing the
quality of both the ontology, and the annotations that arise from its use.
Using the statistical mechanical formalism we also study an ensemble of
ontologies of differing size and complexity; an analysis not readily performed
using real data alone. Focusing on regular tree ontology graphs we uncover a
rich set of scaling laws describing the growth in the optimal ontology size as
the number of objects being annotated increases. In doing so we provide a
further possible measure for assessment of ontologies.

 <dc:description>  Indexed pattern search in text has been studied for many decades. For small
alphabets, the FM-Index provides unmatched performance, in terms of both space
required and search speed. For large alphabets -- for example, when the tokens
are words -- the situation is more complex, and FM-Index representations are
compact, but potentially slow. In this paper we apply recent innovations from
the field of inverted indexing and document retrieval to compressed pattern
search, including for alphabets into the millions. Commencing with the
practical compressed suffix array structure developed by Sadakane, we show that
the Elias-Fano code-based approach to document indexing can be adapted to
provide new tradeoff options in indexed pattern search, and offers
significantly faster pattern processing compared to previous implementations,
as well as reduced space requirements. We report a detailed experimental
evaluation that demonstrates the relative advantages of the new approach, using
the standard Pizza&amp;Chili methodology and files, as well as applied use-cases
derived from large-scale data compression, and from natural language
processing. For large alphabets, the new structure gives rise to space
requirements that are close to those of the most highly-compressed FM-Index
variants, in conjunction with unparalleled search throughput rates.

 <dc:title>Are Facial Attributes Adversarially Robust?</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Facial attributes are emerging soft biometrics that have the potential to
reject non-matches, for example, based on mismatching gender. To be usable in
stand-alone systems, facial attributes must be extracted from images
automatically and reliably. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective
solution for automatic facial attribute extraction by training a deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN) for each facial attribute separately,
without using any pre-training or dataset augmentation, and we obtain new
state-of-the-art facial attribute classification results on the CelebA
benchmark. To test the stability of the networks, we generated adversarial
images -- formed by adding imperceptible non-random perturbations to original
inputs which result in classification errors -- via a novel fast flipping
attribute (FFA) technique. We show that FFA generates more adversarial examples
than other related algorithms, and that DCNNs for certain attributes are
generally robust to adversarial inputs, while DCNNs for other attributes are
not. This result is surprising because no DCNNs tested to date have exhibited
robustness to adversarial images without explicit augmentation in the training
procedure to account for adversarial examples. Finally, we introduce the
concept of natural adversarial samples, i.e., images that are misclassified but
can be easily turned into correctly classified images by applying small
perturbations. We demonstrate that natural adversarial samples commonly occur,
even within the training set, and show that many of these images remain
misclassified even with additional training epochs. This phenomenon is
surprising because correcting the misclassification, particularly when guided
by training data, should require only a small adjustment to the DCNN
parameters.

 <dc:description>  The explosion in the volumes of data being stored online has resulted in
distributed storage systems transitioning to erasure coding based schemes. Yet,
the codes being deployed in practice are fairly short. In this work, we address
what we view as the main coding theoretic barrier to deploying longer codes in
storage: at large lengths, failures are not independent and correlated failures
are inevitable. This motivates designing codes that allow quick data recovery
even after large correlated failures, and which have efficient encoding and
decoding. We propose that code design for distributed storage be viewed as a
two-step process. The first step is choose a topology of the code, which
incorporates knowledge about the correlated failures that need to be handled,
and ensures local recovery from such failures. In the second step one specifies
a code with the chosen topology by choosing coefficients from a finite field.
In this step, one tries to balance reliability (which is better over larger
fields) with encoding and decoding efficiency (which is better over smaller
fields). This work initiates an in-depth study of this reliability/efficiency
tradeoff. We consider the field-size needed for achieving maximal
recoverability: the strongest reliability possible with a given topology. We
propose a family of topologies called grid-like topologies which unify a number
of topologies considered both in theory and practice, and prove a collection of
results about maximally recoverable codes in such topologies including the
first super-polynomial lower bound on the field size.

 <dc:description>  An open challenge in constructing dialogue systems is developing methods for
automatically learning dialogue strategies from large amounts of unlabelled
data. Recent work has proposed Next-Utterance-Classification (NUC) as a
surrogate task for building dialogue systems from text data. In this paper we
investigate the performance of humans on this task to validate the relevance of
NUC as a method of evaluation. Our results show three main findings: (1) humans
are able to correctly classify responses at a rate much better than chance,
thus confirming that the task is feasible, (2) human performance levels vary
across task domains (we consider 3 datasets) and expertise levels (novice vs
experts), thus showing that a range of performance is possible on this type of
task, (3) automated dialogue systems built using state-of-the-art machine
learning methods have similar performance to the human novices, but worse than
the experts, thus confirming the utility of this class of tasks for driving
further research in automated dialogue systems.

 <dc:description>  Gait and static body measurement are important biometric technologies for
passive human recognition. Many previous works argue that recognition
performance based completely on the gait feature is limited. The reason for
this limited performance remains unclear. This study focuses on human
recognition with gait feature obtained by Kinect and shows that gait feature
can effectively distinguish from different human beings through a novel
representation -- relative distance-based gait features. Experimental results
show that the recognition accuracy with relative distance features reaches up
to 85%, which is comparable with that of anthropometric features. The
combination of relative distance features and anthropometric features can
provide an accuracy of more than 95%. Results indicate that the relative
distance feature is quite effective and worthy of further study in more general
scenarios (e.g., without Kinect).

 <dc:description>  Recent work in learning vector-space embeddings for multi-relational data has
focused on combining relational information derived from knowledge bases with
distributional information derived from large text corpora. We propose a simple
approach that leverages the descriptions of entities or phrases available in
lexical resources, in conjunction with distributional semantics, in order to
derive a better initialization for training relational models. Applying this
initialization to the TransE model results in significant new state-of-the-art
performances on the WordNet dataset, decreasing the mean rank from the previous
best of 212 to 51. It also results in faster convergence of the entity
representations. We find that there is a trade-off between improving the mean
rank and the hits@10 with this approach. This illustrates that much remains to
be understood regarding performance improvements in relational models.

 <dc:description>  Computing has revolutionized the biological sciences over the past several
decades, such that virtually all contemporary research in the biosciences
utilizes computer programs. The computational advances have come on many
fronts, spurred by fundamental developments in hardware, software, and
algorithms. These advances have influenced, and even engendered, a phenomenal
array of bioscience fields, including molecular evolution and bioinformatics;
genome-, proteome-, transcriptome- and metabolome-wide experimental studies;
structural genomics; and atomistic simulations of cellular-scale molecular
assemblies as large as ribosomes and intact viruses. In short, much of
post-genomic biology is increasingly becoming a form of computational biology.
The ability to design and write computer programs is among the most
indispensable skills that a modern researcher can cultivate. Python has become
a popular programming language in the biosciences, largely because (i) its
straightforward semantics and clean syntax make it a readily accessible first
language; (ii) it is expressive and well-suited to object-oriented programming,
as well as other modern paradigms; and (iii) the many available libraries and
third-party toolkits extend the functionality of the core language into
virtually every biological domain (sequence and structure analyses,
phylogenomics, workflow management systems, etc.). This primer offers a basic
introduction to coding, via Python, and it includes concrete examples and
exercises to illustrate the language's usage and capabilities; the main text
culminates with a final project in structural bioinformatics. A suite of
Supplemental Chapters is also provided. Starting with basic concepts, such as
that of a 'variable', the Chapters methodically advance the reader to the point
of writing a graphical user interface to compute the Hamming distance between
two DNA sequences.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses a novel data science problem, prescriptive price
optimization, which derives the optimal price strategy to maximize future
profit/revenue on the basis of massive predictive formulas produced by machine
learning. The prescriptive price optimization first builds sales forecast
formulas of multiple products, on the basis of historical data, which reveal
complex relationships between sales and prices, such as price elasticity of
demand and cannibalization. Then, it constructs a mathematical optimization
problem on the basis of those predictive formulas. We present that the
optimization problem can be formulated as an instance of binary quadratic
programming (BQP). Although BQP problems are NP-hard in general and
computationally intractable, we propose a fast approximation algorithm using a
semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation, which is closely related to the
Goemans-Williamson's Max-Cut approximation. Our experiments on simulation and
real retail datasets show that our prescriptive price optimization
simultaneously derives the optimal prices of tens/hundreds products with
practical computational time, that potentially improve 8.2% of gross profit of
those products.

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of predicting lexical entailment using distributional

was previously shown to only measure the prototypicality of word pairs. We find
that the model strongly learns to identify hypernyms using Hearst patterns,
which are well known to be predictive of lexical relations. We present a novel
model which exploits this behavior as a method of feature extraction in an
iterative procedure similar to Principal Component Analysis. Our model combines
the extracted features with the strengths of other proposed models in the
literature, and matches or outperforms prior work on multiple data sets.

 <dc:description>  The problem of exactly summing n floating-point numbers is a fundamental
problem that has many applications in large-scale simulations and computational
geometry. Unfortunately, due to the round-off error in standard floating-point
operations, this problem becomes very challenging. Moreover, all existing
solutions rely on sequential algorithms which cannot scale to the huge datasets
that need to be processed.
  In this paper, we provide several efficient parallel algorithms for summing n
floating point numbers, so as to produce a faithfully rounded floating-point
representation of the sum. We present algorithms in PRAM, external-memory, and
MapReduce models, and we also provide an experimental analysis of our MapReduce
algorithms, due to their simplicity and practical efficiency.

 <dc:title>The Blockchain Anomaly</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Natoli, Christopher</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most popular blockchain solutions, like Bitcoin, rely on proof-of-work,
guaranteeing that the output of the consensus is agreed upon with high
probability. However, this probability depends on the delivery of messages and
that the computational power of the system is sufficiently scattered among
pools of nodes in the network so that no pool can mine more blocks faster than
the crowd. New approaches, like Ethereum, generalise the proof-of-work approach
by letting individuals deploy their own private blockchain with high
transaction throughput. As companies are starting to deploy private chains, it
has become crucial to better understand the guarantees blockchains offer in
such a small and controlled environment.
  In this paper, we present the \emph{Blockchain Anomaly}, an execution that we
experienced when building our private chain at NICTA/Data61. Even though this
anomaly has never been acknowledged before, it may translate into dramatic
consequences for the user of blockchains. Named after the infamous Paxos
anomaly, this anomaly makes dependent transactions, like &quot;Bob sends money to
Carole after he received money from Alice&quot; impossible. This anomaly relies on
the fact that existing blockchains do not ensure consensus safety
deterministically: there is no way for Bob to make sure that Alice actually
sent him coins without Bob using an external mechanism, like converting these
coins into a fiat currency that allows him to withdraw. We also explore smart
contracts as a potential alternative to transactions in order to freeze coins,
and show implementations of smart contract that can suffer from the Blockchain
anomaly and others that may cope with it.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in image captioning task have led to increasing interests in
video captioning task. However, most works on video captioning are focused on
generating single input of aggregated features, which hardly deviates from
image captioning process and does not fully take advantage of dynamic contents
present in videos. We attempt to generate video captions that convey richer
contents by temporally segmenting the video with action localization,
generating multiple captions from multiple frames, and connecting them with
natural language processing techniques, in order to generate a story-like
caption. We show that our proposed method can generate captions that are richer
in contents and can compete with state-of-the-art method without explicitly
using video-level features as input.

 <dc:title>The Bees Algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this thesis we present a new algorithm for the Vehicle Routing Problem
called the Enhanced Bees Algorithm. It is adapted from a fairly recent
algorithm, the Bees Algorithm, which was developed for continuous optimisation
problems. We show that the results obtained by the Enhanced Bees Algorithm are
competitive with the best meta-heuristics available for the Vehicle Routing
Problem (within 0.5% of the optimal solution for common benchmark problems). We
show that the algorithm has good runtime performance, producing results within
2% of the optimal solution within 60 seconds, making it suitable for use within
real world dispatch scenarios.

 <dc:title>Dual Local-Global Contextual Pathways for Recognition in Aerial Imagery</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Marcu, Alina</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Leordeanu, Marius</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Visual context is important in object recognition and it is still an open
problem in computer vision. Along with the advent of deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN), using contextual information with such systems starts to
receive attention in the literature. At the same time, aerial imagery is
gaining momentum. While advances in deep learning make good progress in aerial
image analysis, this problem still poses many great challenges. Aerial images
are often taken under poor lighting conditions and contain low resolution
objects, many times occluded by trees or taller buildings. In this domain, in
particular, visual context could be of great help, but there are still very few
papers that consider context in aerial image understanding. Here we introduce
context as a complementary way of recognizing objects. We propose a dual-stream
deep neural network model that processes information along two independent
pathways, one for local and another for global visual reasoning. The two are
later combined in the final layers of processing. Our model learns to combine
local object appearance as well as information from the larger scene at the
same time and in a complementary way, such that together they form a powerful
classifier. We test our dual-stream network on the task of segmentation of
buildings and roads in aerial images and obtain state-of-the-art results on the
Massachusetts Buildings Dataset. We also introduce two new datasets, for
buildings and road segmentation, respectively, and study the relative
importance of local appearance vs. the larger scene, as well as their
performance in combination. While our local-global model could also be useful
in general recognition tasks, we clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of
visual context in conjunction with deep nets for aerial image understanding.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of image segmentation using superpixels.
We propose two approaches to enhance the discriminative ability of the
superpixel's covariance descriptors. In the first one, we employ the
Log-Euclidean distance as the metric on the covariance manifolds, and then use
the RBF kernel to measure the similarities between covariance descriptors. The
second method is focused on extracting the subspace structure of the set of
covariance descriptors by extending a low rank representation algorithm on to
the covariance manifolds. Experiments are carried out with the Berkly
Segmentation Dataset, and compared with the state-of-the-art segmentation
algorithms, both methods are competitive.

 <dc:title>Non-negativity constraints in the one-dimensional discrete-time phase

 <dc:description>  Phase retrieval problems occur in a width range of applications in physics
and engineering such as crystallography, astronomy, and laser optics. Common to
all of them is the recovery of an unknown signal from the intensity of its
Fourier transform. Because of the well-known ambiguousness of these problems,
the determination of the original signal is generally challenging. Although
there are many approaches in the literature to incorporate the assumption of
non-negativity of the solution into numerical algorithms, theoretical
considerations about the solvability with this constraint occur rarely. In this
paper, we consider the one-dimensional discrete-time setting and investigate
whether the usually applied a priori non-negativity can overcame the
ambiguousness of the phase retrieval problem or not. We show that the assumed
non-negativity of the solution is usually not a sufficient a priori condition
to ensure uniqueness in one-dimensional phase retrieval. More precisely, using
an appropriate characterization of the occurring ambiguities, we show that
neither the uniqueness nor the ambiguousness are rare exceptions.

 <dc:description>  Incremental stability is a property of dynamical systems ensuring the uniform
asymptotic stability of each trajectory rather than a fixed equilibrium point
or trajectory. Here, we introduce a notion of incremental stability for
stochastic control systems and provide its description in terms of existence of
a notion of so-called incremental Lyapunov functions. Moreover, we provide a
backstepping controller design scheme providing controllers along with
corresponding incremental Lyapunov functions rendering a class of stochastic
control systems, namely, stochastic Hamiltonian systems with jumps,
incrementally stable. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
we design a controller making a spring pendulum system in a noisy environment
incrementally stable.

 <dc:description>  Mobile-edge computing (MEC) is an emerging paradigm to meet the
ever-increasing computation demands from mobile applications. By offloading the
computationally intensive workloads to the MEC server, the quality of
computation experience, e.g., the execution latency, could be greatly improved.
Nevertheless, as the on-device battery capacities are limited, computation
would be interrupted when the battery energy runs out. To provide satisfactory
computation performance as well as achieving green computing, it is of
significant importance to seek renewable energy sources to power mobile devices
via energy harvesting (EH) technologies. In this paper, we will investigate a
green MEC system with EH devices and develop an effective computation
offloading strategy. The execution cost, which addresses both the execution
latency and task failure, is adopted as the performance metric. A
low-complexity online algorithm, namely, the Lyapunov optimization-based
dynamic computation offloading (LODCO) algorithm is proposed, which jointly
decides the offloading decision, the CPU-cycle frequencies for mobile
execution, and the transmit power for computation offloading. A unique
advantage of this algorithm is that the decisions depend only on the
instantaneous side information without requiring distribution information of
the computation task request, the wireless channel, and EH processes. The
implementation of the algorithm only requires to solve a deterministic problem
in each time slot, for which the optimal solution can be obtained either in
closed form or by bisection search. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is shown
to be asymptotically optimal via rigorous analysis. Sample simulation results
shall be presented to verify the theoretical analysis as well as validate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Neural networks require a careful design in order to perform properly on a
given task. In particular, selecting a good activation function (possibly in a
data-dependent fashion) is a crucial step, which remains an open problem in the
research community. Despite a large amount of investigations, most current
implementations simply select one fixed function from a small set of
candidates, which is not adapted during training, and is shared among all
neurons throughout the different layers. However, neither two of these
assumptions can be supposed optimal in practice. In this paper, we present a
principled way to have data-dependent adaptation of the activation functions,
which is performed independently for each neuron. This is achieved by
leveraging over past and present advances on cubic spline interpolation,
allowing for local adaptation of the functions around their regions of use. The
resulting algorithm is relatively cheap to implement, and overfitting is
counterbalanced by the inclusion of a novel damping criterion, which penalizes
unwanted oscillations from a predefined shape. Experimental results validate
the proposal over two well-known benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications have been postulated as one of the
most disruptive technologies for future 5G systems. Among mmWave bands the
60-GHz radio technology is specially suited for ultradense small cells and
mobile data offloading scenarios. Many challenges remain to be addressed in
mmWave communications but among them deafness, or misalignment between
transmitter and receivers beams, and interference management lie among the most
prominent ones. In the recent years, scenarios considering negligible
interference on mmWave resource allocation have been rather common in
literature. To this end, interestingly, many open issues still need to be
addressed such as the applicability of noise-limited regime for mmWave.
Furthermore, in mmWave the beam-steering mechanism imposes a forced silence
period, in the course of which no data can be conveyed, that should not be
neglected in throughput/delay calculations. This paper introduces mmWave
enabled Small Cell Networks (SCNs) with relaying capabilities where as a result
of a coordinated meta-heuristically optimized beamwidth/alignment-delay
approach overall system throughput is optimized. Simulations have been conveyed
for three transmitter densities under TDMA and naive 'all-on' scheduling
producing average per node throughput increments of up to 248%. The paper
further elaborates on the off-balancing impact of alignment delay and
time-multiplexing strategies by illustrating how the foreseen transition that
increasing the number of transmitters produces in the regime of a fixed-node
size SCN in downlink operation fades out by a poor choice in the scheduling
strategy.

 <dc:description>  The application of mobile computing is currently altering patterns of our
behavior to a greater degree than perhaps any other invention. In combination
with the introduction of power efficient wireless communication technologies,
such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), designers are today increasingly empowered
to shape the way we interact with our physical surroundings and thus build
entirely new experiences. However, our evaluations of BLE and its abilities to
facilitate mobile location-based experiences in public environments revealed a
number of potential problems. Most notably, the position and orientation of the
user in combination with various environmental factors, such as crowds of
people traversing the space, were found to cause major fluctuations of the
received BLE signal strength. These issues are rendering a seamless functioning
of any location-based application practically impossible. Instead of achieving
seamlessness by eliminating these technical issues, we thus choose to advocate
the use of a seamful approach, i.e. to reveal and exploit these problems and
turn them into a part of the actual experience. In order to demonstrate the
viability of this approach, we designed, implemented and evaluated the Ghost
Detector - an educational location-based museum game for children. By
presenting a qualitative evaluation of this game and by motivating our design
decisions, this paper provides insight into some of the challenges and possible
solutions connected to the process of developing location-based BLE-enabled
experiences for public cultural spaces.

 <dc:description>  Weakly-supervised object localization methods tend to fail for object classes
that consistently co-occur with the same background elements, e.g. trains on
tracks. We propose a method to overcome these failures by adding a very small
amount of model-specific additional annotation. The main idea is to cluster a
deep network's mid-level representations and assign object or distractor labels
to each cluster. Experiments show substantially improved localization results
on the challenging ILSVC2014 dataset for bounding box detection and the PASCAL
VOC2012 dataset for semantic segmentation.

 <dc:description>  The Shortest Superstring Problem (SSP) consists, for a set of strings S =
{s_1,...,s_n}, to find a minimum length string that contains all s_i, 1 &lt;= i &lt;=
k, as substrings. This problem is proved to be NP-Complete and APX-hard.
Guaranteed approximation algorithms have been proposed, the current best ratio
being 2+11/23, which has been achieved following a long and difficult quest.
However, SSP is highly used in practice on next generation sequencing (NGS)
data, which plays an increasingly important role in sequencing. In this note,
we show that the SSP approximation ratio can be improved on NGS reads by
assuming specific characteristics of NGS data that are experimentally verified
on a very large sampling set.

 <dc:description>  Background: Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a
popular tool for structural determination of biological macromolecular
complexes. High-resolution cryo-EM reconstruction often requires hundreds of
thousands of single-particle images. Particle extraction from experimental
micrographs thus can be laborious and presents a major practical bottleneck in
cryo-EM structural determination. Existing computational methods of particle
picking often use low-resolution templates as inputs for particle matching,
making it possible to cause reference-dependent bias. It is critical to develop
a highly efficient template-free method to automatically recognize particle
images from cryo-EM micrographs. Results: We developed a deep learning-based
algorithmic framework, DeepEM, for single-particle recognition from noisy
cryo-EM micrographs, enabling automated particle picking, selection and
verification in an integrated fashion. The kernel of DeepEM is built upon a
convolutional neural network (CNN) of eight layers, which can be recursively
trained to be highly &quot;knowledgeable&quot;. Our approach exhibits improved
performance and high precision when tested on the standard KLH dataset.
Application of DeepEM to several challenging experimental cryo-EM datasets
demonstrates its capability in avoiding selection of un-wanted particles and
non-particles even when true particles contain fewer features. Conclusions: The
DeepEM method derived from a deep CNN allows automated particle extraction from
raw cryo-EM micrographs in the absence of templates, which demonstrated
improved performance, objectivity and accuracy. Application of this novel
approach is expected to free the labor involved in single-particle
verification, thus promoting the efficiency of cryo-EM data processing.

 <dc:title>Partitions of planar point sets into polygons</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Diwan, Ajit Arvind</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we characterize planar point sets that can be partitioned into
disjoint polygons of arbitrarily specified sizes. We provide an algorithm to
construct such a partition, if it exists, in polynomial time. We show that this
problem is equivalent to finding a specified $2$-factor in the visibility graph
of the point set. The characterization for the case where all cycles have
length $3$ also translates to finding a $K_3$-factor of the visibility graph of
the point set. We show that the generalized problem of finding a $K_k$-factor
of the visibility graph of a given point set for $k \geq 5$ is NP-hard.

 <dc:title>Stealing PINs via Mobile Sensors: Actual Risk versus User Perception</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the actual risks of stealing user PINs by using
mobile sensors versus the perceived risks by users. First, we propose
PINlogger.js which is a JavaScript-based side channel attack revealing user
PINs on an Android mobile phone. In this attack, once the user visits a website
controlled by an attacker, the JavaScript code embedded in the web page starts
listening to the motion and orientation sensor streams without needing any
permission from the user. By analysing these streams, it infers the user's PIN
using an artificial neural network. Based on a test set of fifty 4-digit PINs,
PINlogger.js is able to correctly identify PINs in the first attempt with a
success rate of 74% which increases to 86 and 94% in the second and third
attempts, respectively. The high success rates of stealing user PINs on mobile
devices via JavaScript indicate a serious threat to user security. With the
technical understanding of the information leakage caused by mobile phone
sensors, we then study users' perception of the risks associated with these
sensors. We design user studies to measure the general familiarity with
different sensors and their functionality, and to investigate how concerned
users are about their PIN being discovered by an app that has access to all
these sensors. Our studies show that there is significant disparity between the
actual and perceived levels of threat with regard to the compromise of the user
PIN. We confirm our results by interviewing our participants using two
different approaches, within-subject and between-subject, and compare the
results. We discuss how this observation, along with other factors, renders
many academic and industry solutions ineffective in preventing such side
channel attacks.

 <dc:title>Efficient Algorithms for Time- and Cost-Bounded Probabilistic Model
  Checking</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Hahn, Ernst Moritz</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the design of probabilistic timed systems, bounded requirements concerning
behaviour that occurs within a given time, energy, or more generally cost
budget are of central importance. Traditionally, such requirements have been
model-checked via a reduction to the unbounded case by unfolding the model
according to the cost bound. This exacerbates the state space explosion problem
and significantly increases runtime. In this paper, we present three new
algorithms to model-check time- and cost-bounded properties for Markov decision
processes and probabilistic timed automata that avoid unfolding. They are based
on a modified value iteration process, on an enumeration of schedulers, and on
state elimination techniques. We can now obtain results for any cost bound on a
single state space no larger than for the corresponding unbounded or
expected-value property. In particular, we can naturally compute the cumulative
distribution function at no overhead. We evaluate the applicability and compare
the performance of our new algorithms and their implementation on a number of
case studies from the literature.

 <dc:description>  We consider a special family of SC-LDPC codes, that is, time-invariant LDPCC
codes, which are known in the literature for a long time. Codes of this kind
are usually designed by starting from QC block codes, and applying suitable
unwrapping procedures. We show that, by directly designing the LDPCC code
syndrome former matrix without the constraints of the underlying QC block code,
it is possible to achieve smaller constraint lengths with respect to the best
solutions available in the literature. We also find theoretical lower bounds on
the syndrome former constraint length for codes with a specified minimum length
of the local cycles in their Tanner graphs. For this purpose, we exploit a new
approach based on a numerical representation of the syndrome former matrix,
which generalizes over a technique we already used to study a special subclass
of the codes here considered.

 <dc:description>  Over nearly three decades at the University of Wisconsin, Jeff Naughton has
left an indelible mark on computer science. He has been a global leader of the
database research field, deepening its core and pushing its boundaries. Many of
Naughton's ideas were translated directly into practice in commercial and
open-source systems. But software comes and goes. In the end, it is the ideas
themselves that have had impact, ideas written down in papers.
  Naughton has been a prolific scholar over the last thirty years, with over
175 publications in his bibliography, covering a wide range of topics. This
document does not attempt to enumerate or even summarize the wealth of ideas
that Naughton has published over the course of his academic career--the task is
too daunting. Instead, the best this short note aims to do is to serve as a
rough map of the territory: something to help other researchers navigate the
wide spaces of Naughton's work.

 <dc:title>A General Characterization of Sync Word for Asynchronous Communication</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study a problem of sequential frame synchronization for a frame
transmitted uniformly in $A$ slots. For a discrete memoryless channel (DMC),
Venkat Chandar et al showed that the frame length $N$ must scale with $A$ as
$e^{N \alpha(Q)} &gt; A$ for the frame synchronization error to go to zero
(asymptotically with $A$). Here, $Q$ denotes the transition probabilities of
the DMC and $\alpha(Q)$, defined as the synchronization threshold,
characterizes the scaling needed of $N$ for asymptotic error free frame
synchronization. We show that the asynchronous communication framework permits
a natural tradeoff between the sync frame length $N$ and the channel (usually
parameterised by the input). For an AWGN channel, we study this tradeoff
between the sync frame length $N$ and the input symbol power $P$ and
characterise the scaling needed of the sync frame energy $E = N P$ for optimal
frame synchronisation.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there is rising interest in modelling the interactions of two
sentences with deep neural networks. However, most of the existing methods
encode two sequences with separate encoders, in which a sentence is encoded
with little or no information from the other sentence. In this paper, we
propose a deep architecture to model the strong interaction of sentence pair
with two coupled-LSTMs. Specifically, we introduce two coupled ways to model
the interdependences of two LSTMs, coupling the local contextualized
interactions of two sentences. We then aggregate these interactions and use a
dynamic pooling to select the most informative features. Experiments on two
very large datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architecture and
its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the extent to which spectrum sharing in mmWave
networks with multiple cellular operators is a viable alternative to
traditional dedicated spectrum allocation. Specifically, we develop a general
mathematical framework by which to characterize the performance gain that can
be obtained when spectrum sharing is used, as a function of the underlying
beamforming, operator coordination, bandwidth, and infrastructure sharing
scenarios. The framework is based on joint beamforming and cell association
optimization, with the objective of maximizing the long-term throughput of the
users. Our asymptotic and non-asymptotic performance analyses reveal five key
points: (1) spectrum sharing with light on-demand intra- and inter-operator
coordination is feasible, especially at higher mmWave frequencies (for example,
73 GHz), (2) directional communications at the user equipment substantially
alleviate the potential disadvantages of spectrum sharing (such as higher
multiuser interference), (3) large numbers of antenna elements can reduce the
need for coordination and simplify the implementation of spectrum sharing, (4)
while inter-operator coordination can be neglected in the large-antenna regime,
intra-operator coordination can still bring gains by balancing the network
load, and (5) critical control signals among base stations, operators, and user
equipment should be protected from the adverse effects of spectrum sharing, for
example by means of exclusive resource allocation. The results of this paper,
and their extensions obtained by relaxing some ideal assumptions, can provide
important insights for future standardization and spectrum policy.

 <dc:description>  Many real world datasets subsume a linear or non-linear low-rank structure in
a very low-dimensional space. Unfortunately, one often has very little or no
information about the geometry of the space, resulting in a highly
under-determined recovery problem. Under certain circumstances,
state-of-the-art algorithms provide an exact recovery for linear low-rank
structures but at the expense of highly inscalable algorithms which use nuclear
norm. However, the case of non-linear structures remains unresolved. We revisit
the problem of low-rank recovery from a totally different perspective,
involving graphs which encode pairwise similarity between the data samples and
features. Surprisingly, our analysis confirms that it is possible to recover
many approximate linear and non-linear low-rank structures with recovery
guarantees with a set of highly scalable and efficient algorithms. We call such
data matrices as \textit{Low-Rank matrices on graphs} and show that many real
world datasets satisfy this assumption approximately due to underlying
stationarity. Our detailed theoretical and experimental analysis unveils the
power of the simple, yet very novel recovery framework \textit{Fast Robust PCA
on Graphs}

 <dc:description>  The introduction of automated flight control and management systems have made
possible aircraft designs that sacrifice arodynamic stability in order to
incorporate stealth technology intro their shape, operate more efficiently, and
are highly maneuverable. Therefore, modern flight management systems are
reliant on multiple redundant sensors to monitor and control the rotations of
the aircraft. To this end, a novel distributed quaternion Kalman filtering
algorithm is developed for tracking the rotation and orientation of an aircraft
in the three-dimensional space. The algorithm is developed to distribute
computation among the sensors in a manner that forces them to consent to a
unique solution while being robust to sensor and link failure, a desirable
characteristic for flight management systems. In addition, the underlying
quaternion-valued state space model allows to avoid problems associated with
gimbal lock. The performance of the developed algorithm is verified through
simulations.

 <dc:title>MapReduce and Streaming Algorithms for Diversity Maximization in Metric

 <dc:description>  Given a dataset of points in a metric space and an integer $k$, a diversity
maximization problem requires determining a subset of $k$ points maximizing
some diversity objective measure, e.g., the minimum or the average distance
between two points in the subset. Diversity maximization is computationally
hard, hence only approximate solutions can be hoped for. Although its
applications are mainly in massive data analysis, most of the past research on
diversity maximization focused on the sequential setting. In this work we
present space and pass/round-efficient diversity maximization algorithms for
the Streaming and MapReduce models and analyze their approximation guarantees
for the relevant class of metric spaces of bounded doubling dimension. Like
other approaches in the literature, our algorithms rely on the determination of
high-quality core-sets, i.e., (much) smaller subsets of the input which contain
good approximations to the optimal solution for the whole input. For a variety
of diversity objective functions, our algorithms attain an
$(\alpha+\epsilon)$-approximation ratio, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, where
$\alpha$ is the best approximation ratio achieved by a polynomial-time,
linear-space sequential algorithm for the same diversity objective. This
improves substantially over the approximation ratios attainable in Streaming
and MapReduce by state-of-the-art algorithms for general metric spaces. We
provide extensive experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our algorithms
on both real world and synthetic datasets, scaling up to over a billion points.

 <dc:description>  As ISPs face IPv4 address scarcity they increasingly turn to network address
translation (NAT) to accommodate the address needs of their customers.
Recently, ISPs have moved beyond employing NATs only directly at individual
customers and instead begun deploying Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) to apply
address translation to many independent and disparate endpoints spanning
physical locations, a phenomenon that so far has received little in the way of
empirical assessment. In this work we present a broad and systematic study of
the deployment and behavior of these middleboxes. We develop a methodology to
detect the existence of hosts behind CGNs by extracting non-routable IP
addresses from peer lists we obtain by crawling the BitTorrent DHT. We
complement this approach with improvements to our Netalyzr troubleshooting
service, enabling us to determine a range of indicators of CGN presence as well
as detailed insights into key properties of CGNs. Combining the two data
sources we illustrate the scope of CGN deployment on today's Internet, and
report on characteristics of commonly deployed CGNs and their effect on end
users.

 <dc:title>Slotless Protocols for Fast and Energy-Efficient Neighbor Discovery</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In mobile ad-hoc networks, neighbor discovery protocols are used to find
surrounding devices and to establish a first contact between them. Since the
clocks of the devices are not synchronized and their energy-budgets are
limited, usually duty-cycled, asynchronous discovery protocols are applied.
Only if two devices are awake at the same point in time, they can rendezvous.
Currently, time-slotted protocols, which subdivide time into multiple intervals
with equal lengths (slots), are considered to be the most efficient discovery
schemes. In this paper, we break away from the assumption of slotted time. We
propose a novel, continuous-time discovery protocol, which temporally decouples
beaconing and listening. Each device periodically sends packets with a certain
interval, and periodically listens for a given duration with a different
interval. By optimizing these interval lengths, we show that this scheme can,
to the best of our knowledge, outperform all known protocols such as DISCO,
U-Connect or Searchlight significantly. For example, Searchlight takes up to
740 % longer than our proposed technique to discover a device with the same
duty-cycle. Further, our proposed technique can also be applied in widely-used
asymmetric purely interval-based protocols such as ANT or Bluetooth Low Energy.

 <dc:description>  Consensus protocols are the foundation for building many fault-tolerant
distributed systems and services. This paper posits that there are significant
performance benefits to be gained by offering consensus as a network service
(CAANS). CAANS leverages recent advances in commodity networking hardware
design and programmability to implement consensus protocol logic in network
devices. CAANS provides a complete Paxos protocol, is a drop-in replacement for
software-based implementations of Paxos, makes no restrictions on network
topologies, and is implemented in a higher-level, data-plane programming
language, allowing for portability across a range of target devices. At the
same time, CAANS significantly increases throughput and reduces latency for
consensus operations. Consensus logic executing in hardware can transmit
consensus messages at line speed, with latency only slightly higher than simply
forwarding packets.

 <dc:title>Detecting Novel Processes with CANDIES -- An Holistic Novelty Detection
  Technique based on Probabilistic Models</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gruhl, Christian</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Sick, Bernhard</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this article, we propose CANDIES (Combined Approach for Novelty Detection
in Intelligent Embedded Systems), a new approach to novelty detection in
technical systems. We assume that in a technical system several processes
interact. If we observe these processes with sensors, we are able to model the
observations (samples) with a probabilistic model, where, in an ideal case, the
components of the parametric mixture density model we use, correspond to the
processes in the real world. Eventually, at run-time, novel processes emerge in
the technical systems such as in the case of an unpredictable failure. As a
consequence, new kinds of samples are observed that require an adaptation of
the model. CANDIES relies on mixtures of Gaussians which can be used for
classification purposes, too. New processes may emerge in regions of the
models' input spaces where few samples were observed before (low-density
regions) or in regions where already many samples were available (high-density
regions). The latter case is more difficult, but most existing solutions focus
on the former. Novelty detection in low- and high-density regions requires
different detection strategies. With CANDIES, we introduce a new technique to
detect novel processes in high-density regions by means of a fast online
goodness-of-fit test. For detection in low-density regions we combine this
approach with a 2SND (Two-Stage-Novelty-Detector) which we presented in
preliminary work. The properties of CANDIES are evaluated using artificial data
and benchmark data from the field of intrusion detection in computer networks,
where the task is to detect new kinds of attacks.

 <dc:description>  To support exactly tracking a neutron moving along a given line segment
through a CAD model with quadric surfaces, this paper considers the arithmetic
precision required to compute the order of intersection points of two quadrics
along the line segment. When the orders of all but one pair of intersections
are known, we show that a resultant can resolve the order of the remaining pair
using only half the precision that may be required to eliminate radicals by
repeated squaring. We compare the time and accuracy of our technique with
converting to extended precision to calculate roots.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a novel energy-recycling single-antenna full-duplex (FD) radio
is designed, in which a new 3-port element including a power divider and an
energy harvester is added between the circulator and the receiver (RX) chain.
The presence of this new element brings advantages over the state of the art in
terms of both spectral efficiency and energy consumption. In particular, it
provides the means of performing both an arbitrary attenuation of the incoming
signal, which in turn increases the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art
self-interference cancellation strategies subsequently adopted in the RX chain,
and the recycling of a non-negligible portion of the energy leaked through the
non-ideal circulator. The performance of this architecture is analyzed in a
practically relevant 4-node scenario in which 2 nodes operate in FD and 2 nodes
in half-duplex (HD). Analytical approximations are derived for both the
achievable rates of the transmissions performed by the FD and HD radios and the
energy recycled by the FD radios. The accuracy of these derivations is
confirmed by numerical simulations. Quantitatively, achievable rate gains up to
40% over the state-of-the-art alternatives, in the considered scenario, are
highlighted. Furthermore, up to 50% of the leaked energy at the circulator,
i.e., 5% of the energy of the transmitted signal, can be recycled.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this work, we consider a multiple-input single-output system in which an
access point (AP) performs a simultaneous wireless information and power
transfer (SWIPT) to serve a user terminal (UT) that is not equipped with
external power supply. In order to assess the efficacy of the SWIPT, we target
a practically relevant scenario characterized by imperfect channel state
information (CSI) at the transmitter, the presence of penalties associated to
the CSI acquisition procedures, and non-zero power consumption for the
operations performed by the UT, such as CSI estimation, uplink signaling and
data decoding. We analyze three different cases for the CSI knowledge at the
AP: no CSI, and imperfect CSI in case of time-division duplexing and
frequency-division duplexing communications. Closed-form representations of the
ergodic downlink rate and both the energy shortage and data outage probability
are derived for the three cases. Additionally, analytic expressions for the
ergodically optimal duration of power transfer and channel estimation/feedback
phases are provided. Our numerical findings verify the correctness of our
derivations, and also show the importance and benefits of CSI knowledge at the
AP in SWIPT systems, albeit imperfect and acquired at the expense of the time
available for the information transfer.

 <dc:description>  We present the application of a low dimensional manifold model (LDMM) on
hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction. An important property of
hyperspectral images is that the patch manifold, which is sampled by the
three-dimensional blocks in the data cube, is generally of a low dimensional
nature. This is a generalization of low-rank models in that hyperspectral
images with nonlinear mixing terms can also fit in this framework. The point
integral method (PIM) is used to solve a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point
cloud sampling the patch manifold in LDMM. Both numerical simulations and
theoretical analysis show that the sample points constraint is correctly
enforced by PIM. The framework is demonstrated by experiments on the
reconstruction of both linear and nonlinear mixed hyperspectral images with a
significant number of missing voxels and several entirely missing spectral
bands.

 <dc:description>  We present some arguments why existing methods for representing agents fall
short in applications crucial to artificial life. Using a thought experiment
involving a fictitious dynamical systems model of the biosphere we argue that
the metabolism, motility, and the concept of counterfactual variation should be
compatible with any agent representation in dynamical systems. We then propose
an information-theoretic notion of \emph{integrated spatiotemporal patterns}
which we believe can serve as the basic building block of an agent definition.
We argue that these patterns are capable of solving the problems mentioned
before. We also test this in some preliminary experiments.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider the State-Dependent Wiretap Channel (SD-WC). As the
main idea, we model the SD-WC as a Cognitive Interference Channel (CIC), in
which the primary receiver acts as an eavesdropper for the cognitive
transmitter's message. By this point of view, the Channel State Information
(CSI) in SD-WC plays the role of the primary user's message in CIC which can be
decoded at the eavesdropper. This idea enables us to use the main achievability
approaches of CIC, i.~e., Gel'fand-Pinsker Coding (GPC) and Superposition
Coding (SPC), to find new achievable equivocation-rates for the SD-WC. We show
that these approaches meet the capacity under some constraints on the rate of
the channel state. Similar to the dirty paper channel, extending the results to
the Gaussian case shows that the GPC lead to the capacity of the Gaussian SD-WC
which is equal to the capacity of the wiretap channel without channel state.
Hence, we achieve the capacity of the Gaussian SD-WC using the dirty paper
technique. Moreover, our proposed approaches provide the capacity of the Binary
SD-WC. It is shown that the capacity of the Binary SD-WC is equal to the
capacity of the Binary wiretap channel without channel state.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies graph-based active learning, where the goal is to
reconstruct a binary signal defined on the nodes of a weighted graph, by
sampling it on a small subset of the nodes. A new sampling algorithm is
proposed, which sequentially selects the graph nodes to be sampled, based on an
aggressive search for the boundary of the signal over the graph. The algorithm
generalizes a recent method for sampling nodes in unweighted graphs. The
generalization improves the sampling performance using the information gained
from the available graph weights. An analysis of the number of samples required
by the proposed algorithm is provided, and the gain over the unweighted method
is further demonstrated in simulations. Additionally, the proposed method is
compared with an alternative state of-the-art method, which is based on the
graph's spectral properties. It is shown that the proposed method significantly
outperforms the spectral sampling method, if the signal needs to be predicted
with high accuracy. On the other hand, if a higher level of inaccuracy is
tolerable, then the spectral method outperforms the proposed aggressive search
method. Consequently, we propose a hybrid method, which is shown to combine the
advantages of both approaches.

 <dc:description>  Utilities face the challenge of responding to power outages due to storms and
ice damage, but most power grids are not equipped with sensors to pinpoint the
precise location of the faults causing the outage. Instead, utilities have to
depend primarily on phone calls (trouble calls) from customers who have lost
power to guide the dispatching of utility trucks. In this paper, we develop a
policy that routes a utility truck to restore outages in the power grid as
quickly as possible, using phone calls to create beliefs about outages, but
also using utility trucks as a mechanism for collecting additional information.
This means that routing decisions change not only the physical state of the
truck (as it moves from one location to another) and the grid (as the truck
performs repairs), but also our belief about the network, creating the first
stochastic vehicle routing problem that explicitly models information
collection and belief modeling. We address the problem of managing a single
utility truck, which we start by formulating as a sequential stochastic
optimization model which captures our belief about the state of the grid. We
propose a stochastic lookahead policy, and use Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
to produce a practical policy that is asymptotically optimal. Simulation
results show that the developed policy restores the power grid much faster
compared to standard industry heuristics.

 <dc:description>  In difference to many recent articles that deal with generalized bent (gbent)
functions $f:\mathbb{Z}_2^n \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_q$ for certain small valued
$q\in \{4,8,16 \}$, we give a complete description of these functions for both
$n$ even and odd and for any $q=2^k$ in terms of both the necessary and
sufficient conditions their component functions need to satisfy. This enables
us to completely characterize gbent functions as algebraic objects, namely as
affine spaces of bent or semi-bent functions with interesting additional
properties, which we in detail describe. We also specify the dual and the Gray
image of gbent functions for $q=2^k$. We discuss the subclass of gbent
functions which corresponds to relative difference sets, which we call
$\mathbb{Z}_q$-bent functions, and point out that they correspond to a class of
vectorial bent functions. The property of being $\mathbb{Z}_q$-bent is much
stronger than the standard concept of a gbent function. We analyse two examples
of this class of functions.

lattice-reduction-aided equalization. This decoder does not achieve the same
performance as the classical maximum-likelihood decoding methods, but has
polynomial complexity in the matrix dimension, making it usable for large field

 <dc:description>  Erasure codes offer an efficient way to decrease storage and communication
costs while implementing atomic memory service in asynchronous distributed
storage systems. In this paper, we provide erasure-code-based algorithms having
the additional ability to perform background repair of crashed nodes. A repair
operation of a node in the crashed state is triggered externally, and is
carried out by the concerned node via message exchanges with other active nodes
in the system. Upon completion of repair, the node re-enters active state, and
resumes participation in ongoing and future read, write, and repair operations.
To guarantee liveness and atomicity simultaneously, existing works assume
either the presence of nodes with stable storage, or presence of nodes that
never crash during the execution. We demand neither of these; instead we
consider a natural, yet practical network stability condition $N1$ that only
restricts the number of nodes in the crashed/repair state during broadcast of
any message.
  We present an erasure-code based algorithm $RADON_C$ that is always live, and
guarantees atomicity as long as condition $N1$ holds. In situations when the
number of concurrent writes is limited, $RADON_C$ has significantly improved
storage and communication cost over a replication-based algorithm $RADON_R$,
which also works under $N1$. We further show how a slightly stronger network
stability condition $N2$ can be used to construct algorithms that never violate
atomicity. The guarantee of atomicity comes at the expense of having an
additional phase during the read and write operations.

 <dc:title>Linearized GMM Kernels and Normalized Random Fourier Features</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The method of &quot;random Fourier features (RFF)&quot; has become a popular tool for
approximating the &quot;radial basis function (RBF)&quot; kernel. The variance of RFF is
actually large. Interestingly, the variance can be substantially reduced by a
simple normalization step as we theoretically demonstrate. We name the improved
scheme as the &quot;normalized RFF (NRFF)&quot;.
  We also propose the &quot;generalized min-max (GMM)&quot; kernel as a measure of data
similarity. GMM is positive definite as there is an associated hashing method
named &quot;generalized consistent weighted sampling (GCWS)&quot; which linearizes this
nonlinear kernel. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation of the RBF
kernel and the GMM kernel on more than 50 publicly available datasets. For a
majority of the datasets, the (tuning-free) GMM kernel outperforms the
best-tuned RBF kernel.
  We conduct extensive experiments for comparing the linearized RBF kernel
using NRFF with the linearized GMM kernel using GCWS. We observe that, to reach
a comparable classification accuracy, GCWS typically requires substantially
fewer samples than NRFF, even on datasets where the original RBF kernel
outperforms the original GMM kernel. The empirical success of GCWS (compared to
NRFF) can also be explained from a theoretical perspective. Firstly, the
relative variance (normalized by the squared expectation) of GCWS is
substantially smaller than that of NRFF, except for the very high similarity
region (where the variances of both methods are close to zero). Secondly, if we
make a model assumption on the data, we can show analytically that GCWS
exhibits much smaller variance than NRFF for estimating the same object (e.g.,
the RBF kernel), except for the very high similarity region.

 <dc:title>Delay Bounds for Multiclass FIFO</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Performance</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  FIFO is perhaps the simplest scheduling discipline. For single-class FIFO,
its delay guarantee performance has been extensively studied: The well-known
results include a stochastic delay bound for $GI/GI/1$ by Kingman and a
deterministic delay bound for $D/D/1$ by Cruz. However, for multiclass FIFO,
few such results are available. To fill the gap, we prove delay bounds for
multiclass FIFO in this work, considering both deterministic and stochastic
cases. Specifically, delay bounds are presented for multiclass D/D/1, GI/GI/1
and G/G/1. In addition, examples are provided for several basic settings to
demonstrate the obtained bounds in more explicit forms, which are also compared
with simulation results.

 <dc:description>  For early diagnosis of malignancies in the gastrointestinal tract,
surveillance endoscopy is increasingly used to monitor abnormal tissue changes
in serial examinations of the same patient. Despite successes with optical
biopsy for in vivo and in situ tissue characterisation, biopsy retargeting for
serial examinations is challenging because tissue may change in appearance
between examinations. In this paper, we propose an inter-examination
retargeting framework for optical biopsy, based on an image descriptor designed
for matching between endoscopic scenes over significant time intervals. Each
scene is described by a hierarchy of regional intensity comparisons at various
scales, offering tolerance to long-term change in tissue appearance whilst
remaining discriminative. Binary coding is then used to compress the descriptor
via a novel random forests approach, providing fast comparisons in Hamming
space and real-time retargeting. Extensive validation conducted on 13 in vivo
gastrointestinal videos, collected from six patients, show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  Adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) has been widely adopted to support video
streaming services over heterogeneous devices and varying network conditions.
With ABR, each video content is transcoded into multiple representations in
different bitrates and resolutions. However, video transcoding is computing
intensive, which requires the transcoding service providers to deploy a large
number of servers for transcoding the video contents published by the content
producers. As such, a natural question for the transcoding service provider is
how to provision the computing resource for transcoding the video contents
while maximizing service profit. To address this problem, we design a cloud
video transcoding system by taking the advantage of cloud computing technology
to elastically allocate computing resource. We propose a method for jointly
considering the task scheduling and resource provisioning problem in two
timescales, and formulate the service profit maximization as a two-timescale
stochastic optimization problem. We derive some approximate policies for the
task scheduling and resource provisioning. Based on our proposed methods, we
implement our open source cloud video transcoding system Morph and evaluate its
performance in a real environment. The experiment results demonstrate that our
proposed method can reduce the resource consumption and achieve a higher profit
compared with the baseline schemes.

 <dc:description>  Memristor (memory-resistor) is the fourth passive circuit element. We
introduce a memristor model based on a fuzzy logic window function. Fuzzy
models are flexible, which enables the capture of the pinched hysteresis
behavior of the memristor. The introduced fuzzy model avoids common problems
associated with window-function based memristor models, such as the terminal
state problem, and the symmetry issues. The model captures the memristor
behavior with a simple rule-base which gives an insight of how memristors work.
Because of the flexibility offered by the fuzzy system, shape and distribution
of input and output membership functions can be tuned to capture the behavior
of various real memristors.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a parallel algorithm for calculating the
eight-directional (D8) up-slope contributing area in digital elevation models
(DEMs). In contrast with previous algorithms, which have potentially unbounded
inter-node communications, the algorithm presented here realizes strict bounds
on the number of inter-node communications. Those bounds in turn allow D8
attributes to be processed for arbitrarily large DEMs on hardware ranging from
average desktops to supercomputers. The algorithm can use the OpenMP and MPI
parallel computing models, either in combination or separately. It partitions
the DEM between slave nodes, calculates an internal up-slope area by replacing
information from other slaves with variables representing unknown quantities,
passes the results on to a master node which combines all the slaves' data, and
passes information back to each slave, which then computes its final result. In
this way each slave's DEM partition is treated as a simple unit in the DEM as a
whole and only two communications take place per node.

 <dc:description>  Tensor networks are efficient representations of high-dimensional tensors
which have been very successful for physics and mathematics applications. We
demonstrate how algorithms for optimizing such networks can be adapted to
supervised learning tasks by using matrix product states (tensor trains) to
parameterize models for classifying images. For the MNIST data set we obtain
less than 1% test set classification error. We discuss how the tensor network
form imparts additional structure to the learned model and suggest a possible
generative interpretation.

 <dc:title>The Quality of the Covariance Selection Through Detection Problem and
  AUC Bounds</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of quantifying the quality of a model selection
problem for a graphical model. We discuss this by formulating the problem as a
detection problem. Model selection problems usually minimize a distance between
the original distribution and the model distribution. For the special case of
Gaussian distributions, the model selection problem simplifies to the
covariance selection problem which is widely discussed in literature by
Dempster [2] where the likelihood criterion is maximized or equivalently the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is minimized to compute the model covariance
matrix. While this solution is optimal for Gaussian distributions in the sense
of the KL divergence, it is not optimal when compared with other information
divergences and criteria such as Area Under the Curve (AUC).
  In this paper, we analytically compute upper and lower bounds for the AUC and
discuss the quality of model selection problem using the AUC and its bounds as
an accuracy measure in detection problem. We define the correlation
approximation matrix (CAM) and show that analytical computation of the KL
divergence, the AUC and its bounds only depend on the eigenvalues of CAM. We
also show the relationship between the AUC, the KL divergence and the ROC curve
by optimizing with respect to the ROC curve. In the examples provided, we pick
tree structures as the simplest graphical models. We perform simulations on
fully-connected graphs and compute the tree structured models by applying the
widely used Chow-Liu algorithm [3]. Examples show that the quality of tree
approximation models are not good in general based on information divergences,
the AUC and its bounds when the number of nodes in the graphical model is
large. We show both analytically and by simulations that the 1-AUC for the tree
approximation model decays exponentially as the dimension of graphical model
increases.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The AHP/ANP are multicriteria decision-making theories that deal with both
hierarchic structures when the criteria are independent of the alternatives and
with networks when there is any dependence within and between elements of the
decision. Both of them have been repeatedly used in practice by various
researchers and practitioners. From the perspective of almost 40 years of
practice in solving problems using both theories, some of their properties seem
to be more important than others. The article indicates four of them as
fundamental for understanding AHP/ANP. These are the axioms related to
structure, computation, and expectation. The mathematical formulation of the
axioms is preceded by an introduction explaining the motivation behind the
introduced concepts. The article is expository and it is an improved and
refined version of the work [1].

 <dc:description>  This paper presents an investigation of two search techniques, tabu search
(TS) and simulated annealing (SA), to assess their relative merits when applied
to engineering design optimisation. Design optimisation problems are generally
characterised as having multi-modal search spaces and discontinuities making
global optimisation techniques beneficial. Both techniques claim to be capable
of locating globally optimum solutions on a range of problems but this
capability is derived from different underlying philosophies. While tabu search
uses a semi-deterministic approach to escape local optima, simulated annealing
uses a complete stochastic approach. The performance of each technique is
investigated using a structural optimisation problem. These performances are
then compared to each other as and to a steepest descent (SD) method.

 <dc:description>  Sobolev quantities (norms, inner products, and distances) of probability
density functions are important in the theory of nonparametric statistics, but
have rarely been used in practice, partly due to a lack of practical
estimators. They also include, as special cases, $L^2$ quantities which are
used in many applications. We propose and analyze a family of estimators for
Sobolev quantities of unknown probability density functions. We bound the bias
and variance of our estimators over finite samples, finding that they are
generally minimax rate-optimal. Our estimators are significantly more
computationally tractable than previous estimators, and exhibit a
statistical/computational trade-off allowing them to adapt to computational
constraints. We also draw theoretical connections to recent work on fast
two-sample testing. Finally, we empirically validate our estimators on
synthetic data.

 <dc:title>A Compositional Neuro-Controller for Advanced Motor Control Tasks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Makukhin, Kirill</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Humans and animals developed a sophisticated motor control apparatus and
there is much evidence that it has a modular structure. The modularity offers a
range of benefits, e.g. ability to learn dissociable motion styles without
interference and forgetting, fast adaptation and de-adaptation to changes
conditions. However in robotics, building a controller that can efficiently
incrementally learn new motion styles and provide switching between them is a
formidable challenge. In this paper we address the problem by proposing a novel
biologically inspired compositional neuro-controller. We have shown that the
compositional controller is able to reproduce a set of trajectories more
efficiently comparing to a simple controller, exploiting incremental learning
benefits. Second, we have demonstrated that the proposed controller is able to
learn different locomotion styles and switch between them in a simulated
robot-snake.

 <dc:description>  Since local feature detection has been one of the most active research areas
in computer vision during the last decade, a large number of detectors have
been proposed. The interest in feature-based applications continues to grow and
has thus rendered the task of characterizing the performance of various feature
detection methods an important issue in vision research. Inspired by the good
practices of electronic system design, a generic framework based on the
repeatability measure is presented in this paper that allows assessment of the
upper and lower bounds of detector performance and finds statistically
significant performance differences between detectors as a function of image
transformation amount by introducing a new variant of McNemars test in an
effort to design more reliable and effective vision systems. The proposed
framework is then employed to establish operating and guarantee regions for
several state-of-the-art detectors and to identify their statistical
performance differences for three specific image transformations: JPEG
compression, uniform light changes and blurring. The results are obtained using
a newly acquired, large image database (20482) images with 539 different
scenes. These results provide new insights into the behaviour of detectors and
are also useful from the vision systems design perspective.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a robust demand-side control algorithm in a smart grid
environment for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. A
robust model predictive control (RMPC) scheme in a receding horizon fashion is
deployed, which optimizes electricity cost and capacity market participation of
the HVAC system, while satisfying comfort and operational constraints of the
building and utility, respectively. Thermal load uncertainties experienced by
the HVAC system are included to perform a realistic assessment of the developed
controller. The National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) is used as a
case study and the developed RMPC scheme is tested for various price signals
and scenarios. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the
developed framework to be readily adopted by utilities -- interested in
realizing a grid-friendly and economicaly eficient demand response (DR)
strategy.

 <dc:description>  Notions of community quality underlie network clustering. While studies
surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding
of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In
this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality
metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four
widely-used network clustering algorithms -- Louvain, Infomap, label
propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality
metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the
information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual
information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous
work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes
varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes.
  We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster
quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4
out of 1 on modularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find
conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best
indicates performance on information recovery metrics. Our study shows that the
variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be
assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information.
  Smart local moving is the best performing algorithm in our study, but
discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it
absolutely superior. Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the
tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap
was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs
poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and
accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.

 <dc:description>  Many modern applications collect highly imbalanced categorical data, with
some categories relatively rare. Bayesian hierarchical models combat data
sparsity by borrowing information, while also quantifying uncertainty. However,
posterior computation presents a fundamental barrier to routine use; a single
class of algorithms does not work well in all settings and practitioners waste
time trying different types of MCMC approaches. This article was motivated by
an application to quantitative advertising in which we encountered extremely
poor computational performance for common data augmentation MCMC algorithms but
obtained excellent performance for adaptive Metropolis. To obtain a deeper
understanding of this behavior, we give strong theory results on computational
complexity in an infinitely imbalanced asymptotic regime. Our results show
computational complexity of Metropolis is logarithmic in sample size, while
data augmentation is polynomial in sample size. The root cause of poor
performance of data augmentation is a discrepancy between the rates at which
the target density and MCMC step sizes concentrate. In general, MCMC algorithms
that have a similar discrepancy will fail in large samples - a result with
substantial practical impact.

2006; Hinton, 2002), as density estimators for static data. Methods for
extending RBMs--and likewise EFHs--to data with temporal dependencies have been
proposed previously (Sutskever and Hinton, 2007; Sutskever et al., 2009), the
learning procedure being validated by qualitative assessment of the generative
model. Here we propose and justify, from a very different perspective, an
alternative training procedure, proving sufficient conditions for optimal
inference under that procedure. The resulting algorithm can be learned with
only forward passes through the data--backprop-through-time is not required, as
in previous approaches. The proof exploits a recent result about information
retention in density estimators (Makin and Sabes, 2015), and applies it to a
&quot;recurrent EFH&quot; (rEFH) by induction. Finally, we demonstrate optimality by
simulation, testing the rEFH: (1) as a filter on training data generated with a
linear dynamical system, the position of which is noisily reported by a
population of &quot;neurons&quot; with Poisson-distributed spike counts; and (2) with the
qualitative experiments proposed by Sutskever et al. (2009).

 <dc:title>Heuristics for Planning, Plan Recognition and Parsing</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a recent paper, we have shown that Plan Recognition over STRIPS can be
formulated and solved using Classical Planning heuristics and algorithms. In
this work, we show that this formulation subsumes the standard formulation of
Plan Recognition over libraries through a compilation of libraries into STRIPS
theories. The libraries correspond to AND/OR graphs that may be cyclic and
where children of AND nodes may be partially ordered. These libraries include
Context-Free Grammars as a special case, where the Plan Recognition problem
becomes a parsing with missing tokens problem. Plan Recognition over the
standard libraries become Planning problems that can be easily solved by any
modern planner, while recognition over more complex libraries, including
Context-Free Grammars (CFGs), illustrate limitations of current Planning
heuristics and suggest improvements that may be relevant in other Planning
problems too.

 <dc:description>  In distributed detection, there does not exist an automatic way of generating
optimal decision strategies for non-affine decision functions. Consequently, in
a detection problem based on a non-affine decision function, establishing
optimality of a given decision strategy, such as a generalized likelihood ratio
test, is often difficult or even impossible.
  In this thesis we develop a novel detection network optimization technique
that can be used to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for
optimality in distributed detection for which the underlying objective function
is monotonic and convex in probabilistic decision strategies. Our developed
approach leverages on basic concepts of optimization and statistical inference
which are provided in sufficient detail. These basic concepts are combined to
form the basis of an optimal inference technique for signal detection.
  We prove a central theorem that characterizes optimality in a variety of
distributed detection architectures. We discuss three applications of this
result in distributed signal detection. These applications include interactive
distributed detection, optimal tandem fusion architecture, and distributed
detection by acyclic graph networks. In the conclusion we indicate several
future research directions, which include possible generalizations of our
optimization method and new research problems arising from each of the three
applications considered.

 <dc:description>  Segmentation partitions an image into its constituent parts. It is
essentially the pre-processing stage of image analysis and computer vision. In
this work, T1 and T2 weighted brain magnetic resonance images are segmented
using multilevel thresholding and bacterial foraging optimization (BFO)
algorithm. The thresholds are obtained by maximizing the between class variance
(multilevel Otsu method) of the image. The BFO algorithm is used to optimize
the threshold searching process. The edges are then obtained from the
thresholded image by comparing the intensity of each pixel with its eight
connected neighbourhood. Post processing is performed to remove spurious
responses in the segmented image. The proposed segmentation technique is
evaluated using edge detector evaluation parameters such as figure of merit,
Rand Index and variation of information. The proposed brain MR image
segmentation technique outperforms the traditional edge detectors such as canny
and sobel.

 <dc:description>  A function is exponentially concave if its exponential is concave. We
consider exponentially concave functions on the unit simplex. In a previous
paper we showed that gradient maps of exponentially concave functions provide
solutions to a Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem and give a better
gradient approximation than those of ordinary concave functions. The
approximation error, called L-divergence, is different from the usual Bregman
divergence. Using tools of information geometry and optimal transport, we show
that L-divergence induces a new information geometry on the simplex consisting
of a Riemannian metric and a pair of dually coupled affine connections which
defines two kinds of geodesics. We show that the induced geometry is dually
projectively flat but not flat. Nevertheless, we prove an analogue of the
celebrated generalized Pythagorean theorem from classical information geometry.
On the other hand, we consider displacement interpolation under a Lagrangian
integral action that is consistent with the optimal transport problem and show
that the action minimizing curves are dual geodesics. The Pythagorean theorem
is also shown to have an interesting application of determining the optimal
trading frequency in stochastic portfolio theory.

 <dc:description>  Declarative machine learning (ML) aims at the high-level specification of ML
tasks or algorithms, and automatic generation of optimized execution plans from
these specifications. The fundamental goal is to simplify the usage and/or
development of ML algorithms, which is especially important in the context of
large-scale computations. However, ML systems at different abstraction levels
have emerged over time and accordingly there has been a controversy about the
meaning of this general definition of declarative ML. Specification
alternatives range from ML algorithms expressed in domain-specific languages
(DSLs) with optimization for performance, to ML task (learning problem)
specifications with optimization for performance and accuracy. We argue that
these different types of declarative ML complement each other as they address
different users (data scientists and end users). This paper makes an attempt to
create a taxonomy for declarative ML, including a definition of essential basic
properties and types of declarative ML. Along the way, we provide insights into
implications of these properties. We also use this taxonomy to classify
existing systems. Finally, we draw conclusions on defining appropriate
benchmarks and specification languages for declarative ML.

 <dc:title>On the Sampling Strategy for Evaluation of Spectral-spatial Methods in

 <dc:description>  Spectral-spatial processing has been increasingly explored in remote sensing
hyperspectral image classification. While extensive studies have focused on
developing methods to improve the classification accuracy, experimental setting
and design for method evaluation have drawn little attention. In the scope of
supervised classification, we find that traditional experimental designs for
spectral processing are often improperly used in the spectral-spatial
processing context, leading to unfair or biased performance evaluation. This is
especially the case when training and testing samples are randomly drawn from
the same image - a practice that has been commonly adopted in the experiments.
Under such setting, the dependence caused by overlap between the training and
testing samples may be artificially enhanced by some spatial information
processing methods such as spatial filtering and morphological operation. Such
interaction between training and testing sets has violated data independence
assumption that is abided by supervised learning theory and performance
evaluation mechanism. Therefore, the widely adopted pixel-based random sampling
strategy is not always suitable to evaluate spectral-spatial classification
algorithms because it is difficult to determine whether the improvement of
classification accuracy is caused by incorporating spatial information into
classifier or by increasing the overlap between training and testing samples.
To partially solve this problem, we propose a novel controlled random sampling
strategy for spectral-spatial methods. It can greatly reduce the overlap
between training and testing samples and provides more objective and accurate
evaluation.

 <dc:description>  We study several decision problems for counter systems with guards defined by
convex polyhedra and updates defined by affine transformations. In general, the
reachability problem is undecidable for such systems. Decidability can be
achieved by imposing two restrictions: (i) the control structure of the counter
system is flat, meaning that nested loops are forbidden, and (ii) the set of
matrix powers is finite, for any affine update matrix in the system. We provide
tight complexity bounds for several decision problems of such systems, by
proving that reachability and model checking for Past Linear Temporal Logic are
complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy $\Sigma^P_2$, while
model checking for First Order Logic is PSPACE-complete.

 <dc:title>Random numbers as probabilities of machine behaviour</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Complexity</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A fruitful way of obtaining meaningful, possibly concrete, algorithmically
random numbers is to consider a potential behaviour of a Turing machine and its
probability with respect to a measure (or semi-measure) on the input space of
binary codes. For example, Chaitin's Omega is a well known Martin-Loef random
number that is obtained by considering the halting probability of a universal
prefix-free machine. In the last decade, similar examples have been obtained
for higher forms of randomness, i.e. randomness relative to strong oracles. In
this work we obtain characterizations of the algorithmically random reals in
higher randomness classes, as probabilities of certain events that can happen
when an oracle universal machine runs probabilistically on a random oracle.
Moreover we apply our analysis to different machine models, including oracle
Turing machines, prefix-free machines, and models for infinite online
computation. We find that in many cases the arithmetical complexity of a
property is directly reflected in the strength of the algorithmic randomness of
the probability with which it occurs, on any given universal machine. On the
other hand, we point to many examples where this does not happen and the
probability is a number whose algorithmic randomness is not the maximum
possible (with respect to its arithmetical complexity). Finally we find that,
unlike the halting probability of a universal machine, the probabilities of
more complex properties like totality, cofinality, computability or
completeness do not necessarily have the same Turing degree when they are
defined with respect to different universal machines.

 <dc:description>  The rise of ad-blockers is viewed as an economic threat by online publishers,
especially those who primarily rely on ad- vertising to support their services.
To address this threat, publishers have started retaliating by employing
ad-block detectors, which scout for ad-blocker users and react to them by
restricting their content access and pushing them to whitelist the website or
disabling ad-blockers altogether. The clash between ad-blockers and ad-block
detectors has resulted in a new arms race on the web. In this paper, we present
the first systematic measurement and analysis of ad-block detection on the web.
We have designed and implemented a machine learning based tech- nique to
automatically detect ad-block detection, and use it to study the deployment of
ad-block detectors on Alexa top- 100K websites. The approach is promising with
precision of 94.8% and recall of 93.1%. We characterize the spectrum of
different strategies used by websites for ad-block detection. We find that most
of publishers use fairly simple passive ap- proaches for ad-block detection.
However, we also note that a few websites use third-party services, e.g.
PageFair, for ad-block detection and response. The third-party services use
active deception and other sophisticated tactics to de- tect ad-blockers. We
also find that the third-party services can successfully circumvent ad-blockers
and display ads on publisher websites.

 <dc:description>  A key enabling technology of NFV is software dataplane, which has attracted
much attention in both academia and industry recently. Yet, till now there is
little understanding about its performance in practice. In this paper, we make
a benchmark measurement study of NFV software dataplanes in terms of packet
processing capability, one of the most fundamental and critical performance
metrics. Specifically, we compare two state-of-the-art open-source NFV
dataplanes, SoftNIC and ClickOS, using commodity 10GbE NICs under various
typical workloads. Our key observations are that (1) both dataplanes have
performance issues processing small (&lt;=128B) packets; (2) it is not always best
to put all VMs of a service chain on one server due to NUMA effect. We propose
resource allocation strategies to remedy the problems, including carefully
adding CPU cores and vNICs to VMs, and spreading VMs of a service chain to
separate servers. To fundamentally address these problems and scale their
performance, SoftNIC and ClickOS could improve the support for NIC queues and
multiple cores.

 <dc:description>  Personal data is collected and stored more than ever by the governments and
companies in the digital age. Even though the data is only released after
anonymization, deanonymization is possible by joining different datasets. This
puts the privacy of individuals in jeopardy. Furthermore, data leaks can unveil
personal identifiers of individuals when security is breached. Processing the
leaked dataset can provide even more information than what is visible to naked
eye. In this work, we report the results of our analyses on the recent &quot;Turkish
citizen database leak&quot;, which revealed the national identifier numbers of close
to fifty million voters, along with personal information such as date of birth,
birth place, and full address. We show that with automated processing of the
data, one can uniquely identify (i) mother's maiden name of individuals and
(ii) landline numbers, for a significant portion of people. This is a serious
privacy and security threat because (i) identity theft risk is now higher, and
(ii) scammers are able to access more information about individuals. The only
and utmost goal of this work is to point out to the security risks and suggest
stricter measures to related companies and agencies to protect the security and
privacy of individuals.

 <dc:description>  In conventional large-scale networks, creation and management of network
services are costly and complex tasks that often consume a lot of resources,
including time and manpower. Network softwarization and network function
virtualization have been introduced to tackle these problems. They replace the
hardware-based network service components and network control mechanisms with
software components running on general-purpose hardware, aiming at decreasing
costs and complexity of implementing new services, maintaining the implemented
services, and managing available resources in service provisioning platforms
and underlying infrastructures. To experience the full potential of these
approaches, innovative development support tools and service provisioning
environments are needed. To answer these needs, we introduce the SONATA
architecture, a service programming, orchestration, and management framework.
We present a development toolchain for virtualized network services, fully
integrated with a service platform and orchestration system. We motivate the
modular and flexible architecture of our system and discuss its main components
and features, such as function- and service-specific managers that allow fine-
grained service management, slicing support to facilitate multi-tenancy,
recursiveness for improved scalability, and full-featured DevOps support.

 <dc:description>  Internet service discovery is an emerging topic to study the deployment of
protocols. Towards this end, our community periodically scans the entire
advertised IPv4 address space. In this paper, we question this principle. Being
good Internet citizens means that we should limit scan traffic to what is
necessary. We conducted a study of scan data, which shows that several prefixes
do not accommodate any host of interest and the network topology is fairly
stable. We argue that this allows us to collect representative data by scanning
less. In our paper, we explore the idea to scan all prefixes once and then
identify prefixes of interest for future scanning. Based on our analysis of the
censys.io data set (4.1 TB data encompassing 28 full IPv4 scans within 6
months) we found that we can reduce scan traffic between 25-90% and miss only
1-10% of the hosts, depending on desired trade-offs and protocols.

 <dc:description>  This monograph is an ongoing revision of &quot;Lectures On A Mathematical Theory
of Computation&quot; by Dana Scott. Scott's monograph uses a formulation of domains
called neighborhood systems in which finite elements are selected subsets of a
master set of objects called &quot;tokens&quot;. Since tokens have little intuitive
significance, Scott has discarded neighborhood systems in favor of an
equivalent formulation of domains called information systems. Unfortunately, he
has not rewritten his monograph to reflect this change.
  We have rewritten Scott's monograph in terms of finitary bases instead of
information systems. A finitary basis is an information system that is closed
under least upper bounds on finite consistent subsets. This convention ensures
that every finite answer is represented by a single basis object instead of a
set of objects.

 <dc:title>On the Mobile-to-Mobile Linear Time-Variant Shallow-Water Acoustic
  Channel Response</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We expose some concepts concerning the channel impulse response (CIR) of
linear time-varying (LTV) channels to give a proper characterization of the
mobile-to-mobile underwater channel. We find different connections between the
linear time-invariant (LTI) CIR of the static channel and two definitions of
LTV CIRs of the dynamic mobile-to-mobile channel. These connections are useful
to design a dynamic channel simulator from the static channel models available
in the literature. Such feature is particularly interesting for overspread
channels, which are hard to characterize by a measuring campaign. Specifically,
the shallow water acoustic (SWA) channel is potentially overspread due the
signal low velocity of propagation which prompt long delay spread responses and
great Doppler effect. Furthermore, from these connections between the LTI
static CIRs and the LTV dynamic CIRS, we find that the SWA mobile-to-mobile CIR
does not only depend on the relative velocity between transceivers, but also on
the absolute velocity of each of them referred to the velocity of propagation.
Nevertheless, publications about this topic do not consider it and formulate
their equations in terms of the relative velocity between transceivers. We
illustrate our find using two couples of examples where, even though the
relative velocity between the mobiles is the same, their CIRs are not.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel access protocol for crowd scenarios in massive MIMO
(Multiple-input multiple-output) systems. Crowd scenarios are characterized by
a large number of users with intermittent access behavior, whereby orthogonal
scheduling is infeasible. In such scenarios, random access is a natural choice.
The proposed access protocol relies on two essential properties of a massive
MIMO system, namely asymptotic orthogonality between user channels and
asymptotic invariance of channel powers. Signal processing techniques that take
advantage of these properties allow us to view a set of contaminated pilot
signals as a graph code on which iterative belief propagation can be performed.
This makes it possible to decontaminate pilot signals and increase the
throughput of the system. Numerical evaluations show that the proposed access
protocol increases the throughput with 36%, when having 400 antennas at the
base station, compared to the conventional method of slotted ALOHA. With 1024
antennas, the throughput is increased by 85%.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present a tracker, which is radically different from
state-of-the-art trackers: we apply no model updating, no occlusion detection,
no combination of trackers, no geometric matching, and still deliver
state-of-the-art tracking performance, as demonstrated on the popular online
tracking benchmark (OTB) and six very challenging YouTube videos. The presented
tracker simply matches the initial patch of the target in the first frame with
candidates in a new frame and returns the most similar patch by a learned
matching function. The strength of the matching function comes from being
extensively trained generically, i.e., without any data of the target, using a
Siamese deep neural network, which we design for tracking. Once learned, the
matching function is used as is, without any adapting, to track previously
unseen targets. It turns out that the learned matching function is so powerful
that a simple tracker built upon it, coined Siamese INstance search Tracker,
SINT, which only uses the original observation of the target from the first
frame, suffices to reach state-of-the-art performance. Further, we show the
proposed tracker even allows for target re-identification after the target was
absent for a complete video shot.

 <dc:description>  Exploiting the information about members of a Social Network (SN) represents
one of the most attractive and dwelling subjects for both academic and applied
scientists. The community of Complexity Science and especially those
researchers working on multiplex social systems are devoting increasing efforts
to outline general laws, models, and theories, to the purpose of predicting
emergent phenomena in SN's (e.g. success of a product). On the other side the
semantic web community aims at engineering a new generation of advanced
services tailored to specific people needs. This implies defining constructs,
models and methods for handling the semantic layer of SNs. We combined models
and techniques from both the former fields to provide a hybrid approach to
understand a basic (yet complex) phenomenon: the propagation of individual
interests along the social networks. Since information may move along different
social networks, one should take into account a multiplex structure. Therefore
we introduced the notion of &quot;Semantic Multiplex&quot;. In this paper we analyse two
different semantic social networks represented by authors publishing in the
Computer Science and those in the American Physical Society Journals. The
comparison allows to outline common and specific features

 <dc:title>Wirelessly Powered Backscatter Communication Networks: Modeling,

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) will connect billions of small computing
devices embedded in the environment and support their device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Powering this massive number of embedded devices is a key
challenge of designing IoT since batteries increase the devices' form factors
and battery recharging/replacement is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel network architecture that enables D2D communication between
passive nodes by integrating wireless power transfer and backscatter
communication, which is called a wirelessly powered backscatter communication
(WP-BackCom) network. In the network, standalone power beacons (PBs) are
deployed for wirelessly powering nodes by beaming unmodulated carrier signals
to targeted nodes. Provisioned with a backscatter antenna, a node transmits
data to an intended receiver by modulating and reflecting a fraction of a
carrier signal. Such transmission by backscatter consumes orders-of-magnitude
less power than a traditional radio. Thereby, the dense deployment of
low-complexity PBs with high transmission power can power a large-scale IoT. In
this paper, a WP-BackCom network is modeled as a random Poisson cluster process
in the horizontal plane where PBs are Poisson distributed and active ad-hoc
pairs of backscatter communication nodes with fixed separation distances form
random clusters centered at PBs. The backscatter nodes can harvest energy from
and backscatter carrier signals transmitted by PBs. Furthermore, the
transmission power of each node depends on the distance from the associated PB.
Applying stochastic geometry, the network coverage probability and transmission
capacity are derived and optimized as functions of backscatter parameters,
including backscatter duty cycle and reflection coefficient, as well as the PB
density. The effects of the parameters on network performance are
characterized.

 <dc:title>A Rewriting System for the Assessment of XACML Policies Similarity</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Mejri, Mohamed</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose in this paper a policies similarity approach which is performed in
three steps. The first step is concerned with the formalization of a XACML
policy as a term in a boolean algebra while taking into account the policy and
rule combining algorithms. This formalization is based on Security Policy
Language (SePL) which was proposed in a previous work. In the second step, the
SePL term is transformed into a term in a boolean ring. In the third step, the
two policy terms, which are derived from the previous step, are the input to a
rewriting system to conclude which kind of relation exists between these
security policies such as equivalence, restriction, inclusion, and divergence.
We provide a case study of our approach based on real XACML policies and also
an empirical evaluation of its performance.

 <dc:description>  B{\'e}zout 's theorem states that dense generic systems of n multivariate
quadratic equations in n variables have 2 n solutions over algebraically closed
fields. When only a small subset M of monomials appear in the equations
(fewnomial systems), the number of solutions may decrease dramatically. We
focus in this work on subsets of quadratic monomials M such that generic
systems with support M do not admit any solution at all. For these systems,
Hilbert's Nullstellensatz ensures the existence of algebraic certificates of
inconsistency. However, up to our knowledge all known bounds on the sizes of
such certificates -including those which take into account the Newton polytopes
of the polynomials- are exponential in n. Our main results show that if the
inequality 2|M| -- 2n $\le$ $\sqrt$ 1 + 8{\nu} -- 1 holds for a quadratic
fewnomial system -- where {\nu} is the matching number of a graph associated
with M, and |M| is the cardinality of M -- then there exists generically a
certificate of inconsistency of linear size (measured as the number of
coefficients in the ground field K). Moreover this certificate can be computed
within a polynomial number of arithmetic operations. Next, we evaluate how
often this inequality holds, and we give evidence that the probability that the
inequality is satisfied depends strongly on the number of squares. More
precisely, we show that if M is picked uniformly at random among the subsets of
n + k + 1 quadratic monomials containing at least $\Omega$(n 1/2+$\epsilon$)
squares, then the probability that the inequality holds tends to 1 as n grows.
Interestingly, this phenomenon is related with the matching number of random
graphs in the Erd{\&quot;o}s-Renyi model. Finally, we provide experimental results
showing that certificates in inconsistency can be computed for systems with
more than 10000 variables and equations.

 <dc:description>  Microblogging platforms such as Twitter provide active communication channels
during mass convergence and emergency events such as earthquakes, typhoons.
During the sudden onset of a crisis situation, affected people post useful
information on Twitter that can be used for situational awareness and other
humanitarian disaster response efforts, if processed timely and effectively.
Processing social media information pose multiple challenges such as parsing
noisy, brief and informal messages, learning information categories from the
incoming stream of messages and classifying them into different classes among
others. One of the basic necessities of many of these tasks is the availability
of data, in particular human-annotated data. In this paper, we present
human-annotated Twitter corpora collected during 19 different crises that took
place between 2013 and 2015. To demonstrate the utility of the annotations, we
train machine learning classifiers. Moreover, we publish first largest word2vec
word embeddings trained on 52 million crisis-related tweets. To deal with
tweets language issues, we present human-annotated normalized lexical resources
for different lexical variations.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents two new space time block codes (STBCs) with quasi
orthogonal structure for an open loop multi-input single-output (MISO) systems.
These two codes have been designed to transmit from three or four antennas at
the transmitter and be given to one antenna at the receiver. First, the
proposed codes are introduced and their structures are investigated. This is
followed by the demonstration of how the decoder decodes half of transmitted
symbols independent of the other half. The last part of this paper discusses
the simulation results, makes performance comparison against other popular
approaches and concludes that the proposed solutions offer superiority.

 <dc:description>  Object detection often suffers from a plenty of bootless proposals, selecting
high quality proposals remains a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a
semantic, class-specific approach to re-rank object proposals, which can
consistently improve the recall performance even with less proposals. We first
extract features for each proposal including semantic segmentation, stereo
information, contextual information, CNN-based objectness and low-level cue,
and then score them using class-specific weights learnt by Structured SVM. The
advantages of the proposed model are twofold: 1) it can be easily merged to
existing generators with few computational costs, and 2) it can achieve high
recall rate uner strict critical even using less proposals. Experimental
evaluation on the KITTI benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantly
improves existing popular generators on recall performance. Moreover, in the
experiment conducted for object detection, even with 1,500 proposals, our
approach can still have higher average precision (AP) than baselines with 5,000
proposals.

 <dc:description>  Studying tongue motion during speech using ultrasound is a standard
procedure, but automatic ultrasound image labelling remains a challenge, as
standard tongue shape extraction methods typically require human intervention.
This article presents a method based on deep neural networks to automatically
extract tongue contour from ultrasound images on a speech dataset. We use a
deep autoencoder trained to learn the relationship between an image and its
related contour, so that the model is able to automatically reconstruct
contours from the ultrasound image alone. In this paper, we use an automatic
labelling algorithm instead of time-consuming hand-labelling during the
training process, and estimate the performances of both automatic labelling and
contour extraction as compared to hand-labelling. Observed results show quality
scores comparable to the state of the art.

 <dc:description>  We address the problem of predicting similarity between a pair of handwritten
document images written by different individuals. This has applications related
to matching and mining in image collections containing handwritten content. A
similarity score is computed by detecting patterns of text re-usages between
document images irrespective of the minor variations in word morphology, word
ordering, layout and paraphrasing of the content. Our method does not depend on
an accurate segmentation of words and lines. We formulate the document matching
problem as a structured comparison of the word distributions across two
document images. To match two word images, we propose a convolutional neural
network (CNN) based feature descriptor. Performance of this representation
surpasses the state-of-the-art on handwritten word spotting. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of our method on a practical problem of matching
handwritten assignments.

 <dc:title>Exploiting Equitable Partitions for Efficient Block Triangularization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Th&#xfc;ne, Mario</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In graph theory a partition of the vertex set of a graph is called equitable
if for all pairs of cells all vertices in one cell have an equal number of
neighbours in the other cell. Considering the implications for the adjacency
matrix one may generalize that concept as a block partition of a complex square
matrix s.t. each block has constant row sum. It is well known that replacing
each block by its row sum yields a smaller matrix whose multiset of eigenvalues
is contained in the initial spectrum. We generalize this approach to weighted
row sums and rectangular matrices and derive an efficient unitary
transformation which approximately block triangularizes a matrix w.r.t. an
arbitrary partition. Singular values and Hermiticity (if present) are
preserved. The approximation is exact in the equitable case and the error can
be bounded in terms of unitarily invariant matrix norms.

 <dc:description>  We study multidimensional configurations (infinite words) and subshifts of
low pattern complexity using tools of algebraic geometry. We express the
configuration as a multivariate formal power series over integers and
investigate the setup when there is a non-trivial annihilating polynomial: a
non-zero polynomial whose formal product with the power series is zero. Such
annihilator exists, for example, if the number of distinct patterns of some
finite shape $D$ in the configuration is at most the size $|D|$ of the shape.
This is our low pattern complexity assumption. We prove that the configuration
must be a sum of periodic configurations over integers, possibly with unbounded
values. As a specific application of the method we obtain an asymptotic version
of the well-known Nivat's conjecture: we prove that any two-dimensional,
non-periodic configuration can satisfy the low pattern complexity assumption
with respect to only finitely many distinct rectangular shapes $D$.

 <dc:description>  Recent developments in cloud storage architectures have originated new models
of online storage as cooperative storage systems and interconnected clouds.
Such distributed environments involve many organizations, thus ensuring
confidentiality becomes crucial: only legitimate clients should recover the
information they distribute among storage nodes.
  In this work we present a unified framework for verifying confidentiality of
dispersal algorithms against probabilistic models of intruders. Two models of
intruders are given, corresponding to different types of attackers: one aiming
at intercepting as many slices of information as possible, and the other aiming
at attacking the storage providers in the network. Both try to recover the
original information, given the intercepted slices. By using probabilistic
model checking, we can measure the degree of confidentiality of the system
exploring exhaustively all possible behaviors. Our experiments suggest that
dispersal algorithms ensure a high degree of confidentiality against the slice
intruder, no matter the number of storage providers in the system. On the
contrary, they show a low level of confidentiality against the provider
intruder in networks with few storage providers (e.g. interconnected cloud
storage solutions).

 <dc:description>  Recent applications in computer vision have come to heavily rely on
superpixel over-segmentation as a pre-processing step for higher level vision
tasks, such as object recognition, image labelling or image segmentation. Here
we present a new superpixel algorithm called Hierarchical Piecewise-Constant
Super-regions (HPCS), which not only obtains superpixels comparable to the
state-of-the-art, but can also be applied hierarchically to form what we call
n-th order super-regions. In essence, a Markov Random Field (MRF)-based
anisotropic denoising formulation over the quantized feature space is adopted
to form piecewise-constant image regions, which are then combined with a
graph-based split &amp; merge post-processing step to form superpixels. The graph
and quantized feature based formulation of the problem allows us to generalize
it hierarchically to preserve boundary adherence with fewer superpixels.
Experimental results show that, despite the simplicity of our framework, it is
able to provide high quality superpixels, and to hierarchically apply them to
form layers of over-segmentation, each with a decreasing number of superpixels,
while maintaining the same desired properties (such as adherence to strong
image edges). The algorithm is also memory efficient and has a low
computational cost.

 <dc:description>  Geometric Near-neighbor Access Tree (GNAT) is a metric space indexing method
based on hierarchical hyperplane partitioning of the space. While GNAT is very
efficient in proximity searching, it has a bad reputation of being a memory
hog. We show that this is partially based on too coarse analysis, and that the
memory requirements can be lowered while at the same time improving the search
efficiency. We also show how to make GNAT memory adaptive in a smooth way, and
that the hyperplane partitioning can be replaced with ball partitioning, which
can further improve the search performance. We conclude with experimental
results showing the new methods can give significant performance boost.

 <dc:description>  Many AI applications rely on knowledge about a relevant real-world domain
that is encoded by means of some logical knowledge base (KB). The most
essential benefit of logical KBs is the opportunity to perform automatic
reasoning to derive implicit knowledge or to answer complex queries about the
modeled domain. The feasibility of meaningful reasoning requires KBs to meet
some minimal quality criteria such as logical consistency. Without adequate
tool assistance, the task of resolving violated quality criteria in KBs can be
extremely tough even for domain experts, especially when the problematic KB
includes a large number of logical formulas or comprises complicated logical
formalisms.
  Published non-interactive debugging systems often cannot localize all
possible faults (incompleteness), suggest the deletion or modification of
unnecessarily large parts of the KB (non-minimality), return incorrect
solutions which lead to a repaired KB not satisfying the imposed quality
requirements (unsoundness) or suffer from poor scalability due to the inherent
complexity of the KB debugging problem. Even if a system is complete and sound
and considers only minimal solutions, there are generally exponentially many
solution candidates to select one from. However, any two repaired KBs obtained
from these candidates differ in their semantics in terms of entailments and
non-entailments. Selection of just any of these repaired KBs might result in
unexpected entailments, the loss of desired entailments or unwanted changes to
the KB.
  This work proposes complete, sound and optimal methods for the interactive
debugging of KBs that suggest the one (minimally invasive) error correction of
the faulty KB that yields a repaired KB with exactly the intended semantics.
Users, e.g. domain experts, are involved in the debugging process by answering
automatically generated queries about the intended domain.

 <dc:title>Montre: A Tool for Monitoring Timed Regular Expressions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present Montre, a monitoring tool to search patterns specified by timed
regular expressions over real-time behaviors. We use timed regular expressions
as a compact, natural, and highly-expressive pattern specification language for
monitoring applications involving quantitative timing constraints. Our tool
essentially incorporates online and offline timed pattern matching algorithms
so it is capable of finding all occurrences of a given pattern over both logged
and streaming behaviors. Furthermore, Montre is designed to work with other
tools via standard interfaces to perform more complex and versatile tasks for
analyzing and reasoning about cyber-physical systems. As the first of its kind,
we believe Montre will enable a new line of inquiries and techniques in these
fields.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a new general approach based on Bayesian networks to
model the human behaviour. This approach represents human behaviour with
probabilistic cause-effect relations based on knowledge, but also with
conditional probabilities coming either from knowledge or deduced from
observations. This approach has been applied to the co-simulation of the CO2
concentration in an office coupled with human behaviour.

 <dc:description>  This article describes a contour-based 3D tongue deformation visualization
framework using B-mode ultrasound image sequences. A robust, automatic tracking
algorithm characterizes tongue motion via a contour, which is then used to
drive a generic 3D Finite Element Model (FEM). A novel contour-based 3D dynamic
modeling method is presented. Modal reduction and modal warping techniques are
applied to model the deformation of the tongue physically and efficiently. This
work can be helpful in a variety of fields, such as speech production, silent
speech recognition, articulation training, speech disorder study, etc.

 <dc:description>  We consider linear rank-metric codes in $\mathbb F_{q^m}^n$. We show that the
properties of being MRD (maximum rank distance) and non-Gabidulin are generic
over the algebraic closure of the underlying field, which implies that over a
large extension field a randomly chosen generator matrix generates an MRD and a
non-Gabidulin code with high probability. Moreover, we give upper bounds on the
respective probabilities in dependence on the extension degree $m$.

 <dc:title>A Geometric Approach to Color Image Regularization</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>&#xc5;str&#xf6;m, Freddie</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a new vectorial total variation method that addresses the problem
of color consistent image filtering. Our approach is inspired from the
double-opponent cell representation in the human visual cortex. Existing
methods of vectorial total variation regularizers have insufficient (or no)
coupling between the color channels and thus may introduce color artifacts. We
address this problem by introducing a novel coupling between the color channels
related to a pullback-metric from the opponent space to the data (RGB color)
space. Our energy is a non-convex, non-smooth higher-order vectorial total
variation approach and promotes color consistent image filtering via a coupling
term. For a convex variant, we show well-posedness and existence of a solution
in the space of vectorial bounded variation. For the higher-order scheme we
employ a half-quadratic strategy, which model the non-convex energy terms as
the infimum of a sequence of quadratic functions. In experiments, we elaborate
on traditional image restoration applications of inpainting, deblurring and
denoising. Regarding the latter, we demonstrate state of the art restoration
quality with respect to structure coherence and color consistency.

 <dc:title>Minimizing The Expected Distortion Using Multi-layer Coding Approach In

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This work concerns minimizing the achievable distortion of a Gaussian source
over a two-hop block fading channel under mean square-error criterion. It is
assumed that there is not a direct link between transmission ends and the
communication is carried out through the use of a relay, employing the Decode
and Forward (DF) strategy. Moreover, for both of transmitter-to-relay and
relay-to-destination links the channel statistics are merely available at the
corresponding receivers, while the channel gains are not available at the
affiliated transmitters. It is assumed that a Gaussian source is hierarchically
encoded through the use of successive refinement source coding approach and
sent to the relay using a multi-layer channel code. Similarly, the relay
transmits the retrieved information to the destination through the use of a
multi-layer code. Accordingly, in a Rayleigh block fading environment, the
optimal power allocation across code layers is derived. Numerical results
demonstrate that the achievable distortion of the proposed multi-layer approach
outperforms that of single-layer code. Moreover, the resulting distortion of DF
strategy is better than Amplify and Forward~(AF) strategy for channel mismatch
factors greater than one, while the resulting distortion has a marginal
degradation for channel mismatch factors lower than one.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Emerging Technologies</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Reversible logic synthesis is emerging as a major research component for
post-CMOS computing devices, in particular Quantum computing. In this work, we
link the reversible logic synthesis problem to sorting algorithms. Based on our
analysis, an alternative derivation of the worst-case complexity of generated
reversible circuits is provided. Furthermore, a novel column-wise reversible
logic synthesis method, termed RevCol, is designed with inspiration from radix
sort. Extending the principles of RevCol, we present a hybrid reversible logic
synthesis framework. The theoretical and experimental results are presented.
The results are extensively benchmarked with state-of-the-art ancilla-free
reversible logic synthesis methods.

 <dc:title>Performance Analysis of Joint Time Delay and Doppler-Stretch Estimation

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the performance of joint time delay and
Doppler-stretch estimation with the random stepp ed-frequency (RSF) signal.
Applying the ambiguity function (AF) to implement the estimation, we derive the
compact expressions of the theoretical mean square errors (MSEs) under high
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The obtained MSEs are shown consistent with the
corresponding Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs), implying that the AF-based
estimation is approximately efficient. Waveform parameters including higher
carrier frequencies, wider bandwidth covered by the carrier frequencies, and
frequency shifting codewords with larger variance are expected for a better
estimation performance. As a synthetic wideband signal, the RSF signal achieves
the same estimation performance as the OFDM signal within an identical
bandwidth. Due to its instantaneous narrowband character, requirement for the
bandwidth of the receiver is much reduced.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the effects of relative increments of mutual information among the
geographical, technological, and organizational distributions of firms on the
relative augmentation of regional summary turnover in terms of synergies. How
do increases in synergy in international cooperation affect regional turnover?
The methodological contribution of this study is that we translate the synergy
(abstractly measured in bits of information) into more familiar economic terms,
such as turnover for the special case of domestic-foreign collaborations. The
analysis is based on Norwegian data, as Norway is a small country with an open
and export-oriented economy. Data for Norway is publicly available in great
detail.

 <dc:description>  The BeatBox simulation environment combines flexible script language user
interface with the robust computational tools, in order to setup cardiac
electrophysiology in-silico experiments without re-coding at low-level, so that
cell excitation, tissue/anatomy models, stimulation protocols may be included
into a BeatBox script, and simulation run either sequentially or in parallel
(MPI) without re-compilation. BeatBox is a free software written in C language
to be run on a Unix-based platform. It provides the whole spectrum of multi
scale tissue modelling from 0-dimensional individual cell simulation,
1-dimensional fibre, 2-dimensional sheet and 3-dimensional slab of tissue, up
to anatomically realistic whole heart simulations, with run time measurements
including cardiac re-entry tip/filament tracing, ECG, local/global samples of
any variables, etc. BeatBox solvers, cell, and tissue/anatomy models
repositories are extended via robust and flexible interfaces, thus providing an
open framework for new developments in the field. In this paper we give an
overview of the BeatBox current state, together with a description of the main
computational methods and MPI parallelisation approaches.

 <dc:description>  The work presented in this paper deals with the issue of massive demands for
higher capacity. For that matter, we investigate the spectrum resource
management in outdoor mmWave cell for the uplink of cellular and D2D
communications. Indeed, we provide a first insight how to optimize the system
performance in terms of achievable throughput while realizing a compromise
between the large number of admitted devices and the generated interference
constraint. We propose a mathematical formulation of the optimization objective
which falls in the mixed integer-real optimization scheme. To overcome its
complexity, we apply a heuristic algorithm and test its efficiency through
simulation results with a particular regard to the BER impact in the QoS.

 <dc:description>  The way we look at data has a great impact on how we can understand it,
particularly when the data is related to health and wellness. Due to the
increased use of self-tracking devices and the ongoing shift towards preventive
medicine, better understanding of our health data is an important part of
improving the general welfare of the citizens. Electronic Health Records,
self-tracking devices and mobile applications provide a rich variety of data
but it often becomes difficult to understand. We implemented the hFigures
library inspired on the hGraph visualization with additional improvements. The
purpose of the library is to provide a visual representation of the evolution
of health measurements in a complete and useful manner. We researched the
usefulness and usability of the library by building an application for health
data visualization in a health coaching program. We performed a user evaluation
with Heuristic Evaluation, Controlled User Testing and Usability
Questionnaires. In the Heuristics Evaluation the average response was 6.3 out
of 7 points and the Cognitive Walkthrough done by usability experts indicated
no design or mismatch errors. In the CSUQ usability test the system obtained an
average score of 6.13 out of 7, and in the ASQ usability test the overall
satisfaction score was 6.64 out of 7. We developed hFigures, an open source
library for visualizing a complete, accurate and normalized graphical
representation of health data. The idea is based on the concept of the hGraph
but it provides additional key features, including a comparison of multiple
health measurements over time. We conducted a usability evaluation of the
library as a key component of an application for health and wellness
monitoring. The results indicate that the data visualization library was
helpful in assisting users in understanding health data and its evolution over
time.

 <dc:title>On the Equivalence of Maximum SNR and MMSE Estimation: Applications to
  Additive Non-Gaussian Channels and Quantized Observations</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Rugini, Luca</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Banelli, Paolo</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) is one of the most popular criteria for
Bayesian estimation. Conversely, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is a typical
performance criterion in communications, radar, and generally detection theory.
In this paper we first formalize an SNR criterion to design an estimator, and
then we prove that there exists an equivalence between MMSE and maximum-SNR
estimators, for any statistics. We also extend this equivalence to specific
classes of suboptimal estimators, which are expressed by a basis expansion
model (BEM). Then, by exploiting an orthogonal BEM for the estimator, we derive
the MMSE estimator constrained to a given quantization resolution of the noisy
observations, and we prove that this suboptimal MMSE estimator tends to the
optimal MMSE estimator that uses an infinite resolution of the observation.
Besides, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean-squared error (MSE) and
for the SNR of the proposed suboptimal estimators, and we show that these
expressions constitute tight, asymptotically exact, bounds for the optimal MMSE
and maximum SNR.

 <dc:title>AMSOM: Adaptive Moving Self-organizing Map for Clustering and
  Visualization</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a neural network model which is used to obtain a
topology-preserving mapping from the (usually high dimensional) input/feature
space to an output/map space of fewer dimensions (usually two or three in order
to facilitate visualization). Neurons in the output space are connected with
each other but this structure remains fixed throughout training and learning is
achieved through the updating of neuron reference vectors in feature space.
Despite the fact that growing variants of SOM overcome the fixed structure
limitation they increase computational cost and also do not allow the removal
of a neuron after its introduction. In this paper, a variant of SOM is proposed
called AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map) that on the one hand creates
a more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered during
training and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined grid
by allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experiments using
multiple literature datasets show that the proposed method improves training
performance of SOM, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset and
provides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure of
neurons.

 <dc:description>  The question of how to parallelize the stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
method has received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we focus
instead on batch methods that use a sizeable fraction of the training set at
each iteration to facilitate parallelism, and that employ second-order
information. In order to improve the learning process, we follow a multi-batch
approach in which the batch changes at each iteration. This can cause
difficulties because L-BFGS employs gradient differences to update the Hessian
approximations, and when these gradients are computed using different data
points the process can be unstable. This paper shows how to perform stable
quasi-Newton updating in the multi-batch setting, illustrates the behavior of
the algorithm in a distributed computing platform, and studies its convergence
properties for both the convex and nonconvex cases.

 <dc:description>  Similarity scores in face recognition represent the proximity between pairs
of images as computed by a matching algorithm. Given a large set of images and
the proximities between all pairs, a similarity score space is defined. Cluster
analysis was applied to the similarity score space to develop various
taxonomies. Given the number of subjects in the dataset, we used hierarchical
methods to aggregate images of the same subject. We also explored the hierarchy
above and below the subject level, including clusters that reflect gender and
ethnicity. Evidence supports the existence of clustering by race, gender,
subject, and illumination condition.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Despite recent breakthroughs in the applications of deep neural networks, one
setting that presents a persistent challenge is that of &quot;one-shot learning.&quot;
Traditional gradient-based networks require a lot of data to learn, often
through extensive iterative training. When new data is encountered, the models
must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new
information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented
memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to
quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate
the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a
memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage
this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also
introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory
content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-based
focusing mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  Sequential data often possesses a hierarchical structure with complex
dependencies between subsequences, such as found between the utterances in a
dialogue. In an effort to model this kind of generative process, we propose a
neural network-based generative architecture, with latent stochastic variables
that span a variable number of time steps. We apply the proposed model to the
task of dialogue response generation and compare it with recent neural network
architectures. We evaluate the model performance through automatic evaluation
metrics and by carrying out a human evaluation. The experiments demonstrate
that our model improves upon recently proposed models and that the latent
variables facilitate the generation of long outputs and maintain the context.

 <dc:description>  Suppose there is a collection $x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N$ of independent uniform
$[0,1]$ random variables, and a hypergraph $\cF$ of \emph{target structures} on
the vertex set $\{1,\dots,N\}$. We would like to buy a target structure at
small cost, but we do not know all the costs $x_i$ ahead of time. Instead, we
inspect the random variables $x_i$ one at a time, and after each inspection,
choose to either keep the vertex $i$ at cost $x_i$, or reject vertex $i$
forever.
  In the present paper, we consider the case where $\{1,\dots,N\}$ is the
edge-set of some graph, and the target structures are the spanning trees of a
graph, spanning arborescences of a digraph, the paths between a fixed pair of
vertices, perfect matchings, Hamilton cycles or the cliques of some fixed size.

 <dc:description>  An untested assumption behind the crowdsourced descriptions of the images in
the Flickr30K dataset (Young et al., 2014) is that they &quot;focus only on the
information that can be obtained from the image alone&quot; (Hodosh et al., 2013, p.
859). This paper presents some evidence against this assumption, and provides a
list of biases and unwarranted inferences that can be found in the Flickr30K
dataset. Finally, it considers methods to find examples of these, and discusses
how we should deal with stereotype-driven descriptions in future applications.

 <dc:description>  A fundamental problem in Distributed Computing is the Pattern Formation
problem, where some independent mobile entities, called robots, have to
rearrange themselves in such a way as to form a given figure from every
possible (non-degenerate) initial configuration.
  In the present paper, we consider robots that operate in the Euclidean plane
and are dimensionless, anonymous, oblivious, silent, asynchronous, disoriented,
non-chiral, and non-rigid. For this very elementary type of robots, the
feasibility of the Pattern Formation problem has been settled, either in the
positive or in the negative, for every possible pattern, except for one case:
the Square Formation problem by a team of four robots.
  Here we solve this last case by giving a Square Formation algorithm and
proving its correctness. Our contribution represents the concluding chapter in
a long thread of research. Our results imply that in the context of the Pattern
Formation problem for mobile robots, features such as synchronicity, chirality,
and rigidity are computationally irrelevant.

 <dc:description>  A large number of different feature detectors has been proposed so far. Any
existing approach presents strengths and weaknesses, which make a detector
optimal only for a limited range of applications. A tool capable of selecting
the optimal feature detector in relation to the operating conditions is
presented in this paper. The input images are quickly analyzed to determine
what type of image transformation is applied to them and at which amount.
Finally, the detector that is expected to obtain the highest repeatability
under such conditions, is chosen to extract features from the input images. The
efficiency and the good accuracy in determining the optimal feature detector
for any operating condition, make the proposed tool suitable to be utilized in
real visual applications. %A large number of different feature detectors has
been proposed so far. Any existing approach presents strengths and weaknesses,
which make a detector optimal only for a limited range of applications. A large
number of different local feature detectors have been proposed in the last few
years. However, each feature detector has its own strengths ad weaknesses that
limit its use to a specific range of applications. In this paper is presented a
tool capable of quickly analysing input images to determine which type and
amount of transformation is applied to them and then selecting the optimal
feature detector, which is expected to perform the best. The results show that
the performance and the fast execution time render the proposed tool suitable
for real-world vision applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the distributed filtering and prediction of
time-varying random fields represented by linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical
systems. The field is observed by a sparsely connected network of
agents/sensors collaborating among themselves. We develop a Kalman filter type
consensus+innovations distributed linear estimator of the dynamic field termed
as Consensus+Innovations Kalman Filter. We analyze the convergence properties
of this distributed estimator. We prove that the mean-squared error of the
estimator asymptotically converges if the degree of instability of the field
dynamics is within a pre-specified threshold defined as tracking capacity of
the estimator. The tracking capacity is a function of the local observation
models and the agent communication network. We design the optimal consensus and
innovation gain matrices yielding distributed estimates with minimized
mean-squared error. Through numerical evaluations, we show that, the
distributed estimator with optimal gains converges faster and with
approximately 3dB better mean-squared error performance than previous

 <dc:description>  This article describes the development of a platform designed to visualize
the 3D motion of the tongue using ultrasound image sequences. An overview of
the system design is given and promising results are presented. Compared to the
analysis of motion in 2D image sequences, such a system can provide additional
visual information and a quantitative description of the tongue 3D motion. The
platform can be useful in a variety of fields, such as speech production,
articulation training, etc.

 <dc:description>  The $p$-curvature of a system of linear differential equations in positive
characteristic $p$ is a matrix that measures how far the system is from having
a basis of polynomial solutions. We show that the similarity class of the
$p$-curvature can be determined without computing the $p$-curvature itself.
More precisely, we design an algorithm that computes the invariant factors of
the $p$-curvature in time quasi-linear in $\sqrt p$. This is much less than the
size of the $p$-curvature, which is generally linear in $p$. The new algorithm
allows to answer a question originating from the study of the Ising model in
statistical physics.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we present an FPGA-based implementation of linear programming
(LP) decoding. LP decoding frames error correction as an optimization problem.
This is in contrast to variants of belief propagation (BP) decoding that view
error correction as a problem of graphical inference. There are many advantages
to taking the optimization perspective: convergence guarantees, improved
performance in certain regimes, and a methodology for incorporating the latest
developments in optimization techniques. However, LP decoding, when implemented
with standard LP solvers, does not easily scale to the blocklengths of modern
error-correction codes. In earlier work, we showed that by drawing on
decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM), we could build an LP decoding solver
that was competitive with BP, both in terms of performance and speed. We also
observed empirically that LP decoders have much better high-SNR performance in
the &quot;error floor&quot; regime, a trait of particular relevance to optical transport
and storage applications. While our previous implementation was in floating
point, in this paper we report initial results of a fixed-point, hardware-based
realization of our ADMM-LP decoder.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years, an increasing amount of data is collected in different and
often, not cooperative, databases. The problem of privacy-preserving,
distributed calculations over separated databases and, a relative to it, issue
of private data release were intensively investigated. However, despite a
considerable progress, computational complexity, due to an increasing size of
data, remains a limiting factor in real-world deployments, especially in case
of privacy-preserving computations.
  In this paper, we present a general method for trade off between performance
and accuracy of distributed calculations by performing data sampling. Sampling
was a topic of extensive research that recently received a boost of interest.
We provide a sampling method targeted at separate, non-collaborating,
vertically partitioned datasets. The method is exemplified and tested on
approximation of intersection set both without and with privacy-preserving
mechanism. An analysis of the bound on error as a function of the sample size
is discussed and heuristic algorithm is suggested to further improve the
performance. The algorithms were implemented and experimental results confirm
the validity of the approach.

 <dc:description>  Network device syslogs are ubiquitous and abundant in modern data centers
with most large data centers producing millions of messages per day. Yet, the
operational information reflected in syslogs and their implications on
diagnosis or management tasks are poorly understood. Prevalent approaches to
understanding syslogs focus on simple correlation and abnormality detection and
are often limited to detection providing little insight towards diagnosis and
resolution.
  Towards improving data center operations, we propose and implement
Log-Prophet, a system that applies a toolbox of statistical techniques and
domain-specific models to mine detailed diagnoses. Log-Prophet infers causal
relationships between syslog lines and constructs succinct but valuable problem
graphs, summarizing root causes and their locality, including cascading
problems. We validate Log-Prophet using problem tickets and through operator
interviews. To demonstrate the strength of Log-Prophet, we perform an initial
longitudinal study of a large online service provider's data center. Our study
demonstrates that Log-Prophet significantly reduces the number of alerts while
highlighting interesting operational issues.

 <dc:description>  E-journal preservation systems have to ingest millions of articles each year.
Ingest, especially of the &quot;long tail&quot; of journals from small publishers, is the
largest element of their cost. Cost is the major reason that archives contain
less than half the content they should. Automation is essential to minimize
these costs. This paper examines the potential for automation beyond the status
quo based on the API provided by CrossRef, ANSI/NISO Z39.99 ResourceSync, and
the provision of typed links in publishers' HTTP response headers. These
changes would not merely assist e-journal preservation and other cross-venue
scholarly applications, but would help remedy the gap that research has
revealed between DOIs' potential and actual benefits.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present the Inter-Battery Topic Model (IBTM). Our approach
extends traditional topic models by learning a factorized latent variable
representation. The structured representation leads to a model that marries
benefits traditionally associated with a discriminative approach, such as
feature selection, with those of a generative model, such as principled
regularization and ability to handle missing data. The factorization is
provided by representing data in terms of aligned pairs of observations as
different views. This provides means for selecting a representation that
separately models topics that exist in both views from the topics that are
unique to a single view. This structured consolidation allows for efficient and
robust inference and provides a compact and efficient representation. Learning
is performed in a Bayesian fashion by maximizing a rigorous bound on the
log-likelihood. Firstly, we illustrate the benefits of the model on a synthetic
dataset,. The model is then evaluated in both uni- and multi-modality settings
on two different classification tasks with off-the-shelf convolutional neural
network (CNN) features which generate state-of-the-art results with extremely
compact representations.

 <dc:title>Combining Density and Overlap (CoDO): A New Method for Assessing the

 <dc:description>  Algorithms for detecting clusters (including overlapping clusters) in graphs
have received significant attention in the research community. A closely
related important aspect of the problem -- quantification of statistical
significance of overlap of clusters, remains relatively unexplored. This paper
presents the first theoretical and practical results on quantifying
statistically significant interactions between clusters in networks. Such
problems commonly arise in diverse applications, ranging from social network
analysis to systems biology. The paper addresses the problem of quantifying the
statistical significance of the observed overlap of the two clusters in an
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph model. The analytical framework presented in the paper
assigns a $p$-value to overlapping subgraphs by combining information about
both the sizes of the subgraphs and their edge densities in comparison to the
corresponding values for their overlapping component. This $p$-value is
demonstrated to have excellent discrimination properties in real applications
and is shown to be robust across broad parameter ranges.
  Our results are comprehensively validated on synthetic, social, and
biological networks. We show that our framework: (i) derives insight from both
the density and the size of overlap among communities (circles/pathways), (ii)
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods over all tested datasets, and
(iii) when compared to other measures, has much broader application scope. In
the context of social networks, we identify highly interdependent (social)
circles and show that our predictions are highly co-enriched with known user
features. In networks of biomolecular interactions, we show that our method
identifies novel cross-talk between pathways, sheds light on their mechanisms
of interaction, and provides new opportunities for investigations of
biomolecular interactions.

 <dc:description>  A video dataset that is designed to study fine-grained categorisation of
pedestrians is introduced. Pedestrians were recorded &quot;in-the-wild&quot; from a
moving vehicle. Annotations include bounding boxes, tracks, 14 keypoints with
occlusion information and the fine-grained categories of age (5 classes), sex
(2 classes), weight (3 classes) and clothing style (4 classes). There are a
total of 27,454 bounding box and pose labels across 4222 tracks. This dataset
is designed to train and test algorithms for fine-grained categorisation of
people, it is also useful for benchmarking tracking, detection and pose
estimation of pedestrians. State-of-the-art algorithms for fine-grained
classification and pose estimation were tested using the dataset and the
results are reported as a useful performance baseline.

 <dc:description>  The false data injection (FDI) attack cannot be detected by the traditional
anomaly detection techniques used in the energy system state estimators. In
this paper, we demonstrate how FDI attacks can be constructed blindly, i.e.,
without system knowledge, including topological connectivity and line reactance
information. Our analysis reveals that existing FDI attacks become detectable
(consequently unsuccessful) by the state estimator if the data contains grossly
corrupted measurements such as device malfunction and communication errors. The
proposed sparse optimization based stealthy attacks construction strategy
overcomes this limitation by separating the gross errors from the measurement
matrix. Extensive theoretical modeling and experimental evaluation show that
the proposed technique performs more stealthily (has less relative error) and
efficiently (fast enough to maintain time requirement) compared to other
methods on IEEE benchmark test systems.

 <dc:description>  Variational inference provides approximations to the computationally
intractable posterior distribution in Bayesian networks. A prominent medical
application of noisy-or Bayesian network is to infer potential diseases given
observed symptoms. Previous studies focus on approximating a handful of
complicated pathological cases using variational transformation. Our goal is to
use variational transformation as part of a novel hybridized inference for
serving reliable and real time diagnosis at web scale. We propose a hybridized
inference that allows variational parameters to be estimated without disease
posteriors or priors, making the inference faster and much of its computation
recyclable. In addition, we propose a transformation ranking algorithm that is
very stable to large variances in network prior probabilities, a common issue
that arises in medical applications of Bayesian networks. In experiments, we
perform comparative study on a large real life medical network and scalability
study on a much larger (36,000x) synthesized network.

 <dc:title>Dimensionality Reduction on SPD Manifolds: The Emergence of

 <dc:description>  Representing images and videos with Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)
matrices, and considering the Riemannian geometry of the resulting space, has
been shown to yield high discriminative power in many visual recognition tasks.
Unfortunately, computation on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices
-especially of high-dimensional ones- comes at a high cost that limits the
applicability of existing techniques. In this paper, we introduce algorithms
able to handle high-dimensional SPD matrices by constructing a
lower-dimensional SPD manifold. To this end, we propose to model the mapping
from the high-dimensional SPD manifold to the low-dimensional one with an
orthonormal projection. This lets us formulate dimensionality reduction as the
problem of finding a projection that yields a low-dimensional manifold either
with maximum discriminative power in the supervised scenario, or with maximum
variance of the data in the unsupervised one. We show that learning can be
expressed as an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold and discuss fast
solutions for special cases. Our evaluation on several classification tasks
evidences that our approach leads to a significant accuracy gain over
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:title>On Polynomial Time Approximation Bounded Solution for TSP and NP
  Complete Problems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Tian, Wenhong</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The question of whether all problems in NP class are also in P class is
generally considered one of the most important open questions in mathematics
and theoretical computer science as it has far-reaching consequences to other
problems in mathematics, computer science, biology, philosophy and
cryptography. There are intensive research on proving `NP not equal to P' and
`NP equals to P'. However, none of the `proved' results is commonly accepted by
the research community up to date. In this paper, motived by approximability of
traveling salesman problem (TSP) in polynomial time, we aim to provide a new
perspective: showing that NP=P from polynomial time approximation-bounded
solutions of TSP in Euclidean space.

 <dc:description>  Complex systems are usually illustrated by networks which captures the
topology of the interactions between the entities. To better understand the
roles played by the entities in the system one needs to uncover the underlying
community structure of the system. In recent years, systems with interactions
that have various types or can change over time between the entities have
attracted an increasing research attention. However, algorithms aiming to solve
the key problem - community detection - in multilayer networks are still
limited. In this work, we first introduce the multilayer network model
representation with multiple aspects, which is flexible to a variety of
networks. Then based on this model, we naturally derive the multilayer
modularity - a widely adopted objective function of community detection in
networks - from a static perspective as an evaluation metric to evaluate the
quality of the communities detected in multilayer networks. It enables us to
better understand the essence of the modularity by pointing out the specific
kind of communities that will lead to a high modularity score. We also propose
a spectral method called mSpec for the optimization of the proposed modularity
function based on the supra-adjacency representation of the multilayer
networks. Experiments on the electroencephalograph network and the comparison
results on several empirical multilayer networks demonstrate the feasibility
and reliable performance of the proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of strongly-convex online optimization in presence of
adversarial delays; in a T-iteration online game, the feedback of the player's
query at time t is arbitrarily delayed by an adversary for d_t rounds and
delivered before the game ends, at iteration t+d_t-1. Specifically for
\algo{online-gradient-descent} algorithm we show it has a simple regret bound
of \Oh{\sum_{t=1}^T \log (1+ \frac{d_t}{t})}. This gives a clear and simple
bound without resorting any distributional and limiting assumptions on the
delays. We further show how this result encompasses and generalizes several of
the existing known results in the literature. Specifically it matches the
celebrated logarithmic regret \Oh{\log T} when there are no delays (i.e. d_t =
1) and regret bound of \Oh{\tau \log T} for constant delays d_t = \tau.

 <dc:title>Faster Projection-free Convex Optimization over the Spectrahedron</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Garber, Dan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Minimizing a convex function over the spectrahedron, i.e., the set of all
positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace, is an important optimization
task with many applications in optimization, machine learning, and signal
processing. It is also notoriously difficult to solve in large-scale since
standard techniques require expensive matrix decompositions. An alternative, is
the conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) that regained much
interest in recent years, mostly due to its application to this specific
setting. The key benefit of the CG method is that it avoids expensive matrix
decompositions all together, and simply requires a single eigenvector
computation per iteration, which is much more efficient. On the downside, the
CG method, in general, converges with an inferior rate. The error for
minimizing a $\beta$-smooth function after $t$ iterations scales like
$\beta/t$. This convergence rate does not improve even if the function is also
strongly convex.
  In this work we present a modification of the CG method tailored for convex
optimization over the spectrahedron. The per-iteration complexity of the method
is essentially identical to that of the standard CG method: only a single
eigenvecor computation is required. For minimizing an $\alpha$-strongly convex
and $\beta$-smooth function, the expected approximation error of the method
after $t$ iterations is: $$O\left({\min\{\frac{\beta{}}{t}
,\left({\frac{\beta\sqrt{\textrm{rank}(\textbf{X}^*)}}{\alpha^{1/4}t}}\right)^{4/3},
\left({\frac{\beta}{\sqrt{\alpha}\lambda_{\min}(\textbf{X}^*)t}}\right)^{2}\}}\right)
,$$ where $\textbf{X}^*$ is the optimal solution. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first result that attains provably faster convergence rates for a
CG variant for optimization over the spectrahedron. We also present encouraging
preliminary empirical results.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional networks are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of
features. We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained
end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic
segmentation. Our key insight is to build &quot;fully convolutional&quot; networks that
take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with
efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully
convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction
tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary
classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully
convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by
fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that
combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance
information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed
segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves improved segmentation
of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT
Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a
typical image.

 <dc:description>  With the advancement in the digital camera technology, the use of high
resolution images and videos has been widespread in the modern society. In
particular, image and video frame registration is frequently applied in
computer graphics and film production. However, the conventional registration
approaches usually require long computational time for high quality images and
video frames. This hinders the applications of the registration approaches in
the modern industries. In this work, we propose a novel approach called {\em
TRIM} to accelerate the computations of the registration by triangulating the
images. More specifically, given a high resolution image or video frame, we
compute an optimal coarse triangulation which captures the important features
of the image. Then, the computation of the registration can be simplified with
the aid of the coarse triangulation. Experimental results suggest that the
computational time of the registration is significantly reduced using our
triangulation-based approach, meanwhile the accuracy of the registration is
well retained when compared with the conventional grid-based approach.

to their simple algebraic form, additional extraordinary properties and their
wide applications in many areas of science and engineering. In the present
paper, six new classes of permutation trinomials over finite fields of even
characteristic are constructed from six fractional polynomials. Further, three
classes of permutation trinomials over finite fields of characteristic three
are raised. Distinct from most of the known permutation trinomials which are
with fixed exponents, our results are some general classes of permutation
trinomials with one parameter in the exponents. Finally, we propose a few

 <dc:description>  A key challenge in fine-grained recognition is how to find and represent
discriminative local regions. Recent attention models are capable of learning
discriminative region localizers only from category labels with reinforcement
learning. However, not utilizing any explicit part information, they are not
able to accurately find multiple distinctive regions. In this work, we
introduce an attribute-guided attention localization scheme where the local
region localizers are learned under the guidance of part attribute
descriptions. By designing a novel reward strategy, we are able to learn to
locate regions that are spatially and semantically distinctive with
reinforcement learning algorithm. The attribute labeling requirement of the
scheme is more amenable than the accurate part location annotation required by
traditional part-based fine-grained recognition methods. Experimental results
on the CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme
on both fine-grained recognition and attribute recognition.

 <dc:description>  In our recent paper, we showed that in exponential family, contrastive
divergence (CD) with fixed learning rate will give asymptotically consistent
estimates \cite{wu2016convergence}. In this paper, we establish consistency and
convergence rate of CD with annealed learning rate $\eta_t$. Specifically,
suppose CD-$m$ generates the sequence of parameters $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$
using an i.i.d. data sample $\mathbf{X}_1^n \sim p_{\theta^*}$ of size $n$,
then $\delta_n(\mathbf{X}_1^n) = \limsup_{t \to \infty} \Vert \sum_{s=t_0}^t
\eta_s \theta_s / \sum_{s=t_0}^t \eta_s - \theta^* \Vert$ converges in
probability to 0 at a rate of $1/\sqrt[3]{n}$. The number ($m$) of MCMC
transitions in CD only affects the coefficient factor of convergence rate. Our
proof is not a simple extension of the one in \cite{wu2016convergence}. which
depends critically on the fact that $\{\theta_t\}_{t \ge 0}$ is a homogeneous
Markov chain conditional on the observed sample $\mathbf{X}_1^n$. Under
annealed learning rate, the homogeneous Markov property is not available and we
have to develop an alternative approach based on super-martingales. Experiment
results of CD on a fully-visible $2\times 2$ Boltzmann Machine are provided to
demonstrate our theoretical results.

 <dc:description>  There is an increasing demand for smart fogcomputing gateways as the size of
cloud data is growing. This paper presents a Fog computing interface (FIT) for
processing clinical speech data. FIT builds upon our previous work on EchoWear,
a wearable technology that validated the use of smartwatches for collecting
clinical speech data from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The fog
interface is a low-power embedded system that acts as a smart interface between
the smartwatch and the cloud. It collects, stores, and processes the speech
data before sending speech features to secure cloud storage. We developed and
validated a working prototype of FIT that enabled remote processing of clinical
speech data to get speech clinical features such as loudness, short-time
energy, zero-crossing rate, and spectral centroid. We used speech data from six
patients with PD in their homes for validating FIT. Our results showed the
efficacy of FIT as a Fog interface to translate the clinical speech processing
chain (CLIP) from a cloud-based backend to a fog-based smart gateway.

 <dc:description>  Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) frequently use vocal exercises in the
treatment of patients with speech disorders. Patients receive treatment in a
clinical setting and need to practice outside of the clinical setting to
generalize speech goals to functional communication. In this paper, we describe
the development of technology that captures mixed speech signals in a group
setting and allows the SLP to analyze the speech signals relative to treatment
goals. The mixed speech signals are blindly separated into individual signals
that are preprocessed before computation of loudness, pitch, shimmer, jitter,
semitone standard deviation and sharpness. The proposed method has been
previously validated on data obtained from clinical trials of people with
Parkinson disease and healthy controls.

 <dc:description>  Building discriminative representations for 3D data has been an important
task in computer graphics and computer vision research. Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) have shown to operate on 2D images with great success for a
variety of tasks. Lifting convolution operators to 3D (3DCNNs) seems like a
plausible and promising next step. Unfortunately, the computational complexity
of 3D CNNs grows cubically with respect to voxel resolution. Moreover, since
most 3D geometry representations are boundary based, occupied regions do not
increase proportionately with the size of the discretization, resulting in
wasted computation. In this work, we represent 3D spaces as volumetric fields,
and propose a novel design that employs field probing filters to efficiently
extract features from them. Each field probing filter is a set of probing
points --- sensors that perceive the space. Our learning algorithm optimizes
not only the weights associated with the probing points, but also their
locations, which deforms the shape of the probing filters and adaptively
distributes them in 3D space. The optimized probing points sense the 3D space
&quot;intelligently&quot;, rather than operating blindly over the entire domain. We show
that field probing is significantly more efficient than 3DCNNs, while providing
state-of-the-art performance, on classification tasks for 3D object recognition
benchmark datasets.

 <dc:description>  Measuring scholarly impact has been a topic of much interest in recent years.
While many use the citation count as a primary indicator of a publications
impact, the quality and impact of those citations will vary. Additionally, it
is often difficult to see where a paper sits among other papers in the same
research area. Questions we wished to answer through this visualization were:
is a publication cited less than publications in the field?; is a publication
cited by high or low impact publications?; and can we visually compare the
impact of publications across a result set? In this work we address the above
questions through a new visualization of publication impact. Our technique has
been applied to the visualization of citation information in INSPIREHEP
(http://www.inspirehep.net), the largest high energy physics publication
repository.

 <dc:description>  In the railway domain, an electronic interlocking is a computerised system
that controls the railway signalling components (e.g. switches or signals) in
order to allow a safe operation of the train traffic. Interlockings are
controlled by a software logic that relies on a generic software and a set of
application data particular to the station under control. The verification of
the application data is time consuming and error prone as it is mostly
performed by human testers. In the first stage of our research, we built a
model of a small Belgian railway station and we performed the verification of
the application data with the nusmv model checker. However, the verification of
larger stations fails due to the state space explosion problem. The intuition
is that large stations can be split into smaller components that can be
verified separately. This concept is known as compositional verification. This
article explains how we used the ocra tool in order to model a medium size
station and how we verified safety properties by mean of contracts. We also
took advantage of new algorithms (k-liveness and ic3) recently implemented in
nuxmv in order to verify LTL properties on our model.

 <dc:description>  Patterns often appear in a variety of large, real-world networks, and
interesting physical phenomena are often explained by network topology as in
the case of the bow-tie structure of the World Wide Web, or the small world
phenomenon in social networks. The discovery and modelling of such regular
patterns has a wide application from disease propagation to financial markets.
In this work we describe a newly discovered regularly occurring striation
pattern found in the PageRank ordering of adjacency matrices that encode
real-world networks. We demonstrate that these striations are the result of
well-known graph generation processes resulting in regularities that are
manifest in the typical neighborhood distribution. The spectral view explored
in this paper encodes a tremendous amount about the explicit and implicit
topology of a given network, so we also discuss the interesting network
properties, outliers and anomalies that a viewer can determine from a brief
look at the re-ordered matrix.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we further develop a recently proposed control method to
switch a bistable system between its steady states using temporal pulses. The
motivation for using pulses comes from biomedical and biological applications
(e.g. synthetic biology), where it is generally difficult to build feedback
control systems due to technical limitations in sensing and actuation. The
original framework was derived for monotone systems and all the extensions
relied on monotone systems theory. In contrast, we introduce the concept of
switching function which is related to eigenfunctions of the so-called Koopman
operator subject to a fixed control pulse. Using the level sets of the
switching function we can (i) compute the set of all pulses that drive the
system toward the steady state in a synchronous way and (ii) estimate the time
needed by the flow to reach an epsilon neighborhood of the target steady state.
Additionally, we show that for monotone systems the switching function is also
monotone in some sense, a property that can yield efficient algorithms to
compute it. This observation recovers and further extends the results of the
original framework, which we illustrate on numerical examples inspired by
biological applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new image representation based on a multilayer
kernel machine. Unlike traditional kernel methods where data representation is
decoupled from the prediction task, we learn how to shape the kernel with
supervision. We proceed by first proposing improvements of the
recently-introduced convolutional kernel networks (CKNs) in the context of
unsupervised learning; then, we derive backpropagation rules to take advantage
of labeled training data. The resulting model is a new type of convolutional
neural network, where optimizing the filters at each layer is equivalent to
learning a linear subspace in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We
show that our method achieves reasonably competitive performance for image
classification on some standard &quot;deep learning&quot; datasets such as CIFAR-10 and
SVHN, and also for image super-resolution, demonstrating the applicability of
our approach to a large variety of image-related tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider a constant envelope (CE) pilot-based
low-complexity technique for frequency synchronization in multi-user massive
MIMO systems. Study of the complexity-performance trade-off shows that this
CE-pilot-based technique provides better MSE performance when compared to
existing low-complexity high-PAPR pilot-based CFO (carrier frequency offset)
estimator. Numerical study of the information rate performance of the TR-MRC
receiver in imperfect CSI scenario with this CE-pilot based CFO estimator shows
that it is more energy-and-spectrally efficient than existing low-complexity
CFO estimator in massive MIMO systems. It is also observed that with this
CE-pilot based CFO estimation, an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{M})$ array gain is
achievable.

 <dc:description>  Most of machine learning approaches have stemmed from the application of
minimizing the mean squared distance principle, based on the computationally
efficient quadratic optimization methods. However, when faced with
high-dimensional and noisy data, the quadratic error functionals demonstrated
many weaknesses including high sensitivity to contaminating factors and
dimensionality curse. Therefore, a lot of recent applications in machine
learning exploited properties of non-quadratic error functionals based on $L_1$
norm or even sub-linear potentials corresponding to quasinorms $L_p$ ($0&lt;p&lt;1$).
The back side of these approaches is increase in computational cost for
optimization. Till so far, no approaches have been suggested to deal with {\it
arbitrary} error functionals, in a flexible and computationally efficient
framework. In this paper, we develop a theory and basic universal data
approximation algorithms ($k$-means, principal components, principal manifolds
and graphs, regularized and sparse regression), based on piece-wise quadratic
error potentials of subquadratic growth (PQSQ potentials). We develop a new and
universal framework to minimize {\it arbitrary sub-quadratic error potentials}
using an algorithm with guaranteed fast convergence to the local or global
error minimum. The theory of PQSQ potentials is based on the notion of the cone
of minorant functions, and represents a natural approximation formalism based
on the application of min-plus algebra. The approach can be applied in most of
existing machine learning methods, including methods of data approximation and
regularized and sparse regression, leading to the improvement in the
computational cost/accuracy trade-off. We demonstrate that on synthetic and
real-life datasets PQSQ-based machine learning methods achieve orders of
magnitude faster computational performance than the corresponding
state-of-the-art methods.

 <dc:description>  TCP proxies are basic building blocks for many advanced middleboxes. In this
paper we present Miniproxy, a TCP proxy built on top of a specialized
minimalistic cloud operating system. Miniproxy's connection handling
performance is comparable to that of full-fledged GNU/Linux TCP proxy
implementations, but its minimalistic footprint enables new use cases.
Specifically, Miniproxy requires as little as 6 MB to run and boots in tens of
milliseconds, enabling massive consolidation, on-the-fly instantiation and edge
cloud computing scenarios. We demonstrate the benefits of Miniproxy by
implementing and evaluating a TCP acceleration use case.

 <dc:description>  We introduce the isogeometric shape optimisation of thin shell structures
using subdivision surfaces. Both triangular Loop and quadrilateral
Catmull-Clark subdivision schemes are considered for geometry modelling and
finite element analysis. A gradient-based shape optimisation technique is
implemented to minimise compliance, i.e. to maximise stiffness. Different
control meshes describing the same surface are used for geometry
representation, optimisation and finite element analysis. The finite element
analysis is performed with subdivision basis functions corresponding to a
sufficiently fine control mesh. During iterative shape optimisation the
geometry is updated starting from the coarsest control mesh and proceeding to
increasingly finer control meshes. The proposed approach is applied to three
optimisation examples, namely a catenary, roof over a rectangular domain and
freeform architectural shell roof. The influence of the geometry description
and the used subdivision scheme on the obtained optimised curved geometries are
investigated in detail.

 <dc:description>  Software architectures are critical in the successful development and
evolution of software-intensive systems. While formal and automated support for
architectural descriptions has been widely addressed, their evolution is
equally crucial, but significantly less well-understood and supported. In order
to face a recurring evolution need, we introduce the concept of evolution
pattern. It formalises an architectural evolution through both a set of
concepts and a reusable evolution process. We propose it through the recurring
need of introducing an architectural style on existing software architectures.
We formally describe and analyse the feasibility of architectural evolution
patterns, and provide a practical validation by implementing them in
COSABuilder, an Eclipse plugin for the COSA architectural description language.

 <dc:description>  Constant envelope (CE) precoding is an appealing transmission technique,
which enables highly efficient power amplification, and is realizable with a
single radio frequency (RF) chain at the multi-antenna transmitter. In this
paper, we study the transceiver design for a point-to-point multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system with CE precoding. Both single-stream
transmission (i.e., beamforming) and multi-stream transmission (i.e., spatial
multiplexing) are considered. For single-stream transmission, we optimize the
receive beamforming vector to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) for any
given channel realization and desired constellation at the combiner output. By
reformulating the problem as an equivalent quadratically constrained quadratic
program (QCQP), we propose an efficient semi-definite relaxation (SDR) based
algorithm to find an approximate solution. Next, for multi-stream transmission,
we propose a new scheme based on antenna grouping at the transmitter and
minimum mean squared error (MMSE) or zero-forcing (ZF) based beamforming at the
receiver. The transmit antenna grouping and receive beamforming vectors are
then jointly designed to minimize the maximum SER over all data streams.
Finally, the error-rate performance of single- versus multi-stream transmission
is compared via simulations under different setups.

 <dc:title>On the Robustness of Decision Tree Learning under Label Noise</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In most practical problems of classifier learning, the training data suffers
from the label noise. Hence, it is important to understand how robust is a
learning algorithm to such label noise. This paper presents some theoretical
analysis to show that many popular decision tree algorithms are robust to
symmetric label noise under large sample size. We also present some sample
complexity results which provide some bounds on the sample size for the
robustness to hold with a high probability. Through extensive simulations we
illustrate this robustness.

 <dc:description>  Community structure is essential for social communications, where individuals
belonging to the same community are much more actively interacting and
communicating with each other than those in different communities within the
human society. Naming game, on the other hand, is a social communication model
that simulates the process of learning a name of an object within a community
of humans, where the individuals can generally reach global consensus
asymptotically through iterative pair-wise conversations. The underlying
network indicates the relationships among the individuals. In this paper, three
typical topologies, namely random-graph, small-world and scale-free networks,
are employed, which are embedded with the multi-local-world community
structure, to study the naming game. Simulations show that 1) the convergence
process to global consensus is getting slower as the community structure
becomes more prominent, and eventually might fail; 2) if the inter-community
connections are sufficiently dense, neither the number nor the size of the
communities affects the convergence process; and 3) for different topologies
with the same average node-degree, local clustering of individuals obstruct or
prohibit global consensus to take place. The results reveal the role of local
communities in a global naming game in social network studies.

 <dc:title>The Bass diffusion model on networks with correlations and inhomogeneous

 <dc:description>  The Bass model, which is an effective forecasting tool for innovation
diffusion based on large collections of empirical data, assumes an homogeneous
diffusion process. We introduce a network structure into this model and we
investigate numerically the dynamics in the case of networks with link density
$P(k)=c/k^\gamma$, where $k=1, \ldots , N$. The resulting curve of the total
adoptions in time is qualitatively similar to the homogeneous Bass curve
corresponding to a case with the same average number of connections. The peak
of the adoptions, however, tends to occur earlier, particularly when $\gamma$
and $N$ are large (i.e., when there are few hubs with a large maximum number of
connections). Most interestingly, the adoption curve of the hubs anticipates
the total adoption curve in a predictable way, with peak times which can be,
for instance when $N=100$, between 10% and 60% of the total adoptions peak.
This may allow to monitor the hubs for forecasting purposes. We also consider
the case of networks with assortative and disassortative correlations and a
case of inhomogeneous advertising where the publicity terms are &quot;targeted&quot; on
the hubs while maintaining their total cost constant.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) conjugate prior
for multiple extended object filtering. A Poisson point process is used to
describe the existence of yet undetected targets, while a multi-Bernoulli
mixture describes the distribution of the targets that have been detected. The
prediction and update equations are presented for the standard transition
density and measurement likelihood. Both the prediction and the update preserve
the PMBM form of the density, and in this sense the PMBM density is a conjugate
prior. However, the unknown data associations lead to an intractably large
number of terms in the PMBM density, and approximations are necessary for
tractability. A gamma Gaussian inverse Wishart implementation is presented,
along with methods to handle the data association problem. A simulation study
shows that the extended target PMBM filter outperforms the extended target
$\delta$-GLMB and LMB filters. An experiment with Lidar data illustrates the
benefit of tracking both detected and undetected targets.

 <dc:description>  Similes are natural language expressions used to compare unlikely things,
where the comparison is not taken literally. They are often used in everyday
communication and are an important part of cultural heritage. Having an
up-to-date corpus of similes is challenging, as they are constantly coined
and/or adapted to the contemporary times. In this paper we present a
methodology for semi-automated collection of similes from the world wide web
using text mining techniques. We expanded an existing corpus of traditional
similes (containing 333 similes) by collecting 446 additional expressions. We,
also, explore how crowdsourcing can be used to extract and curate new similes.

 <dc:title>Asymptotic analysis of threshold models for social networks</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A class of dynamic threshold models is proposed, for describing the upset of
collective actions in social networks. The agents of the network have to decide
whether to undertake a certain action or not. They make their decision by
comparing the activity level of their neighbors with a time-varying threshold,
evolving according to a time-invariant opinion dynamic model. Key features of
the model are a parameter representing the degree of self-confidence of the
agents, and the mechanism adopted by the agents to evaluate the activity level
of their neighbors. The case in which a radical agent, initially eager to
undertake the action, interacts with a group of ordinary agents, is considered.
The main contribution of the paper is the complete analytic characterization of
the asymptotic behaviors of the network, for three different graph topologies.
The asymptotic activity patterns are determined as a function of the
self-confidence parameter and of the initial threshold of the ordinary agents.

 <dc:description>  Superpixel segmentation is becoming ubiquitous in computer vision. In
practice, an object can either be represented by a number of segments in finer
levels of detail or included in a surrounding region at coarser levels of
detail, and thus a superpixel segmentation hierarchy is useful for applications
that require different levels of image segmentation detail depending on the
particular image objects segmented. Unfortunately, there is no method that can
generate all scales of superpixels accurately in real-time. As a result, a
simple yet effective algorithm named Super Hierarchy (SH) is proposed in this
paper. It is as accurate as the state-of-the-art but 1-2 orders of magnitude
faster. The proposed method can be directly integrated with recent efficient
edge detectors like the structured forest edges to significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art in terms of segmentation accuracy. Quantitative and
qualitative evaluation on a number of computer vision applications was
conducted, demonstrating that the proposed method is the top performer.

 <dc:description>  Recently, social phenomena have received a lot of attention not only from
social scientists, but also from physicists, mathematicians and computer
scientists, in the emerging interdisciplinary field of complex system science.
Opinion dynamics is one of the processes studied, since opinions are the
drivers of human behaviour, and play a crucial role in many global challenges
that our complex world and societies are facing: global financial crises,
global pandemics, growth of cities, urbanisation and migration patterns, and
last but not least important, climate change and environmental sustainability
and protection. Opinion formation is a complex process affected by the
interplay of different elements, including the individual predisposition, the
influence of positive and negative peer interaction (social networks playing a
crucial role in this respect), the information each individual is exposed to,
and many others. Several models inspired from those in use in physics have been
developed to encompass many of these elements, and to allow for the
identification of the mechanisms involved in the opinion formation process and
the understanding of their role, with the practical aim of simulating opinion
formation and spreading under various conditions. These modelling schemes range
from binary simple models such as the voter model, to multi-dimensional
continuous approaches. Here, we provide a review of recent methods, focusing on
models employing both peer interaction and external information, and
emphasising the role that less studied mechanisms, such as disagreement, has in
driving the opinion dynamics. [...]

 <dc:description>  Nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA) provides an appealing
framework for unsupervised feature learning, but the models proposed so far are
not identifiable. Here, we first propose a new intuitive principle of
unsupervised deep learning from time series which uses the nonstationary
structure of the data. Our learning principle, time-contrastive learning (TCL),
finds a representation which allows optimal discrimination of time segments
(windows). Surprisingly, we show how TCL can be related to a nonlinear ICA
model, when ICA is redefined to include temporal nonstationarities. In
particular, we show that TCL combined with linear ICA estimates the nonlinear
ICA model up to point-wise transformations of the sources, and this solution is
unique --- thus providing the first identifiability result for nonlinear ICA
which is rigorous, constructive, as well as very general.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we study parameter tuning towards the M^2 metric, the standard
metric for automatic grammar error correction (GEC) tasks. After implementing
M^2 as a scorer in the Moses tuning framework, we investigate interactions of
dense and sparse features, different optimizers, and tuning strategies for the
CoNLL-2014 shared task. We notice erratic behavior when optimizing sparse
feature weights with M^2 and offer partial solutions. We find that a bare-bones
phrase-based SMT setup with task-specific parameter-tuning outperforms all
previously published results for the CoNLL-2014 test set by a large margin
(46.37% M^2 over previously 41.75%, by an SMT system with neural features)
while being trained on the same, publicly available data. Our newly introduced
dense and sparse features widen that gap, and we improve the state-of-the-art
to 49.49% M^2.

 <dc:description>  This book chapter attempts to counter anxieties in the humanities and social
science about the role of big data in research by focusing on approaches which,
by being firmly grounded in the traditional values of disciplines, enhance
existing methods to produce fruitful research. Big data poses many
methodological challenges, but these pressures should prompt scholars to pay
much closer attention to methodological issues than they have in the past.

 <dc:description>  Lurking is a complex user-behavioral phenomenon that occurs in all
large-scale online communities and social networks. It generally refers to the
behavior characterizing users that benefit from the information produced by
others in the community without actively contributing back to the production of
social content. The amount and evolution of lurkers may strongly affect an
online social environment, therefore understanding the lurking dynamics and
identifying strategies to curb this trend are relevant problems. In this
regard, we introduce the Lurker Game, i.e., a model for analyzing the
transitions from a lurking to a non-lurking (i.e., active) user role, and vice
versa, in terms of evolutionary game theory. We evaluate the proposed Lurker
Game by arranging agents on complex networks and analyzing the system
evolution, seeking relations between the network topology and the final
equilibrium of the game. Results suggest that the Lurker Game is suitable to
model the lurking dynamics, showing how the adoption of rewarding mechanisms
combined with the modeling of hypothetical heterogeneity of users' interests
may lead users in an online community towards a cooperative behavior.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Address clustering tries to construct the one-to-many mapping from entities
to addresses in the Bitcoin system. Simple heuristics based on the
micro-structure of transactions have proved very effective in practice. In this
paper we describe the primary reasons behind this effectiveness: address reuse,
avoidable merging, super-clusters with high centrality, and the incremental
growth of address clusters. We quantify their impact during Bitcoin's first
seven years of existence.

 <dc:title>Fast $\epsilon$-free Inference of Simulation Models with Bayesian

 <dc:description>  Many statistical models can be simulated forwards but have intractable
likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods are used to infer
properties of these models from data. Traditionally these methods approximate
the posterior over parameters by conditioning on data being inside an
$\epsilon$-ball around the observed data, which is only correct in the limit
$\epsilon\!\rightarrow\!0$. Monte Carlo methods can then draw samples from the
approximate posterior to approximate predictions or error bars on parameters.
These algorithms critically slow down as $\epsilon\!\rightarrow\!0$, and in
practice draw samples from a broader distribution than the posterior. We
propose a new approach to likelihood-free inference based on Bayesian
conditional density estimation. Preliminary inferences based on limited
simulation data are used to guide later simulations. In some cases, learning an
accurate parametric representation of the entire true posterior distribution
requires fewer model simulations than Monte Carlo ABC methods need to produce a
single sample from an approximate posterior.

 <dc:description>  After data selection, pre-processing, transformation, and feature extraction,
knowledge extraction is not the final step in a data mining process. It is then
necessary to understand this knowledge in order to apply it efficiently and
effectively. Up to now, there is a lack of appropriate techniques that support
this significant step. This is partly due to the fact that the assessment of
knowledge is often highly subjective, e.g., regarding aspects such as novelty
or usefulness. These aspects depend on the specific knowledge and requirements
of the data miner. There are, however, a number of aspects that are objective
and for which it is possible to provide appropriate measures. In this article
we focus on classification problems and use probabilistic generative
classifiers based on mixture density models that are quite common in data
mining applications. We define objective measures to assess the
informativeness, uniqueness, importance, discrimination, representativity,
uncertainty, and distinguishability of rules contained in these classifiers
numerically. These measures not only support a data miner in evaluating results
of a data mining process based on such classifiers. As we will see in
illustrative case studies, they may also be used to improve the data mining
process itself or to support the later application of the extracted knowledge.

 <dc:creator>Sun, Tianjiao</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Mathematical Software</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this project, we introduce OPESCI-FD, a Python package built on symbolic
mathematics to automatically generate Finite Difference models from a
high-level description of the model equations. We investigate applying this
framework to generate the propagator program used in seismic imaging. We
implement the 3D velocity-stress FD scheme as an example and demonstrate the
advantages of usability, flexibility and accuracy of the framework. The design
of OPESCI-FD aims to allow rapid development, analysis and optimisation of
Finite Difference programs. OPESCI-FD is the foundation for continuing
development by the OPESCI project team, building on the research presented in
this report. This report concludes by reviewing the further developments that
are already under way, as well as the scope for extension to cater for other
equations and numerical schemes.

 <dc:description>  The type of malicious attack inflicting on networks greatly influences their
stability under ordinary percolation in which a node fails when it becomes
disconnected from the giant component. Here we study its generalization,
$k$-core percolation, in which a node fails when it loses connection to a
threshold $k$ number of neighbors. We study and compare analytically and by
numerical simulations of $k$-core percolation the stability of networks under
random attacks (RA), localized attacks (LA) and targeted attacks (TA),
respectively. By mapping a network under LA or TA into an equivalent network
under RA, we find that in both single and interdependent networks, TA exerts
the greatest damage to the core structure of a network. We also find that for
Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) networks, LA and RA exert equal damage to the core
structure whereas for scale-free (SF) networks, LA exerts much more damage than
RA does to the core structure.

 <dc:title>Deep Multi-task Representation Learning: A Tensor Factorisation Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yang, Yongxin</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Hospedales, Timothy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Most contemporary multi-task learning methods assume linear models. This
setting is considered shallow in the era of deep learning. In this paper, we
present a new deep multi-task representation learning framework that learns
cross-task sharing structure at every layer in a deep network. Our approach is
based on generalising the matrix factorisation techniques explicitly or
implicitly used by many conventional MTL algorithms to tensor factorisation, to
realise automatic learning of end-to-end knowledge sharing in deep networks.
This is in contrast to existing deep learning approaches that need a
user-defined multi-task sharing strategy. Our approach applies to both
homogeneous and heterogeneous MTL. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our
deep multi-task representation learning in terms of both higher accuracy and
fewer design choices.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we bridge the gap between hyperparameter optimization and
ensemble learning by performing Bayesian optimization of an ensemble with
regards to its hyperparameters. Our method consists in building a fixed-size
ensemble, optimizing the configuration of one classifier of the ensemble at
each iteration of the hyperparameter optimization algorithm, taking into
consideration the interaction with the other models when evaluating potential
performances. We also consider the case where the ensemble is to be
reconstructed at the end of the hyperparameter optimization phase, through a
greedy selection over the pool of models generated during the optimization. We
study the performance of our proposed method on three different hyperparameter
spaces, showing that our approach is better than both the best single model and
a greedy ensemble construction over the models produced by a standard Bayesian
optimization.

 <dc:description>  Wyner's soft-covering lemma is the central analysis step for achievability
proofs of information theoretic security, resolvability, and channel synthesis.
It can also be used for simple achievability proofs in lossy source coding.
This work sharpens the claim of soft-covering by moving away from an expected
value analysis. Instead, a random codebook is shown to achieve the
soft-covering phenomenon with high probability. The probability of failure is
super-exponentially small in the block-length, enabling many applications
through the union bound. This work gives bounds for both the exponential decay
rate of total variation and the second-order codebook rate for soft covering.

 <dc:description>  We consider convex-concave saddle-point problems where the objective
functions may be split in many components, and extend recent stochastic
variance reduction methods (such as SVRG or SAGA) to provide the first
large-scale linearly convergent algorithms for this class of problems which is
common in machine learning. While the algorithmic extension is straightforward,
it comes with challenges and opportunities: (a) the convex minimization
analysis does not apply and we use the notion of monotone operators to prove
convergence, showing in particular that the same algorithm applies to a larger
class of problems, such as variational inequalities, (b) there are two notions
of splits, in terms of functions, or in terms of partial derivatives, (c) the
split does need to be done with convex-concave terms, (d) non-uniform sampling
is key to an efficient algorithm, both in theory and practice, and (e) these
incremental algorithms can be easily accelerated using a simple extension of
the &quot;catalyst&quot; framework, leading to an algorithm which is always superior to
accelerated batch algorithms.

 <dc:title>ImageCL: An Image Processing Language for Performance Portability on

 <dc:description>  Modern computer systems typically conbine multicore CPUs with accelerators
like GPUs for inproved performance and energy efficiency. However, these sys-
tems suffer from poor performance portability, code tuned for one device must
be retuned to achieve high performance on another. Image processing is increas-
ing in importance , with applications ranging from seismology and medicine to
Photoshop. Based on our experience with medical image processing, we propose
ImageCL, a high-level domain-specific language and source-to-source compiler,
targeting heterogeneous hardware. ImageCL resembles OpenCL, but abstracts away
per- formance optimization details, allowing the programmer to focus on
algorithm development, rather than performance tuning. The latter is left to
our source-to- source compiler and auto-tuner. From high-level ImageCL kernels,
our source- to-source compiler can generate multiple OpenCL implementations
with different optimizations applied. We rely on auto-tuning rather than
machine models or ex- pert programmer knowledge to determine which
optimizations to apply, making our tuning procedure highly robust. Furthermore,
we can generate high perform- ing implementations for different devices from a
single source code, thereby im- proving performance portability. We evaluate
our approach on three image processing benchmarks, on different GPU and CPU
devices, and are able to outperform other state of the art solutions in several
cases, achieving speedups of up to 4.57x.

 <dc:description>  Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved major breakthroughs in
recent years. Their performance in computer vision have matched and in some
areas even surpassed human capabilities. Deep neural networks can capture
complex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of high
computational and memory requirements. State-of-art networks require billions
of arithmetic operations and millions of parameters. To enable embedded devices
such as smartphones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishing
power of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decrease
both execution time and power consumption. In applications where fast
connection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important,
computation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deep
neural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step of
accelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, which
enables energy-efficient inference. We present Ristretto, a fast and automated
framework for CNN approximation. Ristretto simulates the hardware arithmetic of
a custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of network
parameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip area
for multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove the
need for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. The
tool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Since
training of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highly
optimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of any
given network. Given a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfully
condense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.

 <dc:title>The Price of Fog: a Data-Driven Study on Caching Architectures in

 <dc:description>  Vehicular users are expected to consume large amounts of data, for both
entertainment and navigation purposes. This will put a strain on cellular
networks, which will be able to cope with such a load only if proper caching is
in place, this in turn begs the question of which caching architecture is the
best-suited to deal with vehicular content consumption. In this paper, we
leverage a large-scale, crowd-collected trace to (i) characterize the vehicular
traffic demand, in terms of overall magnitude and content breakup, (ii) assess
how different caching approaches perform against such a real-world load, (iii)
study the effect of recommendation systems and local contents. We define a
price-of-fog metric, expressing the additional caching capacity to deploy when
moving from traditional, centralized caching architectures to a &quot;fog computing&quot;
approach, where caches are closer to the network edge. We find that for
location-specific contents, such as the ones that vehicular users are most
likely to request, such a price almost disappears. Vehicular networks thus make
a strong case for the adoption of mobile-edge caching, as we are able to reap
the benefit thereof -- including a reduction in the distance traveled by data,
within the core network -- with little or no of the associated disadvantages.

 <dc:description>  We present region-based, fully convolutional networks for accurate and
efficient object detection. In contrast to previous region-based detectors such
as Fast/Faster R-CNN that apply a costly per-region subnetwork hundreds of
times, our region-based detector is fully convolutional with almost all
computation shared on the entire image. To achieve this goal, we propose
position-sensitive score maps to address a dilemma between
translation-invariance in image classification and translation-variance in
object detection. Our method can thus naturally adopt fully convolutional image
classifier backbones, such as the latest Residual Networks (ResNets), for
object detection. We show competitive results on the PASCAL VOC datasets (e.g.,
83.6% mAP on the 2007 set) with the 101-layer ResNet. Meanwhile, our result is
achieved at a test-time speed of 170ms per image, 2.5-20x faster than the
Faster R-CNN counterpart. Code is made publicly available at:

 <dc:description>  Contour and skeleton are two complementary representations for shape
recognition. However combining them in a principal way is nontrivial, as they
are generally abstracted by different structures (closed string vs graph),
respectively. This paper aims at addressing the shape recognition problem by
combining contour and skeleton according to the correspondence between them.
The correspondence provides a straightforward way to associate skeletal
information with a shape contour. More specifically, we propose a new shape
descriptor. named Skeleton-associated Shape Context (SSC), which captures the
features of a contour fragment associated with skeletal information. Benefited
from the association, the proposed shape descriptor provides the complementary
geometric information from both contour and skeleton parts, including the
spatial distribution and the thickness change along the shape part. To form a
meaningful shape feature vector for an overall shape, the Bag of Features
framework is applied to the SSC descriptors extracted from it. Finally, the
shape feature vector is fed into a linear SVM classifier to recognize the
shape. The encouraging experimental results demonstrate that the proposed way
to combine contour and skeleton is effective for shape recognition, which
achieves the state-of-the-art performances on several standard shape
benchmarks.

 <dc:title>Root-cause analysis for time-series anomalies via spatiotemporal causal

 <dc:description>  Modern distributed cyber-physical systems encounter a large variety of
anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault
propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. In this
regard, root-cause analysis becomes highly intractable due to complex fault
propagation mechanisms in combination with diverse operating modes. This paper
presents a new data-driven framework for root-cause analysis for addressing
such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction
scheme for multivariate time series built on the concept of symbolic dynamics
for discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems of a
complex system. We propose sequential state switching ($S^3$) and artificial
anomaly association ($A^3$) methods to implement root-cause analysis in an
unsupervised and semi-supervised manner respectively. Synthetic data from cases
with failed pattern(s) and anomalous node are simulated to validate the
proposed approaches, then compared with the performance of vector
autoregressive (VAR) model-based root-cause analysis. The results show that:
(1) $S^3$ and $A^3$ approaches can obtain high accuracy in root-cause analysis
and successfully handle multiple nominal operation modes, and (2) the proposed
tool-chain is shown to be scalable while maintaining high accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of clustering partially labeled data from a minimal
number of randomly chosen pairwise comparisons between the items. We introduce
an efficient local algorithm based on a power iteration of the non-backtracking
operator and study its performance on a simple model. For the case of two
clusters, we give bounds on the classification error and show that a small
error can be achieved from $O(n)$ randomly chosen measurements, where $n$ is
the number of items in the dataset. Our algorithm is therefore efficient both
in terms of time and space complexities. We also investigate numerically the
performance of the algorithm on synthetic and real world data.

 <dc:description>  The use of Bayesian methods in large-scale data settings is attractive
because of the rich hierarchical models, uncertainty quantification, and prior
specification they provide. Standard Bayesian inference algorithms are
computationally expensive, however, making their direct application to large
datasets difficult or infeasible. Recent work on scaling Bayesian inference has
focused on modifying the underlying algorithms to, for example, use only a
random data subsample at each iteration. We leverage the insight that data is
often redundant to instead obtain a weighted subset of the data (called a
coreset) that is much smaller than the original dataset. We can then use this
small coreset in any number of existing posterior inference algorithms without
modification. In this paper, we develop an efficient coreset construction
algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression models. We provide theoretical
guarantees on the size and approximation quality of the coreset -- both for
fixed, known datasets, and in expectation for a wide class of data generative
models. Crucially, the proposed approach also permits efficient construction of
the coreset in both streaming and parallel settings, with minimal additional
effort. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a number of synthetic
and real-world datasets, and find that, in practice, the size of the coreset is
independent of the original dataset size. Furthermore, constructing the coreset
takes a negligible amount of time compared to that required to run MCMC on it.

 <dc:description>  CRDT[24] Sets as implemented in Riak[6] perform poorly for writes, both as
cardinality grows, and for sets larger than 500KB[25]. Riak users wish to
create high cardinality CRDT sets, and expect better than O(n) performance for
individual insert and remove operations. By decomposing a CRDT set on disk, and
employing delta-replication[2], we can achieve far better performance than just
delta replication alone: relative to the size of causal metadata, not the
cardinality of the set, and we can support sets that are 100s times the size of
Riak sets, while still providing the same level of consistency. There is a
trade-off in read performance but we expect it is mitigated by enabling queries
on sets.

 <dc:description>  In this work we propose a novel interpretation of residual networks showing
that they can be seen as a collection of many paths of differing length.
Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging
only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite
residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional
models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study
reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do
not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are
shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during
training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of
the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are
only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that
seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the
vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient
throughout the extent of very deep networks.

 <dc:description>  We introduce Deep Variational Bayes Filters (DVBF), a new method for
unsupervised learning and identification of latent Markovian state space
models. Leveraging recent advances in Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes,
DVBF can overcome intractable inference distributions via variational
inference. Thus, it can handle highly nonlinear input data with temporal and
spatial dependencies such as image sequences without domain knowledge. Our
experiments show that enabling backpropagation through transitions enforces
state space assumptions and significantly improves information content of the
latent embedding. This also enables realistic long-term prediction.

 <dc:description>  Establishing correspondence between shapes is a fundamental problem in
geometry processing, arising in a wide variety of applications. The problem is
especially difficult in the setting of non-isometric deformations, as well as
in the presence of topological noise and missing parts, mainly due to the
limited capability to model such deformations axiomatically. Several recent
works showed that invariance to complex shape transformations can be learned
from examples. In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic convolutional neural
network architecture based on anisotropic diffusion kernels, which we term
Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN). In our construction, we
generalize convolutions to non-Euclidean domains by constructing a set of
oriented anisotropic diffusion kernels, creating in this way a local intrinsic
polar representation of the data (`patch'), which is then correlated with a
filter. Several cascades of such filters, linear, and non-linear operators are
stacked to form a deep neural network whose parameters are learned by
minimizing a task-specific cost. We use ACNNs to effectively learn intrinsic
dense correspondences between deformable shapes in very challenging settings,
achieving state-of-the-art results on some of the most difficult recent
correspondence benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  We consider online learning algorithms that guarantee worst-case regret rates
in adversarial environments (so they can be deployed safely and will perform
robustly), yet adapt optimally to favorable stochastic environments (so they
will perform well in a variety of settings of practical importance). We
quantify the friendliness of stochastic environments by means of the well-known
Bernstein (a.k.a. generalized Tsybakov margin) condition. For two recent
algorithms (Squint for the Hedge setting and MetaGrad for online convex
optimization) we show that the particular form of their data-dependent
individual-sequence regret guarantees implies that they adapt automatically to
the Bernstein parameters of the stochastic environment. We prove that these
algorithms attain fast rates in their respective settings both in expectation
and with high probability.

 <dc:description>  Spectrum sharing mechanisms need to be carefully designed to enable
inter-technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, as these bands are an
instance of a spectrum commons where heterogeneous technologies and deployments
must coexist. Unlike in licensed bands, where multiple technologies could
coexist only in a primary-secondary DSA mode, a spectrum commons offers
competition opportunities between multiple dominant technologies, such as Wi-Fi
and the recently proposed LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band. In this paper we
systematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for
inter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are
threefold. First, we propose a general framework for comparative analysis of
spectrum sharing mechanisms in time and frequency, by studying the effect of
key constituent parameters. Second, we propose a novel throughput and
interference model for inter-technology coexistence, integrating different
distributed MAC sharing mechanisms at the same level of abstraction. Finally,
we present a case study of IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi and LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed
band, in order to obtain generalizable insight into coexistence in a spectrum
commons. Our extensive simulation results show that LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence in
the 5 GHz band can be ensured simply through channel selection schemes, such
that time-sharing MAC mechanisms are irrelevant. We also show that, in the
general co-channel case, the coexistence performance of MAC sharing mechanisms
strongly depends on the interference coupling in the network, as determined by
building shielding. We thus identify two regimes: (i) low interference
coupling, e.g. residential indoor scenarios, where duty cycle mechanisms
outperform sensing-based LBT mechanisms; and (ii) high interference coupling,
e.g. open-plan indoor or outdoor hotspot scenarios, where LBT outperforms duty
cycle mechanisms.

 <dc:description>  We present a general theoretical analysis of structured prediction with a
series of new results. We give new data-dependent margin guarantees for
structured prediction for a very wide family of loss functions and a general
family of hypotheses, with an arbitrary factor graph decomposition. These are
the tightest margin bounds known for both standard multi-class and general
structured prediction problems. Our guarantees are expressed in terms of a
data-dependent complexity measure, factor graph complexity, which we show can
be estimated from data and bounded in terms of familiar quantities. We further
extend our theory by leveraging the principle of Voted Risk Minimization (VRM)
and show that learning is possible even with complex factor graphs. We present
new learning bounds for this advanced setting, which we use to design two new
algorithms, Voted Conditional Random Field (VCRF) and Voted Structured Boosting
(StructBoost). These algorithms can make use of complex features and factor
graphs and yet benefit from favorable learning guarantees. We also report the
results of experiments with VCRF on several datasets to validate our theory.

 <dc:description>  In artificial neural networks, learning from data is a computationally
demanding task in which a large number of connection weights are iteratively
tuned through stochastic-gradient-based heuristic processes over a
cost-function. It is not well understood how learning occurs in these systems,
in particular how they avoid getting trapped in configurations with poor
computational performance. Here we study the difficult case of networks with
discrete weights, where the optimization landscape is very rough even for
simple architectures, and provide theoretical and numerical evidence of the
existence of rare - but extremely dense and accessible - regions of
configurations in the network weight space. We define a novel measure, which we
call the &quot;robust ensemble&quot; (RE), which suppresses trapping by isolated
configurations and amplifies the role of these dense regions. We analytically
compute the RE in some exactly solvable models, and also provide a general
algorithmic scheme which is straightforward to implement: define a
cost-function given by a sum of a finite number of replicas of the original
cost-function, with a constraint centering the replicas around a driving
assignment. To illustrate this, we derive several powerful new algorithms,
ranging from Markov Chains to message passing to gradient descent processes,
where the algorithms target the robust dense states, resulting in substantial
improvements in performance. The weak dependence on the number of precision
bits of the weights leads us to conjecture that very similar reasoning applies
to more conventional neural networks. Analogous algorithmic schemes can also be
applied to other optimization problems.

 <dc:title>Query-Efficient Imitation Learning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  One way to approach end-to-end autonomous driving is to learn a policy
function that maps from a sensory input, such as an image frame from a
front-facing camera, to a driving action, by imitating an expert driver, or a
reference policy. This can be done by supervised learning, where a policy
function is tuned to minimize the difference between the predicted and
ground-truth actions. A policy function trained in this way however is known to
suffer from unexpected behaviours due to the mismatch between the states
reachable by the reference policy and trained policy functions. More advanced
algorithms for imitation learning, such as DAgger, addresses this issue by
iteratively collecting training examples from both reference and trained
policies. These algorithms often requires a large number of queries to a
reference policy, which is undesirable as the reference policy is often
expensive. In this paper, we propose an extension of the DAgger, called
SafeDAgger, that is query-efficient and more suitable for end-to-end autonomous
driving. We evaluate the proposed SafeDAgger in a car racing simulator and show
that it indeed requires less queries to a reference policy. We observe a
significant speed up in convergence, which we conjecture to be due to the
effect of automated curriculum learning.

 <dc:description>  Modern computer vision algorithms typically require expensive data
acquisition and accurate manual labeling. In this work, we instead leverage the
recent progress in computer graphics to generate fully labeled, dynamic, and
photo-realistic proxy virtual worlds. We propose an efficient real-to-virtual
world cloning method, and validate our approach by building and publicly
releasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI (see
http://www.xrce.xerox.com/Research-Development/Computer-Vision/Proxy-Virtual-Worlds),
automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection,
tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow. We provide
quantitative experimental evidence suggesting that (i) modern deep learning
algorithms pre-trained on real data behave similarly in real and virtual
worlds, and (ii) pre-training on virtual data improves performance. As the gap
between real and virtual worlds is small, virtual worlds enable measuring the
impact of various weather and imaging conditions on recognition performance,
all other things being equal. We show these factors may affect drastically
otherwise high-performing deep models for tracking.

 <dc:description>  We describe Swapout, a new stochastic training method, that outperforms
ResNets of identical network structure yielding impressive results on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100. Swapout samples from a rich set of architectures including
dropout, stochastic depth and residual architectures as special cases. When
viewed as a regularization method swapout not only inhibits co-adaptation of
units in a layer, similar to dropout, but also across network layers. We
conjecture that swapout achieves strong regularization by implicitly tying the
parameters across layers. When viewed as an ensemble training method, it
samples a much richer set of architectures than existing methods such as
dropout or stochastic depth. We propose a parameterization that reveals
connections to exiting architectures and suggests a much richer set of
architectures to be explored. We show that our formulation suggests an
efficient training method and validate our conclusions on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 matching state of the art accuracy. Remarkably, our 32 layer wider
model performs similar to a 1001 layer ResNet model.

 <dc:description>  Web services are software systems designed for supporting interoperable
dynamic cross-enterprise interactions. The result of attacks to Web services
can be catastrophic and causing the disclosure of enterprises' confidential
data. As new approaches of attacking arise every day, anomaly detection systems
seem to be invaluable tools in this context. The aim of this work has been to
target the attacks that reside in the Web service layer and the extensible
markup language (XML)-structured simple object access protocol (SOAP) messages.
After studying the shortcomings of the existing solutions, a new approach for
detecting anomalies in Web services is outlined. More specifically, the
proposed technique illustrates how to identify anomalies by employing mining
methods on XML-structured SOAP messages. This technique also takes the
advantages of tree-based association rule mining to extract knowledge in the
training phase, which is used in the test phase to detect anomalies. In
addition, this novel composition of techniques brings nearly low false alarm
rate while maintaining the detection rate reasonably high, which is shown by a
case study.

 <dc:description>  Modern web browsers are incredibly complex, with millions of lines of code
and over one thousand JavaScript functions and properties available to website
authors. This work investigates how these browser features are used on the
modern, open web. We find that JavaScript features differ wildly in popularity,
with over 50% of provided features never used in the Alexa 10k.
  We also look at how popular ad and tracking blockers change the distribution
of features used by sites, and identify a set of approximately 10% of features
that are disproportionately blocked (prevented from executing by these
extensions at least 90% of the time they are used). We additionally find that
in the presence of these blockers, over 83% of available features are executed
on less than 1% of the most popular 10,000 websites.
  We additionally measure a variety of aspects of browser feature usage on the
web, including how complex sites have become in terms of feature usage, how the
length of time a browser feature has been in the browser relates to its usage
on the web, and how many security vulnerabilities have been associated with
related browser features.

 <dc:description>  We consider regression under the &quot;extremely small $n$ large $p$&quot; condition,
where the number of samples $n$ is so small compared to the dimensionality $p$
that predictors cannot be estimated without prior knowledge. This setup occurs
in personalized medicine, for instance, when predicting treatment outcomes for
an individual patient based on noisy high-dimensional genomics data. A
remaining source of information is expert knowledge, which has received
relatively little attention in recent years. We formulate the inference problem
of asking expert feedback on features on a budget, propose an elicitation
strategy for a simple &quot;small $n$&quot; setting, and derive conditions under which
the elicitation strategy is optimal. Experiments on simulated experts, both on
synthetic and genomics data, demonstrate that the proposed strategy can
drastically improve prediction accuracy.

 <dc:title>Simple DRAM and Virtual Memory Abstractions to Enable Highly Efficient
  Memory Systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Seshadri, Vivek</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Hardware Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In most modern systems, the memory subsystem is managed and accessed at
multiple different granularities at various resources. We observe that such
multi-granularity management results in significant inefficiency in the memory
subsystem. Specifically, we observe that 1) page-granularity virtual memory
unnecessarily triggers large memory operations, and 2) existing cache-line
granularity memory interface is inefficient for performing bulk data operations
and operations that exhibit poor spatial locality. To address these problems,
we present a series of techniques in this thesis.
  First, we propose page overlays, a framework augments the existing virtual
memory framework with the ability to track a new version of a subset of cache
lines within each virtual page. We show that this extension is powerful by
demonstrating its benefits on a number of applications.
  Second, we show that DRAM can be used to perform more complex operations than
just store data. We propose RowClone, a mechanism to perform bulk data copy and
initialization completely inside DRAM, and Buddy RAM, a mechanism to perform
bulk bitwise operations using DRAM. Both these techniques achieve an
order-of-magnitude improvement in the efficiency of the respective operations.
  Third, we propose Gather-Scatter DRAM, a technique that exploits DRAM
organization to effectively gather/scatter values with a power-of-2 strided
access patterns. For these access patterns, GS-DRAM achieves near-ideal
bandwidth and cache utilization, without increasing the latency of fetching
data from memory.
  Finally, we propose the Dirty-Block Index, a new way of tracking dirty
blocks. In addition to improving the efficiency of bulk data coherence, DBI has
several applications including high-performance memory scheduling, efficient
cache lookup bypassing, and enabling heterogeneous ECC.

 <dc:title>Using Read-$k$ Inequalities to Analyze a Distributed MIS Algorithm</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Until recently, the fastest distributed MIS algorithm, even for simple
graphs, e.g., unoriented trees has been the simple randomized algorithm
discovered the 80s. This algorithm (commonly called Luby's algorithm) computes
an MIS in $O(\log n)$ rounds (with high probability). This situation changed
when Lenzen and Wattenhofer (PODC 2011) presented a randomized $O(\sqrt{\log
n}\cdot \log\log n)$-round MIS algorithm for unoriented trees. This algorithm
was improved by Barenboim et al. (FOCS 2012), resulting in an $O(\sqrt{\log n
\cdot \log\log n})$-round MIS algorithm.
  The analyses of these tree MIS algorithms depends on &quot;near independence&quot; of
probabilistic events, a feature of the tree structure of the network. In their
paper, Lenzen and Wattenhofer hope that their algorithm and analysis could be
extended to graphs with bounded arboricity. We show how to do this. By using a
new tail inequality for read-k families of random variables due to Gavinsky et
al. (Random Struct Algorithms, 2015), we show how to deal with dependencies
induced by the recent tree MIS algorithms when they are executed on bounded
arboricity graphs. Specifically, we analyze a version of the tree MIS algorithm
of Barenboim et al. and show that it runs in $O(\mbox{poly}(\alpha) \cdot
\sqrt{\log n \cdot \log\log n})$ rounds in the $\mathcal{CONGEST}$ model for
graphs with arboricity $\alpha$.
  While the main thrust of this paper is the new probabilistic analysis via
read-$k$ inequalities, for small values of $\alpha$, this algorithm is faster
than the bounded arboricity MIS algorithm of Barenboim et al. We also note that
recently (SODA 2016), Gaffari presented a novel MIS algorithm for general
graphs that runs in $O(\log \Delta) + 2^{O(\sqrt{\log\log n})}$ rounds; a
corollary of this algorithm is an $O(\log \alpha + \sqrt{\log n})$-round MIS
algorithm on arboricity-$\alpha$ graphs.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new method for creating computationally efficient and compact
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a novel sparse connection structure
that resembles a tree root. This allows a significant reduction in
computational cost and number of parameters compared to state-of-the-art deep
CNNs, without compromising accuracy, by exploiting the sparsity of inter-layer
filter dependencies. We validate our approach by using it to train more
efficient variants of state-of-the-art CNN architectures, evaluated on the
CIFAR10 and ILSVRC datasets. Our results show similar or higher accuracy than
the baseline architectures with much less computation, as measured by CPU and
GPU timings. For example, for ResNet 50, our model has 40% fewer parameters,
45% fewer floating point operations, and is 31% (12%) faster on a CPU (GPU).
For the deeper ResNet 200 our model has 25% fewer floating point operations and
44% fewer parameters, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. For
GoogLeNet, our model has 7% fewer parameters and is 21% (16%) faster on a CPU
(GPU).

 <dc:description>  Evolutionary games on networks traditionally involve the same game at each
interaction. Here we depart from this assumption by considering mixed games,
where the game played at each interaction is drawn uniformly at random from a
set of two different games. While in well-mixed populations the random mixture
of the two games is always equivalent to the average single game, in structured
populations this is not always the case. We show that the outcome is in fact
strongly dependent on the distance of separation of the two games in the
parameter space. Effectively, this distance introduces payoff heterogeneity,
and the average game is returned only if the heterogeneity is small. For higher
levels of heterogeneity the distance to the average game grows, which often
involves the promotion of cooperation. The presented results support preceding
research that highlights the favorable role of heterogeneity regardless of its
origin, and they also emphasize the importance of the population structure in
amplifying facilitators of cooperation.

 <dc:title>Linear-memory and Decomposition-invariant Linearly Convergent
  Conditional Gradient Algorithm for Structured Polytopes</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Garber, Dan</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Meshi, Ofer</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Optimization and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, several works have shown that natural modifications of the
classical conditional gradient method (aka Frank-Wolfe algorithm) for
constrained convex optimization, provably converge with a linear rate when: i)
the feasible set is a polytope, and ii) the objective is smooth and
strongly-convex. However, all of these results suffer from two significant
shortcomings: large memory requirement due to the need to store an explicit
convex decomposition of the current iterate, and as a consequence, large
running-time overhead per iteration, and worst case convergence rate that
depends unfavorably on the dimension.
  In this work we present a new conditional gradient variant and a
corresponding analysis that improves on both of the above shortcomings. In
particular: both memory and computation overheads are only linear in the
dimension. Moreover, in case the optimal solution is sparse, the new
convergence rate replaces a factor which is at least linear in the dimension in
previous works, with a linear dependence on the number of non-zeros in the
optimal solution.
  At the heart of our method, and corresponding analysis, is a novel way to
compute decomposition-invariant away-steps. While our theoretical guarantees do
not apply to any polytope, they apply to several important structured polytopes
that capture central concepts such as paths in graphs, perfect matchings in
bipartite graphs, marginal distributions that arise in structured prediction
tasks, and more. Our theoretical findings are complemented by empirical
evidence which shows that our method delivers state-of-the-art performance.

 <dc:description>  Large knowledge bases (KBs) are useful in many tasks, but it is unclear how
to integrate this sort of knowledge into &quot;deep&quot; gradient-based learning
systems. To address this problem, we describe a probabilistic deductive
database, called TensorLog, in which reasoning uses a differentiable process.
In TensorLog, each clause in a logical theory is first converted into certain
type of factor graph. Then, for each type of query to the factor graph, the
message-passing steps required to perform belief propagation (BP) are
&quot;unrolled&quot; into a function, which is differentiable. We show that these
functions can be composed recursively to perform inference in non-trivial
logical theories containing multiple interrelated clauses and predicates. Both
compilation and inference in TensorLog are efficient: compilation is linear in
theory size and proof depth, and inference is linear in database size and the
number of message-passing steps used in BP. We also present experimental
results with TensorLog and discuss its relationship to other first-order
probabilistic logics.

 <dc:description>  Proximity-based social applications let users interact with people that are
currently close to them, by revealing some information about their preferences
and whereabouts. This information is acquired through passive geo-localisation
and used to build a sense of serendipitous discovery of people, places and
interests. Unfortunately, while this class of applications opens different
interactions possibilities for people in urban settings, obtaining access to
certain identity information could lead a possible privacy attacker to identify
and follow a user in their movements in a specific period of time. The same
information shared through the platform could also help an attacker to link the
victim's online profiles to physical identities. We analyse a set of popular
dating application that shares users relative distances within a certain radius
and show how, by using the information shared on these platforms, it is
possible to formalise a multilateration attack, able to identify the user
actual position. The same attack can also be used to follow a user in all their
movements within a certain period of time, therefore identifying their habits
and Points of Interest across the city. Furthermore we introduce a social
attack which uses common Facebook likes to profile a person and finally
identify their real identity.

Citizens will be able to access the MobilitApp mobile application and decide
their optimal transportation strategy by visualising their usual routes, their
carbon footprint, receiving tips, analytics and general mobility information,
such as traffic and incident alerts. Transport authorities and service
providers will be able to access information about the mobility pattern of
citizens to o er their best services, improve costs and planning. The
MobilitApp client runs on Android devices and records synchronously, while
running in the background, periodic location updates from its users. The

the time web pages were just hypertext documents; almost no personalisation of
the user experience was o ered. The Web today has evolved as a world wide
distributed system following specific architectural paradigms. On the web now,
an enormous quantity of user generated data is shared and consumed by a network
of applications and services, reasoning upon users expressed preferences and
their social and physical connections. Advertising networks follow users'
browsing habits while they surf the web, continuously collecting their traces
and surfing patterns. We analyse how users tracking happens on the web by
measuring their online footprint and estimating how quickly advertising
networks are able to pro le users by their browsing habits.

 <dc:description>  Recommendation systems and content filtering approaches based on annotations
and ratings, essentially rely on users expressing their preferences and
interests through their actions, in order to provide personalised content. This
activity, in which users engage collectively, has been named social tagging.
Although it has opened a myriad of new possibilities for application
interoperability on the semantic web, it is also posing new privacy threats.
Social tagging consists in describing online or online resources by using
free-text labels (i.e. tags), therefore exposing the user's profile and
activity to privacy attacks. Tag forgery is a privacy enhancing technology
consisting of generating tags for categories or resources that do not reflect
the user's actual preferences. By modifying their profile, tag forgery may have
a negative impact on the quality of the recommendation system, thus protecting
user privacy to a certain extent but at the expenses of utility loss. The
impact of tag forgery on content-based recommendation is, therefore,
investigated in a real-world application scenario where different forgery
strategies are evaluated, and the consequent loss in utility is measured and
compared.

 <dc:description>  This exploratory study used the R Statistical Software to perform Monte Carlo
simulation of time maps, which characterize events based on the elapsed time
since the last event and the time that will transpire until the next event, and
compare them to time maps from real Twitter users. Time maps are used to
explore differences in the interarrival patterns of Tweets between human users,
humans who use scheduling services like TweetDeck and HootSuite, and non-human
(bot) users. The results indicate that there are differences between the tweet
interarrival patterns across these categories of users, and that time maps
could potentially be used to automate the detection of bot accounts on Twitter.
This could enhance social media intelligence capabilities, help bot developers
build more human-like Twitter bots to avoid detection, or both.

 <dc:description>  Physical consequences to power systems of false data injection cyber-attacks
are considered. Prior work has shown that the worst-case consequences of such
an attack can be determined using a bi-level optimization problem, wherein an
attack is chosen to maximize the physical power flow on a target line
subsequent to re-dispatch. This problem can be solved as a mixed-integer linear
program, but it is difficult to scale to large systems due to numerical
challenges. Three new computationally efficient algorithms to solve this
problem are presented. These algorithms provide lower and upper bounds on the
system vulnerability measured as the maximum power flow subsequent to an
attack. Using these techniques, vulnerability assessments are conducted for
IEEE 118-bus system and Polish system with 2383 buses.

 <dc:description>  As the complexity of deep neural networks (DNNs) trend to grow to absorb the
increasing sizes of data, memory and energy consumption has been receiving more
and more attentions for industrial applications, especially on mobile devices.
This paper presents a novel structure based on functional hashing to compress
DNNs, namely FunHashNN. For each entry in a deep net, FunHashNN uses multiple
low-cost hash functions to fetch values in the compression space, and then
employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry. The
reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly.
FunHashNN includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated case, and
benefits from larger value capacity and less reconstruction loss. We further
discuss extensions with dual space hashing and multi-hops. On several benchmark
datasets, FunHashNN demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on
prediction accuracy.

 <dc:title>DynaNewton - Accelerating Newton's Method for Machine Learning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Newton's method is a fundamental technique in optimization with quadratic
convergence within a neighborhood around the optimum. However reaching this
neighborhood is often slow and dominates the computational costs. We exploit
two properties specific to empirical risk minimization problems to accelerate
Newton's method, namely, subsampling training data and increasing strong
convexity through regularization. We propose a novel continuation method, where
we define a family of objectives over increasing sample sizes and with
decreasing regularization strength. Solutions on this path are tracked such
that the minimizer of the previous objective is guaranteed to be within the
quadratic convergence region of the next objective to be optimized. Thereby
every Newton iteration is guaranteed to achieve super-linear contractions with
regard to the chosen objective, which becomes a moving target. We provide a
theoretical analysis that motivates our algorithm, called DynaNewton, and
characterizes its speed of convergence. Experiments on a wide range of data
sets and problems consistently confirm the predicted computational savings.

 <dc:title>Double-Sided Energy Auction Equilibrium Under Price Anticipation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Faqiry, M. Nazif</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Das, Sanjoy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the problem of proportionally fair double sided
energy auction involving buying and selling agents. The grid is assumed to be
operating under islanded mode. A distributed auction algorithm that can be
implemented by an aggregator, as well as a possible approach by which the
agents may approximate price anticipation is considered. Equilibrium conditions
arising due to price anticipation is analyzed. A modified auction to mitigate
the resulting loss in efficiency due to such behavior is suggested. This
modified auction allows the aggregate social welfare of the agents to be
arbitrarily close to that attainable with price taking agents. Next,
equilibrium conditions when the aggregator collects a surcharge price per unit
of energy traded is examined. A biobjective optimization problem is identified
that takes into account both the agents social welfare as well as the
aggregator revenue from the surcharge. Results of extensive simulations, which
corroborate the theoretical analysis, are reported.

 <dc:title>On the Rate of Convergence of the Power-of-Two-Choices to its Mean-Field

 <dc:creator>Ying, Lei</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the rate of convergence of the power-of-two-choices, a
celebrated randomized load balancing algorithm for many-server queueing
systems, to its mean field limit. The convergence to the mean-field limit has
been proved in the literature, but the rate of convergence remained to be an
open problem. This paper establishes that the sequence of stationary
distributions, indexed by $M,$ the number of servers in the system, converges
in mean-square to its mean-field limit with rate $O\left(\frac{(\log M)^3
(\log\log M)^2}{M}\right).$

 <dc:title>Optimal Number of Choices in Rating Contexts</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ganzfried, Sam</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Probability</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many settings people must give numerical scores to entities from a small
discrete set. For instance, rating physical attractiveness from 1-5 on dating
sites, or papers from 1-10 for conference reviewing. We study the problem of
understanding when using a different number of options is optimal. For
concreteness we assume the true underlying scores are integers from 1-100. We
consider the case when scores are uniform random and Gaussian. We study when
using 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 options is optimal in these models. One may expect
that using more options would always improve performance in this model, but we
show that this is not necessarily the case, and that using fewer choices --
even just two -- can surprisingly be optimal in certain situations. While in
theory for this setting it would be optimal to use all 100 options, in practice
this is prohibitive, and it is preferable to utilize a smaller number of
options due to humans' limited computational resources. Our results suggest
that using a smaller number of options than is typical could be optimal in
certain situations. This would have many potential applications, as settings
requiring entities to be ranked by humans are ubiquitous.

 <dc:description>  We study the stochastic online problem of learning to influence in a social
network with semi-bandit feedback, where we observe how users influence each
other. The problem combines challenges of limited feedback, because the
learning agent only observes the influenced portion of the network, and
combinatorial number of actions, because the cardinality of the feasible set is
exponential in the maximum number of influencers. We propose a computationally
efficient UCB-like algorithm, IMLinUCB, and analyze it. Our regret bounds are
polynomial in all quantities of interest; reflect the structure of the network
and the probabilities of influence. Moreover, they do not depend on inherently
large quantities, such as the cardinality of the action set. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first such results. IMLinUCB permits linear
generalization and therefore is suitable for large-scale problems. Our
experiments show that the regret of IMLinUCB scales as suggested by our upper
bounds in several representative graph topologies; and based on linear
generalization, IMLinUCB can significantly reduce regret of real-world
influence maximization semi-bandits.

 <dc:description>  Cloud imaging using ground-based whole sky imagers is essential for a
fine-grained understanding of the effects of cloud formations, which can be
useful in many applications. Some such imagers are available commercially, but
their cost is relatively high, and their flexibility is limited. Therefore, we
built a new daytime Whole Sky Imager (WSI) called Wide Angle High-Resolution
Sky Imaging System. The strengths of our new design are its simplicity, low
manufacturing cost and high resolution. Our imager captures the entire
hemisphere in a single high-resolution picture via a digital camera using a
fish-eye lens. The camera was modified to capture light across the visible as
well as the near-infrared spectral ranges. This paper describes the design of
the device as well as the geometric and radiometric calibration of the imaging
system.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Algorithm and Platform Selection for Visual Detection and

 <dc:description>  Computer vision algorithms are known to be extremely sensitive to the
environmental conditions in which the data is captured, e.g., lighting
conditions and target density. Tuning of parameters or choosing a completely
new algorithm is often needed to achieve a certain performance level,
especially when there is a limitation of the computation source. In this paper,
we focus on this problem and propose a framework to adaptively select the
&quot;best&quot; algorithm-parameter combination and the computation platform under
performance and cost constraints at design time, and adapt the algorithms at
runtime based on real-time inputs. This necessitates developing a mechanism to
switch between different algorithms as the nature of the input video changes.
Our proposed algorithm calculates a similarity function between a test video
scenario and each training scenario, where the similarity calculation is based
on learning a manifold of image features that is shared by both the training
and test datasets. Similarity between training and test dataset indicates the
same algorithm can be applied to both of them and achieve similar performance.
We design a cost function with this similarity measure to find the most similar
training scenario to the test data. The &quot;best&quot; algorithm under a given platform
is obtained by selecting the algorithm with a specific parameter combination
that performs the best on the corresponding training data. The proposed
framework can be used first offline to choose the platform based on performance
and cost constraints, and then online whereby the &quot;best&quot; algorithm is selected
for each new incoming video segment for a given platform. In the experiments,
we apply our algorithm to the problems of pedestrian detection and tracking. We
show how to adaptively select platforms and algorithm-parameter combinations.
Our results provide optimal performance on 3 publicly available datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel measure of degree heterogeneity, for unweighted and
undirected complex networks, which requires only the degree distribution of the
network for its computation. We show that the proposed measure can be applied
to all types of network topology with ease and increases with the diversity of
node degrees in the network. The measure is applied to compute the
heterogeneity of synthetic (both random and scale free) and real world networks
with its value normalized in the interval [0, 1]. To define the measure, we
introduce a limiting network whose heterogeneity can be expressed analytically
with the value tending to 1 as the size of the network N tends to infinity. We
numerically study the variation of heterogeneity for random graphs (as a
function of p and N) and for scale free networks with and N as variables.
Finally, as a specific application, we show that the proposed measure can be
used to compare the heterogeneity of recurrence networks constructed from the
time series of several low dimensional chaotic attractors9thereby providing a
single index to compare the structural complexity of chaotic attractors.

proposed. At last, we present the security proof in the random oracle based on

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present that security threats coming with existing GPU
memory management strategy are overlooked, which opens a back door for
adversaries to freely break the memory isolation: they enable adversaries
without any privilege in a computer to recover the raw memory data left by
previous processes directly. More importantly, such attacks can work on not
only normal multi-user operating systems, but also cloud computing platforms.
  To demonstrate the seriousness of such attacks, we recovered original data
directly from GPU memory residues left by exited commodity applications,
including Google Chrome, Adobe Reader, GIMP, Matlab. The results show that,
because of the vulnerable memory management strategy, commodity applications in
our experiments are all affected.

 <dc:description>  For many kinds of prefix-free codes there are efficient and compact
alternatives to the traditional tree-based representation. Since these put the
codes into canonical form, however, they can only be used when we can choose
the order in which codewords are assigned to characters. In this paper we first
show how, given a probability distribution over an alphabet of $\sigma$
characters, we can store a nearly optimal alphabetic prefix-free code in $o
(\sigma)$ bits such that we can encode and decode any character in constant
time. We then consider a kind of code introduced recently to reduce the space
usage of wavelet matrices (Claude, Navarro, and Ord\'o\~nez, Information
Systems, 2015). They showed how to build an optimal prefix-free code such that
the codewords' lengths are non-decreasing when they are arranged such that
their reverses are in lexicographic order. We show how to store such a code in
$O (\sigma \log L + 2^{\epsilon L})$ bits, where $L$ is the maximum codeword
length and $\epsilon$ is any positive constant, such that we can encode and
decode any character in constant time under reasonable assumptions. Otherwise,
we can always encode and decode a codeword of $\ell$ bits in time $O (\ell)$
using $O (\sigma\log L)$ bits of space.

 <dc:description>  Asynchronous parallel optimization algorithms for solving large-scale machine
learning problems have drawn significant attention from academia to industry
recently. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, decoupled asynchronous
proximal stochastic gradient descent (DAP-SGD), to minimize an objective
function that is the composite of the average of multiple empirical losses and
a regularization term. Unlike the traditional asynchronous proximal stochastic
gradient descent (TAP-SGD) in which the master carries much of the computation
load, the proposed algorithm off-loads the majority of computation tasks from
the master to workers, and leaves the master to conduct simple addition
operations. This strategy yields an easy-to-parallelize algorithm, whose
performance is justified by theoretical convergence analyses. To be specific,
DAP-SGD achieves an $O(\log T/T)$ rate when the step-size is diminishing and an
ergodic $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate when the step-size is constant, where $T$ is the

 <dc:description>  Deep networks have been successfully applied to learn transferable features
for adapting models from a source domain to a different target domain. In this
paper, we present joint adaptation networks (JAN), which learn a transfer
network by aligning the joint distributions of multiple domain-specific layers
across domains based on a joint maximum mean discrepancy (JMMD) criterion.
Adversarial training strategy is adopted to maximize JMMD such that the
distributions of the source and target domains are made more distinguishable.
Learning can be performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradients
computed by back-propagation in linear-time. Experiments testify that our model
yields state of the art results on standard datasets.

 <dc:description>  Given that in practice training data is scarce for all but a small set of
problems, a core question is how to incorporate prior knowledge into a model.
In this paper, we consider the case of prior procedural knowledge for neural
networks, such as knowing how a program should traverse a sequence, but not
what local actions should be performed at each step. To this end, we present an
end-to-end differentiable interpreter for the programming language Forth which
enables programmers to write program sketches with slots that can be filled
with behaviour trained from program input-output data. We can optimise this
behaviour directly through gradient descent techniques on user-specified
objectives, and also integrate the program into any larger neural computation
graph. We show empirically that our interpreter is able to effectively leverage
different levels of prior program structure and learn complex behaviours such
as sequence sorting and addition. When connected to outputs of an LSTM and
trained jointly, our interpreter achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for
end-to-end reasoning about quantities expressed in natural language stories.

 <dc:title>Deep convolutional networks on the pitch spiral for musical instrument
  recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Lostanlen, Vincent</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Sound</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Musical performance combines a wide range of pitches, nuances, and expressive
techniques. Audio-based classification of musical instruments thus requires to
build signal representations that are invariant to such transformations. This
article investigates the construction of learned convolutional architectures
for instrument recognition, given a limited amount of annotated training data.
In this context, we benchmark three different weight sharing strategies for
deep convolutional networks in the time-frequency domain: temporal kernels;
time-frequency kernels; and a linear combination of time-frequency kernels
which are one octave apart, akin to a Shepard pitch spiral. We provide an
acoustical interpretation of these strategies within the source-filter
framework of quasi-harmonic sounds with a fixed spectral envelope, which are
archetypal of musical notes. The best classification accuracy is obtained by
hybridizing all three convolutional layers into a single deep learning
architecture.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we define a general class of abstract aerial robotic systems
named Laterally Bounded Force (LBF) vehicles, in which most of the control
authority is expressed along a principal thrust direction, while in the lateral
directions a (smaller and possibly null) force may be exploited to achieve
full-pose tracking. This class approximates well platforms endowed with
non-coplanar/non-collinear rotors that can use the tilted propellers to
slightly change the orientation of the total thrust w.r.t. the body frame. For
this broad class of systems, we introduce a new geometric control strategy in
SE(3) to achieve, whenever made possible by the force constraints, the
independent tracking of position-plus-orientation trajectories. The exponential
tracking of a feasible full-pose reference trajectory is proven using a
Lyapunov technique in SE(3). The method can deal seamlessly with both under-
and fully-actuated LBF platforms. The controller guarantees the tracking of at
least the positional part in the case that an unfeasible full-pose reference
trajectory is provided. The paper provides several experimental tests clearly
showing the practicability of the approach and the sharp improvement with
respect to state of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel method for hierarchical topic detection where topics are
obtained by clustering documents in multiple ways. Specifically, we model
document collections using a class of graphical models called hierarchical
latent tree models (HLTMs). The variables at the bottom level of an HLTM are
observed binary variables that represent the presence/absence of words in a
document. The variables at other levels are binary latent variables, with those
at the lowest latent level representing word co-occurrence patterns and those
at higher levels representing co-occurrence of patterns at the level below.
Each latent variable gives a soft partition of the documents, and document
clusters in the partitions are interpreted as topics. Latent variables at high
levels of the hierarchy capture long-range word co-occurrence patterns and
hence give thematically more general topics, while those at low levels of the
hierarchy capture short-range word co-occurrence patterns and give thematically
more specific topics. Unlike LDA-based topic models, HLTMs do not refer to a
document generation process and use word variables instead of token variables.
They use a tree structure to model the relationships between topics and words,
which is conducive to the discovery of meaningful topics and topic hierarchies.

 <dc:title>Gambler's Ruin Bandit Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new multi-armed bandit problem called the
Gambler's Ruin Bandit Problem (GRBP). In the GRBP, the learner proceeds in a
sequence of rounds, where each round is a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with
two actions (arms): a continuation action that moves the learner randomly over
the state space around the current state; and a terminal action that moves the
learner directly into one of the two terminal states (goal and dead-end state).
The current round ends when a terminal state is reached, and the learner incurs
a positive reward only when the goal state is reached. The objective of the
learner is to maximize its long-term reward (expected number of times the goal
state is reached), without having any prior knowledge on the state transition
probabilities. We first prove a result on the form of the optimal policy for
the GRBP. Then, we define the regret of the learner with respect to an
omnipotent oracle, which acts optimally in each round, and prove that it
increases logarithmically over rounds. We also identify a condition under which
the learner's regret is bounded. A potential application of the GRBP is optimal
medical treatment assignment, in which the continuation action corresponds to a
conservative treatment and the terminal action corresponds to a risky treatment
such as surgery.

 <dc:title>Bending the Curve: Improving the ROC Curve Through Error Redistribution</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Richman, Oran</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Classification performance is often not uniform over the data. Some areas in
the input space are easier to classify than others. Features that hold
information about the &quot;difficulty&quot; of the data may be non-discriminative and
are therefore disregarded in the classification process. We propose a
meta-learning approach where performance may be improved by post-processing.
This improvement is done by establishing a dynamic threshold on the
base-classifier results. Since the base-classifier is treated as a &quot;black box&quot;
the method presented can be used on any state of the art classifier in order to
try an improve its performance. We focus our attention on how to better control
the true-positive/false-positive trade-off known as the ROC curve. We propose
an algorithm for the derivation of optimal thresholds by redistributing the
error depending on features that hold information about difficulty. We
demonstrate the resulting benefit on both synthetic and real-life data.

 <dc:description>  Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is proposed recently to reduce network
cost, enable cooperative communications, and increase system flexibility
through centralized baseband processing. By pooling multiple virtual base
stations (VBSs) and consolidating their stochastic computational tasks, the
overall computational resource can be reduced, achieving the so-called
statistical multiplexing gain. In this paper, we evaluate the statistical
multiplexing gain of VBS pools using a multi-dimensional Markov model, which
captures the session-level dynamics and the constraints imposed by both radio
and computational resources. Based on this model, we derive a recursive formula
for the blocking probability and also a closed-form approximation for it in
large pools. These formulas are then used to derive the session-level
statistical multiplexing gain of both real-time and delay-tolerant traffic.
Numerical results show that VBS pools can achieve more than 75% of the maximum
pooling gain with 50 VBSs, but further convergence to the upper bound
(large-pool limit) is slow because of the quickly diminishing marginal pooling
gain, which is inversely proportional to a factor between the one-half and
three-fourth power of the pool size. We also find that the pooling gain is more
evident under light traffic load and stringent Quality of Service (QoS)
requirement.

 <dc:description>  Using the array form of numerically stable square-root implementation methods

 <dc:description>  One of the methodologies based on group dynamics is Role Playing (RP). This
method consists on the simulation of a real situation, allowing its study and
understanding. Knowledge and technical skills are not the only prerequisites
for proper practice in health sciences. RP has been used as Communication
Skills Training (CST) amongst health professionals. In the teaching of
odontology and stomatology, object of our research, dental assistance brings up
situations where the professional must develop transversal skills, which
improve the interaction with the patient and the dental treatment itself. The
aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed RP methodology
through the students' opinion. The study sample is made out of dental students
(n=80), all of them on the 4th year at the College of Dentistry (University of
Seville, Spain). The students who took part in the activity considered the
incorporation of RP in the syllabus as relevant, though further study should be
considered in order to analyze the efficacy of this teaching methodology in
depth.

 <dc:description>  The importance of knowing ICT training and motivation -so relevant in today's
society- which currently offers the first year college students, mostly in
degrees in Education, focuses the object of interest in this study. The
following targets have been proposed: [1] knowing what basic skills regarding
initial instrumental knowledge presents the prospective teacher (aptitudes) and
[2] knowing their motivation for the educational use of ICT in the classroom
(attitudes). For this purpose a non-experimental descriptive quantitative
methodology has been used, with a sample of subjects (N=282) of the Autonomous
Region of Extremadura (Spain). The results show that new degree college
students possess a basic knowledge of ICT alongside a highly positive
motivation towards the use of these. However, it is worrying that they only
show an instrumental and technical knowledge of computing and telematic tools
implied in social environments, but not pedagogical ones. Also they are
unfamiliar with the true power of social, economic, political, ethical,
influence as well as the effects and problems that their misuse can generate in
their future students (addictions, manipulation, consumerism, etc.). Dimensions
therefore for which they are urged to be trained at University for a proper
performance as future professionals in education.

 <dc:description>  Service virtualisation is a supporting tool for DevOps to generate
interactive service models of dependency systems on which a system-under-test
relies. These service models allow applications under development to be
continuously tested against production-like conditions. Generating these
virtual service models requires expert knowledge of the service protocol, which
may not always be available. However, service models may be generated
automatically from network traces. Previous work has used the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm to select a response from the service model to play back for a live
request. We propose an extension of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which uses
entropy analysis to automatically detect the critical matching fields for
selecting a response. Empirical tests against four enterprise protocols
demonstrate that entropy weighted matching can improve response accuracy.

 <dc:description>  In recent years the need to simplify or to hide sensitive information in
provenance has given way to research on provenance abstraction. In the context
of scientific workflows, existing research provides techniques to semi
automatically create abstractions of a given workflow description, which is in
turn used as filters over the workflow's provenance traces. An alternative
approach that is commonly adopted by scientists is to build workflows with
abstractions embedded into the workflow's design, such as using sub-workflows.
This paper reports on the comparison of manual versus semi-automated approaches
in a context where result abstractions are used to filter report-worthy results
of computational scientific analyses. Specifically; we take a real-world
workflow containing user-created design abstractions and compare these with
abstractions created by ZOOM UserViews and Workflow Summaries systems. Our
comparison shows that semi-automatic and manual approaches largely overlap from
a process perspective, meanwhile, there is a dramatic mismatch in terms of data
artefacts retained in an abstracted account of derivation. We discuss reasons
and suggest future research directions.

 <dc:description>  Large enterprise software systems make many complex interactions with other
services in their environment. Developing and testing for production-like
conditions is therefore a very challenging task. Current approaches include
emulation of dependent services using either explicit modelling or
record-and-replay approaches. Models require deep knowledge of the target
services while record-and-replay is limited in accuracy. Both face
developmental and scaling issues. We present a new technique that improves the
accuracy of record-and-replay approaches, without requiring prior knowledge of
the service protocols. The approach uses Multiple Sequence Alignment to derive
message prototypes from recorded system interactions and a scheme to match
incoming request messages against prototypes to generate response messages. We
use a modified Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for distance calculation during
message matching. Our approach has shown greater than 99% accuracy for four
evaluated enterprise system messaging protocols. The approach has been
successfully integrated into the CA Service Virtualization commercial product
to complement its existing techniques.

 <dc:description>  Transfer learning is a problem defined over two domains. These two domains
share the same feature space and class label space, but have significantly
different distributions. One domain has sufficient labels, named as source
domain, and the other domain has few labels, named as target do- main. The
problem is to learn a effective classifier for the target domain. In this
paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for this problem by learning
a partially shared classifier for the target domain, and weighting the source
domain data points. We learn some shared subspaces for both the data points of
the two domains, and a shared classifier in the shared subspaces. We hope that
in the shared subspaces, the distributions of two domain can match each other
well, and to match the distributions, we weight the source domain data points
with different weighting factors. Moreover, we adapt the shared classifier to
each domain by learning different adaptation functions. To learn the subspace
transformation matrices, the classifier parameters, and the adaptation
parameters, we build a objective function with weighted clas- sification
errors, parameter regularization, local reconstruction regularization, and
distribution matching. This objective function is minimized by an itera- tive
algorithm. Experiments show its effectiveness over benchmark data sets,
including travel destination review data set, face expression data set, spam
email data set, etc.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of multiple agents sensing and acting in environments
with the goal of maximising their shared utility. In these environments, agents
must learn communication protocols in order to share information that is needed
to solve the tasks. By embracing deep neural networks, we are able to
demonstrate end-to-end learning of protocols in complex environments inspired
by communication riddles and multi-agent computer vision problems with partial
observability. We propose two approaches for learning in these domains:
Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning
(DIAL). The former uses deep Q-learning, while the latter exploits the fact
that, during learning, agents can backpropagate error derivatives through
(noisy) communication channels. Hence, this approach uses centralised learning
but decentralised execution. Our experiments introduce new environments for
studying the learning of communication protocols and present a set of
engineering innovations that are essential for success in these domains.

 <dc:title>Detection of Spatially-Modulated Signals in Doubly Selective Fading

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  To detect spatially-modulated signals, a receiver needs the channel state
information (CSI) of each transmit- receive antenna pair. Although the CSI is
never perfect and varies in time, most studies on spatial modulation (SM)
systems assume perfectly known CSI and time-invariant channel. The spatial
correlations among multiple spatial subchannels, which have to be considered
when CSI is imperfect, are also often neglected. In this paper, we release the
above assumptions and take the CSI uncertainty along with the spatial-temporal
selectivities into account. We derive the channel estimation error aware
maximum likelihood (CEEA-ML) detectors as well as several low- complexity
alternatives for PSK and QAM signals. As the CSI uncertainty depends on the
channel estimator used, we consider both decision feedback and model based
estimators in our study. The error rate performance of the ML and some
suboptimal detectors is analyzed. Numerical results obtained by simulations and
analysis show that the CEEA-ML detectors offer clear performance gain against
conventional mismatched SM detectors and, in many cases, the proposed
suboptimal detectors incur only minor performance loss.

 <dc:description>  Redundant transfer of resources is a critical issue for compromising the
performance of mobile Web applications (a.k.a., apps) in terms of data traffic,
load time, and even energy consumption. Evidence shows that the current cache
mechanisms are far from satisfactory. With lessons learned from how native apps
manage their resources, in this paper, we propose the ReWAP approach to
fundamentally reducing redundant transfers by restructuring the resource
loading of mobile Web apps. ReWAP is based on an efficient mechanism of
resource packaging where stable resources are encapsulated and maintained into
a package, and such a package shall be loaded always from the local storage and
updated by explicitly refreshing. By retrieving and analyzing the update of
resources, ReWAP maintains resource packages that can accurately identify which
resources can be loaded from the local storage for a considerably long period.
ReWAP also provides a wrapper for mobile Web apps to enable loading and
updating resource packages in the local storage as well as loading resources
from resource packages. ReWAP can be easily and seamlessly deployed into
existing mobile Web architectures with minimal modifications, and is
transparent to end-users. We evaluate ReWAP based on continuous 15-day access
traces of 50 mobile Web apps that suffer heavily from the problem of redundant
transfers. Compared to the original mobile Web apps with cache enabled, ReWAP
can significantly reduce the data traffic, with the median saving up to 51%. In
addition, ReWAP can incur only very minor runtime overhead of the client-side
browsers.

 <dc:description>  With the development of modern industrial technology a large number of
non-linear loads are used in power system, which causes harmonic distortion in
the power system. At the same time the power quality and safe operation becomes
inferior. Therefore mitigation of harmonics is very necessary under the
situation. This paper presents the design of two passive filters to reduce the
current harmonics produced by nonlinear loads in industrial power system.
Matlab /simulink software has been used for the simulation purpose. The results
have been obtained with and without installation of filters and then it is
observed that after installation of filters harmonics of the current are
reduced and power factor is improved.

 <dc:description>  Dualization is a key discrete enumeration problem. It is not known whether or
not this problem is polynomial-time solvable. Asymptotically optimal
dualization algorithms are the fastest among the known dualization algorithms,
which is supported by new experiments with various data described in this
paper. A theoretical justification of the efficiency of these algorithms on the
average was given by E.V. Djukova more than 30 years ago. In this paper, new
results on the construction of parallel algorithms for intractable enumeration
problems are presented. A new static parallelization scheme for asymptotically
optimal dualization algorithms is developed and tested. The scheme is based on
statistical estimations of subtasks size.

 <dc:description>  We present a novel method for efficiently searching top-k neighbors for
documents represented in high dimensional space of terms based on the cosine
similarity. Mostly, documents are stored as bag-of-words tf-idf representation.
One of the most used ways of computing similarity between a pair of documents
is cosine similarity between the vector representations, but cosine similarity
is not a metric distance measure as it doesn't follow triangle inequality,
therefore most metric searching methods can not be applied directly. We propose
an efficient method for indexing documents using a pivot tree that leads to
efficient retrieval. We also study the relation between precision and
efficiency for the proposed method and compare it with a state of the art in
the area of document searching based on inner product.

 <dc:description>  We address the difficult problem of distinguishing fine-grained object
categories in low resolution images. Wepropose a simple an effective deep
learning approach that transfers fine-grained knowledge gained from high
resolution training data to the coarse low-resolution test scenario. Such
fine-to-coarse knowledge transfer has many real world applications, such as
identifying objects in surveillance photos or satellite images where the image
resolution at the test time is very low but plenty of high resolution photos of
similar objects are available. Our extensive experiments on two standard
benchmark datasets containing fine-grained car models and bird species
demonstrate that our approach can effectively transfer fine-detail knowledge to
coarse-detail imagery.

 <dc:description>  A language $L$ over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is prefix-convex if, for any words
$x,y,z\in\Sigma^*$, whenever $x$ and $xyz$ are in $L$, then so is $xy$.
Prefix-convex languages include right-ideal, prefix-closed, and prefix-free
languages. We study complexity properties of prefix-convex regular languages.
In particular, we find the quotient/state complexity of boolean operations,
product (concatenation), star, and reversal, the size of the syntactic
semigroup, and the quotient complexity of atoms. For binary operations we use
arguments with different alphabets when appropriate; this leads to higher tight
upper bounds than those obtained with equal alphabets. We exhibit most complex
prefix-convex languages that meet the complexity bounds for all the measures
listed above.

 <dc:description>  In 2003, Cohn and Umans described a framework for proving upper bounds on the
exponent $\omega$ of matrix multiplication by reducing matrix multiplication to
group algebra multiplication, and in 2005 Cohn, Kleinberg, Szegedy, and Umans
proposed specific conjectures for how to obtain $\omega=2$. In this paper we
rule out obtaining $\omega=2$ in this framework from abelian groups of bounded
exponent. To do this we bound the size of tricolored sum-free sets in such
groups, extending the breakthrough results of Croot, Lev, Pach, Ellenberg, and
Gijswijt on cap sets. As a byproduct of our proof, we show that a variant of
tensor rank due to Tao gives a quantitative understanding of the notion of
unstable tensor from geometric invariant theory.

 <dc:description>  We survey an abstract theory of connectivity, based on symmetric submodular
set functions. We start by developing Robertson and Seymour's fundamental
duality between branch decompositions (related to the better-known tree
decompositions) and so-called tangles, which may be viewed as highly connected
regions in a connectivity system. We move on to studying canonical
decompositions of connectivity systems into their maximal tangles. Last, but
not least, we will discuss algorithmic aspect of the theory.

 <dc:title>Automatic Detection of Epileptiform Discharges in the EEG</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The diagnosis of epilepsy generally includes a visual inspection of EEG
recorded data by the Neurologist, with the purpose of checking the occurrence
of transient waveforms called interictal epileptiform discharges. These
waveforms have short duration (less than 100 ms), so the inspection process is
usually time-consuming, particularly for ambulatory long term EEG records.
Therefore, an automatic detection system of epileptiform discharges can be a
valuable tool for a Neurology service. The proposed approach is the development
of a multi stage detection algorithm, which processes the complete EEG signals
and applies decision criteria to selected waveforms. It employs EEG analysis
techniques such as Wavelet Transform and Mimetic Analysis, complemented with a
classification based on Fuzzy Logic. In order to evaluate the algorithm's
performance, data were collected from several epileptic patients, with
epileptiform activity marked by a Neurologist. The average values obtained for
both Sensitivity and Specificity were respectively higher than 80 and 70
percent.

 <dc:description>  Dimensionality reduction techniques play an essential role in data analytics,
signal processing and machine learning. Dimensionality reduction is usually
performed in a preprocessing stage that is separate from subsequent data
analysis, such as clustering or classification. Finding reduced-dimension
representations that are well-suited for the intended task is more appealing.
This paper proposes a joint factor analysis and latent clustering framework,
which aims at learning cluster-aware low-dimensional representations of matrix
and tensor data. The proposed approach leverages matrix and tensor
factorization models that produce essentially unique latent representations of
the data to unravel latent cluster structure -- which is otherwise obscured
because of the freedom to apply an oblique transformation in latent space. At
the same time, latent cluster structure is used as prior information to enhance
the performance of factorization. Specific contributions include several
custom-built problem formulations, corresponding algorithms, and discussion of
associated convergence properties. Besides extensive simulations, real-world
datasets such as Reuters document data and MNIST image data are also employed
to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

 <dc:description>  Most of the problems in genetic algorithms are very complex and demand a
large amount of resources that current technology can not offer. Our purpose
was to develop a Java-JINI distributed library that implements Genetic
Algorithms with sub-populations (coarse grain) and a graphical interface in
order to configure and follow the evolution of the search. The sub-populations
are simulated/evaluated in personal computers connected trough a network,
keeping in mind different models of sub-populations, migration policies and
network topologies. We show that this model delays the convergence of the
population keeping a higher level of genetic diversity and allows a much
greater number of evaluations since they are distributed among several
computers compared with the traditional Genetic Algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Deep conditional generative models are developed to simultaneously learn the
temporal dependencies of multiple sequences. The model is designed by
introducing a three-way weight tensor to capture the multiplicative
interactions between side information and sequences. The proposed model builds
on the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN), a sequential stack of Sigmoid
Belief Networks (SBNs). The transition matrices are further factored to reduce
the number of parameters and improve generalization. When side information is
not available, a general framework for semi-supervised learning based on the
proposed model is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification.
Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
predictive and classification performance on sequential data, and has the
capacity to synthesize sequences, with controlled style transitioning and
blending.

 <dc:description>  Effect algebras are one of the generalizations of Boolean algebras proposed
in the quest for a quantum logic. Frobenius algebras are a tool of categorical
quantum mechanics, used to present various families of observables in abstract,
often nonstandard frameworks. Both effect algebras and Frobenius algebras
capture their respective fragments of quantum mechanics by elegant and succinct
axioms; and both come with their conceptual mysteries. A particularly elegant
and mysterious constraint, imposed on Frobenius algebras to characterize a
class of tripartite entangled states, is the antispecial law. A particularly
contentious issue on the quantum logic side is the modularity law, proposed by
von Neumann to mitigate the failure of distributivity of quantum logical
connectives. We show that, if quantum logic and categorical quantum mechanics
are formalized in the same framework, then the antispecial law of categorical
quantum mechanics corresponds to the natural requirement of effect algebras
that the units are each other's unique complements; and that the modularity law
corresponds to the Frobenius condition. These correspondences lead to the
equivalence announced in the title. Aligning the two formalisms, at the very
least, sheds new light on the concepts that are more clearly displayed on one
side than on the other (such as e.g. the orthogonality). Beyond that, it may
also open up new approaches to deep and important problems of quantum mechanics
(such as the classification of complementary observables).

 <dc:description>  People are able to detect up to 1 trillion odors. Yet, city planning is
concerned only with a few bad odors, mainly because odors are currently
captured only through complaints made by urban dwellers. To capture both good
and bad odors, we resort to a methodology that has been recently proposed and
relies on tagging information of geo-referenced pictures. In doing so for the
cities of London and Barcelona, this work makes three new contributions. We
study 1) how the urban smellscape changes in time and space; 2) which emotions
people share at places with specific smells; and 3) what is the color of a
smell, if it exists. Without social media data, insights about those three
aspects have been difficult to produce in the past, further delaying the
creation of urban restorative experiences.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the two-stage capacitated facility location problem
(TSCFLP) in which products manufactured in plants are delivered to customers
via storage depots. Customer demands are satisfied subject to limited plant
production and limited depot storage capacity. The objective is to determine
the locations of plants and depots in order to minimize the total cost
including the fixed cost and transportation cost. A hybrid evolutionary
algorithm (HEA) with genetic operations and local search is proposed. To avoid
the expensive calculation of fitness of population in terms of computational
time, the HEA uses extreme machine learning to approximate the fitness of most
of the individuals. Moreover, two heuristics based on the characteristic of the
problem is incorporated to generate a good initial population.
  Computational experiments are performed on two sets of test instances from
the recent literature. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated
and analyzed. Compared with the state-of-the-art genetic algorithm, the
proposed algorithm can find the optimal or near-optimal solutions in a
reasonable computational time.

 <dc:description>  Constructing testbeds for systems which are interconnected with large
networks of other software services is a challenging task. It is particularly
difficult to create testbeds facilitating evaluation of the non-functional
qualities of a system, such as scalability, that can be expected in production
deployments. Software service emulation is an approach for creating such
testbeds where service behaviour is defined by emulate-able models executed in
an emulation runtime environment. We present (i) a meta-modelling framework
supporting emulate-able service modelling (including messages, protocol,
behaviour and states), and (ii) Kaluta, an emulation environment able to
concurrently execute large numbers (thousands) of service models, providing a
testbed which mimics the behaviour and characteristics of large networks of
interconnected software services. Experiments show that Kaluta can emulate
10,000 servers using a single physical machine, and is a practical testbed for
scalability testing of a real, enterprise-grade identity management suite. The
insights gained into the tested enterprise system were used to enhance its
design.

 <dc:description>  Tensor decomposition plays a key role in identifying common features across a
collection of matrices in many areas of science. A fundamental need in big data
research is to process data tabulated as large-scale matrices using
eigenvectors. A higher order generalized singular value decomposition technique
successfully captures the common features of the same organ from multiple
animals in genomic signal processing. A recent semidefinite programming
approach to solve an AC optimal power flow was accompanied by the problem
formulation in the Cartesian coordinate system. The collection of nodal
Kirchhoff laws introduces a 3D tensor with a common feature of individual
matrices to maintain local power balance. In this paper, the mathematical
process is established and the common feature is identified. The common feature
is a key element to a fully decentralized and therefore scalable algorithm to
solve AC optimal power flow.

 <dc:description>  A rapid pattern-recognition approach to characterize driver's
curve-negotiating behavior is proposed. To shorten the recognition time and
improve the recognition of driving styles, a k-means clustering-based support
vector machine ( kMC-SVM) method is developed and used for classifying drivers
into two types: aggressive and moderate. First, vehicle speed and throttle
opening are treated as the feature parameters to reflect the driving styles.
Second, to discriminate driver curve-negotiating behaviors and reduce the
number of support vectors, the k-means clustering method is used to extract and
gather the two types of driving data and shorten the recognition time. Then,
based on the clustering results, a support vector machine approach is utilized
to generate the hyperplane for judging and predicting to which types the human
driver are subject. Lastly, to verify the validity of the kMC-SVM method, a
cross-validation experiment is designed and conducted. The research results
show that the $ k $MC-SVM is an effective method to classify driving styles
with a short time, compared with SVM method.

 <dc:title>Inductive Bias of Deep Convolutional Networks through Pooling Geometry</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Our formal understanding of the inductive bias that drives the success of
convolutional networks on computer vision tasks is limited. In particular, it
is unclear what makes hypotheses spaces born from convolution and pooling
operations so suitable for natural images. In this paper we study the ability
of convolutional networks to model correlations among regions of their input.
We theoretically analyze convolutional arithmetic circuits, and empirically
validate our findings on other types of convolutional networks as well.
Correlations are formalized through the notion of separation rank, which for a
given partition of the input, measures how far a function is from being
separable. We show that a polynomially sized deep network supports
exponentially high separation ranks for certain input partitions, while being
limited to polynomial separation ranks for others. The network's pooling
geometry effectively determines which input partitions are favored, thus serves
as a means for controlling the inductive bias. Contiguous pooling windows as
commonly employed in practice favor interleaved partitions over coarse ones,
orienting the inductive bias towards the statistics of natural images. Other
pooling schemes lead to different preferences, and this allows tailoring the
network to data that departs from the usual domain of natural imagery. In
addition to analyzing deep networks, we show that shallow ones support only
linear separation ranks, and by this gain insight into the benefit of functions
brought forth by depth - they are able to efficiently model strong correlation
under favored partitions of the input.

 <dc:description>  The traditional Karatsuba algorithm for the multiplication of polynomials and
multi-precision integers has a time complexity of $O(n^{1.59})$ and a space
complexity of $O(n)$. Roche proposed an improved algorithm with the same
$O(n^{1.59})$ time complexity but with a much reduced $O(\log n)$ space
complexity. In Roche's paper details were provided for multiplication of
polynomials, but not for multi-precision integers. Multi-precision integers
differ from polynomials by the presence of carries, which poses difficulties in
implementing Roche's scheme in multi-precision integers. This paper provides a
detailed solution to these difficulties. Finally, numerical comparisons between
the schoolbook, traditional Karatsuba, and space-efficient Karatsuba algorithms
are provided.

 <dc:description>  We present a fully automatic approach to real-time 3D face reconstruction
from monocular in-the-wild videos. With the use of a cascaded-regressor based
face tracking and a 3D Morphable Face Model shape fitting, we obtain a
semi-dense 3D face shape. We further use the texture information from multiple
frames to build a holistic 3D face representation from the video frames. Our
system is able to capture facial expressions and does not require any
person-specific training. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach on the
challenging 300 Videos in the Wild (300-VW) dataset. Our real-time fitting
framework is available as an open source library at http://4dface.org.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to automatically construct
parallel discourse corpus for dialogue machine translation. Firstly, the
parallel subtitle data and its corresponding monolingual movie script data are
crawled and collected from Internet. Then tags such as speaker and discourse
boundary from the script data are projected to its subtitle data via an
information retrieval approach in order to map monolingual discourse to
bilingual texts. We not only evaluate the mapping results, but also integrate
speaker information into the translation. Experiments show our proposed method
can achieve 81.79% and 98.64% accuracy on speaker and dialogue boundary
annotation, and speaker-based language model adaptation can obtain around 0.5
BLEU points improvement in translation qualities. Finally, we publicly release
around 100K parallel discourse data with manual speaker and dialogue boundary
annotation.

 <dc:description>  This work considers reconstructing a target signal in a context of
distributed sparse sources. We propose an efficient reconstruction algorithm
with the aid of other given sources as multiple side information (SI). The
proposed algorithm takes advantage of compressive sensing (CS) with SI and
adaptive weights by solving a proposed weighted $n$-$\ell_{1}$ minimization.
The proposed algorithm computes the adaptive weights in two levels, first each
individual intra-SI and then inter-SI weights are iteratively updated at every
reconstructed iteration. This two-level optimization leads the proposed
reconstruction algorithm with multiple SI using adaptive weights (RAMSIA) to
robustly exploit the multiple SIs with different qualities. We experimentally
perform our algorithm on generated sparse signals and also correlated feature
histograms as multiview sparse sources from a multiview image database. The
results show that RAMSIA significantly outperforms both classical CS and CS
with single SI, and RAMSIA with higher number of SIs gained more than the one
with smaller number of SIs.

 <dc:description>  We introduce openXBOW, an open-source toolkit for the generation of
bag-of-words (BoW) representations from multimodal input. In the BoW principle,
word histograms were first used as features in document classification, but the
idea was and can easily be adapted to, e.g., acoustic or visual low-level
descriptors, introducing a prior step of vector quantisation. The openXBOW
toolkit supports arbitrary numeric input features and text input and
concatenates computed subbags to a final bag. It provides a variety of
extensions and options. To our knowledge, openXBOW is the first publicly
available toolkit for the generation of crossmodal bags-of-words. The
capabilities of the tool are exemplified in two sample scenarios:
time-continuous speech-based emotion recognition and sentiment analysis in
tweets where improved results over other feature representation forms were
observed.

 <dc:description>  We propose a pool-based non-parametric active learning algorithm for general
metric spaces, called MArgin Regularized Metric Active Nearest Neighbor
(MARMANN), which outputs a nearest-neighbor classifier. We give prediction
error guarantees that depend on the noisy-margin properties of the input
sample, and are competitive with those obtained by previously proposed passive
learners. We prove that the label complexity of MARMANN is significantly lower
than that of any passive learner with similar error guarantees. MARMANN is
based on a generalized sample compression scheme, and a new label-efficient
active model-selection procedure.

 <dc:description>  Two semimetrics on probability distributions are proposed, given as the sum
of differences of expectations of analytic functions evaluated at spatial or
frequency locations (i.e, features). The features are chosen so as to maximize
the distinguishability of the distributions, by optimizing a lower bound on
test power for a statistical test using these features. The result is a
parsimonious and interpretable indication of how and where two distributions
differ locally. An empirical estimate of the test power criterion converges
with increasing sample size, ensuring the quality of the returned features. In
real-world benchmarks on high-dimensional text and image data, linear-time
tests using the proposed semimetrics achieve comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art quadratic-time maximum mean discrepancy test, while returning
human-interpretable features that explain the test results.

 <dc:description>  Both face-to-face communication and communication in online environments
convey information beyond the actual verbal message. In a traditional
face-to-face conversation, paralanguage, or the ancillary meaning- and
emotion-laden aspects of speech that are not actual verbal prose, gives
contextual information that allows interactors to more appropriately understand
the message being conveyed. In this paper, we conceptualize textual
paralanguage (TPL), which we define as written manifestations of nonverbal
audible, tactile, and visual elements that supplement or replace written
language and that can be expressed through words, symbols, images, punctuation,
demarcations, or any combination of these elements. We develop a typology of
textual paralanguage using data from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We
present a conceptual framework of antecedents and consequences of brands' use
of textual paralanguage. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

 <dc:description>  We study the computational complexity of distance games, a class of
combinatorial games played on graphs. A move consists of colouring an
uncoloured vertex subject to it not being at certain distances determined by
two sets, D and S. D is the set of forbidden distances for colouring vertices
in different colors, while S is the set of forbidden distances for the same
colour. The last player to move wins. Well-known examples of distance games are
Node-Kayles, Snort, and Col, whose complexities were shown to be PSPACE-hard.
We show that many more distance games are also PSPACE-hard.

 <dc:description>  Verifying that a network configuration satisfies a given boolean predicate is
a fundamental problem in distributed computing. Many variations of this problem
have been studied, for example, in the context of proof labeling schemes (PLS),
locally checkable proofs (LCP), and non-deterministic local decision (NLD). In
all of these contexts, verification time is assumed to be constant. Korman,
Kutten and Masuzawa [PODC 2011] presented a proof-labeling scheme for MST, with
poly-logarithmic verification time, and logarithmic memory at each vertex.
  In this paper we introduce the notion of a $t$-PLS, which allows the
verification procedure to run for super-constant time. Our work analyzes the
tradeoffs of $t$-PLS between time, label size, message length, and computation
space. We construct a universal $t$-PLS and prove that it uses the same amount
of total communication as a known one-round universal PLS, and $t$ factor
smaller labels. In addition, we provide a general technique to prove lower
bounds for space-time tradeoffs of $t$-PLS. We use this technique to show an
optimal tradeoff for testing that a network is acyclic (cycle free). Our
optimal $t$-PLS for acyclicity uses label size and computation space $O((\log
n)/t)$. We further describe a recursive $O(\log^* n)$ space verifier for
acyclicity which does not assume previous knowledge of the run-time $t$.

 <dc:description>  It is well-known in image processing that computational cost increases
rapidly with the number and dimensions of the images to be processed. Several
fields, such as medical imaging, routinely use numerous very large images,
which might also be 3D and/or captured at several frequency bands, all adding
to the computational expense. Multiresolution analysis is a method of
increasing the efficiency of the segmentation process. One multiresolution
approach is the coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, whereby the segmentation
starts at a coarse resolution and is then fine-tuned during subsequent steps.
The starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily with
no clear selection criteria. The research reported in this paper showed that
starting from different resolutions for image segmentation results in different
accuracies and computational times, even for images of the same category
(depicting similar scenes or objects). An automated method for resolution
selection for an input image would thus be beneficial. This paper introduces a
framework for the automated selection of the best resolution for image
segmentation. We propose a measure for defining the best resolution based on
user/system criteria, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computation
time. A learning approach is then introduced for the selection of the
resolution, whereby extracted image features are mapped to the previously
determined best resolution. In the learning process, class (i.e., resolution)
distribution is generally imbalanced, making effective learning from the data
difficult. Experiments conducted with three datasets using two different
segmentation algorithms show that the resolutions selected through learning
enable much faster segmentation than the original ones, while retaining at
least the original accuracy.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a network design game where the objective of the players is to
design the interconnections between the nodes of two different networks $G_1$
and $G_2$ in order to maximize certain local utility functions. In this
setting, each player is associated with a node in $G_1$ and has functional
dependencies on certain nodes in $G_2$. We use a distance-based utility for the
players in which the goal of each player is to purchase a set of edges
(incident to its associated node) such that the sum of the distances between
its associated node and the nodes it depends on in $G_2$ is minimized. We
consider a heterogeneous set of players (i.e., players have their own costs and
benefits for constructing edges). We show that finding a best response of a
player in this game is NP-hard. Despite this, we characterize some properties
of the best response actions which are helpful in determining a Nash
equilibrium for certain instances of this game. In particular, we prove
existence of pure Nash equilibria in this game when $G_2$ contains a star
subgraph, and provide an algorithm that outputs such an equilibrium for any set
of players. Finally, we show that the price of anarchy in this game can be
arbitrarily large.

 <dc:description>  Two families of complementary codes over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ are
studied, where $q=r^2$ is square: i) Hermitian complementary dual linear codes,
and ii) trace Hermitian complementary dual subfield linear codes. Necessary and
sufficient conditions for a linear code (resp., a subfield linear code) to be
Hermitian complementary dual (resp., trace Hermitian complementary dual) are
determined. Constructions of such codes are given together their parameters.

 <dc:description>  A typical problem in causal modeling is the instability of model structure
learning, i.e., small changes in finite data can result in completely different
optimal models. The present work introduces a novel causal modeling algorithm
for longitudinal data, that is robust for finite samples based on recent
advances in stability selection using subsampling and selection algorithms. Our
approach uses exploratory search but allows incorporation of prior knowledge,
e.g., the absence of a particular causal relationship between two specific
variables. We represent causal relationships using structural equation models.
Models are scored along two objectives: the model fit and the model complexity.
Since both objectives are often conflicting we apply a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm to search for Pareto optimal models. To handle the
instability of small finite data samples, we repeatedly subsample the data and
select those substructures (from the optimal models) that are both stable and
parsimonious. These substructures can be visualized through a causal graph. Our
more exploratory approach achieves at least comparable performance as, but
often a significant improvement over state-of-the-art alternative approaches on
a simulated data set with a known ground truth. We also present the results of
our method on three real-world longitudinal data sets on chronic fatigue
syndrome, Alzheimer disease, and chronic kidney disease. The findings obtained
with our approach are generally in line with results from more
hypothesis-driven analyses in earlier studies and suggest some novel
relationships that deserve further research.

 <dc:description>  The focus of this paper is to understand storage costs of emulating an atomic
shared memory over an asynchronous, distributed message passing system.
Previous literature has developed several shared memory emulation algorithms
based on replication and erasure coding techniques. In this paper, we present
information-theoretic lower bounds on the storage costs incurred by shared
memory emulation algorithms. Our storage cost lower bounds are universally
applicable, that is, we make no assumption on the structure of the algorithm or
the method of encoding the data.
  We consider an arbitrary algorithm $A$ that implements an atomic multi-writer
single-reader (MWSR) shared memory variable whose values come from a finite set
$\mathcal{V}$ over a system of $N$ servers connected by point-to-point
asynchronous links. We require that in every fair execution of algorithm $A$
where the number of server failures is smaller than a parameter $f$, every
operation invoked at a non-failing client terminates. We define the storage
cost of a server in algorithm $A$ as the logarithm (to base 2) of number of
states it can take on; the total-storage cost of algorithm $A$ is the sum of
the storage cost of all servers.
  Our results are as follows. (i) We show that if algorithm $A$ does not use
server gossip, then the total storage cost is lower bounded by $2
\frac{N}{N-f+1}\log_2|\mathcal{V}|-o(\log_2|\mathcal{V}|)$. (ii) The total
storage cost is at least $2 \frac{N}{N-f+2}
\log_{2}|\mathcal{V}|-o(\log_{2}|\mathcal{V}|)$ even if the algorithm uses
server gossip. (iii) We consider algorithms where the write protocol sends
information about the value in at most one phase. We show that the total
storage cost is at least $\nu^* \frac{N}{N-f+\nu^*-1} \log_2( |\mathcal{V}|)-
o(\log_2(|\mathcal{V}|),$ where $\nu^*$ is the minimum of $f+1$ and the number
of active write operations of an execution.

 <dc:description>  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the problem of decomposing a given
nonnegative $n \times m$ matrix $M$ into a product of a nonnegative $n \times
d$ matrix $W$ and a nonnegative $d \times m$ matrix $H$. A longstanding open
question, posed by Cohen and Rothblum in 1993, is whether a rational matrix $M$
always has an NMF of minimal inner dimension $d$ whose factors $W$ and $H$ are
also rational. We answer this question negatively, by exhibiting a matrix for
which $W$ and $H$ require irrational entries.

 <dc:title>The Greedy Spanner is Existentially Optimal</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Filtser, Arnold</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Solomon, Shay</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The greedy spanner is arguably the simplest and most well-studied spanner
construction. Experimental results demonstrate that it is at least as good as
any other spanner construction, in terms of both the size and weight
parameters. However, a rigorous proof for this statement has remained elusive.
  In this work we fill in the theoretical gap via a surprisingly simple
observation: The greedy spanner is \emph{existentially optimal} (or
existentially near-optimal) for several important graph families. Focusing on
the weight parameter, the state-of-the-art spanner constructions for both
general graphs (due to Chechik and Wulff-Nilsen [SODA'16]) and doubling metrics
(due to Gottlieb [FOCS'15]) are complex. Plugging our observation on these
results, we conclude that the greedy spanner achieves near-optimal weight
guarantees for both general graphs and doubling metrics, thus resolving two
longstanding conjectures in the area.
  Further, we observe that approximate-greedy algorithms are existentially
near-optimal as well. Consequently, we provide an $O(n \log n)$-time
construction of $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners for doubling metrics with constant
lightness and degree. Our construction improves Gottlieb's construction, whose
runtime is $O(n \log^2 n)$ and whose number of edges and degree are unbounded,
and remarkably, it matches the state-of-the-art Euclidean result (due to
Gudmundsson et al. [SICOMP'02]) in all the involved parameters (up to
dependencies on $\epsilon$ and the dimension).

 <dc:title>Path Planning in Dynamic Environments with Adaptive Dimensionality</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Path planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles is a challenging problem
due to the added time dimension in search space. In approaches that ignore the
time dimension and treat dynamic obstacles as static, frequent re-planning is
unavoidable as the obstacles move, and their solutions are generally
sub-optimal and can be incomplete. To achieve both optimality and completeness,
it is necessary to consider the time dimension during planning. The notion of
adaptive dimensionality has been successfully used in high-dimensional motion
planning such as manipulation of robot arms, but has not been used in the
context of path planning in dynamic environments. In this paper, we apply the
idea of adaptive dimensionality to speed up path planning in dynamic
environments for a robot with no assumptions on its dynamic model.
Specifically, our approach considers the time dimension only in those regions
of the environment where a potential collision may occur, and plans in a
low-dimensional state-space elsewhere. We show that our approach is complete
and is guaranteed to find a solution, if one exists, within a cost
sub-optimality bound. We experimentally validate our method on the problem of
3D vehicle navigation (x, y, heading) in dynamic environments. Our results show
that the presented approach achieves substantial speedups in planning time over
4D heuristic-based A*, especially when the resulting plan deviates
significantly from the one suggested by the heuristic.

 <dc:description>  Many users in online social networks are constantly trying to gain attention
from their followers by broadcasting posts to them. These broadcasters are
likely to gain greater attention if their posts can remain visible for a longer
period of time among their followers' most recent feeds. Then when to post? In
this paper, we study the problem of smart broadcasting using the framework of
temporal point processes, where we model users feeds and posts as discrete
events occurring in continuous time. Based on such continuous-time model, then
choosing a broadcasting strategy for a user becomes a problem of designing the
conditional intensity of her posting events. We derive a novel formula which
links this conditional intensity with the visibility of the user in her
followers' feeds. Furthermore, by exploiting this formula, we develop an
efficient convex optimization framework for the when-to-post problem. Our
method can find broadcasting strategies that reach a desired visibility level
with provable guarantees. We experimented with data gathered from Twitter, and
show that our framework can consistently make broadcasters' post more visible
than alternatives.

 <dc:description>  The database community has long recognized the importance of graphical query
interface to the usability of data management systems. Yet, relatively less has
been done. We present Orion, a visual interface for querying
ultra-heterogeneous graphs. It iteratively assists users in query graph
construction by making suggestions via machine learning methods. In its active
mode, Orion automatically suggests top-k edges to be added to a query graph. In
its passive mode, the user adds a new edge manually, and Orion suggests a
ranked list of labels for the edge. Orion's edge ranking algorithm, Random
Decision Paths (RDP), makes use of a query log to rank candidate edges by how
likely they will match the user's query intent. Extensive user studies using
Freebase demonstrated that Orion users have a 70% success rate in constructing
complex query graphs, a significant improvement over the 58% success rate by
the users of a baseline system that resembles existing visual query builders.
Furthermore, using active mode only, the RDP algorithm was compared with
several methods adapting other machine learning algorithms such as random
forests and naive Bayes classifier, as well as class association rules and
recommendation systems based on singular value decomposition. On average, RDP
required 40 suggestions to correctly reach a target query graph (using only its
active mode of suggestion) while other methods required 1.5--4 times as many
suggestions.

 <dc:description>  We target the problem of sparse 3D reconstruction of dynamic objects observed
by multiple unsynchronized video cameras with unknown temporal overlap. To this
end, we develop a framework to recover the unknown structure without sequencing
information across video sequences. Our proposed compressed sensing framework
poses the estimation of 3D structure as the problem of dictionary learning,
where the dictionary is defined as an aggregation of the temporally varying 3D
structures. Given the smooth motion of dynamic objects, we observe any element
in the dictionary can be well approximated by a sparse linear combination of
other elements in the same dictionary (i. e. self-expression). Moreover, the
sparse coefficients describing a locally linear 3D structural interpolation
reveal the local sequencing information. Our formulation optimizes a biconvex
cost function that leverages a compressed sensing formulation and enforces both
structural dependency coherence across video streams, as well as motion
smoothness across estimates from common video sources. We further analyze the
reconstructability of our approach under different capture scenarios, and its
comparison and relation to existing methods. Experimental results on large
amounts of synthetic data as well as real imagery demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Relational databases are wildly adopted in RDF (Resource Description
Framework) data management. For efficient SPARQL query evaluation, the legacy
query optimizer needs reconsiderations. One vital problem is how to tackle the
suboptimal query plan caused by error-prone cardinality estimation. Consider
the schema-free nature of RDF data and the Join-intensive characteristic of
SPARQL query, determine an optimal execution order before the query actually
evaluated is costly or even infeasible, especially for complex queries on
large-scale data. In this paper, we propose ROSIE, a Runtime Optimization
framework that iteratively re-optimize SPARQL query plan according to the
actual cardinality derived from Incremental partial query Evaluation. By
introducing an approach for heuristic-based plan generation, as well as a
mechanism to detect cardinality estimation error at runtime, ROSIE relieves the
problem of biased cardinality propagation in an efficient way, and thus is more
resilient to complex query evaluation. Extensive experiments on real and
benchmark data show that compared to the state-of-the-arts, ROSIE consistently
outperformed on complex queries by orders of magnitude.

 <dc:description>  We study safety verification for multithreaded programs with recursive
parallelism (i.e. unbounded thread creation and recursion) as well as unbounded
integer variables. Since the threads in each program configuration are
structured in a hierarchical fashion, our model is state-extended ground-tree
rewrite systems equipped with shared unbounded integer counters that can be
incremented, decremented, and compared against an integer constant. Since the
model is Turing-complete, we propose a decidable underapproximation. First,
using a restriction similar to context-bounding, we underapproximate the global
control by a weak global control (i.e. DAGs possibly with self-loops), thereby
limiting the number of synchronisations between different threads. Second, we
bound the number of reversals between non-decrementing and non-incrementing
modes of the counters. Under this restriction, we show that reachability
becomes NP-complete. In fact, it is poly-time reducible to satisfaction over
existential Presburger formulas, which allows one to tap into highly optimised
SMT solvers. Our decidable approximation strictly generalises known decidable
models including (i) weakly-synchronised ground-tree rewrite systems, and (ii)
synchronisation/reversal-bounded concurrent pushdown systems systems with
counters. Finally, we show that, when equipped with reversal-bounded counters,
relaxing the weak control restriction by the notion of senescence results in
undecidability.

 <dc:description>  Fine-grained image recognition is a challenging computer vision problem, due
to the small inter-class variations caused by highly similar subordinate
categories, and the large intra-class variations in poses, scales and
rotations. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end Mask-CNN model without
the fully connected layers for fine-grained recognition. Based on the part
annotations of fine-grained images, the proposed model consists of a fully
convolutional network to both locate the discriminative parts (e.g., head and
torso), and more importantly generate object/part masks for selecting useful
and meaningful convolutional descriptors. After that, a four-stream Mask-CNN
model is built for aggregating the selected object- and part-level descriptors
simultaneously. The proposed Mask-CNN model has the smallest number of
parameters, lowest feature dimensionality and highest recognition accuracy when
compared with state-of-the-arts fine-grained approaches.

 <dc:description>  We study local aggregation and graph analysis in distributed environments
using the message passing model. We provide a flexible framework, where each of
the nodes in a set $S$--which is a subset of all nodes in the network--can
perform a large range of common aggregation functions in its $k$-neighborhood.
We study this problem in the CONGEST model, where in each synchronous round,
every node can transmit a different (but short) message to each of its
neighbors. While the $k$-neighborhoods of nodes in $S$ might overlap and
aggregation could cause congestion in this model, we present an algorithm that
needs time $O(|S|+k)$ even when each of the nodes in $S$ performs a different
aggregation on its $k$-neighborhood. The framework is not restricted to
aggregation-trees such that it can be used for more advanced graph analysis. We
demonstrate this by providing efficient approximations of centrality measures
and approximation of minimum routing cost trees.

 <dc:description>  Mobile cloud computing relieves the tension between compute-intensive mobile
applications and battery-constrained mobile devices by enabling the offloading
of computing tasks from mobiles to a remote processors. This paper considers a
mobile cloud computing scenario in which the &quot;cloudlet&quot; processor that provides
offloading opportunities to mobile devices is mounted on unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) to enhance coverage. Focusing on a slotted communication system
with frequency division multiplexing between mobile and UAV, the joint
optimization of the number of input bits transmitted in the uplink by the
mobile to the UAV, the number of input bits processed by the cloudlet at the
UAV, and the number of output bits returned by the cloudlet to the mobile in
the downlink in each slot is carried out by means of dual decomposition under
maximum latency constraints with the aim of minimizing the mobile energy
consumption. Numerical results reveal the critical importance of an optimized
bit allocation in order to enable significant energy savings as compared to
local mobile execution for stringent latency constraints.

 <dc:title>Bridging Category-level and Instance-level Semantic Image Segmentation</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We propose an approach to instance-level image segmentation that is built on
top of category-level segmentation. Specifically, for each pixel in a semantic
category mask, its corresponding instance bounding box is predicted using a
deep fully convolutional regression network. Thus it follows a different
pipeline to the popular detect-then-segment approaches that first predict
instances' bounding boxes, which are the current state-of-the-art in instance
segmentation. We show that, by leveraging the strength of our state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation models, the proposed method can achieve comparable or
even better results to detect-then-segment approaches. We make the following
contributions. (i) First, we propose a simple yet effective approach to
semantic instance segmentation. (ii) Second, we propose an online bootstrapping
method during training, which is critically important for achieving good
performance for both semantic category segmentation and instance-level
segmentation. (iii) As the performance of semantic category segmentation has a
significant impact on the instance-level segmentation, which is the second step
of our approach, we train fully convolutional residual networks to achieve the
best semantic category segmentation accuracy. On the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset,
we obtain the currently best mean intersection-over-union score of 79.1%. (iv)
We also achieve state-of-the-art results for instance-level segmentation.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic partition models tailor a product space into a number of
rectangular regions such that the data within each region exhibit certain types
of homogeneity. Due to constraints of partition strategy, existing models may
cause unnecessary dissections in sparse regions when fitting data in dense
regions. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a parsimonious partition
model, named Stochastic Patching Process (SPP), to deal with multi-dimensional
arrays. SPP adopts an &quot;enclosing&quot; strategy to attach rectangular patches to
dense regions. SPP is self-consistent such that it can be extended to infinite
arrays. We apply SPP to relational modeling and the experimental results
validate its merit compared to the state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  As the emerging field of machine learning, deep learning shows excellent
ability in solving complex learning problems. However, the size of the networks
becomes increasingly large scale due to the demands of the practical
applications, which poses significant challenge to construct a high performance
implementations of deep learning neural networks. In order to improve the
performance as well to maintain the low power cost, in this paper we design
DLAU, which is a scalable accelerator architecture for large-scale deep
learning networks using FPGA as the hardware prototype. The DLAU accelerator
employs three pipelined processing units to improve the throughput and utilizes
tile techniques to explore locality for deep learning applications.
Experimental results on the state-of-the-art Xilinx FPGA board demonstrate that
the DLAU accelerator is able to achieve up to 36.1x speedup comparing to the
Intel Core2 processors, with the power consumption at 234mW.

 <dc:description>  Macroscopic behavior of scientific and societal systems results from the
aggregation of microscopic behaviors of their constituent elements, but
connecting the macroscopic with the microscopic in human behavior has
traditionally been difficult. Manifestations of homophily, the notion that
individuals tend to interact with others who resemble them, have been observed
in many small and intermediate size settings. However, whether this behavior
translates to truly macroscopic levels, and what its consequences may be,
remains unknown. Here, we use call detail records (CDRs) to examine the
population dynamics and manifestations of social and spatial homophily at a
macroscopic level among the residents of 23 states of India at the Kumbh Mela,
a 3-month-long Hindu festival. We estimate that the festival was attended by 61
million people, making it the largest gathering in the history of humanity.
While we find strong overall evidence for both types of homophily for residents
of different states, participants from low-representation states show
considerably stronger propensity for both social and spatial homophily than
those from high-representation states. These manifestations of homophily are
amplified on crowded days, such as the peak day of the festival, which we
estimate was attended by 25 million people. Our findings confirm that
homophily, which here likely arises from social influence, permeates all scales
of human behavior.

 <dc:description>  We analyze stochastic algorithms for optimizing nonconvex, nonsmooth
finite-sum problems, where the nonconvex part is smooth and the nonsmooth part
is convex. Surprisingly, unlike the smooth case, our knowledge of this
fundamental problem is very limited. For example, it is not known whether the
proximal stochastic gradient method with constant minibatch converges to a
stationary point. To tackle this issue, we develop fast stochastic algorithms
that provably converge to a stationary point for constant minibatches.
Furthermore, using a variant of these algorithms, we show provably faster
convergence than batch proximal gradient descent. Finally, we prove global
linear convergence rate for an interesting subclass of nonsmooth nonconvex
functions, that subsumes several recent works. This paper builds upon our
recent series of papers on fast stochastic methods for smooth nonconvex
optimization [22, 23], with a novel analysis for nonconvex and nonsmooth
functions.

 <dc:description>  The built environment, as hallmark of modern society, has become one of the
key drivers of energy demand. This makes for meaningful application of novel
paradigms, such as cyber-physical systems, with large scale impact for both
primary energy consumption reduction as well as (micro-) grid stability
problems. In a bottom-up approach we analyze the drivers of CPS design,
deployment and adoption in smart buildings. This ranges from low-level embedded
and real time system challenges, instrumentation and control issues, up to ICT
security layers protecting information in a world of ubiquitous connectivity. A
modeling and predictive control framework is also discussed with outlook of
deployment for HVAC optimization to a new facility for research from our
campus.

 <dc:description>  Motif finding is one of the NP-complete problems in Computational Biology.
Existing nondeterministic algorithms for motif finding do not guarantee the
global optimality of results and are sensitive to initial parameters. To
address this problem, the PROJECTION algorithm provides a good initial estimate
that can be further refined using local optimization algorithms such as EM,
MEME or Gibbs. For large enough input (600-1000 bp per sequence) or for
challenging motif finding problems, the PROJECTION algorithm may run in an
inordinate amount of time. In this paper we present a parallel implementation
of the PROJECTION algorithm in Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) using CUDA. We
also list down several major issues we have encountered including performing
space optimizations because of the GPU's space limitations.

 <dc:title>Embedding based on function approximation for large scale image search</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Do, Thanh-Toan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The objective of this paper is to design an embedding method that maps local
features describing an image (e.g. SIFT) to a higher dimensional representation
useful for the image retrieval problem. First, motivated by the relationship
between the linear approximation of a nonlinear function in high dimensional
space and the stateof-the-art feature representation used in image retrieval,
i.e., VLAD, we propose a new approach for the approximation. The embedded
vectors resulted by the function approximation process are then aggregated to
form a single representation for image retrieval. Second, in order to make the
proposed embedding method applicable to large scale problem, we further derive
its fast version in which the embedded vectors can be efficiently computed,
i.e., in the closed-form. We compare the proposed embedding methods with the
state of the art in the context of image search under various settings: when
the images are represented by medium length vectors, short vectors, or binary
vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed embedding methods
outperform existing the state of the art on the standard public image retrieval
benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the extraction of high-level
features from raw sensor data which has opened up new possibilities in many
different fields, including computer generated choreography. In this paper we
present a system chor-rnn for generating novel choreographic material in the
nuanced choreographic language and style of an individual choreographer. It
also shows promising results in producing a higher level compositional
cohesion, rather than just generating sequences of movement. At the core of
chor-rnn is a deep recurrent neural network trained on raw motion capture data
and that can generate new dance sequences for a solo dancer. Chor-rnn can be
used for collaborative human-machine choreography or as a creative catalyst,
serving as inspiration for a choreographer.

 <dc:title>MDS Codes with Progressive Engagement Property for Cloud Storage Systems</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Fast and efficient failure recovery is a new challenge for cloud storage
systems with a large number of storage nodes. A pivotal recovery metric upon
the failure of a storage node is repair bandwidth cost which refers to the
amount of data that must be downloaded for regenerating the lost data. Since
all the surviving nodes are not always accessible, we intend to introduce a
class of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes that can be re-used when the
number of selected nodes varies yet yields close to optimal repair bandwidth.
Such codes provide flexibility in engaging more surviving nodes in favor of
reducing the repair bandwidth without redesigning the code structure and
changing the content of the existing nodes. We call this property of MDS codes
progressive engagement. This name comes from the fact that if a failure occurs,
it is shown that the best strategy is to incrementally engage the surviving
nodes according to their accessing cost (delay, number of hops, traffic load or
availability in general) until the repair-bandwidth or accessing cost
constraints are met. We argue that the existing MDS codes fail to satisfy the
progressive engagement property. We subsequently present a search algorithm to
find a new set of codes named rotation codes that has both progressive
engagement and MDS properties. Furthermore, we illustrate how the existing
permutation codes can provide progressive engagement by modifying the original
recovery scheme. Simulation results are presented to compare the repair
bandwidth performance of such codes when the number of participating nodes
varies as well as their speed of single failure recovery.

 <dc:description>  The mobile application (app) has become the main entrance to access the
Internet on handheld devices. Unlike the Web where each webpage has a global
URL to reach directly, a specific &quot;content page&quot; of an app can be opened only
by exploring the app with several operations from the landing page. The
interoperability between apps is quite fixed and thus limits the value-added
&quot;linked data&quot; between apps. Recently, deep link has been proposed to enable
targeting and opening a specific page of an app externally with an accessible
uniform resource identifier (URI). However, implementing deep link for mobile
apps requires a lot of manual efforts by app developers, which can be very
error-prone and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose DroidLink to
automatically generating deep links for existing Android apps. We design a deep
link model suitable for automatic generation. Then we explore the transition of
pages and build a navigation graph based on static and dynamic analysis of
Android apps. Next, we realize an updating mechanism that keeps on revisiting
the target app and discover new pages, and thus generates deep links for every
single page of the app. Finally, we repackage the app with deep link supports,
but requires no additional deployment requirements. We generate deep links for
some popular apps and demonstrate the feasibility of DroidLink.

 <dc:description>  The behaviour of many real-world phenomena can be modelled by nonlinear
dynamical systems whereby a latent system state is observed through a filter.
We are interested in interacting subsystems of this form, which we model by a
set of coupled maps as a synchronous update graph dynamical systems.
Specifically, we study the structure learning problem for spatially distributed
dynamical systems coupled via a directed acyclic graph. Unlike established
structure learning procedures that find locally maximum posterior probabilities
of a network structure containing latent variables, our work exploits the
properties of dynamical systems to compute globally optimal approximations of
these distributions. We arrive at this result by the use of time delay
embedding theorems. Taking an information-theoretic perspective, we show that
the log-likelihood has an intuitive interpretation in terms of information
transfer.

 <dc:description>  We present a straightforward, sound Hindley-Milner polymorphic type system
for algebraic effects and handlers in a call-by-value calculus, which allows
type variable generalisation of arbitrary computations, not just values. This
result is surprising. On the one hand, the soundness of unrestricted
call-by-value Hindley-Milner polymorphism is known to fail in the presence of
computational effects such as reference cells and continuations. On the other
hand, many programming examples can be recast to use effect handlers instead of
these effects. Analysing the expressive power of effect handlers with respect
to state effects, we claim handlers cannot express reference cells, and show
they can simulate dynamically scoped state.

 <dc:description>  Combinatorial decision problems arise in many different domains such as
scheduling, routing, packing, bioinformatics, and many more. Despite recent
advances in developing scalable solvers, there are still many problems which
are often very hard to solve. Typically the most advanced solvers include
elements which are stochastic in nature. If a same instance is solved many
times using different seeds then depending on the inherent characteristics of a
problem instance and the solver, one can observe a highly-variant distribution
of times spanning multiple orders of magnitude. Therefore, to solve a problem
instance efficiently it is often useful to solve the same instance in parallel
with different seeds. With the proliferation of cloud computing, it is natural
to think about an elastic solver which can scale up by launching searches in
parallel on thousands of machines (or cores). However, this could result in
consuming a lot of energy. Moreover, not every instance would require thousands
of machines. The challenge is to resolve the tradeoff between solution time and
energy consumption optimally for a given problem instance. We analyse the
impact of the number of machines (or cores) on not only solution time but also
on energy consumption. We highlight that although solution time always drops as
the number of machines increases, the relation between the number of machines
and energy consumption is more complicated. In many cases, the optimal energy
consumption may be achieved by a middle ground, we analyse this relationship in
detail. The tradeoff between solution time and energy consumption is studied
further, showing that the energy consumption of a solver can be reduced
drastically if we increase the solution time marginally. We also develop a
prediction model, demonstrating that such insights can be exploited to achieve
faster solutions times in a more energy efficient manor.

 <dc:description>  We present a new algorithm, trimed, for obtaining the medoid of a set, that
is the element of the set which minimises the mean distance to all other
elements. The algorithm is shown to have, under certain assumptions, expected
run time O(N^(3/2)) in R^d where N is the set size, making it the first
sub-quadratic exact medoid algorithm for d&gt;1. Experiments show that it performs
very well on spatial network data, frequently requiring two orders of magnitude
fewer distance calculations than state-of-the-art approximate algorithms. As an
application, we show how trimed can be used as a component in an accelerated
K-medoids algorithm, and then how it can be relaxed to obtain further
computational gains with only a minor loss in cluster quality.

 <dc:description>  Most of the semi-supervised classification methods developed so far use
unlabeled data for regularization purposes under particular distributional
assumptions such as the cluster assumption. In contrast, recently developed
methods of classification from positive and unlabeled data (PU classification)
use unlabeled data for risk evaluation, i.e., label information is directly
extracted from unlabeled data. In this paper, we extend PU classification to
also incorporate negative data and propose a novel semi-supervised
classification approach. We establish generalization error bounds for our novel
methods and show that the bounds decrease with respect to the number of
unlabeled data without the distributional assumptions that are required in
existing semi-supervised classification methods. Through experiments, we
demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed methods.

 <dc:description>  This note addresses identification of the $A$-matrix in continuous time
linear dynamical systems on state-space form. If this matrix is partially known
or known to have a sparse structure, such knowledge can be used to simplify the
identification. We begin by introducing some general conditions for solvability
of the inverse problems for matrix exponential. Next, we introduce &quot;system
aliasing&quot; as an issue in the identification of slow sampled systems. Such
aliasing give rise to non-unique matrix logarithms. As we show, by imposing
additional conditions on and prior knowledge about the $A$-matrix, the issue of
system aliasing can, at least partially, be overcome. Under conditions on the
sparsity and the norm of the $A$-matrix, it is identifiable up to a finite
equivalence class.

conditions and optimizing the convergence rate of the algorithm, for quantum
networks with undirected underlying topology. This paper aims to address the
extension of this problem over quantum networks with directed underlying
graphs. In doing so, the convergence to two different stable states namely,
consensus and synchronous states have been studied. Based on the intertwining
relation between the eigenvalues, it is shown that for determining the
convergence rate to the consensus state, all induced graphs should be
considered while for the synchronous state only the underlying graph suffices.
Furthermore, it is illustrated that for the range of weights that the Aldous'
conjecture holds true, the convergence rate to both states are equal. Using the
Pareto region for convergence rates of the algorithm, the global and Pareto
optimal points for several topologies have been provided.

 <dc:description>  Let $G$ be an undirected bipartite graph with positive integer weights on the
edges. We refine the existing decomposition theorem originally proposed by Kao
et al., for computing maximum weight bipartite matching. We apply it to design
an efficient version of the decomposition algorithm to compute the weight of a
maximum weight bipartite matching of $G$ in $O(\sqrt{|V|}W'/k(|V|,W'/N))$-time
by employing an algorithm designed by Feder and Motwani as a subroutine, where
$|V|$ and $N$ denote the number of nodes and the maximum edge weight of $G$,
respectively and $k(x,y)=\log x /\log(x^2/y)$. The parameter $W'$ is smaller
than the total edge weight $W,$ essentially when the largest edge weight
differs by more than one from the second largest edge weight in the current
working graph in any decomposition step of the algorithm. In best case
$W'=O(|E|)$ where $|E|$ be the number of edges of $G$ and in worst case $W'=W,$
that is, $|E| \leq W' \leq W.$ In addition, we talk about a scaling property of
the algorithm and research a better bound of the parameter $W'$. An
experimental evaluation on randomly generated data shows that the proposed
improvement is significant in general.

 <dc:description>  Sorting, a classical combinatorial process, forms the bedrock of numerous
algorithms with varied applications. A related problem involves efficiently
finding the corresponding ranks of all the elements - catering to rank queries,
data partitioning and allocation, etc. Although, the element ranks can be
subsequently obtained by initially sorting the elements, such procedures
involve O(n log n) computations and might not be suitable with large input
sizes for hard real-time systems or for applications with data re-ordering
constraints. This paper proposes SONIK, a non-comparison linear time and space
algorithm using bit operations inspired by radix sort for computing the ranks
of all input integer elements, thereby providing implicit sorting. The element
ranks are generated in-situ, i.e., directly at the corresponding element
position without re-ordering or recourse to any other sorting mechanism.

 <dc:description>  The iterative nature of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm presents
a challenge for privacy-preserving estimation, as each iteration increases the
amount of noise needed. We propose a practical private EM algorithm that
overcomes this challenge using two innovations: (1) a novel moment perturbation
formulation for differentially private EM (DP-EM), and (2) the use of two
recently developed composition methods to bound the privacy &quot;cost&quot; of multiple
EM iterations: the moments accountant (MA) and zero-mean concentrated
differential privacy (zCDP). Both MA and zCDP bound the moment generating
function of the privacy loss random variable and achieve a refined tail bound,
which effectively decrease the amount of additive noise. We present empirical
results showing the benefits of our approach, as well as similar performance
between these two composition methods in the DP-EM setting for Gaussian mixture
models. Our approach can be readily extended to many iterative learning
algorithms, opening up various exciting future directions.

 <dc:description>  State-of-the-art algorithms for imaging inverse problems (namely deblurring
and reconstruction) are typically iterative, involving a denoising operation as
one of its steps. Using a state-of-the-art denoising method in this context is
not trivial, and is the focus of current work. Recently, we have proposed to
use a class-adapted denoiser (patch-based using Gaussian mixture models) in a
so-called plug-and-play scheme, wherein a state-of-the-art denoiser is plugged
into an iterative algorithm, leading to results that outperform the best
general-purpose algorithms, when applied to an image of a known class (e.g.
faces, text, brain MRI). In this paper, we extend that approach to handle
situations where the image being processed is from one of a collection of
possible classes or, more importantly, contains regions of different classes.
More specifically, we propose a method to locally select one of a set of
class-adapted Gaussian mixture patch priors, previously estimated from clean
images of those classes. Our approach may be seen as simultaneously performing
segmentation and restoration, thus contributing to bridging the gap between
image restoration/reconstruction and analysis.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present madmom, an open-source audio processing and music
information retrieval (MIR) library written in Python. madmom features a
concise, NumPy-compatible, object oriented design with simple calling
conventions and sensible default values for all parameters, which facilitates
fast prototyping of MIR applications. Prototypes can be seamlessly converted
into callable processing pipelines through madmom's concept of Processors,
callable objects that run transparently on multiple cores. Processors can also
be serialised, saved, and re-run to allow results to be easily reproduced
anywhere. Apart from low-level audio processing, madmom puts emphasis on
musically meaningful high-level features. Many of these incorporate machine
learning techniques and madmom provides a module that implements some in MIR
commonly used methods such as hidden Markov models and neural networks.
Additionally, madmom comes with several state-of-the-art MIR algorithms for
onset detection, beat, downbeat and meter tracking, tempo estimation, and piano
transcription. These can easily be incorporated into bigger MIR systems or run
as stand-alone programs.

 <dc:description>  We study an online learning framework introduced by Mannor and Shamir (2011)
in which the feedback is specified by a graph, in a setting where the graph may
vary from round to round and is \emph{never fully revealed} to the learner. We
show a large gap between the adversarial and the stochastic cases. In the
adversarial case, we prove that even for dense feedback graphs, the learner
cannot improve upon a trivial regret bound obtained by ignoring any additional
feedback besides her own loss. In contrast, in the stochastic case we give an
algorithm that achieves $\widetilde \Theta(\sqrt{\alpha T})$ regret over $T$
rounds, provided that the independence numbers of the hidden feedback graphs
are at most $\alpha$. We also extend our results to a more general feedback
model, in which the learner does not necessarily observe her own loss, and show
that, even in simple cases, concealing the feedback graphs might render a
learnable problem unlearnable.

 <dc:description>  We tackle the problem of collaborative filtering (CF) with side information,
through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Driven by the idea of
using the kernel to explicitly model user-item similarities, we formulate the
GP in a way that allows the incorporation of low-rank matrix factorisation,
arriving at our model, the Tucker Gaussian Process (TGP). Consequently, TGP
generalises classical Bayesian matrix factorisation models, and goes beyond
them to give a natural and elegant method for incorporating side information,
giving enhanced predictive performance for CF problems. Moreover we show that
it is a novel model for regression, especially well-suited to grid-structured
data and problems where the dependence on covariates is close to being
separable.

 <dc:description>  Smile is an irrefutable expression that shows the physical state of the mind
in both true and deceptive ways. Generally, it shows happy state of the mind,
however, `smiles' can be deceptive, for example people can give a smile when
they feel happy and sometimes they might also give a smile (in a different way)
when they feel pity for others. This work aims to distinguish spontaneous
(felt) smile expressions from posed (deliberate) smiles by extracting and
analyzing both global (macro) motion of the face and subtle (micro) changes in
the facial expression features through both tracking a series of facial
fiducial markers as well as using dense optical flow. Specifically the eyes and
lips features are captured and used for analysis. It aims to automatically
classify all smiles into either `spontaneous' or `posed' categories, by using
support vector machines (SVM). Experimental results on large database show
promising results as compared to other relevant methods.

 <dc:description>  We face a need of discovering a pattern in locations of a great number of
points in a high-dimensional space. Goal is to group the close points together.
We are interested in a hierarchical structure, like a B-tree. B-Trees are
hierarchical, balanced, and they can be constructed dynamically. B-Tree
approach allows to determine the structure without any supervised learning or a
priori knowlwdge. The space is Euclidean and isotropic. Unfortunately, there
are no B-Tree implementations processing indices in a symmetrical and
isotropical way. Some implementations are based on constructing compound
asymmetrical indices from point coordinates; and the others split the nodes
along the coordinate hyper-planes. We need to process tens of millions of
points in a thousand-dimensional space. The application has to be scalable.
Ideally, a cluster should be an ellipsoid, but it would require to store O(n2)
ellipse axes. So, we are using multi-dimensional balls defined by the centers
and radii. Calculation of statistical values like the mean and the average
deviation, can be done in an incremental way. While adding a point to a tree,
the statistical values for nodes recalculated in O(1) time. We support both,
brute force O(2n) and greedy O(n2) split algorithms. Statistical and aggregated
node information also allows to manipulate (to search, to delete) aggregated
sets of closely located points. Hierarchical information retrieval. When
searching, the user is provided with the highest appropriate nodes in the tree
hierarchy, with the most important clusters emerging in the hierarchy
automatically. Then, if interested, the user may navigate down the tree to more
specific points. The system is implemented as a library of Java classes
representing Points, Sets of points with aggregated statistical information,
B-tree, and Nodes with a support of serialization and storage in a MySQL
database.

 <dc:description>  Preprocessors support the diversification of software products with #ifdefs,
but also require additional effort from developers to maintain and understand
variable code. We conjecture that #ifdefs cause developers to produce more
vulnerable code because they are required to reason about multiple features
simultaneously and maintain complex mental models of dependencies of
configurable code.
  We extracted a variational call graph across all configurations of the Linux
kernel, and used configuration complexity metrics to compare vulnerable and
non-vulnerable functions considering their vulnerability history. Our goal was
to learn about whether we can observe a measurable influence of configuration
complexity on the occurrence of vulnerabilities.
  Our results suggest, among others, that vulnerable functions have higher
variability than non-vulnerable ones and are also constrained by fewer
configuration options. This suggests that developers are inclined to notice
functions appear in frequently-compiled product variants. We aim to raise
developers' awareness to address variability more systematically, since
configuration complexity is an important, but often ignored aspect of software
product lines.

 <dc:title>Leveraging percolation theory to single out influential spreaders in

 <dc:description>  Among the consequences of the disordered interaction topology underlying many
social, techno- logical and biological systems, a particularly important one is
that some nodes, just because of their position in the network, may have a
disproportionate effect on dynamical processes mediated by the complex
interaction pattern. For example, the early adoption by an opinion leader in a
social network may change the fate of a commercial product, or just a few
super-spreaders may determine the virality of a meme in social media. Despite
many recent efforts, the formulation of an accurate method to optimally
identify influential nodes in complex network topologies remains an unsolved
challenge. Here, we present the exact solution of the problem for the specific,
but highly relevant, case of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model for
epidemic spreading at criticality. By exploiting the mapping between bond
percolation and the static properties of SIR, we prove that the recently
introduced Non-Backtracking centrality is the optimal criterion for the
identification of influential spreaders in locally tree-like networks at
criticality. By means of simulations on synthetic networks and on a very
extensive set of real-world networks, we show that the Non-Backtracking
centrality is a highly reliable metric to identify top influential spreaders
also in generic graphs not embedded in space, and for noncritical spreading.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce two symmetric directed graphs depending on

graphs provides either necessary and sufficient conditions to phase retrieval
of a signal from magnitude measurements of its multiple-window short-time
Fourier transform. Also we propose an algebraic reconstruction algorithm, and
provide an error estimate to our algorithm when magnitude measurements are
corrupted by deterministic/random noises.

 <dc:description>  We address the rectangular matrix completion problem by lifting the unknown

nonconvex objective over the semidefinite factor using a simple gradient
descent scheme. With $O( \mu r^2 \kappa^2 n \max(\mu, \log n))$ random
observations of a $n_1 \times n_2$ $\mu$-incoherent matrix of rank $r$ and
condition number $\kappa$, where $n = \max(n_1, n_2)$, the algorithm linearly
converges to the global optimum with high probability.

 <dc:description>  A wide range of complex systems can be modeled as networks with corresponding
constraints on the edges and nodes, which have been extensively studied in
recent years. Nowadays, with the progress of information technology, systems
that contain the information collected from multiple perspectives have been
generated. The conventional models designed for single perspective networks
fail to depict the diverse topological properties of such systems, so
multilayer network models aiming at describing the structure of these networks
emerge. As a major concern in network science, decomposing the networks into
communities, which usually refers to closely interconnected node groups,
extracts valuable information about the structure and interactions of the
network. Unlike the contention of dozens of models and methods in conventional
single-layer networks, methods aiming at discovering the communities in the
multilayer networks are still limited. In order to help explore the community
structure in multilayer networks, we propose the multilayer edge mixture model,
which explores a relatively general form of a community structure evaluator
from an edge combination view. As an example, we demonstrate that the
multilayer modularity and stochastic blockmodels can be derived from the
proposed model. We also explore the decomposition of community structure
evaluators with specific forms to the multilayer edge mixture model
representation, which turns out to reveal some new interpretation of the
evaluators. The flexibility and performance on different networks of the
proposed model are illustrated with applications on a series of benchmark
networks.

 <dc:description>  A central problem in analyzing networks is partitioning them into modules or
communities. One of the best tools for this is the stochastic block model,
which clusters vertices into blocks with statistically homogeneous pattern of
links. Despite its flexibility and popularity, there has been a lack of
principled statistical model selection criteria for the stochastic block model.
Here we propose a Bayesian framework for choosing the number of blocks as well
as comparing it to the more elaborate degree- corrected block models,
ultimately leading to a universal model selection framework capable of
comparing multiple modeling combinations. We will also investigate its
connection to the minimum description length principle.

 <dc:description>  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the problem of decomposing a given
nonnegative $n \times m$ matrix $M$ into a product of a nonnegative $n \times
d$ matrix $W$ and a nonnegative $d \times m$ matrix $H$. Restricted NMF
requires in addition that the column spaces of $M$ and $W$ coincide. Finding
the minimal inner dimension $d$ is known to be NP-hard, both for NMF and
restricted NMF. We show that restricted NMF is closely related to a question
about the nature of minimal probabilistic automata, posed by Paz in his seminal
1971 textbook. We use this connection to answer Paz's question negatively, thus
falsifying a positive answer claimed in 1974. Furthermore, we investigate
whether a rational matrix $M$ always has a restricted NMF of minimal inner
dimension whose factors $W$ and $H$ are also rational. We show that this holds
for matrices $M$ of rank at most $3$ and we exhibit a rank-$4$ matrix for which
$W$ and $H$ require irrational entries.

 <dc:title>A Unifying Framework for Gaussian Process Pseudo-Point Approximations

 <dc:description>  Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible distributions over functions that
enable high-level assumptions about unknown functions to be encoded in a
parsimonious, flexible and general way. Although elegant, the application of
GPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when
data are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models.
Consequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the
last 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a
small set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper, we
develop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation
Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number of these pseudo-point
approximations. Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this area, the
new framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference
(variational free-energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing
approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In this way, all
of approximation is performed at `inference time' rather than at `modelling
time' resolving awkward philosophical and empirical questions that trouble
previous approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework includes
new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform current approaches on
regression and classification tasks.

 <dc:title>On the Degrees of Freedom of SISO X-networks with Synergistic
  Alternating Channel State Information at transmitters</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider the two-user single-input single-output (SISO)
X-channel and $K$-user SISO X-network in fast fading environment. It is assumed
that the transmitters have access to synergistic alternating channel state
information (CSI). Specifically, the CSIT alternates between three states,
namely, perfect, delayed and no-CSIT, in a certain manner to enable these
states to work together cooperatively. These states are associated with
fractions of time denoted by $\lambda_P$, $\lambda_D$ \text{and} $\lambda_N$,
respectively. For the two-user $X$-channel, simple upper bound is developed to
prove the tightness of the achievability result of $4/3$ DoF under a certain
distribution of the availability of three CSIT states for
$\Lambda(\lambda_P=1/3, \lambda_D= 1/3, \lambda_N=1/3)$. For the $K$-user
$X$-network, it is shown that the sum Degrees of freedom (DoF) is at least
$2K/(K + 1)$, using two-phase transmission schemes over finite symbols channel
extension and under the same distribution of the availability of
$\Lambda(\lambda_P=1/3, \lambda_D= 1/3, \lambda_N=1/3)$.This achievability
result, can be considered as a tight lower bound, coincides with the best lower
bound known for the same network but with partial output feedback in stead of
alternating CSIT. Hence, we show that the role of synergistic alternating CSIT
with distribution $\Lambda(1/3,1/3,1/3)$ is equivalent to the partial output
feedback. Also, this lower bound is strictly better than the best lower bound
known for the case of delayed CSI assumption for all values of $K$. All the
proposed transmission schemes are based on two phases transmission strategy,
namely, interference creation and interference resurrection, which exploit the
synergy of instantaneous CSI and delay CSIT to retrospectively align
interference in the subsequent channel uses.

 <dc:title>Learning Sensor Multiplexing Design through Back-propagation</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chakrabarti, Ayan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent progress on many imaging and vision tasks has been driven by the use
of deep feed-forward neural networks, which are trained by propagating
gradients of a loss defined on the final output, back through the network up to
the first layer that operates directly on the image. We propose
back-propagating one step further---to learn camera sensor designs jointly with
networks that carry out inference on the images they capture. In this paper, we
specifically consider the design and inference problems in a typical color
camera---where the sensor is able to measure only one color channel at each
pixel location, and computational inference is required to reconstruct a full
color image. We learn the camera sensor's color multiplexing pattern by
encoding it as layer whose learnable weights determine which color channel,
from among a fixed set, will be measured at each location. These weights are
jointly trained with those of a reconstruction network that operates on the
corresponding sensor measurements to produce a full color image. Our network
achieves significant improvements in accuracy over the traditional Bayer
pattern used in most color cameras. It automatically learns to employ a sparse
color measurement approach similar to that of a recent design, and moreover,
improves upon that design by learning an optimal layout for these measurements.

 <dc:description>  Bayesian optimization has become a successful tool for hyperparameter
optimization of machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or
deep neural networks. Despite its success, for large datasets, training and
validating a single configuration often takes hours, days, or even weeks, which
limits the achievable performance. To accelerate hyperparameter optimization,
we propose a generative model for the validation error as a function of
training set size, which is learned during the optimization process and allows
exploration of preliminary configurations on small subsets, by extrapolating to
the full dataset. We construct a Bayesian optimization procedure, dubbed
Fabolas, which models loss and training time as a function of dataset size and
automatically trades off high information gain about the global optimum against
computational cost. Experiments optimizing support vector machines and deep
neural networks show that Fabolas often finds high-quality solutions 10 to 100
times faster than other state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods or the
recently proposed bandit strategy Hyperband.

 <dc:description>  A single color image can contain many cues informative towards different
aspects of local geometric structure. We approach the problem of monocular
depth estimation by using a neural network to produce a mid-level
representation that summarizes these cues. This network is trained to
characterize local scene geometry by predicting, at every image location, depth
derivatives of different orders, orientations and scales. However, instead of a
single estimate for each derivative, the network outputs probability
distributions that allow it to express confidence about some coefficients, and
ambiguity about others. Scene depth is then estimated by harmonizing this
overcomplete set of network predictions, using a globalization procedure that
finds a single consistent depth map that best matches all the local derivative
distributions. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through evaluation
on the NYU v2 depth data set.

 <dc:description>  The last years have seen a steep rise in data generation worldwide, with the
development and widespread adoption of several software projects targeting the
Big Data paradigm. Many companies currently engage in Big Data analytics as
part of their core business activities, nonetheless there are no tools and
techniques to support the design of the underlying hardware configuration
backing such systems. In particular, the focus in this report is set on Cloud
deployed clusters, which represent a cost-effective alternative to on premises
installations. We propose a novel tool implementing a battery of optimization
and prediction techniques integrated so as to efficiently assess several
alternative resource configurations, in order to determine the minimum cost
cluster deployment satisfying QoS constraints. Further, the experimental
campaign conducted on real systems shows the validity and relevance of the
proposed method.

 <dc:description>  We provide new query complexity separations against sensitivity for total
Boolean functions: a power $3$ separation between deterministic (and even
randomized or quantum) query complexity and sensitivity, and a power $2.22$
separation between certificate complexity and sensitivity. We get these
separations by using a new connection between sensitivity and a seemingly
unrelated measure called one-sided unambiguous certificate complexity
($UC_{min}$). We also show that $UC_{min}$ is lower-bounded by fractional block
sensitivity, which means we cannot use these techniques to get a
super-quadratic separation between $bs(f)$ and $s(f)$. We also provide a
quadratic separation between the tree-sensitivity and decision tree complexity
of Boolean functions, disproving a conjecture of Gopalan, Servedio, Tal, and
Wigderson (CCC 2016).
  Along the way, we give a power $1.22$ separation between certificate
complexity and one-sided unambiguous certificate complexity, improving the
power $1.128$ separation due to G\&quot;o\&quot;os (FOCS 2015). As a consequence, we
obtain an improved $\Omega(\log^{1.22} n)$ lower-bound on the
co-nondeterministic communication complexity of the Clique vs. Independent Set
problem.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, stable and &quot;low-diffusive&quot; multidimensional interface
capturing (IC) schemes using slope limiters are discussed. It is known that
direction-by-direction slope-limited MUSCL schemes create geometrical artifacts
and thus return a poor accuracy. We here focus on this particular issue and
show that the reconstruction of gradient directions are an important factor of
accuracy. The use of a multidimensional limiting process (MLP) added with an
adequate time integration scheme leads to an artifact-free and instability-free
interface capturing (IC) approach. Numerical experiments like the reference
Kothe-Rider forward-backward advection case show the accuracy of the approach.
We also show that the approach can be extended to the more complex compressible
multimaterial hydrodynamics case, with potentially an arbitrary number of
fluids. We also believe that this approach is appropriate for
multicore/manycore architecture because of its SIMD feature, which may be
another asset compared to interface reconstruction approaches.

 <dc:description>  While the channel capacity reflects a theoretical upper bound on the
achievable information transmission rate in the limit of infinitely many bits,
it does not characterise the information transfer of a given encoding routine
with finitely many bits. In this note, we characterise the quality of a code
(i. e. a given encoding routine) by an upper bound on the expected minimum
error probability that can be achieved when using this code. We show that for
equientropic channels this upper bound is minimal for codes with maximal
marginal entropy. As an instructive example we show for the additive white
Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel that random coding---also a capacity achieving
code---indeed maximises the marginal entropy in the limit of infinite messages.

 <dc:title>Free Deterministic Equivalents for the Analysis of MIMO Multiple Access

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a free deterministic equivalent is proposed for the capacity
analysis of the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) multiple access channel (MAC)
with a more general channel model compared to previous works. Specifically, a
MIMO MAC with one base station (BS) equipped with several distributed antenna
sets is considered. Each link between a user and a BS antenna set forms a
jointly correlated Rician fading channel. The analysis is based on
operator-valued free probability theory, which broadens the range of
applicability of free probability techniques tremendously. By replacing
independent Gaussian random matrices with operator-valued random variables
satisfying certain operator-valued freeness relations, the free deterministic
equivalent of the considered channel Gram matrix is obtained. The Shannon
transform of the free deterministic equivalent is derived, which provides an
approximate expression for the ergodic input-output mutual information of the
channel. The sum-rate capacity achieving input covariance matrices are also
derived based on the approximate ergodic input-output mutual information. The
free deterministic equivalent results are easy to compute, and simulation
results show that these approximations are numerically accurate and
computationally efficient.

 <dc:title>Generic Instance Search and Re-identification from One Example via

 <dc:description>  This paper aims for generic instance search from one example where the
instance can be an arbitrary object like shoes, not just near-planar and
one-sided instances like buildings and logos. First, we evaluate
state-of-the-art instance search methods on this problem. We observe that what
works for buildings loses its generality on shoes. Second, we propose to use
automatically learned category-specific attributes to address the large
appearance variations present in generic instance search. Searching among
instances from the same category as the query, the category-specific attributes
outperform existing approaches by a large margin on shoes and cars and perform
on par with the state-of-the-art on buildings. Third, we treat person
re-identification as a special case of generic instance search. On the popular
VIPeR dataset, we reach state-of-the-art performance with the same method.
Fourth, we extend our method to search objects without restriction to the
specifically known category. We show that the combination of category-level
information and the category-specific attributes is superior to the alternative
method combining category-level information with low-level features such as
Fisher vector.

 <dc:title>Practitioners' Perspectives on Change Impact Analysis for

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Safety standards prescribe change impact analysis (CIA) during evolution of
safety-critical software systems. Although CIA is a fundamental activity, there
is a lack of empirical studies about how it is performed in practice. We
present a case study on CIA in the context of an evolving automation system,
based on 14 interviews in Sweden and India. Our analysis suggests that
engineers on average spend 50-100 hours on CIA per year, but the effort varies
considerably with the phases of projects. Also, the respondents presented
different connotations to CIA and perceived the importance of CIA differently.
We report the most pressing CIA challenges, and several ideas on how to support
future CIA. However, we show that measuring the effect of such improvement
solutions is non-trivial, as CIA is intertwined with other development
activities. While this paper only reports preliminary results, our work
contributes empirical insights into practical CIA.

 <dc:title>Revenue Maximization in Service Systems with Heterogeneous Customers</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bodas, Tejas</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Manjunath, D.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Science and Game Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we consider revenue maximization problem for a two server
system in the presence of heterogeneous customers. We assume that the customers
differ in their cost for unit delay and this is modeled as a continuous random
variable with a distribution $F.$ We also assume that each server charges an
admission price to each customer that decide to join its queue. We first
consider the monopoly problem where both the servers belong to a single
operator. The heterogeneity of the customer makes the analysis of the problem
difficult. The difficulty lies in the inability to characterize the equilibrium
queue arrival rates as a function of the admission prices. We provide an
equivalent formulation with the queue arrival rates as the optimization
variable simplifying the analysis for revenue rate maximization for the
monopoly. We then consider the duopoly problem where each server competes with
the other server to maximize its revenue rate. For the duopoly problem, the
interest is to obtain the set of admission prices satisfying the Nash
equilibrium conditions. While the problem is in general difficult to analyze,
we consider the special case when the two servers are identical. For such a
duopoly system, we obtain the necessary condition for existence of symmetric
Nash equilibrium of the admission prices. The knowledge of the distribution $F$
characterizing the heterogeneity of the customers is necessary to solve the
monopoly and the duopoly problem. However, for most practical scenarios, the
functional form of $F$ may not be known to the system operator and in such
cases, the revenue maximizing prices cannot be determined. In the last part of
the paper, we provide a simple method to estimate the distribution $F$ by
suitably varying the admission prices. We illustrate the method with some
numerical examples.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we prove a conjecture published in 1989 and also partially
address an open problem announced at the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT)
2015. With no unrealistic assumption, we first prove the following statements
for the squared loss function of deep linear neural networks with any depth and
any widths: 1) the function is non-convex and non-concave, 2) every local
minimum is a global minimum, 3) every critical point that is not a global
minimum is a saddle point, and 4) there exist &quot;bad&quot; saddle points (where the
Hessian has no negative eigenvalue) for the deeper networks (with more than
three layers), whereas there is no bad saddle point for the shallow networks
(with three layers). Moreover, for deep nonlinear neural networks, we prove the
same four statements via a reduction to a deep linear model under the
independence assumption adopted from recent work. As a result, we present an
instance, for which we can answer the following question: how difficult is it
to directly train a deep model in theory? It is more difficult than the
classical machine learning models (because of the non-convexity), but not too
difficult (because of the nonexistence of poor local minima). Furthermore, the
mathematically proven existence of bad saddle points for deeper models would
suggest a possible open problem. We note that even though we have advanced the
theoretical foundations of deep learning and non-convex optimization, there is
still a gap between theory and practice.

 <dc:description>  Quality evaluation of image segmentation algorithms are still subject of
debate and research. Currently, there is no generic metric that could be
applied to any algorithm reliably. This article contains an evaluation for the
PSRN (Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio) as a metric which has been used to evaluate
threshold level selection as well as the number of thresholds in the case of
multi-level segmentation. The results obtained in this study suggest that the
PSNR is not an adequate quality measurement for segmentation algorithms.

 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm for model-based reinforcement learning that combines
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) with random roll-outs and stochastic
optimization for policy learning. The BNNs are trained by minimizing
$\alpha$-divergences, allowing us to capture complicated statistical patterns
in the transition dynamics, e.g. multi-modality and heteroskedasticity, which
are usually missed by other common modeling approaches. We illustrate the
performance of our method by solving a challenging benchmark where model-based
approaches usually fail and by obtaining promising results in a real-world
scenario for controlling a gas turbine.

 <dc:description>  We propose an interactive multimodal framework for language learning. Instead
of being passively exposed to large amounts of natural text, our learners
(implemented as feed-forward neural networks) engage in cooperative referential
games starting from a tabula rasa setup, and thus develop their own language
from the need to communicate in order to succeed at the game. Preliminary
experiments provide promising results, but also suggest that it is important to
ensure that agents trained in this way do not develop an adhoc communication
code only effective for the game they are playing

 <dc:description>  We introduce the study of fairness in multi-armed bandit problems. Our
fairness definition can be interpreted as demanding that given a pool of
applicants (say, for college admission or mortgages), a worse applicant is
never favored over a better one, despite a learning algorithm's uncertainty
over the true payoffs. We prove results of two types.
  First, in the important special case of the classic stochastic bandits
problem (i.e., in which there are no contexts), we provide a provably fair
algorithm based on &quot;chained&quot; confidence intervals, and provide a cumulative
regret bound with a cubic dependence on the number of arms. We further show
that any fair algorithm must have such a dependence. When combined with regret
bounds for standard non-fair algorithms such as UCB, this proves a strong
separation between fair and unfair learning, which extends to the general
contextual case.
  In the general contextual case, we prove a tight connection between fairness
and the KWIK (Knows What It Knows) learning model: a KWIK algorithm for a class
of functions can be transformed into a provably fair contextual bandit
algorithm, and conversely any fair contextual bandit algorithm can be
transformed into a KWIK learning algorithm. This tight connection allows us to
provide a provably fair algorithm for the linear contextual bandit problem with
a polynomial dependence on the dimension, and to show (for a different class of
functions) a worst-case exponential gap in regret between fair and non-fair
learning algorithms

 <dc:description>  Motivated by an application of eliciting users' preferences, we investigate
the problem of learning hemimetrics, i.e., pairwise distances among a set of
$n$ items that satisfy triangle inequalities and non-negativity constraints. In
our application, the (asymmetric) distances quantify private costs a user
incurs when substituting one item by another. We aim to learn these distances
(costs) by asking the users whether they are willing to switch from one item to
another for a given incentive offer. Without exploiting structural constraints
of the hemimetric polytope, learning the distances between each pair of items
requires $\Theta(n^2)$ queries. We propose an active learning algorithm that
substantially reduces this sample complexity by exploiting the structural
constraints on the version space of hemimetrics. Our proposed algorithm
achieves provably-optimal sample complexity for various instances of the task.
For example, when the items are embedded into $K$ tight clusters, the sample
complexity of our algorithm reduces to $O(n K)$. Extensive experiments on a
restaurant recommendation data set support the conclusions of our theoretical
analysis.

 <dc:description>  Auto-Encoders are unsupervised models that aim to learn patterns from
observed data by minimizing a reconstruction cost. The useful representations
learned are often found to be sparse and distributed. On the other hand,
compressed sensing and sparse coding assume a data generating process, where
the observed data is generated from some true latent signal source, and try to
recover the corresponding signal from measurements. Looking at auto-encoders
from this \textit{signal recovery perspective} enables us to have a more
coherent view of these techniques. In this paper, in particular, we show that
the \textit{true} hidden representation can be approximately recovered if the
weight matrices are highly incoherent with unit $ \ell^{2} $ row length and the
bias vectors takes the value (approximately) equal to the negative of the data
mean. The recovery also becomes more and more accurate as the sparsity in
hidden signals increases. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that
auto-encoders are capable of recovering the data generating dictionary when
only data samples are given.

 <dc:description>  Deep residual networks were shown to be able to scale up to thousands of
layers and still have improving performance. However, each fraction of a
percent of improved accuracy costs nearly doubling the number of layers, and so
training very deep residual networks has a problem of diminishing feature
reuse, which makes these networks very slow to train. To tackle these problems,
in this paper we conduct a detailed experimental study on the architecture of
ResNet blocks, based on which we propose a novel architecture where we decrease
depth and increase width of residual networks. We call the resulting network
structures wide residual networks (WRNs) and show that these are far superior
over their commonly used thin and very deep counterparts. For example, we
demonstrate that even a simple 16-layer-deep wide residual network outperforms
in accuracy and efficiency all previous deep residual networks, including
thousand-layer-deep networks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on CIFAR,
SVHN, COCO, and significant improvements on ImageNet. Our code and models are
available at https://github.com/szagoruyko/wide-residual-networks

 <dc:description>  We study optimization of finite sums of geodesically smooth functions on
Riemannian manifolds. Although variance reduction techniques for optimizing
finite-sums have witnessed tremendous attention in the recent years, existing
work is limited to vector space problems. We introduce Riemannian SVRG (RSVRG),
a new variance reduced Riemannian optimization method. We analyze RSVRG for
both geodesically convex and nonconvex (smooth) functions. Our analysis reveals
that RSVRG inherits advantages of the usual SVRG method, but with factors
depending on curvature of the manifold that influence its convergence. To our
knowledge, RSVRG is the first provably fast stochastic Riemannian method.
Moreover, our paper presents the first non-asymptotic complexity analysis
(novel even for the batch setting) for nonconvex Riemannian optimization. Our
results have several implications; for instance, they offer a Riemannian
perspective on variance reduced PCA, which promises a short, transparent
convergence analysis.

 <dc:description>  Generative state estimators based on probabilistic filters and smoothers are
one of the most popular classes of state estimators for robots and autonomous
vehicles. However, generative models have limited capacity to handle rich
sensory observations, such as camera images, since they must model the entire
distribution over sensor readings. Discriminative models do not suffer from
this limitation, but are typically more complex to train as latent variable
models for state estimation. We present an alternative approach where the
parameters of the latent state distribution are directly optimized as a
deterministic computation graph, resulting in a simple and effective gradient
descent algorithm for training discriminative state estimators. We show that
this procedure can be used to train state estimators that use complex input,
such as raw camera images, which must be processed using expressive nonlinear
function approximators such as convolutional neural networks. Our model can be
viewed as a type of recurrent neural network, and the connection to
probabilistic filtering allows us to design a network architecture that is
particularly well suited for state estimation. We evaluate our approach on
synthetic tracking task with raw image inputs and on the visual odometry task
in the KITTI dataset. The results show significant improvement over both
standard generative approaches and regular recurrent neural networks.

 <dc:description>  In recent work by Mossel and Ross, it was asked how large $q$ has to be for a
random jigsaw puzzle with $q$ different shapes of &quot;jigs&quot; to have exactly one
solution. The jigs are assumed symmetric in the sense that two jigs of the same
type always fit together. They showed that for $q=o(n^{2/3})$ there are a.a.s.
multiple solutions, and for $q=\omega(n^2)$ there is a.a.s. exactly one. The
latter bound has since been improved to $q\geq n^{1+\varepsilon}$ independently
by Nenadov, Pfister and Steger, and by Bordernave, Feige and Mossel. Both
groups further remark that for $q=o(n)$ there are a.a.s. duplicate pieces in
the puzzle. In this paper, we show that such puzzle a.a.s. has multiple
solutions whenever $q\leq \frac{2}{\sqrt{e}}\,n - \omega(\log_2 n)$, even if
permuting identical pieces is not considered changing the solution. We further
give some remarks about the number of solutions, and the probability of a
unique solution in this regime.

 <dc:description>  Each human genome is a 3 billion base pair set of encoding instructions.
Decoding the genome using deep learning fundamentally differs from most tasks,
as we do not know the full structure of the data and therefore cannot design
architectures to suit it. As such, architectures that fit the structure of
genomics should be learned not prescribed. Here, we develop a novel search
algorithm, applicable across domains, that discovers an optimal architecture
which simultaneously learns general genomic patterns and identifies the most
important sequence motifs in predicting functional genomic outcomes. The
architectures we find using this algorithm succeed at using only RNA expression
data to predict gene regulatory structure, learn human-interpretable
visualizations of key sequence motifs, and surpass state-of-the-art results on
benchmark genomics challenges.

 <dc:description>  A core challenge for an agent learning to interact with the world is to
predict how its actions affect objects in its environment. Many existing
methods for learning the dynamics of physical interactions require labeled
object information. However, to scale real-world interaction learning to a
variety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data becomes increasingly
impractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels, we develop
an action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixel
motion, by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames.
Because our model explicitly predicts motion, it is partially invariant to
object appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. To
explore video prediction for real-world interactive agents, we also introduce a
dataset of 59,000 robot interactions involving pushing motions, including a
test set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate prediction of videos
conditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a &quot;visual
imagination&quot; of different futures based on different courses of action. Our
experiments show that our proposed method produces more accurate video
predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively, when compared to prior
methods.

 <dc:title>Complexity of Consistent Query Answering in Databases under

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A database D may be inconsistent wrt a given set IC of integrity constraints.
Consistent Query Answering (CQA) is the problem of computing from D the answers
to a query that are consistent wrt IC . Consistent answers are invariant under
all the repairs of D, i.e. the consistent instances that minimally depart from
D. Three classes of repair have been considered in the literature: those that
minimize set-theoretically the set of tuples in the symmetric difference; those
that minimize the changes of attribute values, and those that minimize the
cardinality of the set of tuples in the symmetric difference. The latter class
has not been systematically investigated. In this paper we obtain algorithmic
and complexity theoretic results for CQA under this cardinality-based repair
semantics. We do this in the usual, static setting, but also in a dynamic
framework where a consistent database is affected by a sequence of updates,
which may make it inconsistent. We also establish comparative results with the
other two kinds of repairs in the dynamic case.

 <dc:description>  We study the pure exploration problem subject to a matroid constraint
(Best-Basis) in a stochastic multi-armed bandit game. In a Best-Basis instance,
we are given $n$ stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as
a matroid $\mathcal{M}$ over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean of
its reward distribution. Our goal is to identify a basis of $\mathcal{M}$ with
the maximum total weight, using as few samples as possible.
  The problem is a significant generalization of the best arm identification
problem and the top-$k$ arm identification problem, which have attracted
significant attentions in recent years. We study both the exact and PAC
versions of Best-Basis, and provide algorithms with nearly-optimal sample
complexities for these versions. Our results generalize and/or improve on
several previous results for the top-$k$ arm identification problem and the
combinatorial pure exploration problem when the combinatorial constraint is a
matroid.

 <dc:description>  On today's Web, users trade access to their private data for content and
services. Advertising sustains the business model of many websites and
applications. Efficient and successful advertising relies on predicting users'
actions and tastes to suggest a range of products to buy. It follows that,
while surfing the Web users leave traces regarding their identity in the form
of activity patterns and unstructured data. We analyse how advertising networks
build user footprints and how the suggested advertising reacts to changes in
the user behaviour.

 <dc:description>  Since 1870s, scientists have been taking deep insight into Lie groups and Lie
algebras. With the development of Lie theory, Lie groups have got profound
significance in many branches of mathematics and physics. In Lie theory,
exponential mapping between Lie groups and Lie algebras plays a crucial role.
Exponential mapping is the mechanism for passing information from Lie algebras
to Lie groups. Since many computations are performed much more easily by
employing Lie algebras, exponential mapping is indispensable while studying Lie
groups. In this paper, we first put forward a novel idea of designing
cryptosystem based on Lie groups and Lie algebras. Besides, combing with
discrete logarithm problem(DLP) and factorization problem(FP), we propose some
new intractable assumptions based on exponential mapping. Moreover, in analog
with Boyen's sceme(AsiaCrypt 2007), we disign a public key encryption scheme
based on non-Abelian factorization problems in Lie Groups. Finally, our
proposal is proved to be IND-CCA2 secure in the random oracle model.

 <dc:description>  We consider the closely related problems of maximizing a submodular function
subject to a cardinality constraint and that of maximizing the sum of
submodular functions subject to a partition matroid contraint. Motivated by
applications in team selection, we focus on settings where the function(s) can
be expressed as the expected value of a symmetric submodular value function of
a set of independent random variables with given prior distributions, and
where, the algorithm designer may not be able to access the submodular function
by means of value oracle queries. We consider a novel approach towards
submodular maximization known as test score algorithms whose functioning is
restricted to computing a test score for each element of the ground set and
using these test scores to estimate the outputs of oracle calls. Our main
contributions are test score algorithms that yield constant factor and
logarithmic approximations respectively for the two problems along with new
insights pertaining to function sketching. We also identify necessary and
sufficient conditions under which test score algorithms provide constant-factor
approximations for the submodular maximization problem. We evaluate the quality
of our algorithms for team selection using data from a popular online labour
platform for software development.

 <dc:title>Kernel-based Reconstruction of Graph Signals</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A number of applications in engineering, social sciences, physics, and
biology involve inference over networks. In this context, graph signals are
widely encountered as descriptors of vertex attributes or features in
graph-structured data. Estimating such signals in all vertices given noisy
observations of their values on a subset of vertices has been extensively
analyzed in the literature of signal processing on graphs (SPoG). This paper
advocates kernel regression as a framework generalizing popular SPoG modeling
and reconstruction and expanding their capabilities. Formulating signal
reconstruction as a regression task on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of
graph signals permeates benefits from statistical learning, offers fresh
insights, and allows for estimators to leverage richer forms of prior
information than existing alternatives. A number of SPoG notions such as
bandlimitedness, graph filters, and the graph Fourier transform are naturally
accommodated in the kernel framework. Additionally, this paper capitalizes on
the so-called representer theorem to devise simpler versions of existing
Thikhonov regularized estimators, and offers a novel probabilistic
interpretation of kernel methods on graphs based on graphical models. Motivated
by the challenges of selecting the bandwidth parameter in SPoG estimators or
the kernel map in kernel-based methods, the present paper further proposes two
multi-kernel approaches with complementary strengths. Whereas the first enables
estimation of the unknown bandwidth of bandlimited signals, the second allows
for efficient graph filter selection. Numerical tests with synthetic as well as
real data demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods relative to
state-of-the-art alternatives.

 <dc:description>  We introduce group-to-group anycast (g2g-anycast), a network design problem
of substantial practical importance and considerable generality. Given a
collection of groups and requirements for directed connectivity from source
groups to destination groups, the solution network must contain, for each
requirement, an omni-directional down-link broadcast, centered at any node of
the source group, called the ball; the ball must contain some node from the
destination group in the requirement and all such destination nodes in the ball
must aggregate into a tree directed towards the source, called the funnel-tree.
The solution network is a collection of balls along with the funnel-trees they
contain. g2g-anycast models DBS (Digital Broadcast Satellite), Cable TV systems
and drone swarms. It generalizes several well known network design problems
including minimum energy unicast, multicast, broadcast, Steiner-tree,
Steiner-forest and Group-Steiner tree. Our main achievement is an $O(\log^4 n)$
approximation, counterbalanced by an $\log^{(2-\epsilon)}n$ hardness of
approximation, for general weights. Given the applicability to wireless
communication, we present a scalable and easily implemented $O(\log n)$
approximation algorithm, Cover-and-Grow for fixed-dimensional Euclidean space
with path-loss exponent at least 2.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper develops two heuristic algorithms to solve graph isomorphism,
using free energy encoding. The first algorithm uses four types of encoding
refinement techniques such that every graph can be distinguished by a canonical
number computed by the algorithm. The second algorithm injects energy into the
graph to conduct individualization such that the correspondence relation
between a pair of isomorphic graphs can be found. The core principle behind the
two algorithms is encoding discrete structures as real numbers. A large set of
experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a free energy theory from physics including the
variational principles for automata and languages and also provides algorithms
to compute the energy as well as efficient algorithms for estimating the
nondeterminism in a nondeterministic finite automaton. This theory is then used
as a foundation to define a semantic similarity metric for automata and
languages. Since automata are a fundamental model for all modern programs while
languages are a fundamental model for the programs' behaviors, we believe that
the theory and the metric developed in this paper can be further used for
real-word programs as well.

 <dc:description>  We add a small increment to understanding the notion of Primary Source
Knowledge, knowledge that the non-expert and the citizen can acquire by
assiduously reading the primary scientific journal literature without being
embedded in the cultural life of the corresponding technical specialty. This
comes from exposing four papers to the automated computer filters used by the
physics preprint server arXiv. These filters are used to flag papers in need of
further review by human assessors before being promulgated on the server;
papers not flagged by the algorithm are generally posted on arXiv without
further review. After the filtering, human moderators decide whether papers
should be posted based on a relatively low bar of whether they are of interest,
relevance and value to the research communities that populate arXiv.

 <dc:description>  We construct a deep portfolio theory. By building on Markowitz's classic
risk-return trade-off, we develop a self-contained four-step routine of encode,
calibrate, validate and verify to formulate an automated and general portfolio
selection process. At the heart of our algorithm are deep hierarchical
compositions of portfolios constructed in the encoding step. The calibration
step then provides multivariate payouts in the form of deep hierarchical
portfolios that are designed to target a variety of objective functions. The
validate step trades-off the amount of regularization used in the encode and
calibrate steps. The verification step uses a cross validation approach to
trace out an ex post deep portfolio efficient frontier. We demonstrate all four
steps of our portfolio theory numerically.

 <dc:description>  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a versatile tool
for solving a wide range of constrained optimization problems, with
differentiable or non-differentiable objective functions. Unfortunately, its
performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, which makes ADMM often
unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness
of ADMM by proposing a method to adaptively tune the penalty parameters to
achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm,
inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient
descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial
stepsize and problem scaling.

 <dc:description>  Large receptive field and dense prediction are both important for achieving
high accuracy in pixel labeling tasks such as semantic segmentation. These two
properties, however, contradict with each other. A pooling layer (with stride
2) quadruples the receptive field size but reduces the number of predictions to
25\%. Some existing methods lead to dense predictions using computations that
are not equivalent to the original model. In this paper, we propose the
equivalent convolution (eConv) and equivalent pooling (ePool) layers, leading
to predictions that are both dense and equivalent to the baseline CNN model.
Dense prediction models learned using eConv and ePool can transfer the baseline
CNN's parameters as a starting point, and can inverse transfer the learned
parameters in a dense model back to the original one, which has both fast
testing speed and high accuracy. The proposed eConv and ePool layers have
achieved higher accuracy than baseline CNN in various tasks, including semantic
segmentation, object localization, image categorization and apparent age
estimation, not only in those tasks requiring dense pixel labeling.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of learning the underlying graph of an unknown Ising
model on p spins from a collection of i.i.d. samples generated from the model.
We suggest a new estimator that is computationally efficient and requires a
number of samples that is near-optimal with respect to previously established
information-theoretic lower-bound. Our statistical estimator has a physical
interpretation in terms of &quot;interaction screening&quot;. The estimator is consistent
and is efficiently implemented using convex optimization. We prove that with
appropriate regularization, the estimator recovers the underlying graph using a
number of samples that is logarithmic in the system size p and exponential in
the maximum coupling-intensity and maximum node-degree.

 <dc:description>  In Chile, does not exist an independent entity that publishes quantitative or
qualitative surveys to understand the traditional media environment and its
adaptation on the Social Web. Nowadays, Chilean newsreaders are increasingly
using social web platforms as their primary source of information, among which
Twitter plays a central role. Historical media and pure players are developing
different strategies to increase their audience and influence on this platform.
In this article, we propose a methodology based on data mining techniques to
provide a first level of analysis of the new Chilean media environment. We use
a crawling technique to mine news streams of 37 different Chilean media
actively presents on Twitter and propose several indicators to compare them. We
analyze their volumes of production, their potential audience, and using NLP
techniques, we explore the content of their production: their editorial line
and their geographic coverage.

 <dc:description>  Despite having high accuracy, neural nets have been shown to be susceptible
to adversarial examples, where a small perturbation to an input can cause it to
become mislabeled. We propose metrics for measuring the robustness of a neural
net and devise a novel algorithm for approximating these metrics based on an
encoding of robustness as a linear program. We show how our metrics can be used
to evaluate the robustness of deep neural nets with experiments on the MNIST
and CIFAR-10 datasets. Our algorithm generates more informative estimates of
robustness metrics compared to estimates based on existing algorithms.
Furthermore, we show how existing approaches to improving robustness &quot;overfit&quot;
to adversarial examples generated using a specific algorithm. Finally, we show
that our techniques can be used to additionally improve neural net robustness
both according to the metrics that we propose, but also according to previously
proposed metrics.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter for sets
of trajectories. The resulting filter, which is referred to as trajectory
probability density filter (TPHD), is capable of estimating trajectories in a
principled way without requiring to evaluate all measurement-to-target
association hypotheses. As the PHD filter, the TPHD filter is based on
recursively obtaining the best Poisson approximation to the multitrajectory
filtering density in the sense of minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
We also propose a Gaussian mixture implementation of the TPHD recursion, the
Gaussian mixture TPHD (GMTPHD), and a computationally efficient implementation,
the L-scan GMTPHD, which only updates the PDF of the trajectory states of the
last L time steps.

 <dc:description>  In Computer-Supported learning, monitoring and engaging a group of learners
is a complex task for teachers, especially when learners are working
collaboratively: Are my students motivated? What kind of progress are they
making? Should I intervene? Is my communication and the didactic design adapted
to my students? Our hypothesis is that the analysis of natural language
interactions between students, and between students and teachers, provide very
valuable information and could be used to produce qualitative indicators to
help teachers' decisions. We develop an automatic approach in three steps (1)
to explore the discursive functions of messages in a CSCL platform, (2) to
classify the messages automatically and (3) to evaluate correlations between
discursive attitudes and other variables linked to the learning activity.
Results tend to show that some types of discourse are correlated with a notion
of Progress on the learning activities and the importance of emotive
participation from the Teacher.

 <dc:description>  This work is motivated by the engineering task of achieving a near
state-of-the-art face recognition on a minimal computing budget running on an
embedded system. Our main technical contribution centers around a novel
training method, called Multibatch, for similarity learning, i.e., for the task
of generating an invariant &quot;face signature&quot; through training pairs of &quot;same&quot;
and &quot;not-same&quot; face images. The Multibatch method first generates signatures
for a mini-batch of $k$ face images and then constructs an unbiased estimate of
the full gradient by relying on all $k^2-k$ pairs from the mini-batch. We prove
that the variance of the Multibatch estimator is bounded by $O(1/k^2)$, under
some mild conditions. In contrast, the standard gradient estimator that relies
on random $k/2$ pairs has a variance of order $1/k$. The smaller variance of
the Multibatch estimator significantly speeds up the convergence rate of
stochastic gradient descent. Using the Multibatch method we train a deep
convolutional neural network that achieves an accuracy of $98.2\%$ on the LFW
benchmark, while its prediction runtime takes only $30$msec on a single ARM
Cortex A9 core. Furthermore, the entire training process took only 12 hours on
a single Titan X GPU.

 <dc:description>  Matrix completion is a basic machine learning problem that has wide
applications, especially in collaborative filtering and recommender systems.
Simple non-convex optimization algorithms are popular and effective in
practice. Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithms
converge from a good initial point, it remains unclear why random or arbitrary
initialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convex
objective function for \textit{positive semidefinite} matrix completion has no
spurious local minima --- all local minima must also be global. Therefore, many
popular optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent can
provably solve positive semidefinite matrix completion with \textit{arbitrary}
initialization in polynomial time. The result can be generalized to the setting
when the observed entries contain noise. We believe that our main proof
strategy can be useful for understanding geometric properties of other
statistical problems involving partial or noisy observations.

$\mathbb{S}_{n}(\mathbb{F}_{q})$, the space of $n\times n$ symmetric matrices
over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Using this method, we obtain two classes of binary LDPC
codes, $\cal{C}(n,q)$ and $\cal{C}^{T}(n,q)$, both of which have grith $8$.
Then both the minimum distance and the stopping distance of each class are
investigated. It is shown that the minimum distance and the stopping distance
of $\cal{C}^{T}(n,q)$ are both $2q$. As for $\cal{C}(n,q)$, we determine the
minimum distance and the stopping distance for some special cases and obtain
the lower bounds for other cases.

 <dc:title>Transferability in Machine Learning: from Phenomena to Black-Box Attacks

 <dc:description>  Many machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples: inputs
that are specially crafted to cause a machine learning model to produce an
incorrect output. Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect
another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were
trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to
perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute
model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to
a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has
further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label
a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even
collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques
using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training
procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks
between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning
model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks
on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19%
misclassification rate) and Google (88.94%) using only 800 queries of the
victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in
general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their
structure.

 <dc:description>  Estimation of an unknown deterministic vector from quantized sensor data is
considered in the presence of spoofing attacks which alter the data presented
to several sensors. Contrary to previous work, a generalized attack model is
employed which manipulates the data using transformations with arbitrary
functional forms determined by some attack parameters whose values are unknown
to the attacked system. For the first time, necessary and sufficient conditions
are provided under which the transformations provide a guaranteed attack
performance in terms of Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) regardless of the processing the
estimation system employs, thus defining a highly desirable attack.
Interestingly, these conditions imply that, for any such attack when the
attacked sensors can be perfectly identified by the estimation system, either
the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for jointly estimating the desired and
attack parameters is singular or that the attacked system is unable to improve
the CRB for the desired vector parameter through this joint estimation even
though the joint FIM is nonsingular. It is shown that it is always possible to
construct such a highly desirable attack by properly employing a sufficiently
large dimension attack vector parameter relative to the number of quantization
levels employed, which was not observed previously. To illustrate the theory in
a concrete way, we also provide some numerical results which corroborate that
under the highly desirable attack, attacked data is not useful in reducing the
CRB.

 <dc:description>  Given a set of numbers, the $k$-SUM problem asks for a subset of $k$ numbers
that sums to zero. When the numbers are integers, the time and space complexity
of $k$-SUM is generally studied in the word-RAM model; when the numbers are
reals, the complexity is studied in the real-RAM model, and space is measured
by the number of reals held in memory at any point.
  We present a time and space efficient deterministic self-reduction for the
$k$-SUM problem which holds for both models, and has many interesting
consequences. To illustrate:
  * $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2 \lg\lg(n)/\lg(n))$ and space
$O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n \lg(n)}{\lg\lg(n)}}\right)$. In general, any
polylogarithmic-time improvement over quadratic time for $3$-SUM can be
converted into an algorithm with an identical time improvement but low space
complexity as well. * $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2)$ and space
$O(\sqrt n)$, derandomizing an algorithm of Wang.
  * A popular conjecture states that 3-SUM requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the
word-RAM. We show that the 3-SUM Conjecture is in fact equivalent to the
(seemingly weaker) conjecture that every $O(n^{.51})$-space algorithm for
$3$-SUM requires at least $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the word-RAM.
  * For $k \ge 4$, $k$-SUM is in deterministic $O(n^{k - 2 + 2/k})$ time and
$O(\sqrt{n})$ space.

 <dc:description>  EventNet is a large-scale video corpus and event ontology consisting of 500
events associated with event-specific concepts. In order to improve the quality
of the current EventNet, we conduct the following steps and introduce EventNet
version 1.1: (1) manually verify the correctness of event labels for all
videos; (2) remove the YouTube user bias by limiting the maximum number of
videos in each event from the same YouTube user as 3; (3) remove the videos
which are currently not accessible online; (4) remove the video belonging to
multiple event categories. After the above procedure, some events may contain
only a small number of videos, and therefore we crawl more videos for those
events to ensure every event will contain more than 50 videos. Finally,
EventNet version 1.1 contains 67,641 videos, 500 events, and 5,028
event-specific concepts. In addition, we train a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) model for event classification via fine-tuning AlexNet using EventNet
version 1.1. Then we use the trained CNN model to extract FC7 layer feature and
train binary classifiers using linear SVM for each event-specific concept. We
believe this new version of EventNet will significantly facilitate research in
computer vision and multimedia, and will put it online for public downloading
in the future.

 <dc:title>Limitations of Time Resources in Human Relationships Determine Social
  Structures</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>

 <dc:description>  A single human can be involved in a limited number of social relationships,
and the distribution of strengths of such relationships shows significant skew.
This skewness suggests that the costs and benefits of the social interactions
required to bond with others (social grooming) depend on the social
relationship strength: if they involved uniform costs and benefits, the
distribution would not be skew. Here, we show that the cost of social grooming
increases with the social relationship strength, and its gradient determines
the structures of these relationships in society as evident from an analysis of
data from six communication systems. This may be due to an increase in
communication volumes, such as number of characters and duration of calls,
along with an increase in the social relationship strength. We tested this
hypothesis using an individual-based simulation where social grooming costs
were assumed to increase linearly with the social relationship strength; this
is the simplest assumption. The results indicated that this model fitted all
data sets, i.e., it showed an explanation capacity for the phenomenon.
Additionally, an analysis of this simulation suggested that the gradient of
social grooming costs increases the width and shallowness of social
relationships in its communication system.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a novel unified framework called DeepText for text
region proposal generation and text detection in natural images via a fully
convolutional neural network (CNN). First, we propose the inception region
proposal network (Inception-RPN) and design a set of text characteristic prior
bounding boxes to achieve high word recall with only hundred level candidate
proposals. Next, we present a powerful textdetection network that embeds
ambiguous text category (ATC) information and multilevel region-of-interest
pooling (MLRP) for text and non-text classification and accurate localization.
Finally, we apply an iterative bounding box voting scheme to pursue high recall
in a complementary manner and introduce a filtering algorithm to retain the
most suitable bounding box, while removing redundant inner and outer boxes for
each text instance. Our approach achieves an F-measure of 0.83 and 0.85 on the
ICDAR 2011 and 2013 robust text detection benchmarks, outperforming previous
state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  We present a multimodal interaction framework suitable for a human rescuer
that operates in proximity with a set of co-located drones during search
missions. This work is framed in the context of the SHERPA project whose goal
is to develop a mixed ground and aerial robotic platform to support search and
rescue activities in a real-world alpine scenario. Differently from typical
human-drone interaction settings, here the operator is not fully dedicated to
the drones, but involved in search and rescue tasks, hence only able to provide
sparse, incomplete, although high-value, instructions to the robots. This
operative scenario requires a human-interaction framework that supports
multimodal communication along with an effective and natural mixed-initiative
interaction between the human and the robots. In this work, we illustrate the
domain and the proposed multimodal interaction framework discussing the system
at work in a simulated case study.

 <dc:description>  We study robust $H_\infty$ coherent-classical estimation for a class of
physically realizable linear quantum systems with parameter uncertainties. Such
a robust coherent-classical estimator, with or without coherent feedback, can
yield better disturbance-to-error performance than the corresponding robust
purely-classical estimator for an uncertain plant. Moreover, coherent feedback
allows for such a robust coherent-classical estimator to be more robust to
uncertainty in comparison to the robust classical-only estimator.

 <dc:title>Recognizing Simple-Triangle Graphs by Restricted 2-Chain Subgraph Cover</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Takaoka, Asahi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A simple-triangle graph (also known as a PI graph) is the intersection graph
of a family of triangles defined by a point on a horizontal line and an
interval on another horizontal line. The recognition problem for
simple-triangle graphs was a longstanding open problem, and recently a
polynomial-time algorithm has been given [G. B. Mertzios, The Recognition of
Simple-Triangle Graphs and of Linear-Interval Orders is Polynomial, SIAM J.
Discrete Math., 29(3):1150--1185, 2015]. Along with the approach of this paper,
we show a simpler recognition algorithm for simple-triangle graphs. To do this,
we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the following problem: Given a
bipartite graph $G$ and a set $F$ of edges of $G$, find a 2-chain subgraph
cover of $G$ such that one of two chain subgraphs has no edges in $F$.

 <dc:description>  Vehicular communication requires vehicles to self-organize through the
exchange of periodic beacons. Recent analysis on beaconing indicates that the
standards for beaconing restrict the desired performance of vehicular
applications. This situation can be attributed to the quality of the available
transmission medium, persistent change in the traffic situation and the
inability of standards to cope with application requirements. To this end, this
paper is motivated by the classifications and capability evaluations of
existing adaptive beaconing approaches. To begin with, we explore the anatomy
and the performance requirements of beaconing. Then, the beaconing design is
analyzed to introduce a design-based beaconing taxonomy. A survey of the
state-of-the-art is conducted with an emphasis on the salient features of the
beaconing approaches. We also evaluate the capabilities of beaconing approaches
using several key parameters. A comparison among beaconing approaches is
presented, which is based on the architectural and implementation
characteristics. The paper concludes by discussing open challenges in the
field.

 <dc:description>  We consider the Bayesian active learning and experimental design problem,
where the goal is to learn the value of some unknown target variable through a
sequence of informative, noisy tests. In contrast to prior work, we focus on
the challenging, yet practically relevant setting where test outcomes can be
conditionally dependent given the hidden target variable. Under such
assumptions, common heuristics, such as greedily performing tests that maximize
the reduction in uncertainty of the target, often perform poorly. In this
paper, we propose ECED, a novel, computationally efficient active learning
algorithm, and prove strong theoretical guarantees that hold with correlated,
noisy tests. Rather than directly optimizing the prediction error, at each
step, ECED picks the test that maximizes the gain in a surrogate objective,
which takes into account the dependencies between tests. Our analysis relies on
an information-theoretic auxiliary function to track the progress of ECED, and
utilizes adaptive submodularity to attain the near-optimal bound. We
demonstrate strong empirical performance of ECED on two problem instances,
including a Bayesian experimental design task intended to distinguish among
economic theories of how people make risky decisions, and an active preference
learning task via pairwise comparisons.

 <dc:title>Bubbles: a data management approach to create an advanced industrial
  interoperability layer for critical systems development applying reuse

 <dc:creator>Lodwich, Aleksander</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Software Engineering</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The development of critical systems is becoming more and more complex. The
overall tendency is that development costs raise. In order to cut cost of
development, companies are forced to build systems from proven components and
larger new systems from smaller older ones. Respective reuse activities involve
good number of people, tools and processes along different stages of the
development lifecycle which involve large numbers of tools. Some development is
directly planned for reuse. Planned reuse implies excellent knowledge
management and firm governance of reusable items. According to the current
state of the art, there are still practical problems in the two fields, mainly
because the governance and knowledge management is fragmented over the tools of
the toolchain. In our experience, the practical effect of this fragmentation is
that involved ancestor and derivation relationships are often undocumented or
not exploitable. Additionally, useful reuse is almost always dealing with
heterogeneous content which must be transferred from older to newer development
environments. In this process, interoperability proves either as biggest
obstacle or greatest help. In this paper, authors connect the topics
interoperability and knowledge management and propose to seek for ubiquitous
reuse via advanced interoperability features. A single concept from a larger
Technical Interoperability Concept (TIC) with the name bubble is presented.
Bubbles are expected to overcome existing barriers to cost-efficient reuse in
systems and software development lifecycles. That is why, the present paper
introduces and defines bubbles by showing how they simplify application of
repairs and changes and hence contribute to expansion of reuse at reduced cost.

 <dc:description>  In small cell networks, high mobility of users results in frequent handoff
and thus severely restricts the data rate for mobile users. To alleviate this
problem, we propose to use heterogeneous, two-tier network structure where
static users are served by both macro and micro base stations, whereas the
mobile (i.e., moving) users are served only by macro base stations having
larger cells; the idea is to prevent frequent data outage for mobile users due
to handoff. We use the classical two-tier Poisson network model with different
transmit powers (cf [1]), assume independent Poisson process of static users
and doubly stochastic Poisson process of mobile users moving at a constant
speed along infinite straight lines generated by a Poisson line process. Using
stochastic geometry, we calculate the average downlink data rate of the typical
static and mobile (i.e., moving) users, the latter accounted for handoff outage
periods. We consider also the average throughput of these two types of users
defined as their average data rates divided by the mean total number of users
co-served by the same base station. We find that if the density of a
homogeneous network and/or the speed of mobile users is high, it is
advantageous to let the mobile users connect only to some optimal fraction of
BSs to reduce the frequency of handoffs during which the connection is not
assured. If a heterogeneous structure of the network is allowed, one can
further jointly optimize the mean throughput of mobile and static users by
appropriately tuning the powers of micro and macro base stations subject to
some aggregate power constraint ensuring unchanged mean data rates of static
users via the network equivalence property (see [2]).

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces an open, interoperable, and cloud-computing-based
citizen engagement platform for the management of administrative processes of
public administrations, which also increases the engagement of citizens. The
citizen engagement platform is the outcome of a 3-year Italian national project
called PRISMA (Interoperable cloud platforms for smart government). The aim of
the project is to constitute a new model of digital ecosystem that can support
and enable new methods of interaction among public administrations, citizens,
companies, and other stakeholders surrounding cities. The platform has been
defined by the media as a flexible (enable the addition of any kind of
application or service) and open (enable access to open services) Italian
&quot;cloud&quot; that allows public administrations to access to a vast knowledge base
represented as linked open data to be reused by a stakeholder community with
the aim of developing new applications (&quot;Cloud Apps&quot;) tailored to the specific
needs of citizens. The platform has been used by Catania and Syracuse
municipalities, two of the main cities of southern Italy, located in the
Sicilian region. The fully adoption of the platform is rapidly spreading around
the whole region (local developers have already used available application
programming interfaces (APIs) to create additional services for citizens and
administrations) to such an extent that other provinces of Sicily and Italy in
general expressed their interest for its usage. The platform is available
online and, as mentioned above, is open source and provides APIs for full
exploitation.

 <dc:description>  In this study, the optimal jammer placement problem is proposed and analyzed
for wireless localization systems. In particular, the optimal location of a
jammer node is obtained by maximizing the minimum of the Cramer-Rao lower
bounds (CRLBs) for a number of target nodes under location related constraints
for the jammer node. For scenarios with more than two target nodes, theoretical
results are derived to specify conditions under which the jammer node is
located as close to a certain target node as possible, or the optimal location
of the jammer node is determined by two of the target nodes. Also, explicit
expressions are provided for the optimal location of the jammer node in the
presence of two target nodes. In addition, in the absence of distance
constraints for the jammer node, it is proved, for scenarios with more than two
target nodes, that the optimal jammer location lies on the convex hull formed
by the locations of the target nodes and is determined by two or three of the
target nodes, which have equalized CRLBs. Numerical examples are presented to
provide illustrations of the theoretical results in different scenarios.

 <dc:description>  The recent research effort towards defining new communication solutions for
cyber-physical systems (CPS), to guarantee high availability level with limited
cabling costs and complexity, has renewed the interest in ring-based networks.
This topology has been recently used for various networked cyber-physical
systems (Net-CPS), e.g., avionics and automotive, with the implementation of
many Real Time Ethernet (RTE) profiles. A relevant issue for such networks is
to prove timing predictability, a key requirement for safety-critical systems.
We are interested in this paper in event-triggered ring-based networks, which
guarantee high resource utilization efficiency and (re)configuration
flexibility, at the cost of increasing the timing analysis complexity. The
implementation of such a communication scheme on top of a ring topology
actually induces cyclic dependencies, in comparison to time-triggered
solutions. To cope with this arising issue of cyclic dependencies, only few
techniques have been proposed in the literature, mainly based on Network
Calculus framework, and consist in analyzing locally the delay upper bound in
each crossed node, resulting in pessimistic end-to-end delay bounds. Hence, the
main contribution in this paper is enhancing the delay bounds tightness of such
networks, through an innovative global analysis based on Network Calculus,
accounting the flow serialization phenomena along the flow path. An extensive
analysis of such a proposal is conducted herein regarding the accuracy of delay
bounds and its impact on the system performance, i.e., scalability and
resource-efficiency; and the results highlight its outperformance, in
comparison to conventional methods.

 <dc:title>Unbeatable Set Consensus via Topological and Combinatorial Reasoning</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The set consensus problem has played an important role in the study of
distributed systems for over two decades. Indeed, the search for lower bounds
and impossibility results for this problem spawned the topological approach to
distributed computing, which has given rise to new techniques in the design and
analysis of protocols. The design of efficient solutions to set consensus has
also proven to be challenging. In the synchronous crash failure model, the
literature contains a sequence of solutions to set consensus, each improving
upon the previous ones.
  This paper presents an unbeatable protocol for nonuniform k-set consensus in
the synchronous crash failure model. This is an efficient protocol whose
decision times cannot be improved upon. Moreover, the description of our
protocol is extremely succinct. Proving unbeatability of this protocol is a
nontrivial challenge. We provide two proofs for its unbeatability: one is a
subtle constructive combinatorial proof, and the other is a topological proof
of a new style. These two proofs provide new insight into the connection
between topological reasoning and combinatorial reasoning about protocols,
which has long been a subject of interest. In particular, our topological proof
reasons in a novel way about subcomplexes of the protocol complex, and sheds
light on an open question posed by Guerraoui and Pochon (2009). Finally, using
the machinery developed in the design of this unbeatable protocol, we propose a
protocol for uniform k-set consensus that beats all known solutions by a large
margin.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal cache placement in the
presence of malicious mobile users in heterogeneous networks, where small-cell
base stations are equipped with caches in order to reduce the overall backhaul
load. In particular the malicious users aim at maximizing the congestion of
files at the backhaul, i.e., at maximizing the average backhaul rate. For that
adversarial model, we derive the achievable average backhaul rate of the
heterogeneous network. Moreover, we study the system performance from a
game-theoretic perspective, by naturally considering a zero-sum Stackelberg
game between the macro-cell base station and the malicious users. We then
thoroughly investigate the system performance in the presence of adversaries
and we analyze the influence of the system parameters, such as the network
topology and the capabilities of the small-cell base stations, on the overall
performance of edge caching at the Stackelberg equilibrium. Our results
highlight the impact of the malicious users on the overall caching performance
of the network and they furthermore show the importance of an adversary-aware
content placement at the small-cell base stations.

 <dc:description>  Boundary prediction in images as well as video has been a very active topic
of research and organizing visual information into boundaries and segments is
believed to be a corner stone of visual perception. While prior work has
focused on predicting boundaries for observed frames, our work aims at
predicting boundaries of future unobserved frames. This requires our model to
learn about the fate of boundaries and extrapolate motion patterns. We
experiment on established real-world video segmentation dataset, which provides
a testbed for this new task. We show for the first time spatio-temporal
boundary extrapolation in this challenging scenario. Furthermore, we show
long-term prediction of boundaries in situations where the motion is governed
by the laws of physics. We successfully predict boundaries in a billiard
scenario without any assumptions of a strong parametric model or any object
notion. We argue that our model has with minimalistic model assumptions derived
a notion of 'intuitive physics' that can be applied to novel scenes.

 <dc:description>  Random generators or stochastic engines are a key component in the structure
of metaheuristic algorithms. This work investigates the effects of non-Gaussian
stochastic engines on the performance of metaheuristics when solving a
real-world optimization problem. In this work, the bacteria foraging algorithm
(BFA) was employed in tandem with four random generators (stochastic engines).
The stochastic engines operate using the Weibull distribution, Gamma
distribution, Gaussian distribution and a chaotic mechanism. The two
non-Gaussian distributions are the Weibull and Gamma distributions. In this
work, the approaches developed were implemented on the real-world
multi-objective resin bonded sand mould problem. The Pareto frontiers obtained
were benchmarked using two metrics; the hyper volume indicator (HVI) and the
proposed Average Explorative Rate (AER) metric. Detail discussions from various
perspectives on the effects of non-Gaussian random generators in metaheuristics
are provided.

 <dc:description>  Natural Language Generation systems typically have two parts - strategic
('what to say') and tactical ('how to say'). We present our experiments in
building an unsupervised corpus-driven template based tactical NLG system. We
consider templates as a sequence of words containing gaps. Our idea is based on
the observation that templates are grammatical locally (within their textual
span). We posit the construction of a sentence as a highly restricted sequence
of such templates. This work is an attempt to explore the resulting search
space using Genetic Algorithms to arrive at acceptable solutions. We present a
baseline implementation of this approach which outputs gapped text.

 <dc:description>  Stochastic variance reduction algorithms have recently become popular for
minimizing the average of a large, but finite, number of loss functions. In
this paper, we propose a novel Riemannian extension of the Euclidean stochastic
variance reduced gradient algorithm (R-SVRG) to a compact manifold search
space. To this end, we show the developments on the Grassmann manifold. The key
challenges of averaging, addition, and subtraction of multiple gradients are
addressed with notions like logarithm mapping and parallel translation of
vectors on the Grassmann manifold. We present a global convergence analysis of
the proposed algorithm with decay step-sizes and a local convergence rate
analysis under fixed step-size with some natural assumptions. The proposed
algorithm is applied on a number of problems on the Grassmann manifold like
principal components analysis, low-rank matrix completion, and the Karcher mean
computation. In all these cases, the proposed algorithm outperforms the
standard Riemannian stochastic gradient descent algorithm.

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework and method for simultaneous detection and
segmentation of an object in a video that moves (or comes into view of the
camera) at some unknown time in the video. The method is an online approach
based on motion segmentation, and it operates under dynamic backgrounds caused
by a moving camera or moving nuisances. The goal of the method is to detect and
segment the object as soon as it moves. Due to stochastic variability in the
video and unreliability of the motion signal, several frames are needed to
reliably detect the object. The method is designed to detect and segment with
minimum delay subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate. The method is
derived as a problem of Quickest Change Detection. Experiments on a dataset
show the effectiveness of our method in minimizing detection delay subject to
false alarm constraints.

 <dc:description>  A famous conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as and Sumner states for any tree $T$ and
integer $k$, if the chromatic number of a graph is large enough, either the
graph contains a clique of size $k$ or it contains $T$ as an induced subgraph.
We discuss some results and open problems about extensions of this conjecture
to oriented graphs. We conjecture that for every oriented star $S$ and integer
$k$, if the chromatic number of a digraph is large enough, either the digraph
contains a clique of size $k$ or it contains $S$ as an induced subgraph. As an
evidence, we prove that for any oriented star $S$, every oriented graph with
sufficiently large chromatic number contains either a transitive tournament of
order $3$ or $S$ as an induced subdigraph. We then study for which sets ${\cal
P}$ of orientations of $P_4$ (the path on four vertices) similar statements
hold. We establish some positive and negative results.

 <dc:description>  We provide new lower bounds on the regret that must be suffered by
adversarial bandit algorithms. The new results show that recent upper bounds
that either (a) hold with high-probability or (b) depend on the total lossof
the best arm or (c) depend on the quadratic variation of the losses, are close
to tight. Besides this we prove two impossibility results. First, the existence
of a single arm that is optimal in every round cannot improve the regret in the
worst case. Second, the regret cannot scale with the effective range of the
losses. In contrast, both results are possible in the full-information setting.

 <dc:description>  Topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been widely used
in information retrieval for tasks ranging from smoothing and feedback methods
to tools for exploratory search and discovery. However, classical methods for
inferring topic models do not scale up to the massive size of today's publicly
available Web-scale data sets. The state-of-the-art approaches rely on custom
strategies, implementations and hardware to facilitate their asynchronous,
communication-intensive workloads.
  We present APS-LDA, which integrates state-of-the-art topic modeling with
cluster computing frameworks such as Spark using a novel asynchronous parameter
server. Advantages of this integration include convenient usage of existing
data processing pipelines and eliminating the need for disk writes as data can
be kept in memory from start to finish. Our goal is not to outperform highly
customized implementations, but to propose a general high-performance topic
modeling framework that can easily be used in today's data processing
pipelines. We compare APS-LDA to the existing Spark LDA implementations and
show that our system can, on a 480-core cluster, process up to 135 times more
data and 10 times more topics without sacrificing model quality.

 <dc:description>  Memory networks are neural networks with an explicit memory component that
can be both read and written to by the network. The memory is often addressed
in a soft way using a softmax function, making end-to-end training with
backpropagation possible. However, this is not computationally scalable for
applications which require the network to read from extremely large memories.
On the other hand, it is well known that hard attention mechanisms based on
reinforcement learning are challenging to train successfully. In this paper, we
explore a form of hierarchical memory network, which can be considered as a
hybrid between hard and soft attention memory networks. The memory is organized
in a hierarchical structure such that reading from it is done with less
computation than soft attention over a flat memory, while also being easier to
train than hard attention over a flat memory. Specifically, we propose to
incorporate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the training and inference
procedures for our hierarchical memory network. We explore the use of various
state-of-the art approximate MIPS techniques and report results on
SimpleQuestions, a challenging large scale factoid question answering task.

 <dc:title>Bit complexity for multi-homogeneous polynomial system solving

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Symbolic Computation</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multi-homogeneous polynomial systems arise in many applications. We provide
bit complexity estimates for solving them which, up to a few extra other
factors, are quadratic in the number of solutions and linear in the height of
the input system under some genericity assumptions. The assumptions essentially
imply that the Jacobian matrix of the system under study has maximal rank at
the solution set and that this solution set if finite. The algorithm is
probabilistic and a probability analysis is provided. Next, we apply these
results to the problem of optimizing a linear map on the real trace of an
algebraic set. Under some genericity assumptions, we provide bit complexity
estimates for solving this polynomial minimization problem.

 <dc:description>  We investigate how textual properties of scientific papers relate to the
number of citations they receive. Our main finding is that correlations are
non-linear and affect differently most-cited and typical papers. For instance,
we find that in most journals short titles correlate positively with citations
only for the most cited papers, for typical papers the correlation is in most
cases negative. Our analysis of 6 different factors, calculated both at the
title and abstract level of 4.3 million papers in over 1500 journals, reveals
the number of authors, and the length and complexity of the abstract, as having
the strongest (positive) influence on the number of citations.

 <dc:description>  Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool for decomposing
mixtures of audio signals in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. In the source
separation framework, the phase recovery for each extracted component is
necessary for synthesizing time-domain signals. The Complex NMF (CNMF) model
aims to jointly estimate the spectrogram and the phase of the sources, but
requires to constrain the phase in order to produce satisfactory sounding
results. We propose to incorporate phase constraints based on signal models
within the CNMF framework: a \textit{phase unwrapping} constraint that enforces
a form of temporal coherence, and a constraint based on the \textit{repetition}
of audio events, which models the phases of the sources within onset frames. We
also provide an algorithm for estimating the model parameters. The experimental
results highlight the interest of including such constraints in the CNMF
framework for separating overlapping components in complex audio mixtures.

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel technique for reconstructing the phase of
modified spectrograms of audio signals. From the analysis of mixtures of
sinusoids we obtain relationships between phases of successive time frames in
the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. To obtain similar relationships over
frequencies, in particular within onset frames, we study an impulse model.
Instantaneous frequencies and attack times are estimated locally to encompass
the class of non-stationary signals such as vibratos. These techniques ensure
both the vertical coherence of partials (over frequencies) and the horizontal
coherence (over time). The method is tested on a variety of data and
demonstrates better performance than traditional consistency-based approaches.
We also introduce an audio restoration framework and observe that our technique
outperforms traditional methods.

 <dc:description>  Phase recovery of modified spectrograms is a major issue in audio signal
processing applications, such as source separation. This paper introduces a
novel technique for estimating the phases of components in complex mixtures
within onset frames in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose to exploit
the phase repetitions from one onset frame to another. We introduce a reference
phase which characterizes a component independently of its activation times.
The onset phases of a component are then modeled as the sum of this reference
and an offset which is linearly dependent on the frequency. We derive a complex
mixture model within onset frames and we provide two algorithms for the
estimation of the model phase parameters. The model is estimated on
experimental data and this technique is integrated into an audio source
separation framework. The results demonstrate that this model is a promising
tool for exploiting phase repetitions, and point out its potential for
separating overlapping components in complex mixtures.

 <dc:description>  Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a powerful tool for decomposing
mixtures of audio signals in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. In applications
such as source separation, the phase recovery for each extracted component is a
major issue since it often leads to audible artifacts. In this paper, we
present a methodology for evaluating various NMF-based source separation
techniques involving phase reconstruction. For each model considered, a
comparison between two approaches (blind separation without prior information
and oracle separation with supervised model learning) is performed, in order to
inquire about the room for improvement for the estimation methods. Experimental
results show that the High Resolution NMF (HRNMF) model is particularly
promising, because it is able to take phases and correlations over time into
account with a great expressive power.

aim at reducing the complexity of the linear precoder and receiver that
maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio subject to a given
power constraint. To this end, we consider the asymptotic regime in which $M$
and $K$ grow large with a given ratio. Tools from random matrix theory (RMT)
are then used to compute, in closed form, accurate approximations for the
parameters of the optimal precoder and receiver, when imperfect channel state
information (modeled by the generic Gauss-Markov formulation form) is available
at the BS. The asymptotic analysis allows us to derive the asymptotically
optimal linear precoder and receiver that are characterized by a lower
complexity (due to the dependence on the large scale components of the channel)
and, possibly, by a better resilience to imperfect channel state information.
However, the implementation of both is still challenging as it requires fast
inversions of large matrices in every coherence period. To overcome this issue,
we apply the truncated polynomial expansion (TPE) technique to the precoding
and receiving vector of each UE and make use of RMT to determine the optimal
weighting coefficients on a per-UE basis that asymptotically solve the max-min
SINR problem. Numerical results are used to validate the asymptotic analysis in
the finite system regime and to show that the proposed TPE transceivers
efficiently mimic the optimal ones, while requiring much lower computational
complexity.

 <dc:description>  We consider a setting where in a known future time, a certain continuous
random variable will be realized. There is a public prediction that gradually
converges to its realized value, and an expert that has access to a more
accurate prediction. Our goal is to study {\em when} should the expert reveal
his information, assuming that his reward is based on a logarithmic market
scoring rule (i.e., his reward is proportional to the gain in log-likelihood of
the realized value).
  Our contributions are: (1) we characterize the expert's optimal policy and
show that it is threshold based. (2) we analyze the expert's asymptotic
expected optimal reward and show a tight connection to the Law of the Iterated
Logarithm, and (3) we give an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to
compute the optimal policy.

 <dc:description>  We consider an optimization deployment problem of multistatic radar system
(MSRS). Through the antenna placing and the transmitted power allocating, we
optimally deploy the MSRS for two goals: 1) the first one is to improve the
coverage ratio of surveillance region; 2) the second goal is to get a even
distribution of signal energy in surveillance region. In two typical working
modes of MSRS, we formulate the optimization problem by introducing two
objective functions according to the two mentioned goals, respectively.
Addressing on two main challenges of applying multi-objective particle swarm
optimization (MOPSO) in solving the proposed optimization problem, we propose a
deployment algorithm based on multiobjective particle swarm optimization with
non-dominated relative crowding distance (MOPSO-NRCD). For the challenge of
value difference, we propose a novel selection method with a non-dominated
relative crowding distance. For the challenge of particle allocation, a
multi-swarm structure of MOPSO is also introduced. Finally, simulation results
are given out to prove the advantages and validity of the proposed deployment
algorithm. It is shown that with same number of employed particles, the
proposed MOPSO-NRCD algorithm can achieve better optimization performance than
that of traditional multiobjective particle swarm optimization with crowding
distance (MOPSO-CD).

 <dc:description>  Bayesian optimisation has been successfully applied to a variety of
reinforcement learning problems. However, the traditional approach for learning
optimal policies in simulators does not utilise the opportunity to improve
learning by adjusting certain environment variables: state features that are
unobservable and randomly determined by the environment in a physical setting
but are controllable in a simulator. This paper considers the problem of
finding a robust policy while taking into account the impact of environment
variables. We present Alternating Optimisation and Quadrature (ALOQ), which
uses Bayesian optimisation and Bayesian quadrature to address such settings.
ALOQ is robust to the presence of significant rare events, which may not be
observable under random sampling, but play a substantial role in determining
the optimal policy. Experimental results across different domains show that
ALOQ can learn more efficiently and robustly than existing methods.

 <dc:title>Leveraging Over Priors for Boosting Control of Prosthetic Hands</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Gregori, Valentina</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The Electromyography (EMG) signal is the electrical activity produced by
cells of skeletal muscles in order to provide a movement. The non-invasive
prosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of an
amputee, that record this signal. In order to favour the control of prosthesis,
the EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory to
decide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain a
significant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired and
performed movements, a long training period is needed when we use the
traditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). An
actual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary for
an amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithms
that exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we refer
to prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In our
case an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis,
could use experience from different subjects that are already able to perform
those movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computational
investigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful in
order to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control.
Furthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when the
previous knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee.
Our experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjects
already trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time of
about an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that tries to learn
to use the prosthesis doesn't reach different results when he/she exploits
previous experience of amputees or intact.

 <dc:description>  Blind algorithms for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signals
interception have recently received considerable attention because of their
important applications in modern civil and military communication fields. One
key step in the interception process is to blindly recognize the modulation
type of the MIMO signals. This can be performed by employing a Modulation
Classification (MC) algorithm, which can be feature-based or likelihood-based.
To overcome the problems associated with the existing likelihood-based MC
algorithms, a new algorithm is developed in this paper. We formulated the MC
problem as maximizing a global likelihood function formed by combining the
likelihood functions for the estimated transmitted signals, where Minimum Mean
Square Error (MMSE) filtering is employed to separate the MIMO channel into
several sub-channels. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm
works well under various operating conditions, and performs close to the
performance upper bound with reasonable complexity.

 <dc:title>A note on privacy preserving iteratively reweighted least squares</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) is a widely-used method in
machine learning to estimate the parameters in the generalised linear models.
In particular, IRLS for L1 minimisation under the linear model provides a
closed-form solution in each step, which is a simple multiplication between the
inverse of the weighted second moment matrix and the weighted first moment
vector. When dealing with privacy sensitive data, however, developing a privacy
preserving IRLS algorithm faces two challenges. First, due to the inversion of
the second moment matrix, the usual sensitivity analysis in differential
privacy incorporating a single datapoint perturbation gets complicated and
often requires unrealistic assumptions. Second, due to its iterative nature, a
significant cumulative privacy loss occurs. However, adding a high level of
noise to compensate for the privacy loss hinders from getting accurate
estimates. Here, we develop a practical algorithm that overcomes these
challenges and outputs privatised and accurate IRLS solutions. In our method,
we analyse the sensitivity of each moments separately and treat the matrix
inversion and multiplication as a post-processing step, which simplifies the
sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we apply the {\it{concentrated differential
privacy}} formalism, a more relaxed version of differential privacy, which
requires adding a significantly less amount of noise for the same level of
privacy guarantee, compared to the conventional and advanced compositions of
differentially private mechanisms.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This article introduces a Green Cloudlet Network (GCN) architecture in the
context of mobile cloud computing. The proposed architecture is aimed at
providing seamless and low End-to-End (E2E) delay between a User Equipment (UE)
and its Avatar (its software clone) in the cloudlets to facilitate the
application workloads offloading process. Furthermore, Software Define
Networking (SDN) based core network is introduced in the GCN architecture by
replacing the traditional Evolved Packet Core (EPC) in the LTE network in order
to provide efficient communications connections between different end points.
Cloudlet Network File System (CNFS) is designed based on the proposed
architecture in order to protect Avatars' dataset against hardware failure and
improve the Avatars' performance in terms of data access latency. Moreover,
green energy supplement is proposed in the architecture in order to reduce the
extra Operational Expenditure (OPEX) and CO2 footprint incurred by running the
distributed cloudlets. Owing to the temporal and spatial dynamics of both the
green energy generation and energy demands of Green Cloudlet Systems (GCSs),
designing an optimal green energy management strategy based on the
characteristics of the green energy generation and the energy demands of eNBs
and cloudlets to minimize the on-grid energy consumption is critical to the
cloudlet provider.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a novel model for semantic role labeling that makes use
of neural sequence modeling techniques. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that complex syntactic structures and related phenomena, such as
nested subordinations and nominal predicates, are not handled well by existing
models. Our model treats such instances as sub-sequences of lexicalized
dependency paths and learns suitable embedding representations. We
experimentally demonstrate that such embeddings can improve results over
previous state-of-the-art semantic role labelers, and showcase qualitative
improvements obtained by our method.

 <dc:description>  In phase retrieval, the goal is to recover a complex signal from the
magnitude of its linear measurements. While many well-known algorithms
guarantee deterministic recovery of the unknown signal using i.i.d. random
measurement matrices, they suffer serious convergence issues some
ill-conditioned matrices. As an example, this happens in optical imagers using
binary intensity-only spatial light modulators to shape the input wavefront.
The problem of ill-conditioned measurement matrices has also been a topic of
interest for compressed sensing researchers during the past decade. In this
paper, using recent advances in generic compressed sensing, we propose a new
phase retrieval algorithm that well-adopts for both Gaussian i.i.d. and binary
matrices using both sparse and dense input signals. This algorithm is also
robust to the strong noise levels found in some imaging applications.

 <dc:title>Hijacking Bitcoin: Routing Attacks on Cryptocurrencies</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  As the most successful cryptocurrency to date, Bitcoin constitutes a target
of choice for attackers. While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,
one important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the
Internet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing
advertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous
Systems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin
traffic.
  This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on
Bitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and
large-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we
show that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency
of routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in
terms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker
can hijack few (&lt;100) BGP prefixes to isolate ~50% of the mining power---even
when considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that
on-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by
interfering with few key Bitcoin messages.
  We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin
software. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology
using data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.
  The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the
network or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount
of mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide
range of exploits such as double spending. To prevent such effects in practice,
we provide both short and long-term countermeasures, some of which can be

 <dc:description>  In supervised learning, an inductive learning algorithm extracts general
rules from observed training instances, then the rules are applied to test
instances. We show that this splitting of training and application arises
naturally, in the classical setting, from a simple independence requirement
with a physical interpretation of being non-signalling. Thus, two seemingly
different definitions of inductive learning happen to coincide. This follows
from the properties of classical information that break down in the quantum
setup. We prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for quantum channels, which shows
that in the quantum case, the equivalence holds in the asymptotic setting, that
is, for large number of test instances. This reveals a natural analogy between
classical learning protocols and their quantum counterparts, justifying a
similar treatment, and allowing to inquire about standard elements in
computational learning theory, such as structural risk minimization and sample
complexity.

 <dc:title>On the Capacity Regions of Single-Channel and Multi-Channel Full-Duplex

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study the achievable capacity regions of full-duplex links in the single-
and multi-channel cases (in the latter case, the channels are assumed to be
orthogonal -- e.g., OFDM). We present analytical results that characterize the
uplink and downlink capacity region and efficient algorithms for computing rate
pairs at the region's boundary. We also provide near-optimal and heuristic
algorithms that &quot;convexify&quot; the capacity region when it is not convex. The
convexified region corresponds to a combination of a few full-duplex rates
(i.e., to time sharing between different operation modes). The algorithms can
be used for theoretical characterization of the capacity region as well as for
resource (time, power, and channel) allocation with the objective of maximizing
the sum of the rates when one of them (uplink or downlink) must be guaranteed
(e.g., due to QoS considerations). We numerically illustrate the capacity
regions and the rate gains (compared to time division duplex) for various
channel and cancellation scenarios. The analytical results provide insights
into the properties of the full-duplex capacity region and are essential for
future development of scheduling, channel allocation, and power control
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  How can we efficiently propagate uncertainty in a latent state representation
with recurrent neural networks? This paper introduces stochastic recurrent
neural networks which glue a deterministic recurrent neural network and a state
space model together to form a stochastic and sequential neural generative
model. The clear separation of deterministic and stochastic layers allows a
structured variational inference network to track the factorization of the
model's posterior distribution. By retaining both the nonlinear recursive
structure of a recurrent neural network and averaging over the uncertainty in a
latent path, like a state space model, we improve the state of the art results
on the Blizzard and TIMIT speech modeling data sets by a large margin, while
achieving comparable performances to competing methods on polyphonic music
modeling.

 <dc:description>  The paper described a generalized integrated glance to bin packing problems
including a brief literature survey and some new problem formulations for the
cases of multiset estimates of items. A new systemic viewpoint to bin packing
problems is suggested: (a) basic element sets (item set, bin set, item subset
assigned to bin), (b) binary relation over the sets: relation over item set as
compatibility, precedence, dominance; relation over items and bins (i.e.,
correspondence of items to bins). A special attention is targeted to the
following versions of bin packing problems: (a) problem with multiset estimates
of items, (b) problem with colored items (and some close problems). Applied
examples of bin packing problems are considered: (i) planning in paper industry
(framework of combinatorial problems), (ii) selection of information messages,
(iii) packing of messages/information packages in WiMAX communication system
(brief description).

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new theorem prover for classical higher-order logic named
auto2. The prover is designed to make use of human-specified heuristics when
searching for proofs. The core algorithm is a best-first search through the
space of propositions derivable from the initial assumptions, where new
propositions are added by user-defined functions called proof steps. We
implemented the prover in Isabelle/HOL, and applied it to several formalization
projects in mathematics and computer science, demonstrating the high level of
automation it can provide in a variety of possible proof tasks.

 <dc:description>  We give the first algorithm for kernel Nystr\&quot;om approximation that runs in
*linear time in the number of training points* and is provably accurate for all
kernel matrices, without dependence on regularity or incoherence conditions.
The algorithm projects the kernel onto a set of $s$ landmark points sampled by
their *ridge leverage scores*, requiring just $O(ns)$ kernel evaluations and
$O(ns^2)$ additional runtime. While leverage score sampling has long been known
to give strong theoretical guarantees for Nystr\&quot;om approximation, by employing
a fast recursive sampling scheme, our algorithm is the first to make the
approach scalable. Empirically we show that it finds more accurate, lower rank
kernel approximations in less time than popular techniques such as uniformly
sampled Nystr\&quot;om approximation and the random Fourier features method.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of natural image segmentation by extracting
information from a multi-layer array which is constructed based on color,
gradient, and statistical properties of the local neighborhoods in an image. A
Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to improve the effectiveness of local
spectral histogram features. Grouping these features leads to forming a rough
initial over-segmented layer which contains coherent regions of pixels. The
regions are merged by using two proposed functions for calculating the distance
between two neighboring regions and making decisions about their merging.
Extensive experiments are performed on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset to
evaluate the performance of our proposed method and compare the results with
the recent state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results indicate that our
method achieves higher level of accuracy for natural images compared to recent
methods.

problems. We characterize a large class of loss functions that allows to
naturally embed structured outputs in a linear space. We exploit this fact to
design learning algorithms using a surrogate loss approach and regularization
techniques. We prove universal consistency and finite sample bounds
characterizing the generalization properties of the proposed methods.
Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the practical usefulness of

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic modeling is cyclical: we specify a model, infer its posterior,
and evaluate its performance. Evaluation drives the cycle, as we revise our
model based on how it performs. This requires a metric. Traditionally,
predictive accuracy prevails. Yet, predictive accuracy does not tell the whole
story. We propose to evaluate a model through posterior dispersion. The idea is
to analyze how each datapoint fares in relation to posterior uncertainty around
the hidden structure. We propose a family of posterior dispersion indices (PDI)
that capture this idea. A PDI identifies rich patterns of model mismatch in
three real data examples: voting preferences, supermarket shopping, and
population genetics.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a design strategy for neural network macro-architecture based on
self-similarity. Repeated application of a simple expansion rule generates deep
networks whose structural layouts are precisely truncated fractals. These
networks contain interacting subpaths of different lengths, but do not include
any pass-through or residual connections; every internal signal is transformed
by a filter and nonlinearity before being seen by subsequent layers. In
experiments, fractal networks match the excellent performance of standard
residual networks on both CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, thereby
demonstrating that residual representations may not be fundamental to the
success of extremely deep convolutional neural networks. Rather, the key may be
the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep.
We note similarities with student-teacher behavior and develop drop-path, a
natural extension of dropout, to regularize co-adaptation of subpaths in
fractal architectures. Such regularization allows extraction of
high-performance fixed-depth subnetworks. Additionally, fractal networks
exhibit an anytime property: shallow subnetworks provide a quick answer, while
deeper subnetworks, with higher latency, provide a more accurate answer.

 <dc:description>  CT protocol design and quality control would benefit from automated tools to
estimate the quality of generated CT images. These tools could be used to
identify erroneous CT acquisitions or refine protocols to achieve certain
signal to noise characteristics. This paper investigates blind estimation
methods to determine global signal strength and noise levels in chest CT
images. Methods: We propose novel performance metrics corresponding to the
accuracy of noise and signal estimation. We implement and evaluate the noise
estimation performance of six spatial- and frequency- based methods, derived
from conventional image filtering algorithms. Algorithms were tested on patient
data sets from whole-body repeat CT acquisitions performed with a higher and
lower dose technique over the same scan region. Results: The proposed
performance metrics can evaluate the relative tradeoff of filter parameters and
noise estimation performance. The proposed automated methods tend to
underestimate CT image noise at low-flux levels. Initial application of
methodology suggests that anisotropic diffusion and Wavelet-transform based
filters provide optimal estimates of noise. Furthermore, methodology does not
provide accurate estimates of absolute noise levels, but can provide estimates
of relative change and/or trends in noise levels.

 <dc:description>  In a weakly-supervised scenario object detectors need to be trained using
image-level annotation alone. Since bounding-box-level ground truth is not
available, most of the solutions proposed so far are based on an iterative,
Multiple Instance Learning framework in which the current classifier is used to
select the highest-confidence boxes in each image, which are treated as
pseudo-ground truth in the next training iteration. However, the errors of an
immature classifier can make the process drift, usually introducing a lot of
false positives in the training dataset. In this paper we propose a self-paced
learning protocol to alleviate this problem. The main idea is to iteratively
select a subset of images and boxes that are the most reliable, and use them
for training. While in the past few years similar strategies have been adopted
for SVMs and other classifiers, we are the first showing that a self-paced
approach can be used with deep-network-based classifiers in an end-to-end
training pipeline. The method we propose is built on the fully-supervised
Fast-RCNN architecture and can be applied to similar architectures which
represent the input image as a bag of boxes. Using a relatively simple
architecture based on Fast-RCNN and AlexNet, we show state-of-the-art results
on Pascal VOC 2007 and ILSVRC 2013. On ILSVRC 2013 our low-capacity network
outperforms even those weakly-supervised approaches which are based on much
higher-capacity networks.

 <dc:description>  Geo-materials such as vuggy carbonates are known to exhibit multiple spatial
scales. A common manifestation of spatial scales is the presence of (at least)
two different scales of pores, which is commonly referred to as double
porosity. To complicate things, the pore-network at each scale exhibits
different permeability, and these networks are connected through fissure and
conduits. Although some models are available in the literature, they lack a
strong theoretical basis. This paper aims to fill this lacuna by providing the
much needed theoretical foundations of the flow in porous media which exhibit
double porosity/permeability. We first obtain a mathematical model for double
porosity/permeability using the maximization of rate of dissipation hypothesis,
and thereby providing a firm thermodynamic underpinning. We then present, along
with mathematical proofs, several important mathematical properties that the
solutions to the double porosity/permeability model satisfy. These properties
are important in their own right as well as serve as good (mechanics-based) a
posteriori measures to assess the accuracy of numerical solutions. We also
present several canonical problems and obtain the corresponding analytical
solutions, which are used to gain insights into the velocity and pressure
profiles, and the mass transfer across the two pore-networks. In particular, we
highlight how the solutions under the double porosity/permeability differ from
the corresponding solutions under Darcy equations.

 <dc:title>Adaptive Newton Method for Empirical Risk Minimization to Statistical

 <dc:description>  We consider empirical risk minimization for large-scale datasets. We
introduce Ada Newton as an adaptive algorithm that uses Newton's method with
adaptive sample sizes. The main idea of Ada Newton is to increase the size of
the training set by a factor larger than one in a way that the minimization
variable for the current training set is in the local neighborhood of the
optimal argument of the next training set. This allows to exploit the quadratic
convergence property of Newton's method and reach the statistical accuracy of
each training set with only one iteration of Newton's method. We show
theoretically and empirically that Ada Newton can double the size of the
training set in each iteration to achieve the statistical accuracy of the full
training set with about two passes over the dataset.

 <dc:title>Impact of General Channel Aging Conditions on the Downlink Performance
  of Massive MIMO</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Papazafeiropoulos, Anastasios K.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recent works have identified massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) as
a key technology for achieving substantial gains in spectral and energy
efficiency. Additionally, the turn to low-cost transceivers, being prone to
hardware impairments is the most effective and attractive way for
cost-efficient applications concerning massive MIMO systems. In this context,
the impact of channel aging, which severely affects the performance, is
investigated herein by considering a generalized model. Specifically, we show
that both Doppler shift because of the users' relative movement as well as
phase noise due to noisy local oscillators (LOs) contribute to channel aging.
To this end, we first propose a joint model, encompassing both effects, in
order to investigate the performance of a massive MIMO system based on the
inevitable time-varying nature of realistic mobile communications. Then, we
derive the deterministic equivalents (DEs) for the
signal-to-noise-and-interference ratios (SINRs) with maximum ratio transmission
(MRT) and regularized zero-forcing precoding (RZF). Our analysis not only
demonstrates a performance comparison between MRT and RZF under these
conditions, but most importantly, it reveals interesting properties regarding
the effects of user mobility and phase noise. In particular, the large antenna
limit behavior depends profoundly on both effects, but the burden due to user
mobility is much more detrimental than phase noise even for moderate user
velocities ($\approx30$ km/h), while the negative impact of phase noise is
noteworthy at lower mobility conditions.

 <dc:description>  The ability to compute an accurate reward function is essential for
optimising a dialogue policy via reinforcement learning. In real-world
applications, using explicit user feedback as the reward signal is often
unreliable and costly to collect. This problem can be mitigated if the user's
intent is known in advance or data is available to pre-train a task success
predictor off-line. In practice neither of these apply for most real world
applications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby the
dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via active
learning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on a
continuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashion
using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce data
annotation costs and mitigate noisy user feedback in dialogue policy learning.

within a working group of the Electrophysiology Task Force in the International
Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF) Program on Standards for Data
Sharing. While this document describes the requirements of the standard
independent of the actual storage technology, the Task Force has recommended
basing a standard on HDF5. This is in line with a number of groups who are
already using HDF5 to store electrophysiology data, although currently without

 <dc:description>  Since the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as a prominent technique
in the field of computer vision, the ImageNet classification challenge has
played a major role in advancing the state-of-the-art. While accuracy figures
have steadily increased, the resource utilisation of winning models has not
been properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensive
analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory
footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption.
Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and
architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship;
(3) energy constraint is an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and
model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the
inference time. We believe our analysis provides a compelling set of
information that helps design and engineer efficient DNNs.

 <dc:description>  Most current semantic segmentation methods rely on fully convolutional
networks (FCNs). However, their use of large receptive fields and many pooling
layers cause low spatial resolution inside the deep layers. This leads to
predictions with poor localization around the boundaries. Prior work has
attempted to address this issue by post-processing predictions with CRFs or
MRFs. But such models often fail to capture semantic relationships between
objects, which causes spatially disjoint predictions. To overcome these
problems, recent methods integrated CRFs or MRFs into an FCN framework. The
downside of these new models is that they have much higher complexity than
traditional FCNs, which renders training and testing more challenging.
  In this work we introduce a simple, yet effective Convolutional Random Walk
Network (RWN) that addresses the issues of poor boundary localization and
spatially fragmented predictions with very little increase in model complexity.
Our proposed RWN jointly optimizes the objectives of pixelwise affinity and
semantic segmentation. It combines these two objectives via a novel random walk
layer that enforces consistent spatial grouping in the deep layers of the
network. Our RWN is implemented using standard convolution and matrix
multiplication. This allows an easy integration into existing FCN frameworks
and it enables end-to-end training of the whole network via standard
back-propagation. Our implementation of RWN requires just $131$ additional
parameters compared to the traditional FCNs, and yet it consistently produces
an improvement over the FCNs on semantic segmentation and scene labeling.

 <dc:description>  Traditional dialog systems used in goal-oriented applications require a lot
of domain-specific handcrafting, which hinders scaling up to new domains.
End-to-end dialog systems, in which all components are trained from the dialogs
themselves, escape this limitation. But the encouraging success recently
obtained in chit-chat dialog may not carry over to goal-oriented settings. This
paper proposes a testbed to break down the strengths and shortcomings of
end-to-end dialog systems in goal-oriented applications. Set in the context of
restaurant reservation, our tasks require manipulating sentences and symbols,
so as to properly conduct conversations, issue API calls and use the outputs of
such calls. We show that an end-to-end dialog system based on Memory Networks
can reach promising, yet imperfect, performance and learn to perform
non-trivial operations. We confirm those results by comparing our system to a
hand-crafted slot-filling baseline on data from the second Dialog State
Tracking Challenge (Henderson et al., 2014a). We show similar result patterns
on data extracted from an online concierge service.

 <dc:description>  An increasing number of countries are passing laws that facilitate the mass
surveillance of Internet traffic. In response, governments and citizens are
increasingly paying attention to the countries that their Internet traffic
traverses. In some cases, countries are taking extreme steps, such as building
new Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), which allow networks to interconnect
directly, and encouraging local interconnection to keep local traffic local. We
find that although many of these efforts are extensive, they are often futile,
due to the inherent lack of hosting and route diversity for many popular sites.
By measuring the country-level paths to popular domains, we characterize
transnational routing detours. We find that traffic is traversing known
surveillance states, even when the traffic originates and ends in a country
that does not conduct mass surveillance. Then, we investigate how clients can
use overlay network relays and the open DNS resolver infrastructure to prevent
their traffic from traversing certain jurisdictions. We find that 84\% of paths
originating in Brazil traverse the United States, but when relays are used for
country avoidance, only 37\% of Brazilian paths traverse the United States.
Using the open DNS resolver infrastructure allows Kenyan clients to avoid the
United States on 17\% more paths. Unfortunately, we find that some of the more
prominent surveillance states (e.g., the U.S.) are also some of the least
avoidable countries.

 <dc:description>  Conditional random fields (CRFs) provide a powerful tool for structured
prediction, but cast significant challenges in both the learning and inference
steps. Approximation techniques are widely used in both steps, which should be
considered jointly to guarantee good performance (a.k.a. &quot;inferning&quot;).
Perturb-and-MAP models provide a promising alternative to CRFs, but require
global combinatorial optimization and hence they are usable only on specific
models. In this work, we present a new Local Perturb-and-MAP (locPMAP)
framework that replaces the global optimization with a local optimization by
exploiting our observed connection between locPMAP and the pseudolikelihood of
the original CRF model. We test our approach on three different vision tasks
and show that our method achieves consistently improved performance over other
approximate inference techniques optimized to a pseudolikelihood objective.
Additionally, we demonstrate that we can integrate our method in the fully
convolutional network framework to increase our model's complexity. Finally,
our observed connection between locPMAP and the pseudolikelihood leads to a
novel perspective for understanding and using pseudolikelihood.

 <dc:description>  We present a Communication-efficient Surrogate Likelihood (CSL) framework for
solving distributed statistical inference problems. CSL provides a
communication-efficient surrogate to the global likelihood that can be used for
low-dimensional estimation, high-dimensional regularized estimation and
Bayesian inference. For low-dimensional estimation, CSL provably improves upon
naive averaging schemes and facilitates the construction of confidence
intervals. For high-dimensional regularized estimation, CSL leads to a
minimax-optimal estimator with controlled communication cost. For Bayesian
inference, CSL can be used to form a communication-efficient quasi-posterior
distribution that converges to the true posterior. This quasi-posterior
procedure significantly improves the computational efficiency of MCMC
algorithms even in a non-distributed setting. We present both theoretical

 <dc:description>  In the next generation cellular networks, device-to-device (D2D)
communication is already considered a fundamental feature. A problem of
multi-hop D2D networks is on how to define forwarding algorithms that achieve,
at the same time, high delivery ratio and low network overhead. In this paper
we aim to understand group meetings' properties by looking at their structure
and regularity with the final goal of applying such knowledge in the design of
a forwarding algorithm for D2D multi-hop networks. We introduce a forwarding
protocol, namely GROUPS-NET, which is aware of social group meetings and their
evolution over time. Our algorithm is parameter-calibration free and does not
require any knowledge about the social network structure of the system. In
particular, different from the state of the art algorithms, GROUPS-NET does not
need communities detection, which is a complex and expensive task. We validate
our algorithm using different publicly available data-sources. In real large
scale scenarios, our algorithm achieves approximately the same delivery ratio
of the state-of-art solution with up to 40% less network overhead.

 <dc:title>Describing Human Aesthetic Perception by Deeply-learned Attributes from
  Flickr</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Zhang, L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Many aesthetic models in computer vision suffer from two shortcomings: 1) the
low descriptiveness and interpretability of those hand-crafted aesthetic
criteria (i.e., nonindicative of region-level aesthetics), and 2) the
difficulty of engineering aesthetic features adaptively and automatically
toward different image sets. To remedy these problems, we develop a deep
architecture to learn aesthetically-relevant visual attributes from Flickr1,
which are localized by multiple textual attributes in a weakly-supervised
setting. More specifically, using a bag-ofwords (BoW) representation of the
frequent Flickr image tags, a sparsity-constrained subspace algorithm discovers
a compact set of textual attributes (e.g., landscape and sunset) for each
image. Then, a weakly-supervised learning algorithm projects the textual
attributes at image-level to the highly-responsive image patches at
pixel-level. These patches indicate where humans look at appealing regions with
respect to each textual attribute, which are employed to learn the visual
attributes. Psychological and anatomical studies have shown that humans
perceive visual concepts hierarchically. Hence, we normalize these patches and
feed them into a five-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to mimick the
hierarchy of human perceiving the visual attributes. We apply the learned deep
features on image retargeting, aesthetics ranking, and retrieval. Both
subjective and objective experimental results thoroughly demonstrate the
competitiveness of our approach.

 <dc:title>Learning Purposeful Behaviour in the Absence of Rewards</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Artificial intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to achieve goals
in the world. In the reinforcement learning framework, goals are encoded as
reward functions that guide agent behaviour, and the sum of observed rewards
provide a notion of progress. However, some domains have no such reward signal,
or have a reward signal so sparse as to appear absent. Without reward feedback,
agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lacking
intentionality. In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learning
purposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by
constructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification
of purposes that are &quot;just out of reach&quot; of the agent's current behaviour.
These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately
resulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit different
parts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited for
settings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in the
exploration of the environment until reward is observed.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed a new video delivery paradigm: smartrouter-based
video delivery network, which is enabled by smartrouters deployed at users'
homes, together with the conventional video servers deployed in the
datacenters. Recently, ChinaCache, a large content delivery network (CDN)
provider, and Youku, a video service provider using smartrouters to assist
video delivery, announced their cooperation to create a new paradigm of content
delivery based on householders' network resources. This new paradigm is
different from the conventional peer-to-peer (P2P) approach, because such
dedicated smartrouters are inherently operated by the centralized video service
providers in a coordinative manner. It is intriguing to study the strategies,
performance and potential impact on the content delivery ecosystem of such peer
CDN systems. In this paper, we study the Youku peer CDN, which has deployed
over 300K smartrouter devices for its video streaming. In our measurement, 78K
videos were investigated and 3TB traffic has been analyzed, over controlled
routers and players. Our contributions are the following measurement insights.
First, a global replication and caching strategy is essential for the peer CDN
systems, and proactively scheduling replication and caching on a daily basis
can guarantee their performance. Second, such peer CDN deployment can itself
form an effective Quality of Service (QoS) monitoring sub-system, which can be
used for fine-grained user request redirection. We also provide our analysis on
the performance issues and potential improvements to the peer CDN systems.

 <dc:description>  Domestic service robots such as lawn mowing and vacuum cleaning robots are
the most numerous consumer robots in existence today. While early versions
employed random exploration, recent systems fielded by most of the major
manufacturers have utilized range-based and visual sensors and user-placed
beacons to enable robots to map and localize. However, active range and visual
sensing solutions have the disadvantages of being intrusive, expensive, or only
providing a 1D scan of the environment, while the requirement for beacon
placement imposes other practical limitations. In this paper we present a
passive and potentially cheap vision-based solution to 2D localization at night
that combines easily obtainable day-time maps with low resolution
contrast-normalized image matching algorithms, image sequence-based matching in
two-dimensions, place match interpolation and recent advances in conventional
low light camera technology. In a range of experiments over a domestic lawn and
in a lounge room, we demonstrate that the proposed approach enables 2D
localization at night, and analyse the effect on performance of varying
odometry noise levels, place match interpolation and sequence matching length.
Finally we benchmark the new low light camera technology and show how it can
enable robust place recognition even in an environment lit only by a moonless
sky, raising the tantalizing possibility of being able to apply all
conventional vision algorithms, even in the darkest of nights.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel deep learning approach, deeply-fused nets.
The central idea of our approach is deep fusion, i.e., combine the intermediate
representations of base networks, where the fused output serves as the input of
the remaining part of each base network, and perform such combinations deeply
over several intermediate representations. The resulting deeply fused net
enjoys several benefits. First, it is able to learn multi-scale representations
as it enjoys the benefits of more base networks, which could form the same
fused network, other than the initial group of base networks. Second, in our
suggested fused net formed by one deep and one shallow base networks, the flows
of the information from the earlier intermediate layer of the deep base network
to the output and from the input to the later intermediate layer of the deep
base network are both improved. Last, the deep and shallow base networks are
jointly learnt and can benefit from each other. More interestingly, the
essential depth of a fused net composed from a deep base network and a shallow
base network is reduced because the fused net could be composed from a less
deep base network, and thus training the fused net is less difficult than
training the initial deep base network. Empirical results demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior performance over two closely-related methods, ResNet
and Highway, and competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-arts.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we attack the anomaly detection problem by directly modeling
the data distribution with deep architectures. We propose deep structured
energy based models (DSEBMs), where the energy function is the output of a
deterministic deep neural network with structure. We develop novel model
architectures to integrate EBMs with different types of data such as static
data, sequential data, and spatial data, and apply appropriate model
architectures to adapt to the data structure. Our training algorithm is built
upon the recent development of score matching \cite{sm}, which connects an EBM
with a regularized autoencoder, eliminating the need for complicated sampling
method. Statistically sound decision criterion can be derived for anomaly
detection purpose from the perspective of the energy landscape of the data
distribution. We investigate two decision criteria for performing anomaly
detection: the energy score and the reconstruction error. Extensive empirical
studies on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed model consistently
matches or outperforms all the competing methods.

 <dc:description>  We study the phase retrieval problem, which solves quadratic system of
equations, i.e., recovers a vector $\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ from its
magnitude measurements $y_i=|\langle \boldsymbol{a}_i, \boldsymbol{x}\rangle|,
i=1,..., m$. We develop a gradient-like algorithm (referred to as RWF
representing reshaped Wirtinger flow) by minimizing a nonconvex nonsmooth loss
function. In comparison with existing nonconvex Wirtinger flow (WF) algorithm
\cite{candes2015phase}, although the loss function becomes nonsmooth, it
involves only the second power of variable and hence reduces the complexity. We
show that for random Gaussian measurements, RWF enjoys geometric convergence to
a global optimal point as long as the number $m$ of measurements is on the
order of $n$, the dimension of the unknown $\boldsymbol{x}$. This improves the
sample complexity of WF, and achieves the same sample complexity as truncated
Wirtinger flow (TWF) \cite{chen2015solving}, but without truncation in gradient
loop. Furthermore, RWF costs less computationally than WF, and runs faster
numerically than both WF and TWF. We further develop the incremental
(stochastic) reshaped Wirtinger flow (IRWF) and show that IRWF converges
linearly to the true signal. We further establish performance guarantee of an
existing Kaczmarz method for the phase retrieval problem based on its
connection to IRWF. We also empirically demonstrate that IRWF outperforms
existing ITWF algorithm (stochastic version of TWF) as well as other batch
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Nutrient-based meal recommendations have the potential to help individuals
prevent or manage conditions such as diabetes and obesity. However, learning
people's food preferences and making recommendations that simultaneously appeal
to their palate and satisfy nutritional expectations are challenging. Existing
approaches either only learn high-level preferences or require a prolonged
learning period. We propose Yum-me, a personalized nutrient-based meal
recommender system designed to meet individuals' nutritional expectations,
dietary restrictions, and fine-grained food preferences. Yum-me enables a
simple and accurate food preference profiling procedure via a visual quiz-based
user interface, and projects the learned profile into the domain of
nutritionally appropriate food options to find ones that will appeal to the
user. We present the design and implementation of Yum-me, and further describe
and evaluate two innovative contributions. The first contriution is an open
source state-of-the-art food image analysis model, named FoodDist. We
demonstrate FoodDist's superior performance through careful benchmarking and
discuss its applicability across a wide array of dietary applications. The
second contribution is a novel online learning framework that learns food
preference from item-wise and pairwise image comparisons. We evaluate the
framework in a field study of 227 anonymous users and demonstrate that it
outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. We further conducted an
end-to-end validation of the feasibility and effectiveness of Yum-me through a
60-person user study, in which Yum-me improves the recommendation acceptance
rate by 42.63%.

 <dc:description>  Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised
learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some
applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and
expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm
for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which
users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling
functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are
noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training
set labeling process as a generative model, we can &quot;denoise&quot; the generated
training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of
these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a
discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method
over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs.
Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data
programming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying
data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points
over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the
competition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data
programming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning
models when training data is limited or unavailable.

 <dc:description>  Adversarial training provides a means of regularizing supervised learning
algorithms while virtual adversarial training is able to extend supervised
learning algorithms to the semi-supervised setting. However, both methods
require making small perturbations to numerous entries of the input vector,
which is inappropriate for sparse high-dimensional inputs such as one-hot word
representations. We extend adversarial and virtual adversarial training to the
text domain by applying perturbations to the word embeddings in a recurrent
neural network rather than to the original input itself. The proposed method
achieves state of the art results on multiple benchmark semi-supervised and
purely supervised tasks. We provide visualizations and analysis showing that
the learned word embeddings have improved in quality and that while training,
the model is less prone to overfitting.

 <dc:description>  Kidney exchanges are organized markets where patients swap willing but
incompatible donors. In the last decade, kidney exchanges grew from small and
regional to large and national---and soon, international. This growth results
in more lives saved, but exacerbates the empirical hardness of the
$\mathcal{NP}$-complete problem of optimally matching patients to donors.
State-of-the-art matching engines use integer programming techniques to clear
fielded kidney exchanges, but these methods must be tailored to specific models
and objective functions, and may fail to scale to larger exchanges. In this
paper, we observe that if the kidney exchange compatibility graph can be
encoded by a constant number of patient and donor attributes, the clearing
problem is solvable in polynomial time. We give necessary and sufficient
conditions for losslessly shrinking the representation of an arbitrary
compatibility graph. Then, using real compatibility graphs from the UNOS
nationwide kidney exchange, we show how many attributes are needed to encode
real compatibility graphs. The experiments show that, indeed, small numbers of
attributes suffice.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the storage-latency tradeoff in the $3\times3$ wireless
interference network with caches equipped at all transmitters and receivers.
The tradeoff is characterized by the so-called fractional delivery time (FDT)
at given normalized transmitter and receiver cache sizes. We first propose a
generic cooperative transmitter/receiver caching strategy with adjustable file
splitting ratios. Based on this caching strategy, we then design the delivery
phase carefully to turn the considered interference channel opportunistically
into broadcast channel, multicast channel, X channel, or a hybrid form of these
channels. After that, we obtain an achievable upper bound of the minimum FDT by
solving a linear programming problem of the file splitting ratios. The
achievable FDT is a convex and piece-wise linear decreasing function of the
cache sizes. Receiver local caching gain, coded multicasting gain, and
transmitter cooperation gain (interference alignment and interference
neutralization) are leveraged in different cache size regions.

 <dc:description>  Data centers traffic is composed by numerous latency-sensitive &quot;mice&quot; flows,
which is consisted of only several packets, and a few throughput-sensitive
&quot;elephant&quot; flows, which occupy more than 80% of overall load. Generally, the
short-lived &quot;mice&quot; flows induce transient congestion and the long-lived
&quot;elephant&quot; flows cause persistent congestion. The network congestion is a major
performance inhibitor. Conventionally, the hop-by-hop and end-to-end flow
control mechanisms are employed to relief transient and persistent congestion,
respectively. However, in face of the mixture of elephants and mice, we find
the hybrid congestion control scheme including hop-by-hop and end-to-end flow
control mechanisms suffers from serious performance impairments. As a step
further, our in-depth analysis reveals that the hybrid scheme performs poor at
latency of mice and throughput of elephant. Motivated by this understanding, we
argue for isolating mice and elephants in different queues, such that the
hop-by-hop and end-to-end flow control mechanisms are independently imposed to
short-lived and long-lived flows, respectively. Our solution is
readily-deployable and compatible with current commodity network devices and
can leverage various congestion control mechanisms. Extensive simulations show
that our proposal of isolation can simultaneously improve the latency of mice
by at least 30% and the link utilization to almost 100%.

 <dc:description>  This report presents a general model of the architecture of information
systems for the speech recognition of children. It presents a model of the
speech data stream and how it works. The result of these studies and presented
veins architectural model shows that research needs to be focused on
acoustic-phonetic modeling in order to improve the quality of children's speech
recognition and the sustainability of the systems to noise and changes in
transmission environment. Another important aspect is the development of more

 <dc:description>  Control planes for global carrier networks should be programmable (so that
new functionality can be easily introduced) and scalable (so they can handle
the numerical scale and geographic scope of these networks). Neither
traditional control planes nor new SDN-based control planes meet both of these
goals. In this paper, we propose a framework for recursive routing computations
that combines the best of SDN (programmability) and traditional networks
(scalability through hierarchy) to achieve these two desired properties.
Through simulation on graphs of up to 10,000 nodes, we evaluate our design's
ability to support a variety of routing and traffic engineering solutions,
while incorporating a fast failure recovery mechanism.

 <dc:description>  The report presents the process of planning, designing and the development of
a database of spoken children's speech whose native language is Bulgarian. The
proposed model is designed for children between the age of 4 and 6 without
speech disorders, and reflects their specific capabilities. At this age most
children cannot read, there is no sustained concentration, they are emotional,
etc. The aim is to unite all the media information accompanying the recording
and processing of spoken speech, thereby to facilitate the work of researchers
in the field of speech recognition. This database will be used for the
development of systems for children's speech recognition, children's speech
synthesis systems, games which allow voice control, etc. As a result of the
proposed model a prototype system for speech recognition is presented.

 <dc:description>  Many tasks in AI require the collaboration of multiple agents. Typically, the
communication protocol between agents is manually specified and not altered
during training. In this paper we explore a simple neural model, called
CommNet, that uses continuous communication for fully cooperative tasks. The
model consists of multiple agents and the communication between them is learned
alongside their policy. We apply this model to a diverse set of tasks,
demonstrating the ability of the agents to learn to communicate amongst
themselves, yielding improved performance over non-communicative agents and
baselines. In some cases, it is possible to interpret the language devised by
the agents, revealing simple but effective strategies for solving the task at
hand.

 <dc:title>Improving energy efficiency and classification accuracy of neuromorphic
  chips by learning binary synaptic crossbars</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Yepes, Antonio Jimeno</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tang, Jianbin</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Neural and Evolutionary Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have achieved human level performance in many
image analytics tasks but DNNs are mostly deployed to GPU platforms that
consume a considerable amount of power. Brain-inspired spiking neuromorphic
chips consume low power and can be highly parallelized. However, for deploying
DNNs to energy efficient neuromorphic chips the incompatibility between
continuous neurons and synaptic weights of traditional DNNs, discrete spiking
neurons and synapses of neuromorphic chips has to be overcome. Previous work
has achieved this by training a network to learn continuous probabilities and
deployment to a neuromorphic architecture by random sampling these
probabilities. An ensemble of sampled networks is needed to approximate the
performance of the trained network.
  In the work presented in this paper, we have extended previous research by
directly learning binary synaptic crossbars. Results on MNIST show that better
performance can be achieved with a small network in one time step (92.7%
maximum observed accuracy vs 95.98% accuracy in our work). Top results on a
larger network are similar to previously published results (99.42% maximum
observed accuracy vs 99.45% accuracy in our work). More importantly, in our
work a smaller ensemble is needed to achieve similar or better accuracy than
previous work, which translates into significantly decreased energy consumption
for both networks. Results of our work are stable since they do not require
random sampling.

 <dc:description>  Pairing based cryptography is in a dangerous position following the
breakthroughs on discrete logarithms computations in finite fields of small
characteristic. Remaining instances are built over finite fields of large
characteristic and their security relies on the fact that the embedding field
of the underlying curve is relatively large. How large is debatable. The aim of
our work is to sustain the claim that the combination of degree 3 embedding and
too small finite fields obviously does not provide enough security. As a
computational example, we solve the DLP on a 170-bit MNT curve, by exploiting
the pairing embedding to a 508-bit, degree-3 extension of the base field.

 <dc:description>  We study a stochastic and distributed algorithm for nonconvex problems whose
objective consists of a sum of $N$ nonconvex $L_i/N$-smooth functions, plus a
nonsmooth regularizer. The proposed NonconvEx primal-dual SpliTTing (NESTT)
algorithm splits the problem into $N$ subproblems, and utilizes an augmented
Lagrangian based primal-dual scheme to solve it in a distributed and stochastic
manner. With a special non-uniform sampling, a version of NESTT achieves
$\epsilon$-stationary solution using
$\mathcal{O}((\sum_{i=1}^N\sqrt{L_i/N})^2/\epsilon)$ gradient evaluations,
which can be up to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ times better than the (proximal) gradient
descent methods. It also achieves Q-linear convergence rate for nonconvex
$\ell_1$ penalized quadratic problems with polyhedral constraints. Further, we
reveal a fundamental connection between primal-dual based methods and a few
primal only methods such as IAG/SAG/SAGA.

we ask whether for all $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a deterministic strategy for
the (blind) maximizer such that against all the strategies of the minimizer, it
is possible to reach the set of final states with probability larger than
$1-\epsilon$. This problem is undecidable in general, but we define a class of
games, called leaktight half-blind games where the problem becomes decidable.
We also show that mixed strategies in general are stronger for both players and
that optimal strategies for the minimizer might require infinite-memory.

 <dc:description>  Coordinated multi-display environments from the desktop, second-screen to
gigapixel display walls are increasingly common. Personal and intimate mobile
and wearable devices such as head-mounted displays, smartwatches, smartphones
and tablets are rarely part of such multi-device ecosystems. With this paper,
we contribute to a better understanding about factors that impede the creation
and use of such mobile multi-device ecosystems. We base our findings on
literature research and an expert survey. Specifically, we present grounded
challenges relevant for the design, development and use of mobile multi-device
environments.

 <dc:description>  This technical note addresses the distributed fixed-time consensus protocol
design problem for multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics over
directed communication graphs. By using motion planning approaches, a class of
distributed fixed-time consensus algorithms are developed, which rely only on
the sampling information at some sampling instants. For linear multi-agent
systems, the proposed algorithms solve the fixed-time consensus problem for any
directed graph containing a directed spanning tree. In particular, the settling
time can be off-line pre-assigned according to task requirements. Compared with
the existing results for multi-agent systems, to our best knowledge, it is the
first-time to solve fixed-time consensus problems for general linear
multi-agent systems over directed graphs having a directed spanning tree.
Extensions to the fixed-time formation flying are further studied for multiple
satellites described by Hill equations.

 <dc:description>  Remote attestation is a crucial security service particularly relevant to
increasingly popular IoT (and other embedded) devices. It allows a trusted
party (verifier) to learn the state of a remote, and potentially
malware-infected, device (prover). Most existing approaches are static in
nature and only check whether benign software is initially loaded on the
prover. However, they are vulnerable to run-time attacks that hijack the
application's control or data flow, e.g., via return-oriented programming or
data-oriented exploits. As a concrete step towards more comprehensive run-time
remote attestation, we present the design and implementation of Control- FLow
ATtestation (C-FLAT) that enables remote attestation of an application's
control-flow path, without requiring the source code. We describe a full
prototype implementation of C-FLAT on Raspberry Pi using its ARM TrustZone
hardware security extensions. We evaluate C-FLAT's performance using a
real-world embedded (cyber-physical) application, and demonstrate its efficacy
against control-flow hijacking attacks.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel vector representation that integrates lexical contrast
into distributional vectors and strengthens the most salient features for
determining degrees of word similarity. The improved vectors significantly
outperform standard models and distinguish antonyms from synonyms with an
average precision of 0.66-0.76 across word classes (adjectives, nouns, verbs).
Moreover, we integrate the lexical contrast vectors into the objective function
of a skip-gram model. The novel embedding outperforms state-of-the-art models
on predicting word similarities in SimLex-999, and on distinguishing antonyms

 <dc:description>  The i* modeling language was introduced to fill the gap in the spectrum of
conceptual modeling languages, focusing on the intentional (why?), social
(who?), and strategic (how? how else?) dimensions. i* has been applied in many
areas, e.g., healthcare, security analysis, eCommerce. Although i* has seen
much academic application, the diversity of extensions and variations can make
it difficult for novices to learn and use it in a consistent way. This document
introduces the iStar 2.0 core language, evolving the basic concepts of i* into
a consistent and clear set of core concepts, upon which to build future work
and to base goal-oriented teaching materials. This document was built from a
set of discussions and input from various members of the i* community. It is
our intention to revisit, update and expand the document after collecting
examples and concrete experiences with iStar 2.0.

 <dc:description>  Different types of dynamics have been studied in repeated game play, and one
of them which has received much attention recently consists of those based on
&quot;no-regret&quot; algorithms from the area of machine learning. It is known that
dynamics based on generic no-regret algorithms may not converge to Nash
equilibria in general, but to a larger set of outcomes, namely coarse
correlated equilibria. Moreover, convergence results based on generic no-regret
algorithms typically use a weaker notion of convergence: the convergence of the
average plays instead of the actual plays. Some work has been done showing that
when using a specific no-regret algorithm, the well-known multiplicative
updates algorithm, convergence of actual plays to equilibria can be shown and
better quality of outcomes in terms of the price of anarchy can be reached for
atomic congestion games and load balancing games. Are there more cases of
natural no-regret dynamics that perform well in suitable classes of games in
terms of convergence and quality of outcomes that the dynamics converge to?
  We answer this question positively in the bulletin-board model by showing
that when employing the mirror-descent algorithm, a well-known generic
no-regret algorithm, the actual plays converge quickly to equilibria in
nonatomic congestion games. Furthermore, the bandit model considers a probably
more realistic and prevalent setting with only partial information, in which at
each time step each player only knows the cost of her own currently played
strategy, but not any costs of unplayed strategies. For the class of atomic
congestion games, we propose a family of bandit algorithms based on the
mirror-descent algorithms previously presented, and show that when each player
individually adopts such a bandit algorithm, their joint (mixed) strategy
profile quickly converges with implications.

 <dc:description>  We present a new framework of applying deep neural networks (DNN) to devise a
universal discrete denoiser. Unlike other approaches that utilize supervised
learning for denoising, we do not require any additional training data. In such
setting, while the ground-truth label, i.e., the clean data, is not available,
we devise &quot;pseudo-labels&quot; and a novel objective function such that DNN can be
trained in a same way as supervised learning to become a discrete denoiser. We
experimentally show that our resulting algorithm, dubbed as Neural DUDE,
significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in several applications
with a systematic rule of choosing the hyperparameter, which is an attractive
feature in practice.

 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of Robust PCA in the fully and partially observed
settings. Without corruptions, this is the well-known matrix completion
problem. From a statistical standpoint this problem has been recently
well-studied, and conditions on when recovery is possible (how many
observations do we need, how many corruptions can we tolerate) via
polynomial-time algorithms is by now understood. This paper presents and
analyzes a non-convex optimization approach that greatly reduces the
computational complexity of the above problems, compared to the best available
algorithms. In particular, in the fully observed case, with $r$ denoting rank
and $d$ dimension, we reduce the complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(r^2d^2\log(1/\varepsilon))$ to
$\mathcal{O}(rd^2\log(1/\varepsilon))$ -- a big savings when the rank is big.
For the partially observed case, we show the complexity of our algorithm is no
more than $\mathcal{O}(r^4d \log d \log(1/\varepsilon))$. Not only is this the
best-known run-time for a provable algorithm under partial observation, but in
the setting where $r$ is small compared to $d$, it also allows for
near-linear-in-$d$ run-time that can be exploited in the fully-observed case as
well, by simply running our algorithm on a subset of the observations.

 <dc:description>  In many real-world applications data exhibits non-stationarity, i.e., its
distribution changes over time. One approach to handling non-stationarity is to
remove or minimize it before attempting to analyze the data. In the context of
brain computer interface (BCI) data analysis this may be done by means of
stationary subspace analysis (SSA). The classic SSA method finds a matrix that
projects the data onto a stationary subspace by optimizing a cost function
based on a matrix divergence. In this work we present an alternative method for
SSA based on a symmetrized version of this matrix divergence. We show that this
frames the problem in terms of distances between symmetric positive definite
(SPD) matrices, suggesting a geometric interpretation of the problem. Stemming
from this geometric viewpoint, we introduce and analyze a method which utilizes
the geometry of the SPD matrix manifold and the invariance properties of its
metrics. Most notably we show that these invariances alleviate the need to
whiten the input matrices, a common step in many SSA methods which often
introduces errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of our technique in
experiments on both synthesized and real-world data.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The problem of learning automata from example traces (but no equivalence or
membership queries) is fundamental in automata learning theory and practice. In
this paper we study this problem for finite state machines with inputs and
outputs, and in particular for Moore machines. We develop three algorithms for
solving this problem: (1) the PTAP algorithm, which transforms a set of
input-output traces into an incomplete Moore machine and then completes the
machine with self-loops; (2) the PRPNI algorithm, which uses the well-known
RPNI algorithm for automata learning to learn a product of automata encoding a
Moore machine; and (3) the MooreMI algorithm, which directly learns a Moore
machine using PTAP extended with state merging. We prove that MooreMI has the
fundamental identification in the limit property. We also compare the
algorithms experimentally in terms of the size of the learned machine and
several notions of accuracy, introduced in this paper. Finally, we compare with
OSTIA, an algorithm that learns a more general class of transducers, and find
that OSTIA generally does not learn a Moore machine, even when fed with a
characteristic sample.

 <dc:description>  Proof terms in term rewriting are a representation means for reduction
sequences, and more in general for contraction activity, allowing to
distinguish e.g simultaneous from sequential reduction. Proof terms for
finitary, first-order, left-linear term rewriting are described in the Terese
book, chapter 8. In a previous work, we defined an extension of the finitary
proof-term formalism, that allows to describe contractions in infinitary
first-order term rewriting, and gave a characterisation of permutation
equivalence.
  In this work, we discuss how projections of possibly infinite rewrite
sequences can be modeled using proof terms. Again, the foundation is a
characterisation of projections for finitary rewriting described in Terese,
Section 8.7. We extend this characterisation to infinitary rewriting and also
refine it, by describing precisely the role that structural equivalence plays
in the development of the notion of projection. The characterisation we propose
yields a definite expression, i.e. a proof term, that describes the projection
of an infinitary reduction over another.
  To illustrate the working of projections, we show how a common reduct of a
(possibly infinite) reduction and a single step that makes part of it can be
obtained via their respective projections. We show, by means of several
examples, that the proposed definition yields the expected behavior also in
cases beyond those covered by this result. Finally, we discuss how the notion
of limit is used in our definition of projection for infinite reduction.

for high-quality speech synthesis and modification applications. The proposed
framework consists of three subsystems: instantaneous frequency estimator and
initial aperiodicity detector, F0 trajectory tracker, and F0 refinement and
aperiodicity extractor. A preliminary implementation of the proposed framework
substantially outperformed (by a factor of 10 in terms of RMS F0 estimation
error) existing F0 extractors in tracking ability of temporally varying F0
trajectories. The front end aperiodicity detector consists of a complex-valued
wavelet analysis filter with a highly selective temporal and spectral envelope.
This front end aperiodicity detector uses a new measure that quantifies the
deviation from periodicity. The measure is less sensitive to slow FM and AM and
closely correlates with the signal to noise ratio.

 <dc:description>  This paper develops a probabilistic numerical method for solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs) and studies application of that method to
PDE-constrained inverse problems. This approach enables the solution of
challenging inverse problems whilst accounting, in a statistically principled
way, for the impact of discretisation error due to numerical solution of the
PDE. In particular, the approach confers robustness to failure of the numerical
PDE solver, with statistical inferences driven to be more conservative in the
presence of substantial discretisation error. Going further, the problem of
choosing a PDE solver is cast as a problem in the Bayesian design of
experiments, where the aim is to minimise the impact of solver error on
statistical inferences; here the challenge of non-linear PDEs is also
considered. The method is applied to parameter inference problems in which
discretisation error in non-negligible and must be accounted for in order to
reach conclusions that are statistically valid.

 <dc:description>  WPA2-Personal is widely used to protect Wi-Fi networks against illicit
access. While attackers typically use GPUs to speed up the discovery of weak
network passwords, attacking random passwords is considered to quickly become
infeasible with increasing password length. Professional attackers may thus
turn to commercial high-end FPGA-based cluster solutions to significantly
increase the speed of those attacks. Well known manufacturers such as Elcomsoft
have succeeded in creating world's fastest commercial FPGA-based WPA2 password
recovery system, but since they rely on high-performance FPGAs the costs of
these systems are well beyond the reach of amateurs. In this paper, we present
a highly optimized low-cost FPGA cluster-based WPA-2 Personal password recovery
system that can not only achieve similar performance at a cost affordable by
amateurs, but in comparison our implementation would also be more than 5 times
as fast on the original hardware. Since the currently fastest system is not
only significantly slower but proprietary as well, we believe that we are the
first to present the internals of a highly optimized and fully pipelined FPGA
WPA2 password recovery system. In addition, we evaluated our approach with
respect to performance and power usage and compare it to GPU-based systems. To
assess the real-world impact of our system, we utilized the well known Wigle
Wi-Fi network dataset to conduct a case study within the country and its border
regions. Our results indicate that our system could be used to break into each
of more than 160,000 existing Wi-Fi networks requiring 3 days per network on
our low-cost FPGA cluster in the worst case.

 <dc:description>  Classes in natural images tend to follow long tail distributions. This is
problematic when there are insufficient training examples for rare classes.
This effect is emphasized in compound classes, involving the conjunction of
several concepts, such as those appearing in action-recognition datasets. In
this paper, we propose to address this issue by learning how to utilize common
visual concepts which are readily available. We detect the presence of
prominent concepts in images and use them to infer the target labels instead of
using visual features directly, combining tools from vision and
natural-language processing. We validate our method on the recently introduced
HICO dataset reaching a mAP of 31.54% and on the Stanford-40 Actions dataset,
where the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the art and, combined
with direct visual features, obtains an accuracy 83.12%. Moreover, the method
provides for each class a semantically meaningful list of keywords and relevant
image regions relating it to its constituent concepts.

 <dc:description>  The class of models that can be represented by STL files is larger than the
class of models that can be printed using additive manufacturing technologies.
In this paper such a gap is formalized while providing an unambiguous
description of all the mathematical entities involved in the modeling-printing
pipeline. Possible defects of an STL file are formally defined and classified,
and a fully automatic procedure is described to turn &quot;any&quot; such file into a
printable model. The procedure is as exact as possible, meaning that no visible
distortion is introduced unless it is strictly imposed by limitations of the
printing device. Thanks to such an unprecedented flexibility and accuracy, this
algorithm is expected to significantly simplify the modeling-printing process,
in particular within the continuously emerging non-professional &quot;maker&quot;
communities.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we derive a modified InfoMax algorithm for the solution of
Blind Signal Separation (BSS) problems by using advanced stochastic methods.
The proposed approach is based on a novel stochastic optimization approach
known as the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm. The proposed BSS
solution can benefit from the excellent properties of the Adam approach. In
order to derive the new learning rule, the Adam algorithm is introduced in the
derivation of the cost function maximization in the standard InfoMax algorithm.
The natural gradient adaptation is also considered. Finally, some experimental
results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a novel approach to aspect term extraction based on
unsupervised learning of distributed representations of words and dependency
paths. The basic idea is to connect two words (w1 and w2) with the dependency
path (r) between them in the embedding space. Specifically, our method
optimizes the objective w1 + r = w2 in the low-dimensional space, where the
multi-hop dependency paths are treated as a sequence of grammatical relations
and modeled by a recurrent neural network. Then, we design the embedding
features that consider linear context and dependency context information, for
the conditional random field (CRF) based aspect term extraction. Experimental
results on the SemEval datasets show that, (1) with only embedding features, we
can achieve state-of-the-art results; (2) our embedding method which
incorporates the syntactic information among words yields better performance
than other representative ones in aspect term extraction.

 <dc:description>  Using top-ranked documents in response to a query has been shown to be an
effective approach to improve the quality of query translation in
dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval. In this paper, we
propose a new method for dictionary-based query translation based on dimension
projection of embedded vectors from the pseudo-relevant documents in the source
language to their equivalents in the target language. To this end, first we
learn low-dimensional vectors of the words in the pseudo-relevant collections
separately and then aim to find a query-dependent transformation matrix between
the vectors of translation pairs appeared in the collections. At the next step,
representation of each query term is projected to the target language and then,
after using a softmax function, a query-dependent translation model is built.
Finally, the model is used for query translation. Our experiments on four CLEF
collections in French, Spanish, German, and Italian demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms a word embedding baseline based on bilingual
shuffling and a further number of competitive baselines. The proposed method
reaches up to 87% performance of machine translation (MT) in short queries and
considerable improvements in verbose queries.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  There have been multiple attempts to resolve various inflection matching
problems in information retrieval. Stemming is a common approach to this end.
Among many techniques for stemming, statistical stemming has been shown to be
effective in a number of languages, particularly highly inflected languages. In
this paper we propose a method for finding affixes in different positions of a
word. Common statistical techniques heavily rely on string similarity in terms
of prefix and suffix matching. Since infixes are common in irregular/informal
inflections in morphologically complex texts, it is required to find infixes
for stemming. In this paper we propose a method whose aim is to find
statistical inflectional rules based on minimum edit distance table of word
pairs and the likelihoods of the rules in a language. These rules are used to
statistically stem words and can be used in different text mining tasks.
Experimental results on CLEF 2008 and CLEF 2009 English-Persian CLIR tasks
indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the baselines
in terms of MAP.

 <dc:description>  Many partially-successful attempts have been made to find the most natural
discrete-variable version of Shannon's entropy power inequality (EPI). We
develop an axiomatic framework from which we deduce the natural form of a
discrete-variable EPI and an associated entropic monotonicity in a
discrete-variable central limit theorem. In this discrete EPI, the geometric
distribution, which has the maximum entropy among all discrete distributions
with a given mean, assumes a role analogous to the Gaussian distribution in
Shannon's EPI. The entropy power of $X$ is defined as the mean of a geometric
random variable with entropy $H(X)$. The crux of our construction is a
discrete-variable version of Lieb's scaled addition $X \boxplus_\eta Y$ of two
discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ with $\eta \in (0, 1)$. We discuss the
relationship of our discrete EPI with recent work of Yu and Johnson who
developed an EPI for a restricted class of random variables that have
ultra-log-concave (ULC) distributions. Even though we leave open the proof of
the aforesaid natural form of the discrete EPI, we show that this discrete EPI
holds true for variables with arbitrary discrete distributions when the entropy
power is redefined as $e^{H(X)}$ in analogy with the continuous version.
Finally, we show that our conjectured discrete EPI is a special case of the
yet-unproven Entropy Photon-number Inequality (EPnI), which assumes a role
analogous to Shannon's EPI in capacity proofs for Gaussian bosonic (quantum)
channels.

 <dc:description>  The problem of analyzing the performance of networked agents exchanging
evidence in a dynamic network has recently grown in importance. This problem
has relevance in signal and data fusion network applications and in studying
opinion and consensus dynamics in social networks. Due to its capability of
handling a wider variety of uncertainties and ambiguities associated with
evidence, we use the framework of Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory to capture the
opinion of an agent. We then examine the consensus among agents in dynamic
networks in which an agent can utilize either a cautious or receptive updating
strategy. In particular, we examine the case of bounded confidence updating
where an agent exchanges its opinion only with neighboring nodes possessing
'similar' evidence. In a fusion network, this captures the case in which nodes
only update their state based on evidence consistent with the node's own
evidence. In opinion dynamics, this captures the notions of Social Judgment
Theory (SJT) in which agents update their opinions only with other agents
possessing opinions closer to their own. Focusing on the two special DS
theoretic cases where an agent state is modeled as a Dirichlet body of evidence
and a probability mass function (p.m.f.), we utilize results from matrix
theory, graph theory, and networks to prove the existence of consensus agent
states in several time-varying network cases of interest. For example, we show
the existence of a consensus in which a subset of network nodes achieves a
consensus that is adopted by follower network nodes. Of particular interest is
the case of multiple opinion leaders, where we show that the agents do not
reach a consensus in general, but rather converge to 'opinion clusters'.
Simulation results are provided to illustrate the main results.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A data graph is a convenient paradigm for supporting keyword search that
takes into account available semantic structure and not just textual relevance.
However, the problem of constructing data graphs that facilitate both
efficiency and effectiveness of the underlying system has hardly been
addressed. A conceptual model for this task is proposed. Principles for
constructing good data graphs are explained. Transformations for generating
data graphs from RDB and XML are developed. The results obtained from these
transformations are analyzed. It is shown that XML is a better starting point
for getting a good data graph.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose DeepCut, a method to obtain pixelwise object
segmentations given an image dataset labelled with bounding box annotations. It
extends the approach of the well-known GrabCut method to include machine
learning by training a neural network classifier from bounding box annotations.
We formulate the problem as an energy minimisation problem over a
densely-connected conditional random field and iteratively update the training
targets to obtain pixelwise object segmentations. Additionally, we propose
variants of the DeepCut method and compare those to a naive approach to CNN
training under weak supervision. We test its applicability to solve brain and
lung segmentation problems on a challenging fetal magnetic resonance dataset
and obtain encouraging results in terms of accuracy.

 <dc:description>  Models of neural machine translation are often from a discriminative family
of encoderdecoders that learn a conditional distribution of a target sentence
given a source sentence. In this paper, we propose a variational model to learn
this conditional distribution for neural machine translation: a variational
encoderdecoder model that can be trained end-to-end. Different from the vanilla
encoder-decoder model that generates target translations from hidden
representations of source sentences alone, the variational model introduces a
continuous latent variable to explicitly model underlying semantics of source
sentences and to guide the generation of target translations. In order to
perform efficient posterior inference and large-scale training, we build a
neural posterior approximator conditioned on both the source and the target
sides, and equip it with a reparameterization technique to estimate the
variational lower bound. Experiments on both Chinese-English and English-
German translation tasks show that the proposed variational neural machine
translation achieves significant improvements over the vanilla neural machine
translation baselines.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a bidimensional attention based recursive
autoencoder (BattRAE) to integrate clues and sourcetarget interactions at
multiple levels of granularity into bilingual phrase representations. We employ
recursive autoencoders to generate tree structures of phrases with embeddings
at different levels of granularity (e.g., words, sub-phrases and phrases). Over
these embeddings on the source and target side, we introduce a bidimensional
attention network to learn their interactions encoded in a bidimensional
attention matrix, from which we extract two soft attention weight distributions
simultaneously. These weight distributions enable BattRAE to generate
compositive phrase representations via convolution. Based on the learned phrase
representations, we further use a bilinear neural model, trained via a
max-margin method, to measure bilingual semantic similarity. To evaluate the
effectiveness of BattRAE, we incorporate this semantic similarity as an
additional feature into a state-of-the-art SMT system. Extensive experiments on
NIST Chinese-English test sets show that our model achieves a substantial
improvement of up to 1.63 BLEU points on average over the baseline.

 <dc:title>A Tighter Real-Time Communication Analysis for Wormhole-Switched

 <dc:description>  Simulations and runtime measurements are some of the methods which can be
used to evaluate whether a given NoC-based platform can accommodate application
workload and fulfil its timing requirements. Yet, these techniques are often
time-consuming, and hence can evaluate only a limited set of scenarios.
Therefore, these approaches are not suitable for safety-critical and hard
real-time systems, where one of the fundamental requirements is to provide
strong guarantees that all timing requirements will always be met, even in the
worst-case conditions. For such systems the analytic-based real-time analysis
is the only viable approach.
  In this paper the focus is on the real-time communication analysis for
wormhole-switched priority-preemptive NoCs. First, we elaborate on the existing
analysis and identify one source of pessimism. Then, we propose an extension to
the analysis, which efficiently overcomes this limitation, and allows for a
less pessimistic analysis. Finally, through a comprehensive experimental
evaluation, we compare the newly proposed approach against the existing one,
and also observe how the trends change with different traffic parameters.

 <dc:description>  Continuous space word embeddings have received a great deal of attention in
the natural language processing and machine learning communities for their
ability to model term similarity and other relationships. We study the use of
term relatedness in the context of query expansion for ad hoc information
retrieval. We demonstrate that word embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe, when
trained globally, underperform corpus and query specific embeddings for
retrieval tasks. These results suggest that other tasks benefiting from global
embeddings may also benefit from local embeddings.

 <dc:title>Automatic Extraction of Causal Relations from Natural Language Texts: A

 <dc:description>  Automatic extraction of cause-effect relationships from natural language
texts is a challenging open problem in Artificial Intelligence. Most of the
early attempts at its solution used manually constructed linguistic and
syntactic rules on small and domain-specific data sets. However, with the
advent of big data, the availability of affordable computing power and the
recent popularization of machine learning, the paradigm to tackle this problem
has slowly shifted. Machines are now expected to learn generic causal
extraction rules from labelled data with minimal supervision, in a domain
independent-manner. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of causal
relation extraction techniques from both paradigms, and analyse their relative
strengths and weaknesses, with recommendations for future work.

 <dc:description>  Drawing on ideas from game theory and quantum physics, we investigate
nonlocal correlations from the point of view of equilibria in games of
incomplete information. These equilibria can be classified in decreasing power
as general communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria and correlated
equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of
belief-invariant equilibrium has appeared in game theory before, in the 1990s.
However, the class of non-signalling correlations associated to
belief-invariance arose naturally already in the 1980s in the foundations of
quantum mechanics.
  Here, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and study the above
classes of equilibria, and furthermore quantum correlated equilibria, using
tools from quantum information but the language of game theory. We present a
general framework of belief-invariant communication equilibria, which contains
(quantum) correlated equilibria as special cases. It also contains the theory
of Bell inequalities, a question of intense interest in quantum mechanics, and
quantum games where players have conflicting interests, a recent topic in
physics.
  We then use our framework to show new results related to social welfare.
Namely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than
correlated equilibria, and one where all non-belief-invariant equilibria are
socially suboptimal. Then, we show that in some cases optimal social welfare is
achieved by quantum correlations, which do not need an informed mediator to be
implemented. Furthermore, we illustrate potential practical applications: for
instance, situations where competing companies can correlate without exposing
their trade secrets, or where privacy-preserving advice reduces congestion in a
network. Along the way, we highlight open questions on the interplay between
quantum information, cryptography, and game theory.

 <dc:description>  The exponential server timing channel is known to be the simplest, and in
some sense canonical, queuing timing channel. The capacity of this
infinite-memory channel is known. Here, we discuss practical finite-length
restrictions on the codewords and attempt to understand the maximal rate that
can be achieved for a target error probability. By using Markov chain analysis,
we prove a lower bound on the maximal channel coding rate achievable at
blocklength $n$ and error probability $\epsilon$. The bound is approximated by
$C- n^{-1/2} \sigma Q^{-1}(\epsilon)$ where $Q$ denotes the Q-function and
$\sigma^2$ is the asymptotic variance of the underlying Markov chain. A closed
form expression for $\sigma^2$ is given.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel extension of the encoder-decoder framework, called a
review network. The review network is generic and can enhance any existing
encoder- decoder model: in this paper, we consider RNN decoders with both CNN
and RNN encoders. The review network performs a number of review steps with
attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states, and outputs a thought vector
after each review step; the thought vectors are used as the input of the
attention mechanism in the decoder. We show that conventional encoder-decoders
are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we show that our framework
improves over state-of- the-art encoder-decoder systems on the tasks of image
captioning and source code captioning.

 <dc:description>  Previous studies in Open Information Extraction (Open IE) are mainly based on
extraction patterns. They manually define patterns or automatically learn them
from a large corpus. However, these approaches are limited when grasping the
context of a sentence, and they fail to capture implicit relations. In this
paper, we address this problem with the following methods. First, we exploit
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to extract higher-level features along
the shortest dependency paths, connecting headwords of relations and arguments.
The path-level features from LSTM networks provide useful clues regarding
contextual information and the validity of arguments. Second, we constructed
samples to train LSTM networks without the need for manual labeling. In
particular, feedback negative sampling picks highly negative samples among
non-positive samples through a model trained with positive samples. The
experimental results show that our approach produces more precise and abundant
extractions than state-of-the-art open IE systems. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to apply deep learning to Open IE.

 <dc:description>  The presented work provides a procedure for optimizing the communication cost
of a distributed quantum circuit (DQC) in terms of the number of qubit
teleportations. Because of technology limitations which do not allow large
quantum computers to work as a single processing element, distributed quantum
computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty. Previous
studies have applied ad-hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for
special cases and applications. In this study, a general approach is proposed
to optimize the number of teleportations for a DQC consisting of two spatially
separated and long-distance quantum subsystems. To this end, different
configurations of locations for executing gates whose qubits are in distinct
subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations, the proposed
algorithm is run to find the minimum number of required teleportations.
Finally, the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations
is reported. The proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find
the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the DQC.

 <dc:description>  Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detectors (MLSD) have been largely used to
mitigate the Chromatic Dispersion (CD) in Intensity Modulation/Direct Detection
(IM/DD) optical communication systems. For practical applications, the high
complexity of the receivers remains an important issue. In this paper, we
analyze the design of MLSD-based receivers using the Orthogonal Volterra Kernel
Model for IM/DD optical communication systems in Metro Optical applications. We
discuss the impact in complexity and performance of the main parameters of the
model and provide three design options for the MLSDbased receiver. Finally we
provide numerical simulations showing the Bit Error Rate (BER) performances of
the three considered designs for both On-Off Keying (OOK) and higher order
Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM).

 <dc:description>  For the past few years, in the race between image steganography and
steganalysis, deep learning has emerged as a very promising alternative to
steganalyzer approaches based on rich image models combined with ensemble
classifiers. A key knowledge of image steganalyzer, which combines relevant
image features and innovative classification procedures, can be deduced by a
deep learning approach called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These kind
of deep learning networks is so well-suited for classification tasks based on
the detection of variations in 2D shapes that it is the state-of-the-art in
many image recognition problems. In this article, we design a CNN-based
steganalyzer for images obtained by applying steganography with a unique
embedding key. This one is quite different from the previous study of {\em Qian
et al.} and its successor, namely {\em Pibre et al.} The proposed architecture
embeds less convolutions, with much larger filters in the final convolutional
layer, and is more general: it is able to deal with larger images and lower
payloads. For the &quot;same embedding key&quot; scenario, our proposal outperforms all
other steganalyzers, in particular the existing CNN-based ones, and defeats
many state-of-the-art image steganography schemes.

 <dc:description>  Many statistical machine learning techniques sacrifice convenient
computational structures to gain estimation robustness and modeling
flexibility. In this paper, we study this fundamental tradeoff through a
SQRT-Lasso problem for sparse linear regression and sparse precision matrix
estimation in high dimensions. We explain how novel optimization techniques
help address these computational challenges. Namely, we propose a pathwise
iterative smoothing shrinkage thresholding algorithm for solving the SQRT-Lasso
optimization problem, and provide a novel model-based perspective for analyzing
the smoothing optimization framework, which allows us to establish a near
linear convergence (R-linear convergence) guarantee for our proposed algorithm,
without sacrificing statistical accuracy. This implies that solving the
SQRT-Lasso optimization problem is almost as easy as solving the Lasso
optimization problem, while the former requires much less parameter tuning
effort. Moreover, we show that our proposed algorithm can also be applied to
sparse precision matrix estimation, and enjoys desirable computational as well
as statistical properties. Numerical experiments are provided to support our
theory.

 <dc:title>Towards Extending Noiseless Privacy - Dependent Data and More Practical
  Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Grining, Krzysztof</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Klonowski, Marek</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 2011 Bhaskar et al. pointed out that in many cases one can ensure
sufficient level of privacy without adding noise by utilizing adversarial
uncertainty. Informally speaking, this observation comes from the fact that if
at least a part of the data is randomized from the adversary's point of view,
it can be effectively used for hiding other values.
  So far the approach to that idea in the literature was mostly purely
asymptotic, which greatly limited its adaptation in real-life scenarios. In
this paper we aim to make the concept of utilizing adversarial uncertainty not
only an interesting theoretical idea, but rather a practically useful
technique, complementary to differential privacy, which is the state-of-the-art
definition of privacy. This requires non-asymptotic privacy guarantees, more
realistic approach to the randomness inherently present in the data and to the
adversary's knowledge.
  In our paper we extend the concept proposed by Bhaskar et al. and present
some results for wider class of data. In particular we cover the data sets that
are dependent. We also introduce rigorous adversarial model. Moreover, in
contrast to most of previous papers in this field, we give detailed
(non-asymptotic) results which is motivated by practical reasons. Note that it
required a modified approach and more subtle mathematical tools, including
Stein method which, to the best of our knowledge, was not used in privacy
research before.
  Apart from that, we show how to combine adversarial uncertainty with
differential privacy approach and explore synergy between them to enhance the
privacy parameters already present in the data itself by adding small amount of
noise.

 <dc:description>  Deletion problems are those where given a graph $G$ and a graph property
$\pi$, the goal is to find a subset of edges such that after its removal the
graph $G$ will satisfy the property $\pi$. Typically, we want to minimize the
number of elements removed. In fair deletion problems we change the objective:
we minimize the maximum number of deletions in a neighborhood of a single
vertex.
  We study the parameterized complexity of fair deletion problems with respect
to the structural parameters of the tree-width, the path-width, the size of a
minimum feedback vertex set, the neighborhood diversity, and the size of
minimum vertex cover of graph $G$. We prove the W[1]-hardness of the fair FO
vertex-deletion problem with respect to the first three parameters combined.
Moreover, we show that there is no algorithm for fair FO vertex-deletion
problem running in time $n^{o(k^{1/3})}$, where $n$ is the size of the graph
and $k$ is the sum of the first three mentioned parameters, provided that the
Exponential Time Hypothesis holds.
  On the other hand, we provide an FPT algorithm for the fair MSO edge-deletion
problem parameterized by the size of minimum vertex cover and an FPT algorithm
for the fair MSO vertex-deletion problem parameterized by the neighborhood
diversity

 <dc:title>Multi-Object Tracking and Identification over Sets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Bai, Aijun</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The ability for an autonomous agent or robot to track and identify
potentially multiple objects in a dynamic environment is essential for many
applications, such as automated surveillance, traffic monitoring, human-robot
interaction, etc. The main challenge is due to the noisy and incomplete
perception including inevitable false negative and false positive errors from a
low-level detector. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-object tracking and
identification over sets approach to address this challenge. We define joint
states and observations both as finite sets, and develop motion and observation
functions accordingly. The object identification problem is then formulated and
solved by using expectation-maximization methods. The set formulation enables
us to avoid directly performing observation-to-object association. We
empirically confirm that the overall algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art
in a popular PETS dataset.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an adaptive neural-compilation framework to address the
problem of efficient program learning. Traditional code optimisation strategies
used in compilers are based on applying pre-specified set of transformations
that make the code faster to execute without changing its semantics. In
contrast, our work involves adapting programs to make them more efficient while
considering correctness only on a target input distribution. Our approach is
inspired by the recent works on differentiable representations of programs. We
show that it is possible to compile programs written in a low-level language to
a differentiable representation. We also show how programs in this
representation can be optimised to make them efficient on a target distribution
of inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables learning
specifically-tuned algorithms for given data distributions with a high success
rate.

 <dc:description>  Advances in smartphone technology have promoted the rapid development of
mobile apps. However, the availability of a huge number of mobile apps in
application stores has imposed the challenge of finding the right apps to meet
the user needs. Indeed, there is a critical demand for personalized app
recommendations. Along this line, there are opportunities and challenges posed
by two unique characteristics of mobile apps. First, app markets have organized
apps in a hierarchical taxonomy. Second, apps with similar functionalities are
competing with each other. While there are a variety of approaches for mobile
app recommendations, these approaches do not have a focus on dealing with these
opportunities and challenges. To this end, in this paper, we provide a
systematic study for addressing these challenges. Specifically, we develop a
Structural User Choice Model (SUCM) to learn fine-grained user preferences by
exploiting the hierarchical taxonomy of apps as well as the competitive
relationships among apps. Moreover, we design an efficient learning algorithm
to estimate the parameters for the SUCM model. Finally, we perform extensive
experiments on a large app adoption data set collected from Google Play. The
results show that SUCM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art top-N
recommendation methods by a significant margin.

 <dc:description>  A recent work of Harn and Fuyou presents the first multilevel (disjunctive)
threshold secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In this
work, we first show that the proposed method is not secure and also fails to
work with a certain natural setting of the threshold values on compartments. We
then propose a secure scheme that works for all threshold settings. In this
scheme, we employ a refined version of Asmuth-Bloom secret sharing with a
special and generic Asmuth-Bloom sequence called the {\it anchor sequence}.
Based on this idea, we also propose the first multilevel conjunctive threshold
secret sharing scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Lastly, we
discuss how the proposed schemes can be used for multilevel threshold function
sharing by employing it in a threshold RSA cryptosystem as an example.

 <dc:description>  Influence Maximization (IM), that seeks a small set of key users who spread
the influence widely into the network, is a core problem in multiple domains.
It finds applications in viral marketing, epidemic control, and assessing
cascading failures within complex systems. Despite the huge amount of effort,
IM in billion-scale networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and World Wide Web has
not been satisfactorily solved. Even the state-of-the-art methods such as TIM+
and IMM may take days on those networks.
  In this paper, we propose SSA and D-SSA, two novel sampling frameworks for
IM-based viral marketing problems. SSA and D-SSA are up to 1200 times faster
than the SIGMOD'15 best method, IMM, while providing the same
$(1-1/e-\epsilon)$ approximation guarantee. Underlying our frameworks is an
innovative Stop-and-Stare strategy in which they stop at exponential check
points to verify (stare) if there is adequate statistical evidence on the
solution quality. Theoretically, we prove that SSA and D-SSA are the first
approximation algorithms that use (asymptotically) minimum numbers of samples,
meeting strict theoretical thresholds characterized for IM. The absolute
superiority of SSA and D-SSA are confirmed through extensive experiments on
real network data for IM and another topic-aware viral marketing problem, named
TVM. The source code is available at https://github.com/hungnt55/Stop-and-Stare

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel, efficient approach for distributed sparse learning in
high-dimensions, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines.
Computationally, at each round our method only requires the master machine to
solve a shifted ell_1 regularized M-estimation problem, and other workers to
compute the gradient. In respect of communication, the proposed approach
provably matches the estimation error bound of centralized methods within
constant rounds of communications (ignoring logarithmic factors). We conduct
extensive experiments on both simulated and real world datasets, and
demonstrate encouraging performances on high-dimensional regression and
classification tasks.

 <dc:description>  General-purpose mobile manipulators have the potential to serve as a
versatile form of assistive technology. However, their complexity creates
challenges, including the risk of being too difficult to use. We present a
proof-of-concept robotic system for assistive feeding that consists of a Willow
Garage PR2, a high-level web-based interface, and specialized autonomous
behaviors for scooping and feeding yogurt. As a step towards use by people with
disabilities, we evaluated our system with 5 able-bodied participants. All 5
successfully ate yogurt using the system and reported high rates of success for
the system's autonomous behaviors. Also, Henry Evans, a person with severe
quadriplegia, operated the system remotely to feed an able-bodied person. In
general, people who operated the system reported that it was easy to use,
including Henry. The feeding system also incorporates corrective actions
designed to be triggered either autonomously or by the user. In an offline
evaluation using data collected with the feeding system, a new version of our
multimodal anomaly detection system outperformed prior versions.

 <dc:description>  Machines, not humans, are the world's dominant knowledge accumulators but
humans remain the dominant decision makers. Interpreting and disseminating the
knowledge accumulated by machines requires expertise, time, and is prone to
failure. The problem of how best to convey accumulated knowledge from computers
to humans is a critical bottleneck in the broader application of machine
learning. We propose an approach based on human teaching where the problem is
formalized as selecting a small subset of the data that will, with high
probability, lead the human user to the correct inference. This approach,
though successful for modeling human learning in simple laboratory experiments,
has failed to achieve broader relevance due to challenges in formulating
general and scalable algorithms. We propose general-purpose teaching via
pseudo-marginal sampling and demonstrate the algorithm by teaching topic
models. Simulation results show our sampling-based approach: effectively
approximates the probability where ground-truth is possible via enumeration,
results in data that are markedly different from those expected by random
sampling, and speeds learning especially for small amounts of data. Application
to movie synopsis data illustrates differences between teaching and random
sampling for teaching distributions and specific topics, and demonstrates gains
in scalability and applicability to real-world problems.

 <dc:description>  Self-organizing cyber-physical systems are expected to become increasingly
important in the context of Industry 4.0 automation as well as in everyday
scenarios. Resilient communication is crucial for such systems. In general,
this can be achieved with redundant communication paths. Mathematically, the
amount of redundant paths is expressed with the network connectivity. A high
network connectivity is required for collaboration and system-wide
self-adaptation even when nodes fail or get compromised by an attacker. In this
paper, we analyze the network connectivity of a communication network for large
distributed cyber-physical systems. For this, we simulate the communication
structure of a CPS with different network parameters to determine its
resilience. With our results, we also deduce the required network connectivity
for a given number of failing or compromised nodes.

 <dc:description>  We provide tight upper and lower bounds on the complexity of minimizing the
average of $m$ convex functions using gradient and prox oracles of the
component functions. We show a significant gap between the complexity of
deterministic vs randomized optimization. For smooth functions, we show that
accelerated gradient descent (AGD) and an accelerated variant of SVRG are
optimal in the deterministic and randomized settings respectively, and that a
gradient oracle is sufficient for the optimal rate. For non-smooth functions,
having access to prox oracles reduces the complexity and we present optimal
methods based on smoothing that improve over methods using just gradient
accesses.

 <dc:description>  Mobile edge computing is a new cloud computing paradigm which makes use of
small-sized edge-clouds to provide real-time services to users. These mobile
edge-clouds (MECs) are located in close proximity to users, thus enabling users
to seamlessly access applications running on MECs. Due to the co-existence of
the core (centralized) cloud, users, and one or multiple layers of MECs, an
important problem is to decide where (on which computational entity) to place
different components of an application. This problem, known as the application
or workload placement problem, is notoriously hard, and therefore, heuristic
algorithms without performance guarantees are generally employed in common
practice, which may unknowingly suffer from poor performance as compared to the
optimal solution. In this paper, we address the application placement problem
and focus on developing algorithms with provable performance bounds. We model
the user application as an application graph and the physical computing system
as a physical graph, with resource demands/availabilities annotated on these
graphs. We first consider the placement of a linear application graph and
propose an algorithm for finding its optimal solution. Using this result, we
then generalize the formulation and obtain online approximation algorithms with
polynomial-logarithmic (poly-log) competitive ratio for tree application graph
placement. We jointly consider node and link assignment, and incorporate
multiple types of computational resources at nodes.

 <dc:description>  Recently, end-to-end known-interference cancellation (E2E-KIC) has been
proposed as a promising technique for wireless networks. It sequentially
cancels out the known interferences at each node so that wireless multi-hop
transmission can achieve a similar throughput as single-hop transmission.
Existing work on E2E-KIC assumed that the interference of a transmitter to
those nodes outside the transmitter's communication range is negligible. In
practice, however, this assumption is not always valid. There are many cases
where a transmitter causes notable interference to nodes beyond its
communication distance. From a wireless networking perspective, such
interference is caused by a node to other nodes that are multiple hops away,
thus we call it multi-hop interference. The presence of multi-hop interference
poses fundamental challenges to E2E-KIC, where known procedures cannot be
directly applied. In this paper, we propose an E2E-KIC approach which allows
the existence of multi-hop interference. In particular, we present a method
that iteratively cancels unknown interferences transmitted across multiple
hops. We analyze mathematically why and when this approach works and the
performance of it. The analysis is further supported by numerical results.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we develop a framework of generalized phase retrieval in which
one aims to reconstruct a vector ${\mathbf x}$ in ${\mathbb R}^d$ or ${\mathbb
C}^d$ through quadratic samples ${\mathbf x}^*A_1{\mathbf x}, \dots, {\mathbf
x}^*A_N{\mathbf x}$. The generalized phase retrieval includes as special cases
the standard phase retrieval as well as the phase retrieval by orthogonal
projections. We first explore the connections among generalized phase
retrieval, low-rank matrix recovery and nonsingular bilinear form. Motivated by
the connections, we present results on the minimal measurement number needed
for recovering a matrix that lies in a set $W\in {\mathbb C}^{d\times d}$.
Applying the results to phase retrieval, we show that generic $d \times d$
matrices $A_1,\ldots, A_N$ have the phase retrieval property if $N\geq 2d-1$ in
the real case and $N \geq 4d-4$ in the complex case for very general classes of
$A_1,\ldots,A_N$, e.g. matrices with prescribed ranks or orthogonal
projections. Our method also leads to a novel proof for the classical
Stiefel-Hopf condition on nonsingular bilinear form. We also give lower bounds
on the minimal measurement number required for generalized phase retrieval. For
several classes of dimensions $d$ we obtain the precise values of the minimal
measurement number. Our work unifies and enhances results from the standard
phase retrieval, phase retrieval by projections and low-rank matrix recovery.

 <dc:description>  Many interesting real world domains involve reinforcement learning (RL) in
partially observable environments. Efficient learning in such domains is
important, but existing sample complexity bounds for partially observable RL
are at least exponential in the episode length. We give, to our knowledge, the
first partially observable RL algorithm with a polynomial bound on the number
of episodes on which the algorithm may not achieve near-optimal performance.
Our algorithm is suitable for an important class of episodic POMDPs. Our
approach builds on recent advances in method of moments for latent variable
model estimation.

 <dc:description>  We draw a new connection between Coppersmith's method for finding small
solutions to polynomial congruences modulo integers and the capacity theory of
adelic subsets of algebraic curves. Coppersmith's method uses lattice basis
reduction to construct an auxiliary polynomial that vanishes at the desired
solutions. Capacity theory provides a toolkit for proving when polynomials with
certain boundedness properties do or do not exist. Using capacity theory, we
prove that Coppersmith's bound for univariate polynomials is optimal in the
sense that there are \emph{no} auxiliary polynomials of the type he used that
would allow finding roots of size $N^{1/d+\epsilon}$ for monic degree-$d$
polynomials modulo $N$. Our results rule out the existence of polynomials of
any degree and do not rely on lattice algorithms, thus eliminating the
possibility of even superpolynomial-time improvements to Coppersmith's bound.
We extend this result to constructions of auxiliary polynomials using binomial
polynomials, and rule out the existence of any auxiliary polynomial of this
form that would find solutions of size $N^{1/d+\epsilon}$ unless $N$ has a very
small prime factor.

 <dc:title>Edge complexity of geometric graphs on convex independent point sets</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khopkar, Abhijeet</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Discrete Mathematics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we focus on a generalised version of Gabriel graphs known as
Locally Gabriel graphs ($LGGs$) and Unit distance graphs ($UDGs$) on convexly
independent point sets. $UDGs$ are sub graphs of $LGGs$. We give a simpler
proof for the claim that $LGGs$ on convex independent point sets have $2n \log
n + O(n)$ edges. Then we prove that unit distance graphs on convex independent
point sets have $O(n)$ edges improving the previous known bound of $O(n \log
n)$.

 <dc:title>Real-Time Human Motion Capture with Multiple Depth Cameras</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Commonly used human motion capture systems require intrusive attachment of
markers that are visually tracked with multiple cameras. In this work we
present an efficient and inexpensive solution to markerless motion capture
using only a few Kinect sensors. Unlike the previous work on 3d pose estimation
using a single depth camera, we relax constraints on the camera location and do
not assume a co-operative user. We apply recent image segmentation techniques
to depth images and use curriculum learning to train our system on purely
synthetic data. Our method accurately localizes body parts without requiring an
explicit shape model. The body joint locations are then recovered by combining
evidence from multiple views in real-time. We also introduce a dataset of ~6
million synthetic depth frames for pose estimation from multiple cameras and
exceed state-of-the-art results on the Berkeley MHAD dataset.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic networks are increasingly being usedd to model real world datasets. A
challenging task in their analysis is to detect and characterize clusters. It
is useful for analyzing real-world data such as detecting evolving communities
in networks. We propose a temporal clustering framework based on a set of
network generative models to address this problem. We use PARAFAC decomposition
to learn network models from datasets.We then use $K$-means for clustering, the
Silhouette criterion to determine the number of clusters, and a similarity
score to order the clusters and retain the significant ones. In order to
address the time-dependent aspect of these clusters, we propose a segmentation
algorithm to detect their formations, dissolutions and lifetimes. Synthetic
networks with ground truth and real-world datasets are used to test our method
against state-of-the-art, and the results show that our method has better
performance in clustering and lifetime detection than previous methods.

 <dc:description>  Synchronization codes are frequently used in numerical data transmission and
storage. Compression by Substring Enumeration (CSE) is a new lossless
compression scheme that has turned into a new and unusual application for
synchronization codes. CSE is an inherently bit-oriented technique. However,
since the usual benchmark files are all byte-oriented, CSE incurred a penalty
due to a problem called phase unawareness. Subsequent work showed that
inserting a synchronization code inside the data before compressing it improves
the compression performance. In this paper, we present two constraint models
that compute the shortest synchronization codes, i.e. those that add the fewest
synchronization bits to the original data. We find synchronization codes for
blocks of up to 64 bits.

 <dc:description>  While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve
supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging
unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a
difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a
video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the
structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network
(&quot;PredNet&quot;) architecture that is inspired by the concept of &quot;predictive coding&quot;
from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames
in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions
and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network
layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the
movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks
learn internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object
parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training
views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image
streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric
movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the
representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering
angle. Altogether, these results suggest that prediction represents a powerful
framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object
and scene structure.

 <dc:title>Dominance Product and High-Dimensional Closest Pair under $L_\infty$</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Given a set $S$ of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the Closest Pair problem is
to find a pair of distinct points in $S$ at minimum distance. When $d$ is
constant, there are efficient algorithms that solve this problem, and fast
approximate solutions for general $d$. However, obtaining an exact solution in
very high dimensions seems to be much less understood. We consider the
high-dimensional $L_\infty$ Closest Pair problem, where $d=n^r$ for some $r &gt;
0$, and the underlying metric is $L_\infty$.
  We improve and simplify previous results for $L_\infty$ Closest Pair, showing
that it can be solved by a deterministic strongly-polynomial algorithm that
runs in $O(DP(n,d)\log n)$ time, and by a randomized algorithm that runs in
$O(DP(n,d))$ expected time, where $DP(n,d)$ is the time bound for computing the
{\em dominance product} for $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. That is a matrix $D$,
such that $D[i,j] = \bigl| \{k \mid p_i[k] \leq p_j[k]\} \bigr|$; this is the
number of coordinates at which $p_j$ dominates $p_i$. For integer coordinates
from some interval $[-M, M]$, we obtain an algorithm that runs in
$\tilde{O}\left(\min\{Mn^{\omega(1,r,1)},\, DP(n,d)\}\right)$ time, where
$\omega(1,r,1)$ is the exponent of multiplying an $n \times n^r$ matrix by an
$n^r \times n$ matrix.
  We also give slightly better bounds for $DP(n,d)$, by using more recent
rectangular matrix multiplication bounds. Computing the dominance product
itself is an important task, since it is applied in many algorithms as a major
black-box ingredient, such as algorithms for APBP (all pairs bottleneck paths),
and variants of APSP (all pairs shortest paths).

 <dc:description>  We consider first order gradient methods for effectively optimizing a
composite objective in the form of a sum of smooth and, potentially, non-smooth
functions. We present accelerated and adaptive gradient methods, called FLAG
and FLARE, which can offer the best of both worlds. They can achieve the
optimal convergence rate by attaining the optimal first-order oracle complexity
for smooth convex optimization. Additionally, they can adaptively and
non-uniformly re-scale the gradient direction to adapt to the limited curvature
available and conform to the geometry of the domain. We show theoretically and
empirically that, through the compounding effects of acceleration and
adaptivity, FLAG and FLARE can be highly effective for many data fitting and
machine learning applications.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel supervised learning technique for summarizing videos by
automatically selecting keyframes or key subshots. Casting the problem as a
structured prediction problem on sequential data, our main idea is to use Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a special type of recurrent neural networks to model
the variable-range dependencies entailed in the task of video summarization.
Our learning models attain the state-of-the-art results on two benchmark video
datasets. Detailed analysis justifies the design of the models. In particular,
we show that it is crucial to take into consideration the sequential structures
in videos and model them. Besides advances in modeling techniques, we introduce
techniques to address the need of a large number of annotated data for training
complex learning models. There, our main idea is to exploit the existence of
auxiliary annotated video datasets, albeit heterogeneous in visual styles and
contents. Specifically, we show domain adaptation techniques can improve
summarization by reducing the discrepancies in statistical properties across
those datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper positions and explores the topic of image-based personality test.
Instead of responding to text-based questions, the subjects will be provided a
set of &quot;choose-your-favorite-image&quot; visual questions. With the image options of
each question belonging to the same concept, the subjects' personality traits
are estimated by observing their preferences of images under several unique
concepts. The solution to design such an image-based personality test consists
of concept-question identification and image-option selection. We have
presented a preliminary framework to regularize these two steps in this

 <dc:title>Automatic Action Annotation in Weakly Labeled Videos</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Manual spatio-temporal annotation of human action in videos is laborious,
requires several annotators and contains human biases. In this paper, we
present a weakly supervised approach to automatically obtain spatio-temporal
annotations of an actor in action videos. We first obtain a large number of
action proposals in each video. To capture a few most representative action
proposals in each video and evade processing thousands of them, we rank them
using optical flow and saliency in a 3D-MRF based framework and select a few
proposals using MAP based proposal subset selection method. We demonstrate that
this ranking preserves the high quality action proposals. Several such
proposals are generated for each video of the same action. Our next challenge
is to iteratively select one proposal from each video so that all proposals are
globally consistent. We formulate this as Generalized Maximum Clique Graph
problem using shape, global and fine grained similarity of proposals across the
videos. The output of our method is the most action representative proposals
from each video. Our method can also annotate multiple instances of the same
action in a video. We have validated our approach on three challenging action
datasets: UCF Sport, sub-JHMDB and THUMOS'13 and have obtained promising
results compared to several baseline methods. Moreover, on UCF Sports, we
demonstrate that action classifiers trained on these automatically obtained
spatio-temporal annotations have comparable performance to the classifiers
trained on ground truth annotation.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a Rank Revealing Randomized Singular Value
Decomposition (R3SVD) algorithm to incrementally construct a low-rank
approximation of a potentially large matrix while adaptively estimating the
appropriate rank that can capture most of the actions of the matrix. Starting
from a low-rank approximation with an initial guessed rank, R3SVD adopts an
orthogonal Gaussian sampling approach to obtain the dominant subspace within
the leftover space, which is used to add up to the existing low-rank
approximation. Orthogonal Gaussian sampling is repeated until an appropriate
low-rank approximation with satisfactory accuracy, measured by the overall
energy percentage of the original matrix, is obtained. While being a fast
algorithm, R3SVD is also a memory-aware algorithm where the computational
process can be decomposed into a series of sampling tasks that use constant
amount of memory. Numerical examples in image compression and matrix completion
are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of R3SVD in low-rank approximation.

 <dc:title>Learning Latent Sub-events in Activity Videos Using Temporal Attention

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we newly introduce the concept of temporal attention filters,
and describe how they can be used for human activity recognition from videos.
Many high-level activities are often composed of multiple temporal parts (e.g.,
sub-events) with different duration/speed, and our objective is to make the
model explicitly learn such temporal structure using multiple attention filters
and benefit from them. Our temporal filters are designed to be fully
differentiable, allowing end-of-end training of the temporal filters together
with the underlying frame-based or segment-based convolutional neural network
architectures. This paper presents an approach of learning a set of optimal
static temporal attention filters to be shared across different videos, and
extends this approach to dynamically adjust attention filters per testing video
using recurrent long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). This allows our
temporal attention filters to learn latent sub-events specific to each
activity. We experimentally confirm that the proposed concept of temporal
attention filters benefits the activity recognition, and we visualize the
learned latent sub-events.

 <dc:description>  Though deliberation is a critical component of democratic decision-making,
existing deliberative processes do not scale to large groups of people.
Motivated by this, we propose a model in which large-scale decision-making
takes place through a sequence of small group interactions. Our model considers
a group of participants, each having an opinion which together form a graph. We
show that for median graphs, a class of graphs including grids and trees, it is
possible to use a small number of three-person interactions to tightly
approximate the wisdom of the crowd, defined here to be the generalized median
of participant opinions, even when agents are strategic. Interestingly, we also
show that this sharply contrasts with small groups of size two, for which we
prove an impossibility result. Specifically, we show that it is impossible to
use sequences of two-person interactions satisfying natural axioms to find a
tight approximation of the generalized median, even when agents are
non-strategic. Our results demonstrate the potential of small group
interactions for reaching global decision-making properties.

 <dc:description>  The performance analysis of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks calls for a new kind
of queueing model, in which jobs and service stations arrive randomly. Except
in some simple special cases, in general, the queueing model with varying
service rate is mathematically intractable. Motivated by the P-K formula for
M/G/1 queue, we developed a limiting analysis approach based on the connection
between the fluctuation of service rate and the mean queue length. Considering
the two extreme service rates, we proved the conjecture on the lower bound and
upper bound of mean queue length previously postulated. Furthermore, an
approximate P-K formula to estimate the mean queue length is derived from the
convex combination of these two bounds and the conditional mean queue length
under the overload condition. We confirmed the accuracy of our approximation by
extensive simulation studies with different system parameters. We also verified
that all limiting cases of the system behavior are consistent with the
predictions of our formula.

 <dc:title>Cognitive Dynamic Systems: A Technical Review of Cognitive Radar</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We start with the history of cognitive radar, where origins of the PAC,
Fuster research on cognition and principals of cognition are provided. Fuster
describes five cognitive functions: perception, memory, attention, language,
and intelligence. We describe the Perception-Action Cyclec as it applies to
cognitive radar, and then discuss long-term memory, memory storage, memory
retrieval and working memory. A comparison between memory in human cognition
and cognitive radar is given as well. Attention is another function described
by Fuster, and we have given the comparison of attention in human cognition and
cognitive radar. We talk about the four functional blocks from the PAC:
Bayesian filter, feedback information, dynamic programming and state-space
model for the radar environment. Then, to show that the PAC improves the
tracking accuracy of Cognitive Radar over Traditional Active Radar, we have
provided simulation results. In the simulation, three nonlinear filters:
Cubature Kalman Filter, Unscented Kalman Filter and Extended Kalman Filter are
compared. Based on the results, radars implemented with CKF perform better than
the radars implemented with UKF or radars implemented with EKF. Further, radar
with EKF has the worst accuracy and has the biggest computation load because of
derivation and evaluation of Jacobian matrices. We suggest using the concept of
risk management to better control parameters and improve performance in
cognitive radar. We believe, spectrum sensing can be seen as a potential
interest to be used in cognitive radar and we propose a new approach
Probabilistic ICA which will presumably reduce noise based on estimation error
in cognitive radar. Parallel computing is a concept based on divide and
conquers mechanism, and we suggest using the parallel computing approach in
cognitive radar by doing complicated calculations or tasks to reduce processing
time.

 <dc:description>  Leveraging class semantic descriptions and examples of known objects,
zero-shot learning makes it possible to train a recognition model for an object
class whose examples are not available. In this paper, we propose a novel
zero-shot learning model that takes advantage of clustering structures in the
semantic embedding space. The key idea is to impose the structural constraint
that semantic representations must be predictive of the locations of their
corresponding visual exemplars. To this end, this reduces to training multiple
kernel-based regressors from semantic representation-exemplar pairs from
labeled data of the seen object categories. Despite its simplicity, our
approach significantly outperforms existing zero-shot learning methods on
standard benchmark datasets, including the ImageNet dataset with more than
20,000 unseen categories.

 <dc:description>  A recent paper by Gatys et al. describes a method for rendering an image in
the style of another image. First, they use convolutional neural network
features to build a statistical model for the style of an image. Then they
create a new image with the content of one image but the style statistics of
another image. Here, we extend this method to render a movie in a given
artistic style. The naive solution that independently renders each frame
produces poor results because the features of the style move substantially from
one frame to the next. The other naive method that initializes the optimization
for the next frame using the rendered version of the previous frame also
produces poor results because the features of the texture stay fixed relative
to the frame of the movie instead of moving with objects in the scene. The main
contribution of this paper is to use optical flow to initialize the style
transfer optimization so that the texture features move with the objects in the
video. Finally, we suggest a method to incorporate optical flow explicitly into
the cost function.

 <dc:description>  Palm vein recognition is a novel biometric identification technology. But how
to gain a better vein extraction result from the raw palm image is still a
challenging problem, especially when the raw data collection has the problem of
asymmetric illumination. This paper proposes a method based on single scale
Retinex algorithm to extract palm vein image when strong shadow presents due to
asymmetric illumination and uneven geometry of the palm. We test our method on
a multispectral palm image. The experimental result shows that the proposed
method is robust to the influence of illumination angle and shadow. Compared to
the traditional extraction methods, the proposed method can obtain palm vein
lines with better visualization performance (the contrast ratio increases by
18.4%, entropy increases by 1.07%, and definition increases by 18.8%).

 <dc:description>  Current low-level exploits often rely on code-reuse, whereby short sections
of code (gadgets) are chained together into a coherent exploit that can be
executed without the need to inject any code. Several protection mechanisms
attempt to eliminate this attack vector by applying code transformations to
reduce the number of available gadgets. Nevertheless, it has emerged that the
residual gadgets can still be sufficient to conduct a successful attack.
Crucially, the lack of a common metric for &quot;gadget quality&quot; hinders the
effective comparison of current mitigations. This work proposes four metrics
that assign scores to a set of gadgets, measuring quality, usefulness, and
practicality. We apply these metrics to binaries produced when compiling
programs for architectures implementing Intel's recent MPX CPU extensions. Our
results demonstrate a 17% increase in useful gadgets in MPX binaries, and a
decrease in side-effects and preconditions, making them better suited for ROP
attacks.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes the set of target trajectories as the state variable for
multiple target tracking. The main objective of multiple target tracking is to
estimate an unknown number of target trajectories given a sequence of
measurements. This quantity of interest is perfectly represented as a set of
trajectories without the need of arbitrary parameters such as labels or
ordering. We use finite-set statistics to pose this problem in the Bayesian
framework and formulate a state space model where the random state is a random
finite set that contains trajectories. All information of interest is thus
contained in the multitrajectory filtering probability density function (PDF),
which represents the multitrajectory PDF of the set of trajectories given the
measurements. For the standard measurement and dynamic models, we describe a
family of PDFs that is conjugate in the sense that the multitrajectory
filtering PDF remains within that family during both the prediction and update
steps.

 <dc:description>  The minimization of convex functions which are only available through partial
and noisy information is a key methodological problem in many disciplines. In
this paper we consider convex optimization with noisy zero-th order
information, that is noisy function evaluations at any desired point. We focus
on problems with high degrees of smoothness, such as logistic regression. We
show that as opposed to gradient-based algorithms, high-order smoothness may be
used to improve estimation rates, with a precise dependence of our upper-bounds
on the degree of smoothness. In particular, we show that for infinitely
differentiable functions, we recover the same dependence on sample size as
gradient-based algorithms, with an extra dimension-dependent factor. This is
done for both convex and strongly-convex functions, with finite horizon and
anytime algorithms. Finally, we also recover similar results in the online
optimization setting.

 <dc:description>  This paper studies the problem of parameter learning in probabilistic
graphical models having latent variables, where the standard approach is the
expectation maximization algorithm alternating expectation (E) and maximization
(M) steps. However, both E and M steps are computationally intractable for high
dimensional data, while the substitution of one step to a faster surrogate for
combating against intractability can often cause failure in convergence. We
propose a new learning algorithm which is computationally efficient and
provably ensures convergence to a correct optimum. Its key idea is to run only
a few cycles of Markov Chains (MC) in both E and M steps. Such an idea of
running incomplete MC has been well studied only for M step in the literature,
called Contrastive Divergence (CD) learning. While such known CD-based schemes
find approximated gradients of the log-likelihood via the mean-field approach
in E step, our proposed algorithm does exact ones via MC algorithms in both
steps due to the multi-time-scale stochastic approximation theory. Despite its
theoretical guarantee in convergence, the proposed scheme might suffer from the
slow mixing of MC in E step. To tackle it, we also propose a hybrid approach
applying both mean-field and MC approximation in E step, where the hybrid
approach outperforms the bare mean-field CD scheme in our experiments on
real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper establishes the existence of observable footprints that reveal the
&quot;causal dispositions&quot; of the object categories appearing in collections of
images. We achieve this goal in two steps. First, we take a learning approach
to observational causal discovery, and build a classifier that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on finding the causal direction between pairs of
random variables, given samples from their joint distribution. Second, we use
our causal direction classifier to effectively distinguish between features of
objects and features of their contexts in collections of static images. Our
experiments demonstrate the existence of a relation between the direction of
causality and the difference between objects and their contexts, and by the
same token, the existence of observable signals that reveal the causal
dispositions of objects.

 <dc:description>  Structural balance theory has been developed in sociology and psychology to
explain how interacting agents, e.g., countries, political parties, opinionated
individuals, with mixed trust and mistrust relationships evolve into polarized
camps. Recent results have shown that structural balance is necessary for
polarization in networks with fixed, strongly connected neighbor relationships
when the opinion dynamics are described by DeGroot-type averaging rules. We
develop this line of research in this paper in two steps. First, we consider
fixed, not necessarily strongly connected, neighbor relationships. It is shown
that if the network includes a strongly connected subnetwork containing
mistrust, which influences the rest of the network, then no opinion clustering
is possible when that subnetwork is not structurally balanced; all the opinions
become neutralized in the end. In contrast, it is shown that when that
subnetwork is indeed structurally balanced, the agents of the subnetwork evolve
into two polarized camps and the opinions of all other agents in the network
spread between these two polarized opinions. Second, we consider time-varying
neighbor relationships. We show that the opinion separation criteria carry over
if the conditions for fixed graphs are extended to joint graphs. The results
are developed for both discrete-time and continuous-time models.

 <dc:description>  Citation and coauthor networks offer an insight into the dynamics of
scientific progress. We can also view them as representations of a causal
structure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal perspective, we
can ask questions such as whether authors form groups primarily due to their
prior shared interest, or if their favourite topics are 'contagious' and spread
through co-authorship. Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial
intelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal
correlations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics -- the impact
of latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric
methodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP)
relaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a
causal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a
manifestation of prior shared interest leading to the observed patternedness.
By introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to
existing methods for the analysis of content-related social influences.

 <dc:description>  A recent trend in probabilistic inference emphasizes the codification of
models in a formal syntax, with suitable high-level features such as
individuals, relations, and connectives, enabling descriptive clarity,
succinctness and circumventing the need for the modeler to engineer a custom
solver. Unfortunately, bringing these linguistic and pragmatic benefits to
numerical optimization has proven surprisingly challenging. In this paper, we
turn to these challenges: we introduce a rich modeling language, for which an
interior-point method computes approximate solutions in a generic way. While
logical features easily complicates the underlying model, often yielding
intricate dependencies, we exploit and cache local structure using algebraic
decision diagrams (ADDs). Indeed, standard matrix-vector algebra is efficiently
realizable in ADDs, but we argue and show that well-known optimization methods
are not ideal for ADDs. Our engine, therefore, invokes a sophisticated
matrix-free approach. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting
symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with
millions of non-zero entries.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of estimating multivariate log-concave probability
density functions. We prove the first sample complexity upper bound for
learning log-concave densities on $\mathbb{R}^d$, for all $d \geq 1$. Prior to
our work, no upper bound on the sample complexity of this learning problem was
known for the case of $d&gt;3$. In more detail, we give an estimator that, for any
$d \ge 1$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, draws $\tilde{O}_d \left( (1/\epsilon)^{(d+5)/2}
\right)$ samples from an unknown target log-concave density on $\mathbb{R}^d$,
and outputs a hypothesis that (with high probability) is $\epsilon$-close to
the target, in total variation distance. Our upper bound on the sample
complexity comes close to the known lower bound of $\Omega_d \left(
(1/\epsilon)^{(d+1)/2} \right)$ for this problem.

 <dc:description>  Corporations across the world are highly interconnected in a large global
network of corporate control. This paper investigates the global board
interlock network, covering 400,000 firms linked through 1,700,000 edges
representing shared directors between these firms. The main focus is on the
concept of centrality, which is used to investigate the embeddedness of firms
from a particular country within the global network. The study results in three
contributions. First, to the best of our knowledge for the first time we can
investigate the topology as well as the concept of centrality in corporate
networks at a global scale, allowing for the largest cross-country comparison
ever done in interlocking directorates literature. We demonstrate, amongst
other things, extremely similar network topologies, yet large differences
between countries when it comes to the relation between economic prominence
indicators and firm centrality. Second, we introduce two new metrics that are
specifically suitable for comparing the centrality ranking of a partition to
that of the full network. Using the notion of centrality persistence we propose
to measure the persistence of a partition's centrality ranking in the full
network. In the board interlock network, it allows us to assess the extent to
which the footprint of a national network is still present within the global
network. Next, the measure of centrality ranking dominance tells us whether a
partition (country) is more dominant at the top or the bottom of the centrality
ranking of the full (global) network. Finally, comparing these two new measures
of persistence and dominance between different countries allows us to classify
these countries based the their embeddedness, measured using the relation
between the centrality of a country's firms on the national and the global
scale of the board interlock network.

 <dc:description>  We consider machine learning techniques to develop low-latency approximate
solutions to a class of inverse problems. More precisely, we use a
probabilistic approach for the problem of recovering sparse stochastic signals
that are members of the $\ell_p$-balls. In this context, we analyze the
Bayesian mean-square-error (MSE) for two types of estimators: (i) a linear
estimator and (ii) a structured estimator composed of a linear operator
followed by a Cartesian product of univariate nonlinear mappings. By
construction, the complexity of the proposed nonlinear estimator is comparable
to that of its linear counterpart since the nonlinear mapping can be
implemented efficiently in hardware by means of look-up tables (LUTs). The
proposed structure lends itself to neural networks and iterative
shrinkage/thresholding-type algorithms restricted to a single iterate (e.g. due
to imposed hardware or latency constraints). By resorting to an alternating
minimization technique, we obtain a sequence of optimized linear operators and
nonlinear mappings that converge in the MSE objective. The result is attractive
for real-time applications where general iterative and convex optimization
methods are infeasible.

 <dc:title>ICE: A General and Validated Energy Complexity Model for Multithreaded

 <dc:description>  Like time complexity models that have significantly contributed to the
analysis and development of fast algorithms, energy complexity models for
parallel algorithms are desired as crucial means to develop energy efficient
algorithms for ubiquitous multicore platforms. Ideal energy complexity models
should be validated on real multicore platforms and applicable to a wide range
of parallel algorithms. However, existing energy complexity models for parallel
algorithms are either theoretical without model validation or
algorithm-specific without ability to analyze energy complexity for a
wide-range of parallel algorithms.
  This paper presents a new general validated energy complexity model for
parallel (multithreaded) algorithms. The new model abstracts away possible
multicore platforms by their static and dynamic energy of computational
operations and data access, and derives the energy complexity of a given
algorithm from its work, span and I/O complexity. The new model is validated by
different sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) algorithms and dense
matrix multiplication (matmul) algorithms running on high performance computing
(HPC) platforms (e.g., Intel Xeon and Xeon Phi). The new energy complexity
model is able to characterize and compare the energy consumption of SpMV and
matmul kernels according to three aspects: different algorithms, different
input matrix types and different platforms. The prediction of the new model
regarding which algorithm consumes more energy with different inputs on
different platforms, is confirmed by the experimental results. In order to
improve the usability and accuracy of the new model for a wide range of
platforms, the platform parameters of ICE model are provided for eleven
platforms including HPC, accelerator and embedded platforms.

 <dc:title>Stochastic Variance Reduced Riemannian Eigensolver</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We study the stochastic Riemannian gradient algorithm for matrix
eigen-decomposition. The state-of-the-art stochastic Riemannian algorithm
requires the learning rate to decay to zero and thus suffers from slow
convergence and sub-optimal solutions. In this paper, we address this issue by
deploying the variance reduction (VR) technique of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). The technique was originally developed to solve convex problems in the
Euclidean space. We generalize it to Riemannian manifolds and realize it to
solve the non-convex eigen-decomposition problem. We are the first to propose
and analyze the generalization of SVRG to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically,
we propose the general variance reduction form, SVRRG, in the framework of the
stochastic Riemannian gradient optimization. It's then specialized to the
problem with eigensolvers and induces the SVRRG-EIGS algorithm. We provide a
novel and elegant theoretical analysis on this algorithm. The theory shows that
a fixed learning rate can be used in the Riemannian setting with an exponential
global convergence rate guaranteed. The theoretical results make a significant
improvement over existing studies, with the effectiveness empirically verified.

 <dc:description>  We use the linear threshold model to study the diffusion of information on a
network generated by the stochastic block model. We focus our analysis on a two
community structure where the initial set of informed nodes lies only in one of
the two communities and we look for optimal network structures, i.e. those
maximizing the asymptotic extent of the diffusion. We find that, constraining
the mean degree and the fraction of initially informed nodes, the optimal
structure can be assortative (modular), core-periphery, or even disassortative.
We then look for minimal cost structures, i.e. those such that a minimal
fraction of initially informed nodes is needed to trigger a global cascade. We
find that the optimal networks are assortative but with a structure very close
to a core-periphery graph, i.e. a very dense community linked to a much more
sparsely connected periphery.

 <dc:title>Neighborhood Sensitive Mapping for Zero-Shot Classification using
  Independently Learned Semantic Embeddings</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Singh, Gaurav</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In a traditional setting, classifiers are trained to approximate a target
function $f:X \rightarrow Y$ where at least a sample for each $y \in Y$ is
presented to the training algorithm. In a zero-shot setting we have a subset of
the labels $\hat{Y} \subset Y$ for which we do not observe any corresponding
training instance. Still, the function $f$ that we train must be able to
correctly assign labels also on $\hat{Y}$. In practice, zero-shot problems are
very important especially when the label set is large and the cost of
editorially label samples for all possible values in the label set might be
prohibitively high. Most recent approaches to zero-shot learning are based on
finding and exploiting relationships between labels using semantic embeddings.
We show in this paper that semantic embeddings, despite being very good at
capturing relationships between labels, are not very good at capturing the
relationships among labels in a data-dependent manner. For this reason, we
propose a novel two-step process for learning a zero-shot classifier. In the
first step, we learn what we call a \emph{property embedding space} capturing
the &quot;\emph{learnable}&quot; features of the label set. Then, we exploit the learned
properties in order to reduce the generalization error for a linear nearest
neighbor-based classifier.

 <dc:description>  Introduced a new calculation method (K-method) for cognitive maps. K - method
consists of two consecutive steps. In the first stage, allocated subgraph
composed of all paths from one selected node (concept) to another node
(concept) from the cognitive map (directed weighted graph) . In the second
stage, after the transition to an undirected graph (symmetrization adjacency
matrix) the influence of one node to another calculated with Kirchhoff method.
In the proposed method, there is no problem inherent in the impulse method. In
addition to &quot;pair&quot; influence of one node to another, the average
characteristics are introduced, allowing to calculate the impact of the
selected node to all other nodes and the influence of all on the one selected.
For impulse method similar to the average characteristics in the case where the
pulse method &quot;works&quot; are introduced and compared with the K-method.

 <dc:description>  The generalization error of deep neural networks via their classification
margin is studied in this work. Our approach is based on the Jacobian matrix of
a deep neural network and can be applied to networks with arbitrary
non-linearities and pooling layers, and to networks with different
architectures such as feed forward networks and residual networks. Our analysis
leads to the conclusion that a bounded spectral norm of the network's Jacobian
matrix in the neighbourhood of the training samples is crucial for a deep
neural network of arbitrary depth and width to generalize well. This is a
significant improvement over the current bounds in the literature, which imply
that the generalization error grows with either the width or the depth of the
network. Moreover, it shows that the recently proposed batch normalization and
weight normalization re-parametrizations enjoy good generalization properties,
and leads to a novel network regularizer based on the network's Jacobian
matrix. The analysis is supported with experimental results on the MNIST,
CIFAR-10, LaRED and ImageNet datasets.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel Riemannian manifold preconditioning approach for the
tensor completion problem with rank constraint. A novel Riemannian metric or
inner product is proposed that exploits the least-squares structure of the cost
function and takes into account the structured symmetry that exists in Tucker
decomposition. The specific metric allows to use the versatile framework of
Riemannian optimization on quotient manifolds to develop preconditioned
nonlinear conjugate gradient and stochastic gradient descent algorithms for
batch and online setups, respectively. Concrete matrix representations of
various optimization-related ingredients are listed. Numerical comparisons
suggest that our proposed algorithms robustly outperform state-of-the-art
algorithms across different synthetic and real-world datasets.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the first systematic investigation of the potential
performance gains for crowd work systems, deriving from available information
at the requester about individual worker reputation. In particular, we first
formalize the optimal task assignment problem when workers' reputation
estimates are available, as the maximization of a monotone (submodular)
function subject to Matroid constraints. Then, being the optimal problem
NP-hard, we propose a simple but efficient greedy heuristic task allocation
algorithm. We also propose a simple &quot;maximum a-posteriori&quot; decision rule and a
decision algorithm based on message passing. Finally, we test and compare
different solutions, showing that system performance can greatly benefit from
information about workers' reputation. Our main findings are that: i) even
largely inaccurate estimates of workers' reputation can be effectively
exploited in the task assignment to greatly improve system performance; ii) the
performance of the maximum a-posteriori decision rule quickly degrades as
worker reputation estimates become inaccurate; iii) when workers' reputation
estimates are significantly inaccurate, the best performance can be obtained by
combining our proposed task assignment algorithm with the message-passing
decision algorithm.

 <dc:description>  Many automated system analysis techniques (e.g., model checking, model-based
testing) rely on first obtaining a model of the system under analysis. System
modeling is often done manually, which is often considered as a hindrance to
adopt model-based system analysis and development techniques. To overcome this
problem, researchers have proposed to automatically &quot;learn&quot; models based on
sample system executions and shown that the learned models can be useful
sometimes. There are however many questions to be answered. For instance, how
much shall we generalize from the observed samples and how fast would learning
converge? Or, would the analysis result based on the learned model be more
accurate than the estimation we could have obtained by sampling many system
executions within the same amount of time? In this work, we investigate
existing algorithms for learning probabilistic models for model checking,
propose an evolution-based approach for better controlling the degree of
generalization and conduct an empirical study in order to answer the questions.
One of our findings is that the effectiveness of learning may sometimes be
limited.

networks for feature extraction were made---for the continuous-time case---in
Mallat, 2012, and Wiatowski and B\&quot;olcskei, 2015. This paper considers the
discrete case, introduces new convolutional neural network architectures, and
proposes a mathematical framework for their analysis. Specifically, we
establish deformation and translation sensitivity results of local and global
nature, and we investigate how certain structural properties of the input
signal are reflected in the corresponding feature vectors. Our theory applies
to general filters and general Lipschitz-continuous non-linearities and pooling
operators. Experiments on handwritten digit classification and facial landmark
detection---including feature importance evaluation---complement the
theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a new algorithm, termed \emph{truncated amplitude flow}
(TAF), to recover an unknown vector $\bm{x}$ from a system of quadratic
equations of the form $y_i=|\langle\bm{a}_i,\bm{x}\rangle|^2$, where
$\bm{a}_i$'s are given random measurement vectors. This problem is known to be
\emph{NP-hard} in general. We prove that as soon as the number of equations is
on the order of the number of unknowns, TAF recovers the solution exactly (up
to a global unimodular constant) with high probability and complexity growing
linearly with both the number of unknowns and the number of equations. Our TAF
approach adopts the \emph{amplitude-based} empirical loss function, and
proceeds in two stages. In the first stage, we introduce an
\emph{orthogonality-promoting} initialization that can be obtained with a few
power iterations. Stage two refines the initial estimate by successive updates
of scalable \emph{truncated generalized gradient iterations}, which are able to
handle the rather challenging nonconvex and nonsmooth amplitude-based objective
function. In particular, when vectors $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{a}_i$'s are
real-valued, our gradient truncation rule provably eliminates erroneously
estimated signs with high probability to markedly improve upon its untruncated
version. Numerical tests using synthetic data and real images demonstrate that
our initialization returns more accurate and robust estimates relative to
spectral initializations. Furthermore, even under the same initialization, the
proposed amplitude-based refinement outperforms existing Wirtinger flow
variants, corroborating the superior performance of TAF over state-of-the-art
algorithms.

 <dc:title>A counterexample to Thiagarajan's conjecture on regular event structures</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We provide a counterexample to a conjecture by Thiagarajan (1996 and 2002)
that regular event structures correspond exactly to event structures obtained
as unfoldings of finite 1-safe Petri nets. The same counterexample is used to
disprove a closely related conjecture by Badouel, Darondeau, and Raoult (1999)
that domains of regular event structures with bounded $\natural$-cliques are
recognizable by finite trace automata. Event structures, trace automata, and
Petri nets are fundamental models in concurrency theory. There exist nice
interpretations of these structures as combinatorial and geometric objects.
Namely, from a graph theoretical point of view, the domains of prime event
structures correspond exactly to median graphs; from a geometric point of view,
these domains are in bijection with CAT(0) cube complexes.
  A necessary condition for both conjectures to be true is that domains of
regular event structures (with bounded $\natural$-cliques) admit a regular nice
labeling. To disprove these conjectures, we describe a regular event domain
(with bounded $\natural$-cliques) that does not admit a regular nice labeling.
Our counterexample is derived from an example by Wise (1996 and 2007) of a
nonpositively curved square complex whose universal cover is a CAT(0) square
complex containing a particular plane with an aperiodic tiling. We prove that
other counterexamples to Thiagarajan's conjecture arise from aperiodic 4-way
deterministic tile sets of Kari and Papasoglu (1999) and Lukkarila (2009).
  On the positive side, using breakthrough results by Agol (2013) and Haglund
and Wise (2008, 2012) from geometric group theory, we prove that Thiagarajan's
conjecture is true for regular event structures whose domains occur as
principal filters of hyperbolic CAT(0) cube complexes which are universal
covers of finite nonpositively curved cube complexes.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we initiate the study of adaptive composition in differential
privacy when the length of the composition, and the privacy parameters
themselves can be chosen adaptively, as a function of the outcome of previously
run analyses. This case is much more delicate than the setting covered by
existing composition theorems, in which the algorithms themselves can be chosen
adaptively, but the privacy parameters must be fixed up front. Indeed, it isn't
even clear how to define differential privacy in the adaptive parameter
setting. We proceed by defining two objects which cover the two main use cases
of composition theorems. A privacy filter is a stopping time rule that allows
an analyst to halt a computation before his pre-specified privacy budget is
exceeded. A privacy odometer allows the analyst to track realized privacy loss
as he goes, without needing to pre-specify a privacy budget. We show that
unlike the case in which privacy parameters are fixed, in the adaptive
parameter setting, these two use cases are distinct. We show that there exist
privacy filters with bounds comparable (up to constants) with existing privacy
composition theorems. We also give a privacy odometer that nearly matches
non-adaptive private composition theorems, but is sometimes worse by a small
asymptotic factor. Moreover, we show that this is inherent, and that any valid
privacy odometer in the adaptive parameter setting must lose this factor, which
shows a formal separation between the filter and odometer use-cases.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we model an extended DC state estimation (SE) in an electric
power system as a factor graph (FG) and solve it using belief propagation (BP)
algorithm. The DC model comprises bus voltage angles as state variables, while
the extended DC model includes bus voltage angles and bus voltage magnitudes as
state variables. By applying BP to solve the SE problem in the extended DC
model, we obtain a Gaussian BP scenario for which we derive closed-form
expressions for BP messages exchanged along the FG. The performance of the BP
algorithm is demonstrated for the IEEE 14 bus test case. Finally, the
application of BP algorithm on the extended DC scenario provides significant
insights into a fundamental structure of BP equations in more complex models
such as the AC model - the topic we will investigate in our follow up work. As
a side-goal of this paper, we aim at thorough and detailed presentation on
applying BP on the SE problem in order to make the powerful BP algorithm more
accessible and applicable within the power-engineering community.

 <dc:description>  In this letter, we provide the construction of repairable fountain codes
(RFCs) for distributed storage systems that are information-theoretically
secure against an eavesdropper that has access to the data stored in a subset
of the storage nodes and the data downloaded to repair an additional subset of
storage nodes. The security is achieved by adding random symbols to the
message, which is then encoded by the concatenation of a Gabidulin code and an
RFC. We compare the achievable code rates of the proposed codes with those of
secure minimum storage regenerating codes and secure locally repairable codes.

 <dc:description>  Traditional intra prediction usually utilizes the nearest reference line to
generate the predicted block when considering strong spatial correlation.
However, this kind of single line-based method does not always work well due to
at least two issues. One is the incoherence caused by the signal noise or the
texture of other object, where this texture deviates from the inherent texture
of the current block. The other reason is that the nearest reference line
usually has worse reconstruction quality in block-based video coding. Due to
these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient multiple line-based intra
prediction scheme to improve coding efficiency. Besides the nearest reference
line, further reference lines are also utilized. The further reference lines
with relatively higher quality can provide potential better prediction. At the
same time, the residue compensation is introduced to calibrate the prediction
of boundary regions in a block when we utilize further reference lines. To
speed up the encoding process, this paper designs several fast algorithms.
Experimental results show that, compared with HM-16.9, the proposed fast search
method achieves 2.0% bit saving on average and up to 3.7%, with increasing the
encoding time by 112%.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Wireless systems using low-power wireless communication protocol are rapidly
gain popularity in the license-free industrial scientific, and medical (ISM)
frequency bands. One such emerging trend in ISM frequency bands is home
automation. Historically, all the home devices were once unconnected, today are
now being connected either by a wired or wireless connection. The low-power
wireless communication protocols enable integration of all the digital home
devices into a single system and enhance end user product experience. The rapid
prototyping of these end user product using programmable radio system such as
software-defined radio (SDR) has been the game-changer in the field of home
automation. In this article, we present an overview of popular ISM bands in
different regions of the world. Furthermore, we analyze the signals from the
wireless electric switch using a software-defined radio in 433 MHz ISM band.

 <dc:description>  Information delivery using chemical molecules is an integral part of biology
at multiple distance scales and has attracted recent interest in bioengineering
and communication. The collective signal strength at the receiver (i.e., the
expected number of observed molecules inside the receiver), resulting from a
large number of transmitters at random distances (e.g., due to mobility), can
have a major impact on the reliability and efficiency of the molecular
communication system. Modeling the collective signal from multiple diffusion
sources can be computationally and analytically challenging. In this paper, we
present the first tractable analytical model for the collective signal strength
due to randomly-placed transmitters, whose positions are modelled as a
homogeneous Poisson point process in three-dimensional (3D) space. By applying
stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the expected number
of observed molecules at a fully absorbing receiver and a passive receiver. Our
results reveal that the collective signal strength at both types of receivers
increases proportionally with increasing transmitter density. The proposed
framework dramatically simplifies the analysis of large-scale molecular systems
in both communication and biological applications.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we propose an energy-efficient camera-based gesture recognition
system powered by light energy for &quot;always on&quot; applications. Low energy
consumption is achieved by directly extracting gesture features from the
compressed measurements, which are the block averages and the linear
combinations of the image sensor's pixel values. The gestures are recognized
using a nearest-neighbour (NN) classifier followed by Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW). The system has been implemented on an Analog Devices Black Fin ULP
vision processor and powered by PV cells whose output is regulated by TI's
DC-DC buck converter with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT). Measured data
reveals that with only 400 compressed measurements (768x compression ratio) per
frame, the system is able to recognize key wake-up gestures with greater than
80% accuracy and only 95mJ of energy per frame. Owing to its fully self-powered
operation, the proposed system can find wide applications in &quot;always-on&quot; vision
systems such as in surveillance, robotics and consumer electronics with
touch-less operation.

 <dc:description>  Genomic and metagenomic fields, generating huge sets of short genomic
sequences, brought their own share of high performance problems. To extract
relevant pieces of information from the huge data sets generated by current
sequencing techniques, one must rely on extremely scalable methods and
solutions. Indexing billions of objects is a task considered too expensive
while being a fundamental need in this field. In this paper we propose a
straightforward indexing structure that scales to billions of element and we
propose two direct applications in genomics and metagenomics. We show that our
proposal solves problem instances for which no other known solution scales-up.
We believe that many tools and applications could benefit from either the
fundamental data structure we provide or from the applications developed from
this structure.

 <dc:description>  In multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC) WMNs, interference alleviation is
affected through several network design techniques e.g., channel assignment
(CA), link scheduling, routing etc., intelligent CA schemes being the most
effective tool for interference mitigation. CA in WMNs is an NP-Hard problem,
and makes optimality a desired yet elusive goal in real-time deployments which
are characterized by fast transmission and switching times and minimal
end-to-end latency. The trade-off between optimal performance and minimal
response times is often achieved through CA schemes that employ heuristics to
propose efficient solutions. WMN configuration and physical layout are also
crucial factors which decide network performance, and it has been demonstrated
in numerous research works that rectangular/square grid WMNs outperform random
or unplanned WMN deployments in terms of network capacity, latency, and network
resilience. In this work, we propose a smart heuristic approach to devise a
near-optimal CA algorithm for grid WMNs (NOCAG). We demonstrate the efficacy of
NOCAG by evaluating its performance against the minimal-interference CA
generated through a rudimentary brute-force technique (BFCA), for the same WMN
configuration. We assess its ability to mitigate interference both,
theoretically (through interference estimation metrics) and experimentally (by
running rigorous simulations in NS-3). We demonstrate that the performance of
NOCAG is almost as good as the BFCA, at a minimal computational overhead of
O(n) compared to the exponential of BFCA.

 <dc:title>Aerial image geolocalization from recognition and matching of roads and

 <dc:description>  Aerial image analysis at a semantic level is important in many applications
with strong potential impact in industry and consumer use, such as automated
mapping, urban planning, real estate and environment monitoring, or disaster
relief. The problem is enjoying a great interest in computer vision and remote
sensing, due to increased computer power and improvement in automated image
understanding algorithms. In this paper we address the task of automatic
geolocalization of aerial images from recognition and matching of roads and
intersections. Our proposed method is a novel contribution in the literature
that could enable many applications of aerial image analysis when GPS data is
not available. We offer a complete pipeline for geolocalization, from the
detection of roads and intersections, to the identification of the enclosing
geographic region by matching detected intersections to previously learned
manually labeled ones, followed by accurate geometric alignment between the
detected roads and the manually labeled maps. We test on a novel dataset with
aerial images of two European cities and use the publicly available
OpenStreetMap project for collecting ground truth roads annotations. We show in
extensive experiments that our approach produces highly accurate localizations
in the challenging case when we train on images from one city and test on the
other and the quality of the aerial images is relatively poor. We also show
that the the alignment between detected roads and pre-stored manual annotations
can be effectively used for improving the quality of the road detection
results.

to reduce the communication overhead caused by exchanging parameters. Finally,
we release the framework as open-source for further research on distributed
deep learning

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a solution to an AC state estimation problem in
electric power systems using a fully distributed Gauss-Newton method. The
proposed method is placed within the context of factor graphs and belief
propagation algorithms and closed-form expressions for belief propagation
messages exchanged along the factor graph are derived. The obtained algorithm
provides the same solution as the conventional weighted least-squares state
estimation. Using a simple example, we provide a step-by-step presentation of
the proposed algorithm. Finally, we discuss the convergence behaviour using the
IEEE 14 bus test case.

 <dc:description>  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have drawn interest from machine learning
researchers because of their effectiveness at preserving past inputs for
time-varying data processing tasks. To understand the success and limitations
of RNNs, it is critical that we advance our analysis of their fundamental
memory properties. We focus on echo state networks (ESNs), which are RNNs with
simple memoryless nodes and random connectivity. In most existing analyses, the
short-term memory (STM) capacity results conclude that the ESN network size
must scale linearly with the input size for unstructured inputs. The main
contribution of this paper is to provide general results characterizing the STM
capacity for linear ESNs with multidimensional input streams when the inputs
have common low-dimensional structure: sparsity in a basis or significant
statistical dependence between inputs. In both cases, we show that the number
of nodes in the network must scale linearly with the information rate and
poly-logarithmically with the ambient input dimension. The analysis relies on
advanced applications of random matrix theory and results in explicit
non-asymptotic bounds on the recovery error. Taken together, this analysis
provides a significant step forward in our understanding of the STM properties
in RNNs.

 <dc:description>  Lung cancer accounts for the highest number of cancer deaths globally. Early
diagnosis of lung nodules is very important to reduce the mortality rate of
patients by improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. This work
proposes an automated system to classify lung nodules as malignant and benign
in CT images. It presents extensive experimental results using a combination of
geometric and histogram lung nodule image features and different linear and
non-linear discriminant classifiers. The proposed approach is experimentally
validated on the LIDC-IDRI public lung cancer screening thoracic computed
tomography (CT) dataset containing nodule level diagnostic data. The obtained
results are very encouraging correctly classifying 82% of malignant and 93% of
benign nodules on unseen test data at best.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the impact of intra-cell mobility on user performance in dense
networks such as that enabled by LTE-A and 5G. To this end, we consider a
homogeneous network of small cells and first show how to reduce the evaluation
of user performance to the case of a single representative cell. We then
propose simple analytical models that capture mobility through the distribution
of the residual sojourn time of mobile users in the cell. An approximate model,
based on Quasi-Stationary (QS) assumptions, is developed in order to speed up
computation in the Markovian framework. We use these models to derive the
average throughput of both mobile and static users, along with the probability
of handover for mobile users. Numerical evaluation and simulation results are
provided to assess the accuracy of the proposed models. We show, in particular,
that both classes of users benefit from a throughput gain induced by the
&quot;opportunistic&quot; displacement of mobile users among cells.

 <dc:description>  Smartphones, the devices we carry everywhere with us, are being heavily
tracked and have undoubtedly become a major threat to our privacy. As &quot;tracking
the trackers&quot; has become a necessity, various static and dynamic analysis tools
have been developed in the past. However, today, we still lack suitable tools
to detect, measure and compare the ongoing tracking across mobile OSs. To this
end, we propose MobileAppScrutinator, based on a simple yet efficient dynamic
analysis approach, that works on both Android and iOS (the two most popular OSs
today). To demonstrate the current trend in tracking, we select 140 most
representative Apps available on both Android and iOS AppStores and test them
with MobileAppScrutinator. In fact, choosing the same set of apps on both
Android and iOS also enables us to compare the ongoing tracking on these two
OSs. Finally, we also discuss the effectiveness of privacy safeguards available
on Android and iOS. We show that neither Android nor iOS privacy safeguards in
their present state are completely satisfying.

 <dc:description>  A multi-view image sequence provides a much richer capacity for object
recognition than from a single image. However, most existing solutions to
multi-view recognition typically adopt hand-crafted, model-based geometric
methods, which do not readily embrace recent trends in deep learning. We
propose to bring Convolutional Neural Networks to generic multi-view
recognition, by decomposing an image sequence into a set of image pairs,
classifying each pair independently, and then learning an object classifier by
weighting the contribution of each pair. This allows for recognition over
arbitrary camera trajectories, without requiring explicit training over the
potentially infinite number of camera paths and lengths. Building these
pairwise relationships then naturally extends to the next-best-view problem in
an active recognition framework. To achieve this, we train a second
Convolutional Neural Network to map directly from an observed image to next
viewpoint. Finally, we incorporate this into a trajectory optimisation task,
whereby the best recognition confidence is sought for a given trajectory
length. We present state-of-the-art results in both guided and unguided
multi-view recognition on the ModelNet dataset, and show how our method can be
used with depth images, greyscale images, or both.

 <dc:description>  We use smoothed analysis techniques to provide guarantees on the training
loss of Multilayer Neural Networks (MNNs) at differentiable local minima.
Specifically, we examine MNNs with piecewise linear activation functions,
quadratic loss and a single output, under mild over-parametrization. We prove
that for a MNN with one hidden layer, the training error is zero at every
differentiable local minimum, for almost every dataset and dropout-like noise
realization. We then extend these results to the case of more than one hidden
layer. Our theoretical guarantees assume essentially nothing on the training
data, and are verified numerically. These results suggest why the highly
non-convex loss of such MNNs can be easily optimized using local updates (e.g.,
stochastic gradient descent), as observed empirically.

and Seymour to show that, for every directed graph $H$ (resp.
strongly-connected directed graph $H$), the class of directed graphs that
contain $H$ as a strong minor (resp. butterfly minor, topological minor) has
the vertex-Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property in the class of tournaments. We also prove
that if $H$ is a strongly-connected directed graph, the class of directed
graphs containing $H$ as an immersion has the edge-Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property in
the class of tournaments.

 <dc:description>  We present SGDPLL(T), an algorithm that solves (among many other problems)
probabilistic inference modulo theories, that is, inference problems over
probabilistic models defined via a logic theory provided as a parameter
(currently, propositional, equalities on discrete sorts, and inequalities, more
specifically difference arithmetic, on bounded integers). While many solutions
to probabilistic inference over logic representations have been proposed,
SGDPLL(T) is simultaneously (1) lifted, (2) exact and (3) modulo theories, that
is, parameterized by a background logic theory. This offers a foundation for
extending it to rich logic languages such as data structures and relational
data. By lifted, we mean algorithms with constant complexity in the domain size
(the number of values that variables can take). We also detail a solver for
summations with difference arithmetic and show experimental results from a
scenario in which SGDPLL(T) is much faster than a state-of-the-art
probabilistic solver.

 <dc:description>  Matrix completion, where we wish to recover a low rank matrix by observing a
few entries from it, is a widely studied problem in both theory and practice
with wide applications. Most of the provable algorithms so far on this problem
have been restricted to the offline setting where they provide an estimate of
the unknown matrix using all observations simultaneously. However, in many
applications, the online version, where we observe one entry at a time and
dynamically update our estimate, is more appealing. While existing algorithms
are efficient for the offline setting, they could be highly inefficient for the
online setting.
  In this paper, we propose the first provable, efficient online algorithm for
matrix completion. Our algorithm starts from an initial estimate of the matrix
and then performs non-convex stochastic gradient descent (SGD). After every
observation, it performs a fast update involving only one row of two tall
matrices, giving near linear total runtime. Our algorithm can be naturally used
in the offline setting as well, where it gives competitive sample complexity
and runtime to state of the art algorithms. Our proofs introduce a general
framework to show that SGD updates tend to stay away from saddle surfaces and
could be of broader interests for other non-convex problems to prove tight
rates.

 <dc:description>  Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are probabilistic models over all
subsets a ground set of $N$ items. They have recently gained prominence in
several applications that rely on &quot;diverse&quot; subsets. However, their
applicability to large problems is still limited due to the $\mathcal O(N^3)$
complexity of core tasks such as sampling and learning. We enable efficient
sampling and learning for DPPs by introducing KronDPP, a DPP model whose kernel
matrix decomposes as a tensor product of multiple smaller kernel matrices. This
decomposition immediately enables fast exact sampling. But contrary to what one
may expect, leveraging the Kronecker product structure for speeding up DPP
learning turns out to be more difficult. We overcome this challenge, and derive
batch and stochastic optimization algorithms for efficiently learning the
parameters of a KronDPP.

 <dc:description>  We study the generalization properties of stochastic gradient methods for
learning with convex loss functions and linearly parameterized functions. We
show that, in the absence of penalizations or constraints, the stability and
approximation properties of the algorithm can be controlled by tuning either
the step-size or the number of passes over the data. In this view, these
parameters can be seen to control a form of implicit regularization. Numerical
results complement the theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we provide an analytic framework for computing the expected
downlink coverage probability, and the associated data rate of cellular
networks, where base stations are distributed in a random manner. The provided
expressions are in computable integral forms that accommodate generic channel
fading conditions. We develop these expressions by modelling the cellular
interference using stochastic geometry analysis, then we employ them for
comparing the coverage resulting from various channel fading conditions namely
Rayleigh and Rician fading, in addition to the fading-less channel.
Furthermore, we expand the work to accommodate the effects of random frequency
reuse on the cellular coverage and rate. Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted
to validate the theoretical analysis, where the results show a very close
match.

 <dc:description>  Nowadays, metro systems play an important role in meeting the urban
transportation demand in large cities. The understanding of passenger route
choice is critical for public transit management. The wide deployment of
Automated Fare Collection(AFC) systems opens up a new opportunity. However,
only each trip's tap-in and tap-out timestamp and stations can be directly
obtained from AFC system records; the train and route chosen by a passenger are
unknown, which are necessary to solve our problem. While existing methods work
well in some specific situations, they don't work for complicated situations.
In this paper, we propose a solution that needs no additional equipment or
human involvement than the AFC systems. We develop a probabilistic model that
can estimate from empirical analysis how the passenger flows are dispatched to
different routes and trains. We validate our approach using a large scale data
set collected from the Shenzhen metro system. The measured results provide us
with useful inputs when building the passenger path choice model.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a novel state of the art system for automatic
downbeat tracking from music signals. The audio signal is first segmented in
frames which are synchronized at the tatum level of the music. We then extract
different kind of features based on harmony, melody, rhythm and bass content to
feed convolutional neural networks that are adapted to take advantage of each
feature characteristics. This ensemble of neural networks is combined to obtain
one downbeat likelihood per tatum. The downbeat sequence is finally decoded
with a flexible and efficient temporal model which takes advantage of the
metrical continuity of a song. We then perform an evaluation of our system on a
large base of 9 datasets, compare its performance to 4 other published
algorithms and obtain a significant increase of 16.8 percent points compared to
the second best system, for altogether a moderate cost in test and training.
The influence of each step of the method is studied to show its strengths and
shortcomings.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we invest the domain transfer learning problem with
multi-instance data. We assume we already have a well-trained multi-instance
dictionary and its corresponding classifier from the source domain, which can
be used to represent and classify the bags. But it cannot be directly used to
the target domain. Thus we propose to adapt them to the target domain by adding
an adaptive term to the source domain classifier. The adaptive function is a
linear function based a domain transfer multi-instance dictionary. Given a
target domain bag, we first map it to a bag-level feature space using the
domain transfer dictionary, and then apply a the linear adaptive function to
its bag-level feature vector. To learn the domain-transfer dictionary and the
adaptive function parameter, we simultaneously minimize the average
classification error of the target domain classifier over the target domain
training set, and the complexities of both the adaptive function parameter and
the domain transfer dictionary. The minimization problem is solved by an
iterative algorithm which update the dictionary and the function parameter
alternately. Experiments over several benchmark data sets show the advantage of
the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art domain transfer
multi-instance learning methods.

 <dc:description>  In this work, we present a novel 3D-Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
architecture called I2I-3D that predicts boundary location in volumetric data.
Our fine-to-fine, deeply supervised framework addresses three critical issues
to 3D boundary detection: (1) efficient, holistic, end-to-end volumetric label
training and prediction (2) precise voxel-level prediction to capture fine
scale structures prevalent in medical data and (3) directed multi-scale,
multi-level feature learning. We evaluate our approach on a dataset consisting
of 93 medical image volumes with a wide variety of anatomical regions and
vascular structures. In the process, we also introduce HED-3D, a 3D extension
of the state-of-the-art 2D edge detector (HED). We show that our deep learning
approach out-performs, the current state-of-the-art in 3D vascular boundary
detection (structured forests 3D), by a large margin, as well as HED applied to
slices, and HED-3D while successfully localizing fine structures. With our
approach, boundary detection takes about one minute on a typical 512x512x512
volume.

 <dc:description>  Pull voting is a classic method to reach consensus among $n$ vertices with
differing opinions in a distributed network: each vertex at each step takes on
the opinion of a random neighbour. This method, however, suffers from two
drawbacks. Even if there are only two opposing opinions, the time taken for a
single opinion to emerge can be slow and the final opinion is not necessarily
the initially held majority.
  We refer to a protocol where 2 neighbours are contacted at each step as a
2-sample voting protocol. In the two-sample protocol a vertex updates its
opinion only if both sampled opinions are the same. Not much was known about
the performance of two-sample voting on general expanders in the case of three
or more opinions. In this paper we show that the following performance can be
achieved on a $d$-regular expander using two-sample voting. We suppose there
are $k \ge 3$ opinions, and that the initial size of the largest and second
largest opinions is $A_1, A_2$ respectively.
  We prove that, if $A_1 - A_2 \ge C n \max\{\sqrt{(\log n)/A_1}, \lambda\}$,
where $\lambda$ is the absolute second eigenvalue of matrix $P=Adj(G)/d$ and
$C$ is a suitable constant, then the largest opinion wins in $O((n \log
n)/A_1)$ steps with high probability.
  For almost all $d$-regular graphs, we have $\lambda=c/\sqrt{d}$ for some
constant $c&gt;0$. This means that as $d$ increases we can separate an opinion
whose majority is $o(n)$, whereas $\Theta(n)$ majority is required for $d$
constant.
  This work generalizes the results of Becchetti et. al (SPAA 2014) for the
complete graph $K_n$.

 <dc:description>  What drives the propensity for the social network dynamics? Social influence
is believed to drive both off-line and on-line human behavior, however it has
not been considered as a driver of social network evolution. Our analysis
suggest that, while the network structure affects the spread of influence in
social networks, the network is in turn shaped by social influence activity
(i.e., the process of social influence wherein one person's attitudes and
behaviors affect another's). To that end, we develop a novel model of network
evolution where the dynamics of network follow the mechanism of influence
propagation, which are not captured by the existing network evolution models.
Our experiments confirm the predictions of our model and demonstrate the
important role that social influence can play in the process of network
evolution. As well exploring the reason of social network evolution, different
genres of social influence have been spotted having different effects on the
network dynamics. These findings and methods are essential to both our
understanding of the mechanisms that drive network evolution and our knowledge
of the role of social influence in shaping the network structure.

 <dc:description>  Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry heavily reuses third party IP
cores. These IP cores are vulnerable to insertion of Hardware Trojans (HTs) at
design time by third party IP core providers or by malicious insiders in the
design team. State of the art research has shown that existing HT detection
techniques, which claim to detect all publicly available HT benchmarks, can
still be defeated by carefully designing new sophisticated HTs. The reason
being that these techniques consider the HT landscape to be limited only to the
publicly known HT benchmarks, or other similar (simple) HTs. However the
adversary is not limited to these HTs and may devise new HT design principles
to bypass these countermeasures.
  In this paper, we discover certain crucial properties of HTs which lead to
the definition of an exponentially large class of Deterministic Hardware
Trojans $H_D$ that an adversary can (but is not limited to) design. The
discovered properties serve as HT design principles, based on which we design a
new HT called 'XOR-LFSR' and present it as a 'proof-of-concept' example from
the class $H_D$. These design principles help us understand the tremendous ways
an adversary has to design a HT, and show that the existing publicly known HT
benchmarks are just the tip of the iceberg on this huge landscape. This work,
therefore, stresses that instead of guaranteeing a certain (low) false negative
rate for a small constant set of publicly known HTs, a rigorous HT detection
tool should take into account these newly discovered HT design principles and
hence guarantee the detection of an exponentially large class (exponential in
number of wires in IP core) of HTs with negligible false negative rate.

 <dc:description>  What can we learn about controlling a system solely from its underlying
network structure? Here we adapt a recently developed framework for control of
networks governed by a broad class of nonlinear dynamics that includes the
major dynamic models of biological, technological, and social processes. This
feedback-based framework provides realizable node overrides that steer a system
towards any of its natural long term dynamic behaviors, regardless of the
specific functional forms and system parameters. We use this framework on
several real networks, identify the topological characteristics that underlie
the predicted node overrides, and compare its predictions to those of
structural controllability in control theory. Finally, we demonstrate this
framework's applicability in dynamic models of gene regulatory networks and
identify nodes whose override is necessary for control in the general case, but
not in specific model instances.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, a novel method is exposed to improve the performance of the
Golden code, by using octagonal reconfigurable isolated orthogonal element
(ORIOL) antennas, instead of a conventional microstrip patch antenna. The
aforementioned antenna, should be employed in both the transmitter and the
receiver sides, to approach the mentioned improvement. As a matter fact, in
this paper, we recommend space-time-polarization diversity instead of
space-time singly; therefore it is obvious that by employing the aforementioned
technique, the system obtains more strength against destructive fading. The
simulations for different rates have confirmed that, utilizing ORIOL antenna
outperforms patch microstrip one, which is roughly about $2$ to $3$ dB,
according to the rates.

 <dc:description>  We initiate the systematic study of the energy complexity of algorithms (in
addition to time and space complexity) based on Landauer's Principle in
physics, which gives a lower bound on the amount of energy a system must
dissipate if it destroys information. We propose energy-aware variations of
three standard models of computation: circuit RAM, word RAM, and
transdichotomous RAM. On top of these models, we build familiar high-level
primitives such as control logic, memory allocation, and garbage collection
with zero energy complexity and only constant-factor overheads in space and
time complexity, enabling simple expression of energy-efficient algorithms. We
analyze several classic algorithms in our models and develop low-energy
variations: comparison sort, insertion sort, counting sort, breadth-first
search, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, matrix all-pairs shortest paths, AVL
trees, binary heaps, and dynamic arrays. We explore the time/space/energy
trade-off and develop several general techniques for analyzing algorithms and
reducing their energy complexity. These results lay a theoretical foundation
for a new field of semi-reversible computing and provide a new framework for
the investigation of algorithms.

 <dc:description>  The urban sound environment of New York City (NYC) can be, amongst other
things: loud, intrusive, exciting and dynamic. As indicated by the large
majority of noise complaints registered with the NYC 311 information/complaints
line, the urban sound environment has a profound effect on the quality of life
of the city's inhabitants. To monitor and ultimately understand these sonic
environments, a process of long-term acoustic measurement and analysis is
required. The traditional method of environmental acoustic monitoring utilizes
short term measurement periods using expensive equipment, setup and operated by
experienced and costly personnel. In this paper a different approach is
proposed to this application which implements a smart, low-cost, static,
acoustic sensing device based around consumer hardware. These devices can be
deployed in numerous and varied urban locations for long periods of time,
allowing for the collection of longitudinal urban acoustic data. The varied
environmental conditions of urban settings make for a challenge in gathering
calibrated sound pressure level data for prospective stakeholders. This paper
details the sensors' design, development and potential future applications,
with a focus on the calibration of the devices' Microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) microphone in order to generate reliable decibel levels at the
type/class 2 level.

 <dc:description>  Performance of nuclear threat detection systems based on gamma-ray
spectrometry often strongly depends on the ability to identify the part of
measured signal that can be attributed to background radiation. We have
successfully applied a method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to
obtain a compact null-space model of background spectra using PCA projection
residuals to derive a source detection score. We have shown the method's
utility in a threat detection system using mobile spectrometers in urban scenes
(Tandon et al 2012). While it is commonly assumed that measured photon counts
follow a Poisson process, standard PCA makes a Gaussian assumption about the
data distribution, which may be a poor approximation when photon counts are
low. This paper studies whether and in what conditions PCA with a Poisson-based
loss function (Poisson PCA) can outperform standard Gaussian PCA in modeling
background radiation to enable more sensitive and specific nuclear threat
detection.

 <dc:description>  We propose a low cost and effective way to combine a free simulation software
and free CAD models for modeling human-object interaction in order to improve
human &amp; object segmentation. It is intended for research scenarios related to
safe human-robot collaboration (SHRC) and interaction (SHRI) in the industrial
domain. The task of human and object modeling has been used for detecting
activity, and for inferring and predicting actions, different from those works,
we do human and object modeling in order to learn interactions in RGB-D data
for improving segmentation. For this purpose, we define a novel density
function to model a three dimensional (3D) scene in a virtual environment
(VREP). This density function takes into account various possible
configurations of human-object and object-object relationships and interactions
governed by their affordances. Using this function, we synthesize a large,
realistic and highly varied synthetic RGB-D dataset that we use for training.
We train a random forest classifier, and the pixelwise predictions obtained is
integrated as a unary term in a pairwise conditional random fields (CRF). Our
evaluation shows that modeling these interactions improves segmentation
performance by ~7\% in mean average precision and recall over state-of-the-art
methods that ignore these interactions in real-world data. Our approach is
computationally efficient, robust and can run real-time on consumer hardware.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Programming Languages</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We introduce a new programming language for expressing reversibility,
Energy-Efficient Language (Eel), geared toward algorithm design and
implementation. Eel is the first language to take advantage of a partially
reversible computation model, where programs can be composed of both reversible
and irreversible operations. In this model, irreversible operations cost energy
for every bit of information created or destroyed. To handle programs of
varying degrees of reversibility, Eel supports a log stack to automatically
trade energy costs for space costs, and introduces many powerful control logic
operators including protected conditional, general conditional, protected
loops, and general loops. In this paper, we present the design and compiler for
the three language levels of Eel along with an interpreter to simulate and
annotate incurred energy costs of a program.

 <dc:description>  In imitation learning, an agent learns how to behave in an environment with
an unknown cost function by mimicking expert demonstrations. Existing imitation
learning algorithms typically involve solving a sequence of planning or
reinforcement learning problems. Such algorithms are therefore not directly
applicable to large, high-dimensional environments, and their performance can
significantly degrade if the planning problems are not solved to optimality.
Under the apprenticeship learning formalism, we develop alternative model-free
algorithms for finding a parameterized stochastic policy that performs at least
as well as an expert policy on an unknown cost function, based on sample
trajectories from the expert. Our approach, based on policy gradients, scales
to large continuous environments with guaranteed convergence to local minima.

 <dc:title>Open Problem: Best Arm Identification: Almost Instance-Wise Optimality
  and the Gap Entropy Conjecture</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Lijie</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Li, Jian</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The best arm identification problem (BEST-1-ARM) is the most basic pure
exploration problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits. The problem has a long
history and attracted significant attention for the last decade. However, we do
not yet have a complete understanding of the optimal sample complexity of the
problem: The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of
$O(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}(\ln\delta^{-1} + \ln\ln\Delta_i^{-1}))$
($\Delta_{i}$ is the difference between the largest mean and the $i^{th}$
mean), while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\sum_{i=2}^{n}
\Delta_{i}^{-2}\ln\delta^{-1})$ for general instances and $\Omega(\Delta^{-2}
\ln\ln \Delta^{-1})$ for the two-arm instances. We propose to study the
instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem. Previous work has proved
that it is impossible to have an instance optimal algorithm for the 2-arm
problem. However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term
$\Omega(\Delta_2^{-2} \ln\ln \Delta_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worst
case lower bound for the 2-arm problem), there is an instance optimal algorithm
for BEST-1-ARM. Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropy
for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wise
lower bound. Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer to
the old and basic problem.

 <dc:description>  Appreciation systems--platforms for users to exchange thanks and praise--are
becoming common in the workplace, where employees share appreciation, managers
are notified, and aggregate scores are sometimes made visible. Who do people
thank on these systems, and what do they expect from each other and their
managers? After introducing the design affordances of 13 appreciation systems,
we discuss a system we call Gratia, in use at a large multinational company for
over four years. Using logs of 422,000 appreciation messages and user surveys,
we explore the social dynamics of use and ask if use of the system addresses
the recognition problem. We find that while thanks is mostly exchanged among
employees at the same level and different parts of the company, addressing the
recognition problem, managers do not always act on that recognition in ways
that employees expect.

 <dc:description>  Cartograms combine statistical and geographical information in thematic maps,
where areas of geographical regions (e.g., countries, states) are scaled in
proportion to some statistic (e.g., population, income). Cartograms make it
possible to gain insight into patterns and trends in the world around us and
have been very popular visualizations for geo-referenced data for over a
century. This work surveys cartogram research in visualization, cartography and
geometry, covering a broad spectrum of different cartogram types: from the
traditional rectangular and table cartograms, to Dorling and diffusion
cartograms. A particular focus is the study of the major cartogram dimensions:
statistical accuracy, geographical accuracy, and topological accuracy. We
review the history of cartograms, describe the algorithms for generating them,
and consider task taxonomies. We also review quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, and we use these to arrive at design guidelines and research
challenges.

 <dc:description>  The recovery of a signal from the magnitude of its Fourier transform, also
known as phase retrieval, is of fundamental importance in many scientific
fields. It is well known that due to the loss of Fourier phase the problem in
1D is ill-posed. Without further constraints, there is no unique solution to
the problem. In contrast, uniqueness up to trivial ambiguities very often
exists in higher dimensions, with mild constraints on the input. In this paper
we focus on the 2D phase retrieval problem and provide insight into this
uniqueness property by exploring the connection between the 2D and 1D
formulations. In particular, we show that 2D phase retrieval can be cast as a
1D problem with additional constraints, which limit the solution space. We then
prove that only one additional constraint is sufficient to reduce the many
feasible solutions in the 1D setting to a unique solution for almost all
signals. These results allow to obtain an analytical approach (with
combinatorial complexity) to solve the 2D phase retrieval problem when it is
unique.

locally-biased graph-based learning called SimpleLocal, which finds good
conductance cuts near a set of seed vertices. An important feature of our
algorithm is that it is strongly-local, meaning it does not need to explore the
entire graph to find cuts that are locally optimal. This method solves the same
objective as existing strongly-local flow-based methods, but it enables a
simple implementation. We also show how it achieves localization through an
implicit L1-norm penalty term. As a flow-based method, our algorithm exhibits
several ad- vantages in terms of cut optimality and accurate identification of
target regions in a graph. We demonstrate the power of SimpleLocal by solving
problems on a 467 million edge graph based on an MRI scan.

 <dc:description>  Recently, there has been considerable progress on designing algorithms with
provable guarantees -- typically using linear algebraic methods -- for
parameter learning in latent variable models. But designing provable algorithms
for inference has proven to be more challenging. Here we take a first step
towards provable inference in topic models. We leverage a property of topic
models that enables us to construct simple linear estimators for the unknown
topic proportions that have small variance, and consequently can work with
short documents. Our estimators also correspond to finding an estimate around
which the posterior is well-concentrated. We show lower bounds that for shorter
documents it can be information theoretically impossible to find the hidden
topics. Finally, we give empirical results that demonstrate that our algorithm
works on realistic topic models. It yields good solutions on synthetic data and
runs in time comparable to a {\em single} iteration of Gibbs sampling.

 <dc:description>  With the widespread use of mobile computing devices in contemporary society,
our trajectories in the physical space and virtual world are increasingly
closely connected. Using the anonymous smartphone data of $1 \times 10^5$ users
in 30 days, we constructed the mobility network and the attention network to
study the correlations between online and offline human behaviours. In the
mobility network, nodes are physical locations and edges represent the
movements between locations, and in the attention network, nodes are websites
and edges represent the switch of users between websites. We apply the
box-covering method to renormalise the networks. The investigated network
properties include the size of box $l_B$ and the number of boxes $N(l_B)$. We
find two universal classes of behaviours: the mobility network is featured by a
small-world property, $N(l_B) \simeq e^{-l_B}$, whereas the attention network
is characterised by a self-similar property $N(l_B) \simeq l_B^{-\gamma}$. In
particular, with the increasing of the length of box $l_B$, the degree
correlation of the network changes from positive to negative which indicates
that there are two layers of structure in the mobility network. We use the
results of network renormalisation to detect the community and map the
structure of the mobility network. Further, we located the most relevant
websites visited in these communities, and identified three typical
location-based behaviours, including the shopping, dating, and taxi-calling.
Finally, we offered a revised geometric network model to explain our findings
in the perspective of spatial-constrained attachment.

 <dc:description>  Identification of regions of interest (ROI) associated with certain disease
has a great impact on public health. Imposing sparsity of pixel values and
extracting active regions simultaneously greatly complicate the image analysis.
We address these challenges by introducing a novel region-selection penalty in
the framework of image-on-scalar regression. Our penalty combines the Smoothly
Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) regularization, enforcing sparsity, and the
SCAD of total variation (TV) regularization, enforcing spatial contiguity, into
one group, which segments contiguous spatial regions against zero-valued
background. Efficient algorithm is based on the alternative direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) which decomposes the non-convex problem into two iterative
optimization problems with explicit solutions. Another virtue of the proposed
method is that a divide and conquer learning algorithm is developed, thereby
allowing scaling to large images. Several examples are presented and the
experimental results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.

 <dc:description>  It has been proven that transfer learning provides an easy way to achieve
state-of-the-art accuracies on several vision tasks by training a simple
classifier on top of features obtained from pre-trained neural networks. The
goal of this work is to generate better features for transfer learning from
multiple publicly available pre-trained neural networks. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture called Stacked Neural Networks which leverages the
fast training time of transfer learning while simultaneously being much more
accurate. We show that using a stacked NN architecture can result in up to 8%
improvements in accuracy over state-of-the-art techniques using only one
pre-trained network for transfer learning. A second aim of this work is to make
network fine- tuning retain the generalizability of the base network to unseen
tasks. To this end, we propose a new technique called &quot;joint fine-tuning&quot; that
is able to give accuracies comparable to finetuning the same network
individually over two datasets. We also show that a jointly finetuned network
generalizes better to unseen tasks when compared to a network finetuned over a
single task.

 <dc:description>  In energy harvesting (EH) network, the energy storage devices (i.e.,
batteries) are usually not perfect. In this paper, we consider a practical
battery model with finite battery capacity, energy (dis-)charging loss, and
energy dissipation. Taking into account such battery imperfections, we rely on
the Lyapunov optimization technique to develop a stochastic online control
scheme that aims to maximize the utility of data rates for EH multi-hop
wireless networks. It is established that the proposed algorithm can provide a
feasible and efficient data admission, power allocation, routing and scheduling
solution, without requiring any statistical knowledge of the stochastic
channel, data-traffic, and EH processes. Numerical results demonstrate the
merit of the proposed scheme.

 <dc:description>  In a heterogeneous network consisting of macro base stations (MBSs) and small
base stations (SBSs), the traditional cell association policy, i.e., coupled
access (CA), is far from optimal, due to the significant difference between the
coverage and transmit powers of MBSs and SBSs. Hence, users may choose to
associate with different types of BSs in downlink (DL) and uplink (UL), i.e.,
decoupled access (DA), to enhance spectral efficiency. In this paper, DA in
multiuser MIMO communications is investigated in terms of UL spectral
efficiency. Firstly, we obtain the UL association probabilities. In contrast to
the CA scenario, association probabilities for DA scenario only depend on the
densities of BSs. Hence, DA allows UL and DL to be totally independent.
Secondly, we derive lower bounds on the spectral efficiency. The lower bounds
show that, different from CA, the UL spectral efficiency for DA scenario is
irrelative with the transmit powers of BSs, which implies DA allows users to
associate with any BSs that can achieve the highest UL spectral efficiency.
Finally, the spectral efficiencies for DA and CA scenarios are compared via
simulation results, where it can be concluded that the spectral efficiency in
multiuser MIMO systems is improved by DA.

 <dc:description>  Mobile-edge computation offloading (MECO) offloads intensive mobile
computation to clouds located at the edges of cellular networks. Thereby, MECO
is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and
enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we study
resource allocation for a multiuser MECO system based on time-division multiple
access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). First,
for the TDMA MECO system with infinite or finite computation capacity, the
optimal resource allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for
minimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under the constraint on
computation latency. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based
structure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields
priorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing
energy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given
threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Moreover, for
the cloud with finite capacity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is
proposed to reduce the computation complexity for computing the threshold.
Next, we consider the OFDMA MECO system, for which the optimal resource
allocation is formulated as a non-convex mixed-integer problem. To solve this
challenging problem and characterize its policy structure, a sub-optimal
low-complexity algorithm is proposed by transforming the OFDMA problem to its
TDMA counterpart. The corresponding resource allocation is derived by defining
an average offloading priority function and shown to have close-to-optimal
performance by simulation.

 <dc:description>  Optimal transport (OT) defines a powerful framework to compare probability
distributions in a geometrically faithful way. However, the practical impact of
OT is still limited because of its computational burden. We propose a new class
of stochastic optimization algorithms to cope with large-scale problems
routinely encountered in machine learning applications. These methods are able
to manipulate arbitrary distributions (either discrete or continuous) by simply
requiring to be able to draw samples from them, which is the typical setup in
high-dimensional learning problems. This alleviates the need to discretize
these densities, while giving access to provably convergent methods that output
the correct distance without discretization error. These algorithms rely on two
main ideas: (a) the dual OT problem can be re-cast as the maximization of an
expectation ; (b) entropic regularization of the primal OT problem results in a
smooth dual optimization optimization which can be addressed with algorithms
that have a provably faster convergence. We instantiate these ideas in three
different setups: (i) when comparing a discrete distribution to another, we
show that incremental stochastic optimization schemes can beat Sinkhorn's
algorithm, the current state-of-the-art finite dimensional OT solver; (ii) when
comparing a discrete distribution to a continuous density, a semi-discrete
reformulation of the dual program is amenable to averaged stochastic gradient
descent, leading to better performance than approximately solving the problem
by discretization ; (iii) when dealing with two continuous densities, we
propose a stochastic gradient descent over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). This is currently the only known method to solve this problem, apart
from computing OT on finite samples. We backup these claims on a set of
discrete, semi-discrete and continuous benchmark problems.

 <dc:description>  Developers often wonder how to implement a certain functionality (e.g., how
to parse XML files) using APIs. Obtaining an API usage sequence based on an
API-related natural language query is very helpful in this regard. Given a
query, existing approaches utilize information retrieval models to search for
matching API sequences. These approaches treat queries and APIs as bag-of-words
(i.e., keyword matching or word-to-word alignment) and lack a deep
understanding of the semantics of the query.
  We propose DeepAPI, a deep learning based approach to generate API usage
sequences for a given natural language query. Instead of a bags-of-words
assumption, it learns the sequence of words in a query and the sequence of
associated APIs. DeepAPI adapts a neural language model named RNN
Encoder-Decoder. It encodes a word sequence (user query) into a fixed-length
context vector, and generates an API sequence based on the context vector. We
also augment the RNN Encoder-Decoder by considering the importance of
individual APIs. We empirically evaluate our approach with more than 7 million
annotated code snippets collected from GitHub. The results show that our
approach generates largely accurate API sequences and outperforms the related
approaches.

 <dc:description>  We relate the maximum semidefinite and linear extension complexity of a
family of polytopes to the cardinality of this family and the minimum pairwise
Hausdorff distance of its members. This result directly implies a known lower
bound on the maximum semidefinite extension complexity of 0/1-polytopes. We
further show how our result can be used to improve on the corresponding bounds
known for polygons with integer vertices.
  Our geometric proof builds upon nothing else than a simple well-known
property of maximum volume inscribed ellipsoids of convex bodies. In
particular, it does not rely on factorizations over the semidefinite cone and
thus avoids involved procedures of balancing them as required, e.g., in [Briet,
Dadush &amp; Pokutta 2015]. We hope that revealing the geometry behind the
phenomenon opens doors for further results.
  Moreover, we show that the linear extension complexity of every d-dimensional
0/1-polytope is bounded from above by O(2^d / d).

 <dc:description>  Given two graphs $G$ and $H$, we say that $G$ contains $H$ as an induced
minor if a graph isomorphic to $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of
vertex deletions and edge contractions. We study the complexity of Graph
Isomorphism on graphs that exclude a fixed graph as an induced minor. More
precisely, we determine for every graph $H$ that Graph Isomorphism is
polynomial-time solvable on $H$-induced-minor-free graphs or that it is
GI-complete. Additionally, we classify those graphs $H$ for which
$H$-induced-minor-free graphs have bounded clique-width. These two results
complement similar dichotomies for graphs that exclude a fixed graph as an
induced subgraph, minor, or subgraph.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the target tracking problem for networked robotic
systems (NRSs) under sampled interaction. The target is assumed to be
time-varying and described by a second-order oscillator. Two novel distributed
controller-estimator algorithms (DCEA), which consist of both continuous and
discontinuous signals, are presented. Based on the properties of small-value
norms and Lyapunov stability theory, the conditions on the interaction
topology, the sampling period, and the other control parameters are given such
that the practical stability of the tracking error is achieved and the
stability region is regulated quantitatively. The advantages of the presented
DCEA are illustrated by comparisons with each other and the existing
coordination algorithms. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the
theoretical results.

accuracy of a deep neural network with the computational and memory
requirements. This is especially important on a constrained device unable to
hold all the weights of the network in memory.

enable people to log their travels near and far, leave notes behind, and build
a community around spaces in between destinations. Our design explores new
ground for location-based social computing systems, identifying opportunities
where these systems can foster the growth of on-line communities rooted at
non-places. In our work we develop, explore, and evaluate several innovative
features designed around four usage scenarios: daily commuting, long-distance

small-scale user studies, and one large-scale, world-wide deployment,
synthesizing the results as potential opportunities and lessons learned in
designing social computing for non-places.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, degrees of freedom (DoF) is investigated for the $M\times N$
single input single output (SISO) X channel with alternating channel state
information at the transmitters (CSIT). It is known that the sum DoF of 2-user
SISO X channel with synergistic alternating CSIT is the same as the sum DoF of
2-user $(M=N=2)$ SISO X channel with perfect CSIT [8]. In this paper, such
2-user X channel schemes are extended to the general $M\times N$ X channel. It
is shown that the proposed $M\times N$ X channel schemes with synergistic
alternating CSIT achieve $2M/(M+1)$ sum DoF. This DoF with $M=N=K$ is strictly
lager than the best known DoF for the $K$-user X channel with delayed CSIT.

 <dc:description>  Advances in E2E verifiable voting have the potential to fundamentally restore
trust in elections and democratic processes in society. In this chapter, we
provide a comprehensive introduction to the field. We trace the evolution of
privacy and verifiability properties in the research literature and describe
the operations of current state-of-the-art E2E voting systems. We also discuss
outstanding challenges to the deployment of E2E voting systems, including
technical, legal, and usability constraints.
  Our intention, in writing this chapter, has been to make the innovations in
this domain accessible to a wider audience. We have therefore eschewed
description of complex cryptographic mechanisms and instead attempt to
communicate the fundamental intuition behind the design of E2E voting systems.
We hope our work serves as a useful resource and assists in the future
development of E2E voting.

 <dc:description>  Timed Intruder Models have been proposed for the verification of
Cyber-Physical Security Protocols (CPSP) amending the traditional Dolev-Yao
intruder to obey the physical restrictions of the environment. Since to learn a
message, a Timed Intruder needs to wait for a message to arrive, mounting an
attack may depend on where Timed Intruders are. It may well be the case that in
the presence of a great number of intruders there is no attack, but there is an
attack in the presence of a small number of well placed intruders. Therefore, a
major challenge for the automated verification of CPSP is to determine how many
Timed Intruders to use and where should they be placed. This paper answers this
question by showing it is enough to use the same number of Timed Intruders as
the number of participants. We also report on some preliminary experimental
results in discovering attacks in CPSP.

 <dc:description>  Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) is a growing trend among enterprises, aiming to
improve workers' mobility and productivity via their smartphones. The threats
and dangers posed by the smartphones to the enterprise are also ever-growing.
Such dangers can be mitigated by running the enterprise software inside a
&quot;secure container&quot; on the smartphone. In our work we present a systematic
assessment of security critical areas in design and implementation of a secure
container for Android using reverse engineering and attacker-inspired methods.
We do this through a case-study of Samsung KNOX, a real-world product deployed
on millions of devices. Our research shows how KNOX security features work
behind the scenes and lets us compare the vendor's public security claims
against reality. Along the way we identified several design weaknesses and a
few vulnerabilities that were disclosed to Samsung.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Robotics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Optimal control approaches in combination with trajectory optimization have
recently proven to be a promising control strategy for legged robots.
Computationally efficient and robust algorithms were derived using simplified
models of the contact interaction between robot and environment such as the
linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM). However, as humanoid robots enter more
complex environments, less restrictive models become increasingly important. As
we leave the regime of linear models, we need to build dedicated solvers that
can compute interaction forces together with consistent kinematic plans for the
whole-body. In this paper, we address the problem of planning robot motion and
interaction forces for legged robots given predefined contact surfaces. The
motion generation process is decomposed into two alternating parts computing
force and motion plans in coherence. We focus on the properties of the momentum
computation leading to sparse optimal control formulations to be exploited by a
dedicated solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our motion generation
algorithm computes consistent contact forces and joint trajectories for our
humanoid robot. We also demonstrate the favorable time complexity due to our
formulation and composition of the momentum equations.

 <dc:description>  Dynamic network reconstruction is motivated by applications from many fields.
Due to the limits in experiments, especially in biology, it is required to use
low-sampling-frequency data to perform network inference. The paper raises the
concept of &quot;system aliasing&quot; which plays a central role when the sampling
frequency is not high enough. It focuses on the full-state measurement, which
is supposed to the basic case but has fairly shown complications. A sampling
theorem on system aliasing is presented, together with a test criterion. In the
cases of no system aliasing, an algorithm is provided to reconstruct dynamic
network from data measured with large sampling periods. Moreover, it provides
certain results in theory for the cases when system aliases are presented. As
the first tentative study, the paper dedicates to manifest the intrinsic
complexity in this problem.

 <dc:title>Maximum-expectation matching under recourse</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the expected size of a
matching in the case of unreliable vertices and/or edges. The assumption is
that upon failure, remaining vertices that have not been matched may be subject
to a new assignment. This process may be repeated a given number of times, and
the objective is to end with the overall maximum number of matched vertices.
  The origin of this problem is in kidney exchange programs, going on in
several countries, where a vertex is an incompatible patient-donor pair; the
objective is to match these pairs so as to maximize the number of served
patients. A new scheme is proposed for matching rearrangement in case of
failure, along with a prototype algorithm for computing the optimal expectation
for the number of matched vertices.
  Computational experiments reveal the relevance and limitations of the
algorithm, in general terms and for the kidney exchange application.

 <dc:description>  Hidden Markov Models (HMM) have been used for several years in many time
series analysis or pattern recognitions tasks. HMM are often trained by means
of the Baum-Welch algorithm which can be seen as a special variant of an
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. Second-order training techniques such
as Variational Bayesian Inference (VI) for probabilistic models regard the
parameters of the probabilistic models as random variables and define
distributions over these distribution parameters, hence the name of this
technique. VI can also bee regarded as a special case of an EM algorithm. In
this article, we bring both together and train HMM with multivariate Gaussian
output distributions with VI. The article defines the new training technique
for HMM. An evaluation based on some case studies and a comparison to related
approaches is part of our ongoing work.

 <dc:title>Explicit constructions of optimal-access MDS codes with nearly optimal

 <dc:creator>Ye, Min</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Barg, Alexander</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An $(n,k,l)$ MDS array code of length $n,$ dimension $k=n-r$ and
sub-packetization $l$ is formed of $l\times n$ matrices over a finite field
$F,$ with every column of the matrix stored on a separate node in a distributed
storage system and viewed as a coordinate of the codeword. Repair of a failed
node can be performed by accessing a set of $d\le n-1$ helper nodes. The code
is said to have the optimal access property if the amount of data accessed at
each of the helper nodes meets a lower bound on this quantity. For
optimal-access MDS codes with $d=n-1,$ the sub-packetization $l$ satisfies the
bound $l\ge r^{(k-1)/r}.$ In our previous work, for any $n$ and $r,$ we
presented an explicit construction of optimal-access MDS codes with
sub-packetization $l=r^{n-1}.$ In this paper we take up the question of
reducing the sub-packetization value $l$ to make it approach the lower bound.
We construct an explicit family of optimal-access codes with $l=r^{\lceil
n/r\rceil},$ which differs from the optimal value by at most a factor of $r^2.$
These codes can be constructed over any finite field $F$ as long as $|F|\ge
r\lceil n/r\rceil,$ and afford low-complexity encoding and decoding procedures.
We also define a version of the repair problem that bridges the context of
regenerating codes and codes with locality constraints (LRC codes), calling it
group repair with optimal access. In this variation, we assume that the set of
$n=sm$ nodes is partitioned into $m$ repair groups of size $s,$ and require
that the amount of accessed data for repair is the smallest possible whenever
the $d$ helper nodes include all the other $s-1$ nodes from the same group as
the failed node. For this problem, we construct a family of codes with the
group optimal access property. These codes can be constructed over any field
$F$ of size $|F|\ge n,$ and also afford low-complexity encoding and decoding
procedures.

 <dc:description>  The paper introduces sufficient conditions for input-to-state stability (ISS)
of a class of impulsive systems with jump maps that depend on time. Such
systems can naturally represent an interconnection of several impulsive systems
with different impulse time sequences. Using a concept of ISS-Lyapunov function
for subsystems a small-gain type theorem equipped with a new dwell-time
condition to verify ISS of an interconnection has been proven.

 <dc:description>  We exhibit a strong link between frequentist PAC-Bayesian risk bounds and the
Bayesian marginal likelihood. That is, for the negative log-likelihood loss
function, we show that the minimization of PAC-Bayesian generalization risk
bounds maximizes the Bayesian marginal likelihood. This provides an alternative
explanation to the Bayesian Occam's razor criteria, under the assumption that
the data is generated by an i.i.d distribution. Moreover, as the negative
log-likelihood is an unbounded loss function, we motivate and propose a
PAC-Bayesian theorem tailored for the sub-gamma loss family, and we show that
our approach is sound on classical Bayesian linear regression tasks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we consider a family of algorithms for approximate
implicitization of rational parametric curves and surfaces. The main
approximation tool in all of the approaches is the singular value
decomposition, and they are therefore well suited to floating point
implementation in computer aided geometric design (CAGD) systems. We unify the
approaches under the names of commonly known polynomial basis functions, and
consider various theoretical and practical aspects of the algorithms. We offer
new methods for a least squares approach to approximate implicitization using
orthogonal polynomials, which tend to be faster and more numerically stable
than some existing algorithms. We propose several simple propositions relating
the properties of the polynomial bases to their implicit approximation
properties.

 <dc:title>Dialogue Concerning The Two Chief World Views</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Feinstein, Craig Alan</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - General Literature</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In 1632, Galileo Galilei wrote a book called \textit{Dialogue Concerning the
Two Chief World Systems} which compared the new Copernican model of the
universe with the old Ptolemaic model. His book took the form of a dialogue
between three philosophers, Salviati, a proponent of the Copernican model,
Simplicio, a proponent of the Ptolemaic model, and Sagredo, who was initially
open-minded and neutral. In this paper, I am going to use Galileo's idea to
present a dialogue between three modern philosophers, Mr. Spock, a proponent of
the view that $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$, Professor Simpson, a proponent of
the view that $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$, and Judge Wapner, who is initially
open-minded and neutral.

 <dc:description>  In this paper we introduce CrowdSource, a statistical natural language
processing system designed to make rapid inferences about malware functionality
based on printable character strings extracted from malware binaries.
CrowdSource &quot;learns&quot; a mapping between low-level language and high-level
software functionality by leveraging millions of web technical documents from
StackExchange, a popular network of technical question and answer sites, using
this mapping to infer malware capabilities. This paper describes our approach
and provides an evaluation of its accuracy and performance, demonstrating that
it can detect at least 14 high-level malware capabilities in unpacked malware
binaries with an average per-capability f-score of 0.86 and at a rate of tens
of thousands of binaries per day on commodity hardware.

 <dc:description>  Several recent studies have demonstrated that people show large behavioural
uniqueness. This has serious privacy implications as most individuals become
increasingly re-identifiable in large datasets or can be tracked while they are
browsing the web using only a couple of their attributes, called as their
fingerprints. Often, the success of these attacks depend on explicit
constraints on the number of attributes learnable about individuals, i.e., the
size of their fingerprints. These constraints can be budget as well as
technical constraints imposed by the data holder. For instance, Apple restricts
the number of applications that can be called by another application on iOS in
order to mitigate the potential privacy threats of leaking the list of
installed applications on a device. In this work, we address the problem of
identifying the attributes (e.g., smartphone applications) that can serve as a
fingerprint of users given constraints on the size of the fingerprint. We give
the best fingerprinting algorithms in general, and evaluate their effectiveness
on several real-world datasets. Our results show that current privacy guards
limiting the number of attributes that can be queried about individuals is
insufficient to mitigate their potential privacy risks in many practical cases.

 <dc:description>  We present an approach to finding the implicit equation of a planar rational
parametric cubic curve, by defining a new basis for the representation. The
basis, which contains only four cubic bivariate polynomials, is defined in
terms of the B\'ezier control points of the curve. An explicit formula for the
coefficients of the implicit curve is given. Moreover, these coefficients lead
to simple expressions which describe aspects of the geometric behaviour of the
curve. In particular, we present an explicit barycentric formula for the
position of the double point, in terms of the B\'ezier control points of the
curve. We also give conditions for when an unwanted singularity occurs in the
region of interest. Special cases in which the method fails, such as when three
of the control points are collinear, or when two points coincide, will be
discussed separately.

 <dc:title>Boosting Question Answering by Deep Entity Recognition</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computation and Language</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper an open-domain factoid question answering system for Polish,
RAFAEL, is presented. The system goes beyond finding an answering sentence; it
also extracts a single string, corresponding to the required entity. Herein the
focus is placed on different approaches to entity recognition, essential for
retrieving information matching question constraints. Apart from traditional
approach, including named entity recognition (NER) solutions, a novel
technique, called Deep Entity Recognition (DeepER), is introduced and
implemented. It allows a comprehensive search of all forms of entity references
matching a given WordNet synset (e.g. an impressionist), based on a previously
assembled entity library. It has been created by analysing the first sentences
of encyclopaedia entries and disambiguation and redirect pages. DeepER also
provides automatic evaluation, which makes possible numerous experiments,
including over a thousand questions from a quiz TV show answered on the grounds
of Polish Wikipedia. The final results of a manual evaluation on a separate
question set show that the strength of DeepER approach lies in its ability to
answer questions that demand answers beyond the traditional categories of named
entities.

 <dc:description>  We propose an effective subspace selection scheme as a post-processing step
to improve results obtained by sparse subspace clustering (SSC). Our method
starts by the computation of stable subspaces using a novel random sampling
scheme. Thus constructed preliminary subspaces are used to identify the
initially incorrectly clustered data points and then to reassign them to more
suitable clusters based on their goodness-of-fit to the preliminary model. To
improve the robustness of the algorithm, we use a dominant nearest subspace
classification scheme that controls the level of sensitivity against
reassignment. We demonstrate that our algorithm is convergent and superior to
the direct application of a generic alternative such as principal component
analysis. On several popular datasets for motion segmentation and face
clustering pervasively used in the sparse subspace clustering literature the
proposed method is shown to reduce greatly the incidence of clustering errors
while introducing negligible disturbance to the data points already correctly
clustered.

 <dc:description>  We propose to reformulate the payoff matrix structure of Prisoner's Dilemma
Game, by introducing threat and greed factors, and show their effect on the
co-evolution of memory and cooperation. Our findings are as follows. (i) Memory
protects cooperation. (ii) To our surprise, greater memory size is unfavorable
to evolutionary success when there is no threat. In the absence of threat,
subsequent generations lose their memory and are consequently invaded by
defectors. (iii) In contrast, the presence of an appropriate level of threat
triggers the emergence of a self-protection mechanism for cooperation, which
manifests itself as an increase in memory size within subsequent generations.
On the evolutionary level, memory size acts like an immune response of the
generations against aggressive defection. (iv) Even more extreme threat results
again in defection. Our findings boil down to the following: The dose of the
threat makes the resistance for cooperation.

 <dc:description>  TensorFlow is a machine learning system that operates at large scale and in
heterogeneous environments. TensorFlow uses dataflow graphs to represent
computation, shared state, and the operations that mutate that state. It maps
the nodes of a dataflow graph across many machines in a cluster, and within a
machine across multiple computational devices, including multicore CPUs,
general-purpose GPUs, and custom designed ASICs known as Tensor Processing
Units (TPUs). This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer:
whereas in previous &quot;parameter server&quot; designs the management of shared state
is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with
novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of
applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on
deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we
have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for
machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow
model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling
performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.

 <dc:description>  Whether as telecommunications or power systems, networks are very important
in everyday life. Maintaining these networks properly functional and connected,
even under attacks or failures, is of special concern. This topic has been
previously studied with a whole network robustness perspective,modeling
networks as undirected graphs (such as roads or simply cables). This
perspective measures the average behavior of the network after its last node
has failed. In this article we propose two alternatives to well-known studies
about the robustness of the backbone Internet: to use a supply network model
and metrics for its representation (we called it the Go-Index), and to use
robustness metrics that can be calculated while disconnections appear. Our
research question is: if a smart adversary has a limited number of strikes to
attack the Internet, how much will the damage be after each one in terms of
network disconnection? Our findings suggest that in order to design robust
networks it might be better to have a complete view of the robustness evolution
of the network, from both the infrastructure and the users perspective.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present an algorithm that achieves almost optimal pseudo-regret bounds
against adversarial and stochastic bandits. Against adversarial bandits the
pseudo-regret is $O(K\sqrt{n \log n})$ and against stochastic bandits the
pseudo-regret is $O(\sum_i (\log n)/\Delta_i)$. We also show that no algorithm
with $O(\log n)$ pseudo-regret against stochastic bandits can achieve
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ expected regret against adaptive adversarial bandits.
This complements previous results of Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) that show
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ expected adversarial regret with $O((\log n)^2)$
stochastic pseudo-regret.

 <dc:description>  We introduce an extension of decision problems called resiliency problems. In
resiliency problems, the goal is to decide whether an instance remains positive
after any (appropriately defined) perturbation has been applied to it. To
tackle these kinds of problems, some of which might be of practical interest,
we introduce a notion of resiliency for Integer Linear Programs (ILP) and show
how to use a result of Eisenbrand and Shmonin (Math. Oper. Res., 2008) on
Parametric Linear Programming to prove that ILP Resiliency is fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT) under a certain parameterization. To demonstrate the utility of
our result, we consider natural resiliency versions of several concrete
problems, and prove that they are FPT under natural parameterizations. Our
first results concern a four-variate problem which generalizes the Disjoint Set
Cover problem and which is of interest in access control. We obtain a complete
parameterized complexity classification for every possible combination of the
parameters. Then, we introduce and study a resiliency version of the Closest
String problem, for which we extend an FPT result of Gramm et al.
(Algorithmica, 2003). We also consider problems in the fields of scheduling and
social choice. We believe that many other problems can be tackled by our
framework.

 <dc:description>  Data visualizations typically show retrospective views of an existing dataset
with little or no focus on repeatability. However, consumers of these tools
often use insights gleaned from retrospective visualizations as the basis for
decisions about future events. In this way, visualizations often serve as
visual predictive models despite the fact that they are typically designed to
present historical views of the data. This &quot;visual predictive model&quot; approach,
however, can lead to invalid inferences. In this paper, we describe an approach
to visual model validation called Inline Replication (IR) which, similar to the
cross-validation technique used widely in machine learning, provides a
nonparametric and broadly applicable technique for visual model assessment and
repeatability. This paper describes the overall IR process and outlines how it
can be integrated into both traditional and emerging &quot;big data&quot; visualization
pipelines. Examples are provided showing IR integrated within common
visualization techniques (such as bar charts and linear regression lines) as
well as a more fully-featured visualization system designed for complex
exploratory analysis tasks.

 <dc:description>  We give faster algorithms and improved sample complexities for estimating the
top eigenvector of a matrix $\Sigma$ -- i.e. computing a unit vector $x$ such
that $x^T \Sigma x \ge (1-\epsilon)\lambda_1(\Sigma)$:
  Offline Eigenvector Estimation: Given an explicit $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times
d}$ with $\Sigma = A^TA$, we show how to compute an $\epsilon$ approximate top
eigenvector in time $\tilde O([nnz(A) + \frac{d*sr(A)}{gap^2} ]* \log
1/\epsilon )$ and $\tilde O([\frac{nnz(A)^{3/4} (d*sr(A))^{1/4}}{\sqrt{gap}} ]
* \log 1/\epsilon )$. Here $nnz(A)$ is the number of nonzeros in $A$, $sr(A)$
is the stable rank, $gap$ is the relative eigengap. By separating the $gap$
dependence from the $nnz(A)$ term, our first runtime improves upon the
classical power and Lanczos methods. It also improves prior work using fast
subspace embeddings [AC09, CW13] and stochastic optimization [Sha15c], giving
significantly better dependencies on $sr(A)$ and $\epsilon$. Our second running
time improves these further when $nnz(A) \le \frac{d*sr(A)}{gap^2}$.
  Online Eigenvector Estimation: Given a distribution $D$ with covariance
matrix $\Sigma$ and a vector $x_0$ which is an $O(gap)$ approximate top
eigenvector for $\Sigma$, we show how to refine to an $\epsilon$ approximation
using $ O(\frac{var(D)}{gap*\epsilon})$ samples from $D$. Here $var(D)$ is a
natural notion of variance. Combining our algorithm with previous work to
initialize $x_0$, we obtain improved sample complexity and runtime results
under a variety of assumptions on $D$.
  We achieve our results using a general framework that we believe is of
independent interest. We give a robust analysis of the classic method of
shift-and-invert preconditioning to reduce eigenvector computation to
approximately solving a sequence of linear systems. We then apply fast
stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) based system solvers to achieve our
claims.

 <dc:description>  Advertisers are increasingly turning to fingerprinting techniques to track
users across the web. As web browsing activity shifts to mobile platforms,
traditional browser fingerprinting techniques become less effective; however,
device fingerprinting using built-in sensors offers a new avenue for attack. We
study the feasibility of using motion sensors to perform device fingerprinting
at scale, and explore countermeasures that can be used to protect privacy.
  We perform a large-scale user study to demonstrate that motion sensor
fingerprinting is effective with even 500 users. We also develop a model to
estimate prediction accuracy for larger user populations; our model provides a
conservative estimate of at least 12% classification accuracy with 100000
users. We then investigate the use of motion sensors on the web and find,
distressingly, that many sites send motion sensor data to servers for storage
and analysis, paving the way to potential fingerprinting. Finally, we consider
the problem of developing fingerprinting countermeasures; we evaluate a
previously proposed obfuscation technique and a newly developed quantization
technique via a user study. We find that both techniques are able to
drastically reduce fingerprinting accuracy without significantly impacting the
utility of the sensors in web applications.

 <dc:description>  Ensembling methods are well known for improving prediction accuracy. However,
they are limited in the sense that they cannot discriminate among component
models effectively. In this paper, we propose stacking with auxiliary features
that learns to fuse relevant information from multiple systems to improve
performance. Auxiliary features enable the stacker to rely on systems that not
just agree on an output but also the provenance of the output. We demonstrate
our approach on three very different and difficult problems -- the Cold Start
Slot Filling, the Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking and the ImageNet
object detection tasks. We obtain new state-of-the-art results on the first two
tasks and substantial improvements on the detection task, thus verifying the
power and generality of our approach.

 <dc:description>  Theorists and advocates of &quot;remixing&quot; have suggested that appropriation can
act as a pathway for learning. We test this theory quantitatively using data
from more than 2.4 million multimedia programming projects shared by more than
1 million users in the Scratch online community. First, we show that users who
remix more often have larger repertoires of programming commands even after
controlling for the numbers of projects and amount of code shared. Second, we
show that exposure to computational thinking concepts through remixing is
associated with increased likelihood of using those concepts. Our results
support theories that young people learn through remixing, and have important
implications for designers of social computing systems.

 <dc:description>  The FEAST algorithm is a subspace iteration method that uses a spectral
projector as a rational filter in order to efficiently solve interior
eigenvalue problems in parallel. Although the solutions from the FEAST
algorithm converge rapidly in many cases, convergence can be slow in situations
where the eigenvalues of a matrix are densely populated near the edges of the
search interval of interest, which can be detrimental to parallel load
balancing. This work introduces two methods that allow one to improve the
convergence robustness of the FEAST algorithm in these situations without
having to increase the amount of computation. Selected numerical examples are

 <dc:title>Bridging the Capacity Gap Between Interactive and One-Way Communication</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Haeupler, Bernhard</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  We study the communication rate of coding schemes for interactive
communication that transform any two-party interactive protocol into a protocol
that is robust to noise.
  Recently, Haeupler (FOCS '14) showed that if an $\epsilon &gt; 0$ fraction of
transmissions are corrupted, adversarially or randomly, then it is possible to
achieve a communication rate of $1 - \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$.
Furthermore, Haeupler conjectured that this rate is optimal for general input
protocols. This stands in contrast to the classical setting of one-way
communication in which error-correcting codes are known to achieve an optimal
communication rate of $1 - \Theta(H(\epsilon)) = 1 -
\widetilde{\Theta}(\epsilon)$.
  In this work, we show that the quadratically smaller rate loss of the one-way
setting can also be achieved in interactive coding schemes for a very natural
class of input protocols. We introduce the notion of average message length, or
the average number of bits a party sends before receiving a reply, as a natural
parameter for measuring the level of interactivity in a protocol. Moreover, we
show that any protocol with average message length $\ell =
\Omega(\mathrm{poly}(1/\epsilon))$ can be simulated by a protocol with optimal
communication rate $1 - \Theta(H(\epsilon))$ over an oblivious adversarial
channel with error fraction $\epsilon$. Furthermore, under the additional
assumption of access to public shared randomness, the optimal communication
rate is achieved ratelessly, i.e., the communication rate adapts automatically
to the actual error rate $\epsilon$ without having to specify it in advance.
  This shows that the capacity gap between one-way and interactive
communication can be bridged even for very small (constant in $\epsilon$)
average message lengths, which are likely to be found in many applications.

 <dc:description>  The problem of column subset selection has recently attracted a large body of
research, with feature selection serving as one obvious and important
application. Among the techniques that have been applied to solve this problem,
the greedy algorithm has been shown to be quite effective in practice. However,
theoretical guarantees on its performance have not been explored thoroughly,
especially in a distributed setting. In this paper, we study the greedy
algorithm for the column subset selection problem from a theoretical and
empirical perspective and show its effectiveness in a distributed setting. In
particular, we provide an improved approximation guarantee for the greedy
algorithm which we show is tight up to a constant factor, and present the first
distributed implementation with provable approximation factors. We use the idea
of randomized composable core-sets, developed recently in the context of
submodular maximization. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of this
distributed algorithm via an empirical study.

 <dc:title>Data-driven software security: Models and methods</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Erlingsson, &#xda;lfar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For computer software, our security models, policies, mechanisms, and means
of assurance were primarily conceived and developed before the end of the
1970's. However, since that time, software has changed radically: it is
thousands of times larger, comprises countless libraries, layers, and services,
and is used for more purposes, in far more complex ways. It is worthwhile to
revisit our core computer security concepts. For example, it is unclear whether
the Principle of Least Privilege can help dictate security policy, when
software is too complex for either its developers or its users to explain its
intended behavior.
  This paper outlines a data-driven model for software security that takes an
empirical, data-driven approach to modern software, and determines its exact,
concrete behavior via comprehensive, online monitoring. Specifically, this
paper briefly describes methods for efficient, detailed software monitoring, as
well as methods for learning detailed software statistics while providing
differential privacy for its users, and, finally, how machine learning methods
can help discover users' expectations for intended software behavior, and
thereby help set security policy. Those methods can be adopted in practice,
even at very large scales, and demonstrate that data-driven software security
models can provide real-world benefits.

 <dc:description>  Obtaining labels can be costly and time-consuming. Active learning allows a
learning algorithm to intelligently query samples to be labeled for efficient
learning. Fisher information ratio (FIR) has been used as an objective for
selecting queries in active learning. However, little is known about the theory
behind the use of FIR for active learning. There is a gap between the
underlying theory and the motivation of its usage in practice. In this paper,
we attempt to fill this gap and provide a rigorous framework for analyzing
existing FIR-based active learning methods. In particular, we show that FIR can
be asymptotically viewed as an upper bound of the expected variance of the
log-likelihood ratio. Additionally, our analysis suggests a unifying framework
that not only enables us to make theoretical comparisons among the existing
querying methods based on FIR, but also allows us to give insight into the
development of new active learning approaches based on this objective.

 <dc:description>  Unsupervised learning of probabilistic models is a central yet challenging
problem in machine learning. Specifically, designing models with tractable
learning, sampling, inference and evaluation is crucial in solving this task.
We extend the space of such models using real-valued non-volume preserving
(real NVP) transformations, a set of powerful invertible and learnable
transformations, resulting in an unsupervised learning algorithm with exact
log-likelihood computation, exact sampling, exact inference of latent
variables, and an interpretable latent space. We demonstrate its ability to
model natural images on four datasets through sampling, log-likelihood
evaluation and latent variable manipulations.

 <dc:title>Fingerprintability of WebRTC</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We examine WebRTC's suitability as a means of Internet censorship
circumvention. WebRTC is a framework and suite of protocols for peer-to-peer
communication between web browsers. We analyze the implementation differences
in instantiations of WebRTC that make it possible to &quot;fingerprint&quot;
implementations--potentially distinguishing circumvention-related uses from
ordinary ones. This question is relevant to Snowflake, an upcoming
circumvention system that uses WebRTC to turn web browsers into temporary
peer-to-peer proxies. We conduct a manual analysis of WebRTC-using applications
in order to map the space of distinguishing implementation features. We run a
fingerprinting script on a day's worth of network traffic in order to quantify
WebRTC's prevalence and diversity. Throughout, we find pitfalls that indicate
that resisting fingerprinting in WebRTC is likely to be non-trivial.

 <dc:title>On the Capacity Region of ALOHA Protocol for the Internet of Things</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Accommodating the needs of a large number of diverse users in the Internet of
Things (IoT), notably managing how the users access the common channel, has
posed unique challenges to the network designers. In this paper, we study a
heterogeneous IoT network consisting of multiple classes of users who may have
different service requirements. For this network, we consider the application
of irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) that is shown to offer large
throughput for single-class networks. Then, we focus on finding the network
performance boundaries by studying the set of feasible throughput values for
each class, called the capacity region. To this end, we first introduce the
concept of dual network of a multi-class network meaning a homogeneous network
with the same number of users. We then prove that finding the capacity region
of the assumed multi-class network boils down to finding the maximum achievable
throughput of its dual network. Using this finding, we then discuss how any
given point of the capacity region can be achieved. Further, a delay
performance study is conducted to evaluate the average and maximum packet
transmission delay experienced by the users of each class.

 <dc:title>Censors' Delay in Blocking Circumvention Proxies</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Fifield, David</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Tsai, Lynn</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Censors of the Internet must continually discover and block new circumvention
proxy servers. We seek to understand this process; specifically, the length of
the delay between when a proxy first becomes discoverable and when it is
actually blocked. We measure this delay in the case of obfuscated Tor bridges,
by testing their reachability before and after their introduction into Tor
Browser. We test from sites in the U.S., China, and Iran, over a period of five
months. China's national firewall blocked new bridges after a varying delay of
between 2 and 36 days. Blocking occurred only after end-user software releases,
despite bridges being potentially discoverable earlier through other channels.
While the firewall eventually discovered the bridges of Tor Browser, those that
appeared only in Orbot, a version of Tor for mobile devices, remained
unblocked. Our findings highlight the fact that censors can behave in ways that
defy intuition, presenting difficulties for threat modeling but also
opportunities for evasion.

conditions experienced in a dense urban environment over fixed backhaul links
between wireless devices that are mounted on utility or traffic light poles.
The measurements characterize the 2x1 multiple input single output channel in
the 2.45 GHz band for both spatially separated omni antennas and cross

 <dc:description>  Strategies are necessary to mitigate the impact of unexpected behavior in
collaborative robotics, and research to develop solutions is lacking. Our aim
here was to explore the benefits of an affective interaction, as opposed to a
more efficient, less error prone but non-communicative one. The experiment took
the form of an omelet-making task, with a wide range of participants
interacting directly with BERT2, a humanoid robot assistant. Having significant
implications for design, results suggest that efficiency is not the most
important aspect of performance for users; a personable, expressive robot was
found to be preferable over a more efficient one, despite a considerable trade
off in time taken to perform the task. Our findings also suggest that a robot
exhibiting human-like characteristics may make users reluctant to 'hurt its
feelings'; they may even lie in order to avoid this.

 <dc:title>Weighted Residuals for Very Deep Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Shen, Falong</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Deep residual networks have recently shown appealing performance on many
challenging computer vision tasks. However, the original residual structure
still has some defects making it difficult to converge on very deep networks.
In this paper, we introduce a weighted residual network to address the
incompatibility between \texttt{ReLU} and element-wise addition and the deep
network initialization problem. The weighted residual network is able to learn
to combine residuals from different layers effectively and efficiently. The
proposed models enjoy a consistent improvement over accuracy and convergence
with increasing depths from 100+ layers to 1000+ layers. Besides, the weighted
residual networks have little more computation and GPU memory burden than the
original residual networks. The networks are optimized by projected stochastic
gradient descent. Experiments on CIFAR-10 have shown that our algorithm has a
\emph{faster convergence speed} than the original residual networks and reaches
a \emph{high accuracy} at 95.3\% with a 1192-layer model.

 <dc:description>  We explore a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. This approach is
contrary to the common approach in that the unlabeled examples serve to
&quot;muffle,&quot; rather than enhance, the guidance provided by the labeled examples.
We provide several variants of the basic algorithm and show experimentally that
they can achieve significantly higher AUC than boosted trees, random forests
and logistic regression when unlabeled examples are available.

 <dc:description>  The concept of Shannon entropy of random variables was generalized to
measurable functions in general, and to simple functions with finite values in
particular. It is shown that the information measure of a function is related
to the time complexity of search problems concerning the functions in question.
Formally, given a Turing reduction from a search problem f(x)=y to another
function g(x), the amount of information about f(x)=y provided by querying g(x)
is exactly equal to the average mutual information I(f;g). As a result, the
average number of queries is I(f=y)/I(f;g), where I(f) is amount of
self-information about the event {f=y}. In the idea case, if I(f=y)/I(f;g) is
polynomial in the size of input and the function g(x) can be computed in
polynomial time, then the problem f(x)=y also has polynomial-time algorithm. As
it turns out, our information-based complexity estimation is a natural setting
in which to study the power of randomized or probabilistic algorithms. Applying
to decision problems, our result provides a strong evidence that P=RP=BPP.
Using brute-force search as a benchmark for efficiency, our results also
support that P!=PP. Further, applying an argument similar to Carnot's work on
measuring the efficiency of an ideal heat engine in thermodynamics, it is shown
that I(f=y)/H(f) is a lower bound on query complexity of solving f(x)=y.
According to Markov's inequality, if I(f=y)/H(f) is exponential in the size of
input, then the probability of f(x)=y having polynomial-time algorithm is a
negative exponential in the size of input. This result enables us to reduce the
problem of proving FP!=FNP to the computation of the entropy of certain simple
functions, such as the subset sum function. As a result, P!=NP is provable,
answering a long-standing open problem.

 <dc:title>Dueling Bandits with Dependent Arms</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Chen, Bangrui</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We study dueling bandits with weak utility-based regret when preferences over
arms have a total order and carry observable feature vectors. The order is
assumed to be determined by these feature vectors, an unknown preference
vector, and a known utility function. This structure introduces dependence
between preferences for pairs of arms, and allows learning about the preference
over one pair of arms from the preference over another pair of arms. We propose
an algorithm for this setting called Comparing The Best (CTB), which we show
has constant expected cumulative weak utility-based regret. We provide a
Bayesian interpretation for CTB, an implementation appropriate for a small
number of arms, and an alternate implementation for many arms that can be used
when the input parameters satisfy a decomposability condition. We demonstrate
through numerical experiments that CTB with appropriate input parameters
outperforms all benchmarks considered.

 <dc:title>Optimal dynamic mechanisms with ex-post IR via bank accounts</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Lately, the problem of designing multi-stage dynamic mechanisms has been
shown to be both theoretically challenging and practically important. In this
paper, we consider the problem of designing revenue optimal dynamic mechanism
for a setting where an auctioneer sells a set of items to a buyer in multiple
stages. At each stage, there could be multiple items for sale but each item can
only appear in one stage. The type of the buyer at each stage is thus a
multi-dimensional vector characterizing the buyer's valuations of the items at
that stage and is assumed to be stage-wise independent.
  In particular, we propose a novel class of mechanisms called bank account
mechanisms. Roughly, a bank account mechanism is no different from any
stage-wise individual mechanism except for an augmented structure called bank
account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. We
first establish that the optimal revenue from any dynamic mechanism in this
setting can be achieved by a bank account mechanism, and we provide a simple
characterization of the set of incentive compatible and ex-post individually
rational bank account mechanisms. Based on these characterizations, we then
investigate the problem of finding the (approximately) optimal bank account
mechanisms. We prove that there exists a simple, randomized bank account
mechanism that approximates optimal revenue up to a constant factor. Our result
is general and can accommodate previous approximation results in single-shot
multi-dimensional mechanism design. Based on the previous mechanism, we further
show that there exists a deterministic bank account mechanism that achieves
constant-factor approximation as well. Finally, we consider the problem of
computing optimal mechanisms when the type space is discrete and provide an
FPTAS via linear and dynamic programming.

 <dc:description>  We present a qualitative analysis of interviews with participants in the
NoSleep community within Reddit where millions of fans and writers of horror
fiction congregate. We explore how the community handled a massive, sudden, and
sustained increase in new members. Although existing theory and stories like
Usenet's infamous &quot;Eternal September&quot; suggest that large influxes of newcomers
can hurt online communities, our interviews suggest that NoSleep survived
without major incident. We propose that three features of NoSleep allowed it to
manage the rapid influx of newcomers gracefully: (1) an active and
well-coordinated group of administrators, (2) a shared sense of community which
facilitated community moderation, and (3) technological systems that mitigated
norm violations. We also point to several important trade-offs and limitations.

 <dc:description>  Researchers find weaknesses in current strategies for protecting privacy in
large datasets. Many anonymized datasets are reidentifiable, and norms for
offering data subjects notice and consent over emphasize individual
responsibility. Based on fieldwork with data managers in the City of Seattle, I
identify ways that these conventional approaches break down in practice.
Drawing on work from theorists in sociocultural anthropology, I propose that a
Human Centered Data Science move beyond concepts like dataset identifiability
and sensitivity toward a broader ontology of who is implicated by a dataset,
and new ways of anticipating how data can be combined and used.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Joint estimation of carrier frequency and direction of arrival (DOA) for
multiple signals has been found in many practical applications such as
Cognitive Radio (CR). However, Nyquist sampling mechanism is costly or
implemented due to wide spectrum range. Taking advantage of sub-Nyquist
sampling technology, some array receiver architectures are proposed to realize
joint estimation of carrier frequency and DOA. To further decrease equivalent
sampling rate and hardware complexity, we propose a simplifying receiver
architecture based on our previous work. We come up with joint DOA and
frequency estimation algorithms for the novel architecture. The simulations
demonstrate that the receiver architecture and the proposed approaches are
feasible.

 <dc:description>  The Color is one of the most important and easily identifiable features for
describing the visual content. The MPEG standard has developed a number of
descriptors that covers different aspects of the visual content. The Dominant
color descriptor is one of them. This paper proposes a channelized binning
approach a novel method for extraction of the dominant color pixel value which
is a variant of the dominant color descriptor. The Channelized binning method
treats the problem as a statistical problem and tries to avoid color
quantization and interpolation guessing of number and centroid of dominant
colors. Channelized binning is an iterative approach which automatically
estimates the number of dominant pixel values and their centroids. It operates
on 24 bit full RGB color space, by considering one color channel at a time and
hence avoiding the color quantization. Results show that the proposed method
can successfully extract dominant color pixel values.

 <dc:description>  Key frames play an important role in video annotation. It is one of the
widely used methods for video abstraction as this will help us for processing a
large set of video data with sufficient content representation in faster way.
In this paper a novel approach for key-frame extraction using entropy value is
proposed. The proposed approach classifies frames based on entropy values as
global feature and selects frame from each class as representative key-frame.
It also eliminates redundant frames from selected key-frames using entropy
value as local feature. Evaluation of the approach on several video clips has
been presented. Results show that the algorithm is successful in helping
annotators automatically identify video key-frames.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by the application of high-density data storage technologies,
symbol-pair codes are proposed to protect against pair-errors in symbol-pair
channels, whose outputs are overlapping pairs of symbols. The research of
symbol-pair codes with the largest minimum pair-distance is interesting since
such codes have the best possible error-correcting capability. A symbol-pair
code attaining the maximal minimum pair-distance is called a maximum distance
separable (MDS) symbol-pair code. In this paper, we focus on constructing
linear MDS symbol-pair codes over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We show
that a linear MDS symbol-pair code over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with pair-distance $5$
exists if and only if the length $n$ ranges from $5$ to $q^2+q+1$. As for codes
with pair-distance $6$, length ranging from $6$ to $q^{2}+1$, we construct
linear MDS symbol-pair codes by using a configuration called ovoid in
projective geometry. With the help of elliptic curves, we present a
construction of linear MDS symbol-pair codes for any pair-distance $d+2$ with
length $n$ satisfying $7\le d+2\leq n\le q+\lfloor
2\sqrt{q}\rfloor+\delta(q)-3$, where $\delta(q)=0$ or $1$.

 <dc:description>  We explore the clearing problem in the barter exchange market. The problem,
described in the terminology of graph theory, is to find a set of
vertex-disjoint, length-restricted cycles that maximize the total weight in a
weighted digraph. The problem has previously been shown to be NP-hard. We
advance the understanding of this problem by the following contributions.
  We prove three constant inapproximability results for this problem. For the
weighted graphs, we prove that it is NP-hard to approximate the clearing
problem within a factor of 14/13 under general length constraints and within a
factor of 434/433 when the cycle length is not longer than 3. For the
unweighted graphs, we prove that this problem is NP-hard to approximate within
a factor of 698/697.
  For the unweighted graphs when the cycle length is not longer than 3, we
design and implement two simple and practical algorithms. Experiments on
simulated data suggest that these algorithms yield excellent performances.

 <dc:title>Analysing the Effects of Routing Centralization on BGP Convergence Time</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sermpezis, Pavlos</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Dimitropoulos, Xenofontas</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Software-defined networking (SDN) has improved the routing functionality in
networks like data centers or WANs. Recently, several studies proposed to apply
the SDN principles in the Internet's inter-domain routing as well. This could
offer new routing opportunities and improve the performance of BGP, which can
take minutes to converge to routing changes.
  Previous works have demonstrated that centralization can benefit the
functionality of BGP, and improve its slow convergence that causes severe
packet losses and performance degradation. However, due to (a) the fact that
previous works mainly focus on system design aspects, and (b) the lack of real
deployments, it is not clearly understood yet to what extent inter-domain SDN
can improve performance.
  To this end, in this work, we make the first effort towards analytically
studying the effects of routing centralization on the performance of
inter-domain routing, and, in particular, the convergence time of BGP.
Specifically, we propose a Markovian model for inter-domain networks, where a
subset of nodes (domains) coordinate to centralize their inter-domain routing.
We then derive analytic results that quantify the BGP convergence time under
various network settings (like, SDN penetration, topology, BGP configuration,
etc.). Our analysis and results facilitate the performance evaluation of
inter-domain SDN networks, which have been studied (till now) only through
simulations/emulations that are known to suffer from high time/resource
requirements and limited scalability.

 <dc:description>  Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) combines ideas of probabilistic matrix
factorization (PMF) and topic modeling (e.g., LDA) for recommender systems,
which has gained increasing successes in many applications. Despite enjoying
many advantages, the existing CTR algorithms have some critical limitations.
First of all, they are often designed to work in a batch learning manner,
making them unsuitable to deal with streaming data or big data in real-world
recommender systems. Second, the document-specific topic proportions of LDA are
fed to the downstream PMF, but not reverse, which is sub-optimal as the rating
information is not exploited in discovering the low-dimensional representation
of documents and thus can result in a sub-optimal representation for
prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme of Online Bayesian
Collaborative Topic Regression (OBCTR) which is efficient and scalable for
learning from data streams. Particularly, we {\it jointly} optimize the
combined objective function of both PMF and LDA in an online learning fashion,
in which both PMF and LDA tasks can be reinforced each other during the online
learning process. Our encouraging experimental results on real-world data
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

development of the intelligent Preassessment System has been presented in
[10],[11]. In this paper, we now demystify the theory behind the development of
the pre-assessment system followed by some computational experimentation and
graph visualisation of the agent classified rules learning algorithm in the
estimation and prediction of classified rules. In addition, we present some
preliminary results of the pre-assessment system evaluation. From the results,
it is gathered that the system has performed according to its design

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a novel sparse coding and counting method under
Bayesian framwork for visual tracking. In contrast to existing methods, the
proposed method employs the combination of L0 and L1 norm to regularize the
linear coefficients of incrementally updated linear basis. The sparsity
constraint enables the tracker to effectively handle difficult challenges, such
as occlusion or image corruption. To achieve realtime processing, we propose a
fast and efficient numerical algorithm for solving the proposed model. Although
it is an NP-hard problem, the proposed accelerated proximal gradient (APG)
approach is guaranteed to converge to a solution quickly. Besides, we provide a
closed solution of combining L0 and L1 regularized representation to obtain
better sparsity. Experimental results on challenging video sequences
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results both in
accuracy and speed.

 <dc:description>  We analyze the learning properties of the stochastic gradient method when
multiple passes over the data and mini-batches are allowed. We study how
regularization properties are controlled by the step-size, the number of passes
and the mini-batch size. In particular, we consider the square loss and show
that for a universal step-size choice, the number of passes acts as a
regularization parameter, and optimal finite sample bounds can be achieved by
early-stopping. Moreover, we show that larger step-sizes are allowed when
considering mini-batches. Our analysis is based on a unifying approach,
encompassing both batch and stochastic gradient methods as special cases. As a
byproduct, we derive optimal convergence results for batch gradient methods
(even in the non-attainable cases).

 <dc:title>User-based solutions for increasing level of service in bike-sharing
  transportation systems</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Raimbault, Juste</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Multiagent Systems</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Physics - Physics and Society</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Bike-sharing transportation systems have been well studied from a top-down
viewpoint, either for an optimal conception of the system, or for a better
statistical understanding of their working mechanisms in the aim of the
optimization of the management strategy. Yet bottom-up approaches that could
include behavior of users have not been well studied so far. We propose an
agent-based model for the short time evolution of a bike-sharing system, with a
focus on two strategical parameters that are the role of the quantity of
information users have on the all system and the propensity of user to walk
after having dropped their bike. We implement the model in a general way so it
is applicable to every system as soon as data are available in a certain
format. The model of simulation is parametrized and calibrated on processed
real time-series of bike movements for the system of Paris. After showing the
robustness of the simulations by validating internally and externally the
model, we are able to test different user-based strategies for an increase of
the level of service. In particular, we show that an increase of user
information can have significant impact on the homogeneity of repartition of
bikes in docking stations, and, what is important for a future implementation
of the strategy, that an action on only 30% of regular users is enough to
obtain most of the possible amelioration.

 <dc:title>Models Coupling Urban Growth and Transportation Network Growth : An
  Algorithmic Systematic Review Approach</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Raimbault, Juste</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A broad bibliographical study suggests a scarcity of quantitative models of
simulation integrating both network and urban growth. This absence may be due
to diverging interests of concerned disciplines, resulting in a lack of
communication. We propose to proceed to an algorithmic systematic review to
give quantitative elements of answer to this question. A formal iterative
algorithm to retrieve corpuses of references from initial keywords, based on
text-mining, is developed and implemented. We study its convergence properties
and do a sensitivity analysis. We then apply it on queries representative of
the specific question, for which results tend to confirm the assumption of
disciplines compartmentalisation.

 <dc:description>  Evaluation of NLP methods requires testing against a previously vetted
gold-standard test set and reporting standard metrics
(accuracy/precision/recall/F1). The current assumption is that all items in a
given test set are equal with regards to difficulty and discriminating power.
We propose Item Response Theory (IRT) from psychometrics as an alternative
means for gold-standard test-set generation and NLP system evaluation. IRT is
able to describe characteristics of individual items - their difficulty and
discriminating power - and can account for these characteristics in its
estimation of human intelligence or ability for an NLP task. In this paper, we
demonstrate IRT by generating a gold-standard test set for Recognizing Textual
Entailment. By collecting a large number of human responses and fitting our IRT
model, we show that our IRT model compares NLP systems with the performance in
a human population and is able to provide more insight into system performance
than standard evaluation metrics. We show that a high accuracy score does not
always imply a high IRT score, which depends on the item characteristics and
the response pattern.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a deep memory network for aspect level sentiment classification.
Unlike feature-based SVM and sequential neural models such as LSTM, this
approach explicitly captures the importance of each context word when inferring
the sentiment polarity of an aspect. Such importance degree and text
representation are calculated with multiple computational layers, each of which
is a neural attention model over an external memory. Experiments on laptop and
restaurant datasets demonstrate that our approach performs comparable to
state-of-art feature based SVM system, and substantially better than LSTM and
attention-based LSTM architectures. On both datasets we show that multiple
computational layers could improve the performance. Moreover, our approach is
also fast. The deep memory network with 9 layers is 15 times faster than LSTM
with a CPU implementation.

 <dc:description>  Topological data analysis is becoming a popular way to study high dimensional
feature spaces without any contextual clues or assumptions. This paper concerns
itself with one popular topological feature, which is the number of
$d-$dimensional holes in the dataset, also known as the Betti$-d$ number. The
persistence of the Betti numbers over various scales is encoded into a
persistence diagram (PD), which indicates the birth and death times of these
holes as scale varies. A common way to compare PDs is by a point-to-point
matching, which is given by the $n$-Wasserstein metric. However, a big drawback
of this approach is the need to solve correspondence between points before
computing the distance; for $n$ points, the complexity grows according to
$\mathcal{O}($n$^3)$. Instead, we propose to use an entirely new framework
built on Riemannian geometry, that models PDs as 2D probability density
functions that are represented in the square-root framework on a Hilbert
Sphere. The resulting space is much more intuitive with closed form expressions
for common operations. The distance metric is 1) correspondence-free and also
2) independent of the number of points in the dataset. The complexity of
computing distance between PDs now grows according to $\mathcal{O}(K^2)$, for a
$K \times K$ discretization of $[0,1]^2$. This also enables the use of existing
machinery in differential geometry towards statistical analysis of PDs such as
computing the mean, geodesics, classification etc. We report competitive
results with the Wasserstein metric, at a much lower computational load,
indicating the favorable properties of the proposed approach.

 <dc:description>  This article is based on studies of the existing literature, focusing on the
states-of-the-arts on virtual reality (VR) and its potential uses in learning.
Different platforms have been used to improve the learning effects of VR that
offers exciting opportunities in various fields. As more and more students want
in a distance, part-time, or want to continue their education, VR has attracted
considerable attention in learning, training, and traditional education. VR
based learning enables operators to bring together all disciplinary resources
in a common playground. The VR base multimedia platform has successfully
demonstrated great potential of education and training. In this paper, we will
discuss existing systems and their uses and address the technical challenges
and future directions.

 <dc:description>  We first describe three algorithms for computing the Lyndon array that have
been suggested in the literature, but for which no structured exposition has
been given. Two of these algorithms execute in quadratic time in the worst
case, the third achieves linear time, but at the expense of prior computation
of both the suffix array and the inverse suffix array of x. We then go on to
describe two variants of a new algorithm that avoids prior computation of
global data structures and executes in worst-case n log n time. Experimental
evidence suggests that all but one of these five algorithms require only linear
execution time in practice, with the two new algorithms faster by a small
factor. We conjecture that there exists a fast and worst-case linear-time
algorithm to compute the Lyndon array that is also elementary (making no use of
global data structures such as the suffix array).

 <dc:description>  We present a method for estimating the undetected error rate when a cyclic
redundancy check (CRC) is performed on the output of the decoder of short
low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. This system is of interest for
telecommand links, where new LDPC codes have been designed for updating the
current standard. We show that these new LDPC codes combined with CRC are
adequate for complying with the stringent requirements of this kind of
transmissions in terms of error detection.

 <dc:title>Logic of Local Inference for Contextuality in Quantum Physics and Beyond</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Contextuality in quantum physics provides a key resource for quantum
information and computation. The topological approach in [Abramsky and
Brandenburger, New J. Phys., 2011, Abramsky et al., CSL 2015, 2015]
characterizes contextuality as &quot;global inconsistency&quot; coupled with &quot;local
consistency&quot;, revealing it to be a phenomenon also found in many other fields.
This has yielded a logical method of detecting and proving the &quot;global
inconsistency&quot; part of contextuality. Our goal is to capture the other, &quot;local
consistency&quot; part, which requires a novel approach to logic that is sensitive
to the topology of contexts. To achieve this, we formulate a logic of local
inference by using context-sensitive theories and models in regular categories.
This provides a uniform framework for local consistency, and lays a foundation
for high-level methods of detecting, proving, and moreover using contextuality
as computational resource.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Systems and Control</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper studies the phase balancing of a two and three-agent system where
the agents are coupled through heterogeneous controller gains. Balancing refers
to the situation in which the movement of agents causes the position of their
centroid to become stationary. We generalize existing results and show that by
using heterogeneous controller gains, the velocity directions of the agents in
balanced formation can be controlled. The effect of heterogeneous gains on the
reachable set of these velocity directions is further analyzed. For the
two-agents case, the locus of steady-state location of the centroid is also
analyzed against the variations in the heterogeneous controller gains.
Simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical findings.

 <dc:description>  Given two sets of variables, derived from a common set of samples, sparse
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) seeks linear combinations of a small
number of variables in each set, such that the induced canonical variables are
maximally correlated. Sparse CCA is NP-hard.
  We propose a novel combinatorial algorithm for sparse diagonal CCA, i.e.,
sparse CCA under the additional assumption that variables within each set are
standardized and uncorrelated. Our algorithm operates on a low rank
approximation of the input data and its computational complexity scales
linearly with the number of input variables. It is simple to implement, and
parallelizable. In contrast to most existing approaches, our algorithm
administers precise control on the sparsity of the extracted canonical vectors,
and comes with theoretical data-dependent global approximation guarantees, that
hinge on the spectrum of the input data. Finally, it can be straightforwardly
adapted to other constrained variants of CCA enforcing structure beyond
sparsity.
  We empirically evaluate the proposed scheme and apply it on a real
neuroimaging dataset to investigate associations between brain activity and
behavior measurements.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers a method of coding the sensor outputs in order to detect
stealthy false data injection attacks. An intelligent attacker can design a
sequence of data injection to sensors and actuators that pass the state
estimator and statistical fault detector, based on knowledge of the system
parameters. To stay undetected, the injected data should increase the state
estimation errors while keep the estimation residues small. We employ a coding
matrix to change the original sensor outputs to increase the estimation
residues under intelligent data injection attacks. This is a low cost method
compared with encryption schemes over all sensor measurements in communication
networks. We show the conditions of a feasible coding matrix under the
assumption that the attacker does not have knowledge of the exact coding
matrix. An algorithm is developed to compute a feasible coding matrix, and, we
show that in general, multiple feasible coding matrices exist. To defend
against attackers who estimates the coding matrix via sensor and actuator
measurements, time-varying coding matrices are designed according to the
detection requirements. A heuristic algorithm to decide the time length of
updating a coding matrix is then proposed.

 <dc:description>  Finite impulse response (FIR) graph filters play a crucial role in the field
of signal processing on graphs. However, when the graph signal is time-varying,
the state of the art FIR graph filters do not capture the time variations of
the input signal. In this work, we propose an extension of FIR graph filters to
capture also the signal variations over time. By considering also the past
values of the graph signal, the proposed FIR graph filter extends naturally to
a 2-dimensional filter, capturing jointly the signal variations over the graph
and time. As a particular case of interest we focus on 2-dimensional separable
graph-temporal filters, which can be implemented in a distributed fashion at
the price of higher communication costs. This allows us to give filter
specifications and perform the design independently in the graph and temporal
domain. The work is concluded by analyzing the proposed approach for stochastic
graph signals, where the first and second order moments of the output signal
are characterized.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase of user-generated video
services. In such user-generated video services, crowdsourced live streaming
(e.g., Periscope, Twitch) has significantly challenged today's edge network
infrastructure: today's edge networks (e.g., 4G, Wi-Fi) have limited uplink
capacity support, making high-bitrate live streaming over such links
fundamentally impossible. In this paper, we propose to let broadcasters (i.e.,
users who generate the video) upload crowdsourced video streams using
aggregated network resources from multiple edge networks. There are several
challenges in the proposal: First, how to design a framework that aggregates
bandwidth from multiple edge networks? Second, how to make this framework
transparent to today's crowdsourced live streaming services? Third, how to
maximize the streaming quality for the whole system? We design a
multi-objective and deployable bandwidth aggregation system BASS to address
these challenges: (1) We propose an aggregation framework transparent to
today's crowdsourced live streaming services, using an edge proxy box and
aggregation cloud paradigm; (2) We dynamically allocate geo-distributed cloud
aggregation servers to enable MPTCP (i.e., multi-path TCP), according to
location and network characteristics of both broadcasters and the original
streaming servers; (3) We maximize the overall performance gain for the whole
system, by matching streams with the best aggregation paths.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present three new signal designs for Enhanced Spatial
Modulation (ESM), which was recently introduced by the present authors. The
basic idea of ESM is to convey information bits not only by the index(es) of
the active transmit antenna(s) as in conventional Spatial Modulation (SM), but
also by the types of the signal constellations used. The original ESM schemes
were designed with reference to single-stream SM and involved one or more
secondary modulations in addition to the primary modulation. Compared to
single-stream SM, they provided either higher throughput or improved
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the present paper, we focus on multi-stream SM
(MSM) and present three new ESM designs leading to increasing SNR gains when
they are operated at the same spectral efficiency. The secondary signal
constellations used in the first two designs are based on a single geometric
interpolation step in the signal constellation plane, while the third design
also makes use of additional constellations derived through a second
interpolation step. The new ESM signal designs are described for MIMO systems
with four transmit antennas two of which are active, but we also briefly
present extensions to higher numbers of antennas. Theoretical analysis and
simulation results indicate that the proposed designs provide a significant SNR
gain over MSM.

 <dc:description>  We study the problem of minimising regret in two-armed bandit problems with
Gaussian rewards. Our objective is to use this simple setting to illustrate
that strategies based on an exploration phase (up to a stopping time) followed
by exploitation are necessarily suboptimal. The results hold regardless of
whether or not the difference in means between the two arms is known. Besides
the main message, we also refine existing deviation inequalities, which allow
us to design fully sequential strategies with finite-time regret guarantees
that are (a) asymptotically optimal as the horizon grows and (b) order-optimal
in the minimax sense. Furthermore we provide empirical evidence that the theory
also holds in practice and discuss extensions to non-gaussian and
multiple-armed case.

 <dc:description>  The capacity of symmetric instance of the multiple unicast index coding
problem with neighboring antidotes (side-information) with number of messages
equal to the number of receivers was given by Maleki \textit{et al.} In this
paper, we construct matrices of size $ m \times n (m \geq n)$ over $F_q$ such
that any $n$ adjacent rows of the matrix are linearly independent. By using
such matrices, we give an optimal scalar linear index codes over $F_q$ for the
symmetric one-sided antidote problems considered by Maleki \textit{et al.} for
any given number of messages and one-sided antidotes. The constructed codes are
independent of field size and hence works over every field.

 <dc:description>  We consider a geographically constrained caching community where popular data
files are cached on mobile terminals and distributed through Device-to-Device
(D2D) communications. Further, to ensure availability, data files are protected
against user mobility, or churn, with erasure coding. Communication and storage
costs (in units of energy) are considered. We focus on finding the coding
method that minimizes the overall cost in the network. Closed-form expressions
for the expected energy consumption incurred by data delivery and redundancy
maintenance are derived, and it is shown that coding significantly decreases
the overall energy consumption -- by more than 90% in a realistic scenario. It
is further shown that D2D caching can also yield notable economical savings for
telecommunication operators. Our results are illustrated by numerical examples
and verified by extensive computer simulations.

 <dc:title>Tight (Lower) Bounds for the Fixed Budget Best Arm Identification Bandit
  Problem</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider the problem of \textit{best arm identification} with a
\textit{fixed budget $T$}, in the $K$-armed stochastic bandit setting, with
arms distribution defined on $[0,1]$. We prove that any bandit strategy, for at
least one bandit problem characterized by a complexity $H$, will misidentify
the best arm with probability lower bounded by
$$\exp\Big(-\frac{T}{\log(K)H}\Big),$$ where $H$ is the sum for all sub-optimal
arms of the inverse of the squared gaps. Our result disproves formally the
general belief - coming from results in the fixed confidence setting - that
there must exist an algorithm for this problem whose probability of error is
upper bounded by $\exp(-T/H)$. This also proves that some existing strategies
based on the Successive Rejection of the arms are optimal - closing therefore
the current gap between upper and lower bounds for the fixed budget best arm
identification problem.

 <dc:description>  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been adopted as merely data producers
for years. However, the data collected by WSNs can also be used to manage their
operation and avoid unnecessary measurements that do not provide any new
knowledge about the environment. The benefits are twofold because wireless
sensor nodes may save their limited energy resources and also reduce the
wireless medium occupancy. We present a self-managed platform that collects and
stores data from sensor nodes, analyzes its contents and uses the built
knowledge to adjust the operation of the entire network. The system
architecture facilitates the incorporation of traditional WSNs into the
Internet of Things by abstracting the lower communication layers and allowing
decisions based on the data relevance. Finally, we demonstrate the platform
optimizing a WSN's operation at runtime, based on different real-time data
analysis.

 <dc:title>Market Dynamics of Best-Response with Lookahead</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Dvijotham, Krishnamurthy</dc:creator>

 <dc:creator>Schulman, Leonard J.</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  One attractive approach to market dynamics is the level $k$ model in which a
level $0$ player adopts a very simple response to current conditions, a level
$1$ player best-responds to a model in which others take level $0$ actions, and
so forth. (This is analogous to $k$-ply exploration of game trees in AI, and to
receding-horizon control in control theory.) If players have deterministic
mental models with this kind of finite-level response, there is obviously no
way their mental models can all be consistent. Nevertheless, there is
experimental evidence that people act this way in many situations, motivating
the question of what the dynamics of such interactions lead to.
  We address this question in the setting of Fisher Markets with constant
elasticities of substitution (CES) utilities, in the weak gross substitutes
(WGS) regime. We show that despite the inconsistency of the mental models, and
even if players' models change arbitrarily from round to round, the market
converges to its unique equilibrium. (We show this for both synchronous and
asynchronous discrete-time updates.) Moreover, the result is computationally
feasible in the sense that the convergence rate is linear, i.e., the distance
to equilibrium decays exponentially fast. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first result that demonstrates, in Fisher markets, convergence at any rate
for dynamics driven by a plausible model of seller incentives. Even for the
simple case of (level $0$) best-response dynamics, where we observe that
convergence at some rate can be derived from recent results in convex
optimization, our result is the first to demonstrate a linear rate of
convergence.

 <dc:description>  De Finetti theorems show how sufficiently exchangeable states are
well-approximated by convex combinations of i.i.d. states. Recently, it was
shown that in many quantum information applications a more relaxed de Finetti
reduction (i.e. only a matrix inequality between the symmetric state and one of
de Finetti form) is enough, and that it leads to more concise and elegant
arguments. Here we show several uses and general flexible applicability of a
constrained de Finetti reduction in quantum information theory, which was
recently discovered by Duan, Severini and Winter. In particular we show that
the technique can accommodate other symmetries commuting with the permutation
action, and permutation-invariant linear constraints. We then demonstrate that,
in some cases, it is also fruitful with convex constraints, in particular
separability in a bipartite setting. This is a constraint particularly
interesting in the context of the complexity class $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ of
interactive quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers, and our
results relate to the soundness gap amplification of $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$
protocols by parallel repetition. It is also relevant for the regularization of
certain entropic channel parameters. Finally, we explore an extension to
infinite-dimensional systems, which usually pose inherent problems to de
Finetti techniques in the quantum case.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In some of object recognition problems, labeled data may not be available for
all categories. Zero-shot learning utilizes auxiliary information (also called
signatures) describing each category in order to find a classifier that can
recognize samples from categories with no labeled instance. In this paper, we
propose a novel semi-supervised zero-shot learning method that works on an
embedding space corresponding to abstract deep visual features. We seek a
linear transformation on signatures to map them onto the visual features, such
that the mapped signatures of the seen classes are close to labeled samples of
the corresponding classes and unlabeled data are also close to the mapped
signatures of one of the unseen classes.
  We use the idea that the rich deep visual features provide a representation
space in which samples of each class are usually condensed in a cluster. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks improving the state-of-the-art prediction
accuracy on three of them.

 <dc:description>  The immense growth of data demands switching from traditional data processing
solutions to systems, which can process a continuous stream of real time data.
Various applications employ stream processing systems to provide solutions to
emerging Big Data problems. Open-source solutions such as Storm, Spark
Streaming, and S4 are the attempts to answer key stream processing questions.
The recent introduction of real time stream processing commercial solutions
such as Amazon Kinesis, IBM Infosphere Stream reflect industry requirements.
The system and application related challenges to handle massive stream of real
time data analytics are an active field of research.
  In this paper, we present a comparative analysis of the existing
state-of-the-art stream processing solutions. We also include various
application domains, which are transforming their business model to benefit
from these large scale stream processing systems.

 <dc:title>SUIS: An Online Graphical Signature-Based User Identification System</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Alam, Shahid</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Humans possess a large amount of, and almost limitless, visual memory, that
assists them to remember pictures far better than words. This phenomenon has
recently motivated the computer security researchers' in academia and industry
to design and develop graphical user identification systems (GUISs).
Cognometric GUISs are more memorable than drawmetric GUISs, but takes more time
to authenticate. None of the previously proposed GUISs combines the advantages
of both cognometric and drawmetric systems. A signature personify a person and
a graphical signature is easier to recall than other drawings. This paper
proposes a new graphical Signature-based User Identification System named SUIS.
It is based on a 2D grid technology, that is used to draw, digitize and store
the signature for user identification. SUIS is categorized as both a
cognometric and drawmetric system. Unlike other systems that use 2D grid: We
take one cell in a grid as one pixel in the drawing; for signature matching,
the signature drawn has to follow the same grid cells as the signature stored,
independent of the sequence; and that the system is not based on any machine
learning model. Increasing the number of grid cells increases the password
space, and decreasing the size of the grid cell increases the precision of the
signature. These characteristics makes SUIS: (1) Rigorous enough to be a
password system, but easy enough to be usable. (2) Independent of the language
and device used to draw the signature. (3) Efficient and practical to be used
for online authentication systems.

 <dc:description>  A phase detection sequence is a length-$n$ cyclic sequence, such that the
location of any length-$k$ contiguous subsequence can be determined from a
noisy observation of that subsequence. In this paper, we derive bounds on the
minimal possible $k$ in the limit of $n\to\infty$, and describe some sequence
constructions. We further consider multiple phase detection sequences, where
the location of any length-$k$ contiguous subsequence of each sequence can be
determined simultaneously from a noisy mixture of those subsequences. We study
the optimal trade-offs between the lengths of the sequences, and describe some
sequence constructions. We compare these phase detection problems to their
natural channel coding counterparts, and show a strict separation between the
fundamental limits in the multiple sequence case. Both adversarial and
probabilistic noise models are addressed.

 <dc:description>  Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Belief Propagation (BP) are the most
popular algorithms for computational inference in Graphical Models (GM). In
principle, MCMC is an exact probabilistic method which, however, often suffers
from exponentially slow mixing. In contrast, BP is a deterministic method,
which is typically fast, empirically very successful, however in general
lacking control of accuracy over loopy graphs. In this paper, we introduce MCMC
algorithms correcting the approximation error of BP, i.e., we provide a way to
compensate for BP errors via a consecutive BP-aware MCMC. Our framework is
based on the Loop Calculus (LC) approach which allows to express the BP error
as a sum of weighted generalized loops. Although the full series is
computationally intractable, it is known that a truncated series, summing up
all 2-regular loops, is computable in polynomial-time for planar pair-wise
binary GMs and it also provides a highly accurate approximation empirically.
Motivated by this, we first propose a polynomial-time approximation MCMC scheme
for the truncated series of general (non-planar) pair-wise binary models. Our
main idea here is to use the Worm algorithm, known to provide fast mixing in
other (related) problems, and then design an appropriate rejection scheme to
sample 2-regular loops. Furthermore, we also design an efficient rejection-free
MCMC scheme for approximating the full series. The main novelty underlying our
design is in utilizing the concept of cycle basis, which provides an efficient
decomposition of the generalized loops. In essence, the proposed MCMC schemes
run on transformed GM built upon the non-trivial BP solution, and our
experiments show that this synthesis of BP and MCMC outperforms both direct
MCMC and bare BP schemes.

 <dc:description>  We present a generic compact computational framework relying on structured
random matrices that can be applied to speed up several machine learning
algorithms with almost no loss of accuracy. The applications include new fast
LSH-based algorithms, efficient kernel computations via random feature maps,
convex optimization algorithms, quantization techniques and many more. Certain
models of the presented paradigm are even more compressible since they apply
only bit matrices. This makes them suitable for deploying on mobile devices.
All our findings come with strong theoretical guarantees. In particular, as a
byproduct of the presented techniques and by using relatively new
Berry-Esseen-type CLT for random vectors, we give the first theoretical
guarantees for one of the most efficient existing LSH algorithms based on the
$\textbf{HD}_{3}\textbf{HD}_{2}\textbf{HD}_{1}$ structured matrix (&quot;Practical
and Optimal LSH for Angular Distance&quot;). These guarantees as well as theoretical
results for other aforementioned applications follow from the same general
theoretical principle that we present in the paper. Our structured family
contains as special cases all previously considered structured schemes,
including the recently introduced $P$-model. Experimental evaluation confirms
the accuracy and efficiency of TripleSpin matrices.

 <dc:description>  We propose a scheme for recycling Gaussian random vectors into structured
matrices to approximate various kernel functions in sublinear time via random
embeddings. Our framework includes the Fastfood construction as a special case,
but also extends to Circulant, Toeplitz and Hankel matrices, and the broader
family of structured matrices that are characterized by the concept of
low-displacement rank. We introduce notions of coherence and graph-theoretic
structural constants that control the approximation quality, and prove
unbiasedness and low-variance properties of random feature maps that arise
within our framework. For the case of low-displacement matrices, we show how
the degree of structure and randomness can be controlled to reduce statistical
variance at the cost of increased computation and storage requirements.
Empirical results strongly support our theory and justify the use of a broader
family of structured matrices for scaling up kernel methods using random
features.

 <dc:description>  If a graph has $n\ge4k$ vertices and more than $n^2/4$ edges, then it
contains a copy of $C_{2k+1}$. In 1992, Erd\H{o}s, Faudree and Rousseau showed
even more, that the number of edges that occur in a triangle is at least
$2\lfloor n/2\rfloor+1$, and this bound is tight. They also showed that the
minimum number of edges that occur in a $C_{2k+1}$ for $k\ge2$ is at least
$11n^2/144-O(n)$, and conjectured that for any $k\ge2$, the correct lower bound
should be $2n^2/9-O(n)$. Very recently, F\&quot;uredi and Maleki constructed a
counterexample for $k=2$ and proved asymptotically matching lower bound, namely
that for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ graphs with $(1+\varepsilon)n^2/4$ edges contain
at least $(2+\sqrt{2})n^2/16 \approx 0.2134n^2$ edges that occur in $C_5$.
  In this paper, we use a different approach to tackle this problem and obtain
the following stronger result: Any $n$-vertex graph with at least $\lfloor
n^2/4\rfloor+1$ edges has at least $(2+\sqrt{2})n^2/16-O(n^{15/8})$ edges that
occur in $C_5$. Next, for all $k\ge 3$ and $n$ sufficiently large, we determine
the exact minimum number of edges that occur in $C_{2k+1}$ for $n$-vertex
graphs with more than $n^2/4$ edges, and show it is indeed equal to
$\lfloor\frac{n^2}4\rfloor+1-\lfloor\frac{n+4}6\rfloor\lfloor\frac{n+1}6\rfloor=2n^2/9-O(n)$.
For both results, we give a structural description of the extremal
configurations as well as obtain the corresponding stability results, which
answer a conjecture of F\&quot;uredi and Maleki.
  The main ingredient is a novel approach that combines the flag algebras
together with ideas from finite forcibility of graph limits. This approach
allowed us to keep track of the extra edge needed to guarantee an existence of
a $C_{2k+1}$. Also, we establish the first application of semidefinite method
in a setting, where the set of tight examples has exponential size, and arises
from different constructions.

the cross-bifix-free sets of strings. Non-overlapping sets of pictures are
non-expandable when no other picture can be added without violating the
property. We present a construction of non-expandable non-overlapping (NENO)

 <dc:description>  We consider the task of predicting various traits of a person given an image
of their face. We estimate both objective traits, such as gender, ethnicity and
hair-color; as well as subjective traits, such as the emotion a person
expresses or whether he is humorous or attractive. For sizeable
experimentation, we contribute a new Face Attributes Dataset (FAD), having
roughly 200,000 attribute labels for the above traits, for over 10,000 facial
images. Due to the recent surge of research on Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), we begin by using a CNN architecture for estimating facial
attributes and show that they indeed provide an impressive baseline
performance. To further improve performance, we propose a novel approach that
incorporates facial landmark information for input images as an additional
channel, helping the CNN learn better attribute-specific features so that the
landmarks across various training images hold correspondence. We empirically
analyse the performance of our method, showing consistent improvement over the
baseline across traits.

 <dc:title>Distributed Asynchronous Dual Free Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Huo, Zhouyuan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  The primal-dual distributed optimization methods have broad large-scale
machine learning applications. Previous primal-dual distributed methods are not
applicable when the dual formulation is not available, e.g. the
sum-of-non-convex objectives. Moreover, these algorithms and theoretical
analysis are based on the fundamental assumption that the computing speeds of
multiple machines in a cluster are similar. However, the straggler problem is
an unavoidable practical issue in the distributed system because of the
existence of slow machines. Therefore, the total computational time of the
distributed optimization methods is highly dependent on the slowest machine. In
this paper, we address these two issues by proposing distributed asynchronous
dual free stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm for distributed
optimization. Our method does not need the dual formulation of the target
problem in the optimization. We tackle the straggler problem through
asynchronous communication and the negative effect of slow machines is
significantly alleviated. We also analyze the convergence rate of our method
and prove the linear convergence rate even if the individual functions in
objective are non-convex. Experiments on both convex and non-convex loss
functions are used to validate our statements.

 <dc:description>  Inverse classification is the process of manipulating an instance such that
it is more likely to conform to a specific class. Past methods that address
such a problem have shortcomings. Greedy methods make changes that are overly
radical, often relying on data that is strictly discrete. Other methods rely on
certain data points, the presence of which cannot be guaranteed. In this paper
we propose a general framework and method that overcomes these and other
limitations. The formulation of our method can use any differentiable
classification function. We demonstrate the method by using logistic regression
and Gaussian kernel SVMs. We constrain the inverse classification to occur on
features that can actually be changed, each of which incurs an individual cost.
We further subject such changes to fall within a certain level of cumulative
change (budget). Our framework can also accommodate the estimation of
(indirectly changeable) features whose values change as a consequence of
actions taken. Furthermore, we propose two methods for specifying feature-value
ranges that result in different algorithmic behavior. We apply our method, and
a proposed sensitivity analysis-based benchmark method, to two freely available
datasets: Student Performance from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and a
real world cardiovascular disease dataset. The results obtained demonstrate the
validity and benefits of our framework and method.

 <dc:description>  We study the composition question for bounded-error randomized query
complexity: Is R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) R(g)) for all Boolean functions f and g?
We show that inserting a simple Boolean function h, whose query complexity is
only Theta(log R(g)), in between f and g allows us to prove R(f o h o g) =
Omega(R(f) R(h) R(g)).
  We prove this using a new lower bound measure for randomized query complexity
we call randomized sabotage complexity, RS(f). Randomized sabotage complexity
has several desirable properties, such as a perfect composition theorem, RS(f o
g) &gt;= RS(f) RS(g), and a composition theorem with randomized query complexity,
R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) RS(g)). It is also a quadratically tight lower bound for
total functions and can be quadratically superior to the partition bound, the
best known general lower bound for randomized query complexity.
  Using this technique we also show implications for lifting theorems in
communication complexity. We show that a general lifting theorem for zero-error
randomized protocols implies a general lifting theorem for bounded-error
protocols.

 <dc:title>Spectral Methods for Correlated Topic Models</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Statistics - Machine Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose guaranteed spectral methods for learning a broad
range of topic models, which generalize the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA). We overcome the limitation of LDA to incorporate arbitrary topic
correlations, by assuming that the hidden topic proportions are drawn from a
flexible class of Normalized Infinitely Divisible (NID) distributions. NID
distributions are generated through the process of normalizing a family of
independent Infinitely Divisible (ID) random variables. The Dirichlet
distribution is a special case obtained by normalizing a set of Gamma random
variables. We prove that this flexible topic model class can be learned via
spectral methods using only moments up to the third order, with (low order)
polynomial sample and computational complexity. The proof is based on a key new
technique derived here that allows us to diagonalize the moments of the NID
distribution through an efficient procedure that requires evaluating only
univariate integrals, despite the fact that we are handling high dimensional
multivariate moments. In order to assess the performance of our proposed Latent
NID topic model, we use two real datasets of articles collected from New York
Times and Pubmed. Our experiments yield improved perplexity on both datasets
compared with the baseline.

 <dc:creator>Hou, Chenping</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In many real tasks the features are evolving, with some features being
vanished and some other features augmented. For example, in environment
monitoring some sensors expired whereas some new ones deployed; in mobile game
recommendation some games dropped whereas some new ones added. Learning with
such incremental and decremental features is crucial but rarely studied,
particularly when the data coming like a stream and thus it is infeasible to
keep the whole data for optimization. In this paper, we study this challenging
problem and present the OPID approach. Our approach attempts to compress
important information of vanished features into functions of survived features,
and then expand to include the augmented features. It is the one-pass learning
approach, which only needs to scan each instance once and does not need to
store the whole data, and thus satisfy the evolving streaming data nature. The
effectiveness of our approach is validated theoretically and empirically.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks have had an enormous impact on image analysis.
State-of-the-art training methods, based on weight decay and DropOut, result in
impressive performance when a very large training set is available. However,
they tend to have large problems overfitting to small data sets. Indeed, the
available regularization methods deal with the complexity of the network
function only indirectly. In this paper, we study the feasibility of directly
using the $L_2$ function norm for regularization. Two methods to integrate this
new regularization in the stochastic backpropagation are proposed. Moreover,
the convergence of these new algorithms is studied. We finally show that they
outperform the state-of-the-art methods in the low sample regime on benchmark
datasets (MNIST and CIFAR10). The obtained results demonstrate very clear
improvement, especially in the context of small sample regimes with data laying
in a low dimensional manifold. Source code of the method can be found at

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a Bayesian sequential decision-making formulation of the
information filtering problem, in which an algorithm presents items (news
articles, scientific papers, tweets) arriving in a stream, and learns relevance
from user feedback on presented items. We model user preferences using a
Bayesian linear model, similar in spirit to a Bayesian linear bandit. We
compute a computational upper bound on the value of the optimal policy, which
allows computing an optimality gap for implementable policies. We then use this
analysis as motivation in introducing a pair of new Decompose-Then-Decide (DTD)
heuristic policies, DTD-Dynamic-Programming (DTD-DP) and
DTD-Upper-Confidence-Bound (DTD-UCB). We compare DTD-DP and DTD-UCB against
several benchmarks on real and simulated data, demonstrating significant
improvement, and show that the achieved performance is close to the upper
bound.

the same way as using the standard Python interactive interpreter. It allows
programs to be modified while they are running. PyRIDE is also a software
integration framework that abstracts and aggregates disparate low level ROS
software modules, e.g. arm joint motor controllers, and exposes their
functionalities through a unified Python programming interface. PR2 programmers
are able to experiment and develop robot behaviours without dealing with
specific details of accessing underlying softwares and hardwares. PyRIDE
provides a client-server mechanism that allows remote user access of the robot
functionalities, e.g. remote robot monitoring and control, access real-time
robot camera image data etc. This enables multi-modal human robot interactions
using different devices and user interfaces. All these features are seamlessly
integrated into one lightweight and portable middleware package. In this paper,
we use four real life scenarios to demonstrate PyRIDE key features and
illustrate the usefulness of software.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we proposed a sentence encoding-based model for recognizing
text entailment. In our approach, the encoding of sentence is a two-stage
process. Firstly, average pooling was used over word-level bidirectional LSTM
(biLSTM) to generate a first-stage sentence representation. Secondly, attention
mechanism was employed to replace average pooling on the same sentence for
better representations. Instead of using target sentence to attend words in
source sentence, we utilized the sentence's first-stage representation to
attend words appeared in itself, which is called &quot;Inner-Attention&quot; in our paper
. Experiments conducted on Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) Corpus
has proved the effectiveness of &quot;Inner-Attention&quot; mechanism. With less number
of parameters, our model outperformed the existing best sentence encoding-based
approach by a large margin.

 <dc:description>  Understanding how words change their meanings over time is key to models of
language and cultural evolution, but historical data on meaning is scarce,
making theories hard to develop and test. Word embeddings show promise as a
diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust
methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings
(PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this
methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six
historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two
quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of
semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the
law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous
have higher rates of semantic change.

 <dc:description>  Many powerful machine learning models are based on the composition of
multiple processing layers, such as deep nets, which gives rise to nonconvex
objective functions. A general, recent approach to optimise such &quot;nested&quot;
functions is the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). MAC introduces an
auxiliary coordinate for each data point in order to decouple the nested model
into independent submodels. This decomposes the optimisation into steps that
alternate between training single layers and updating the coordinates. It has
the advantage that it reuses existing single-layer algorithms, introduces
parallelism, and does not need to use chain-rule gradients, so it works with
nondifferentiable layers. With large-scale problems, or when distributing the
computation is necessary for faster training, the dataset may not fit in a
single machine. It is then essential to limit the amount of communication
between machines so it does not obliterate the benefit of parallelism. We
describe a general way to achieve this, ParMAC. ParMAC works on a cluster of
processing machines with a circular topology and alternates two steps until
convergence: one step trains the submodels in parallel using stochastic
updates, and the other trains the coordinates in parallel. Only submodel
parameters, no data or coordinates, are ever communicated between machines.
ParMAC exhibits high parallelism, low communication overhead, and facilitates
data shuffling, load balancing, fault tolerance and streaming data processing.
We study the convergence of ParMAC and propose a theoretical model of its
runtime and parallel speedup. We develop ParMAC to learn binary autoencoders
for fast, approximate image retrieval. We implement it in MPI in a distributed
system and demonstrate nearly perfect speedups in a 128-processor cluster with
a training set of 100 million high-dimensional points.

 <dc:description>  A common requirement in policy specification languages is the ability to map
policies to the underlying network devices. Doing so, in a provably correct
way, is important in a security policy context, so administrators can be
confident of the level of protection provided by the policies for their
networks. Existing policy languages allow policy composition but lack formal
semantics to allocate policy to network devices.
  Our research tackles this from first principles: we ask how network policies
can be described at a high-level, independent of firewall-vendor and network
minutiae. We identify the algebraic requirements of the policy mapping process
and propose semantic foundations to formally verify if a policy is implemented
by the correct set of policy-arbiters. We show the value of our proposed
algebras in maintaining concise network-device configurations by applying them
to real-world networks.

 <dc:description>  The performance of image segmentation highly relies on the original inputting
image. When the image is contaminated by some noises or blurs, we can not
obtain the efficient segmentation result by using direct segmentation methods.
In order to efficiently segment the contaminated image, this paper proposes a
two step method based on the hybrid total variation model with a box constraint
and the K-means clustering method. In the first step, the hybrid model is based
on the weighted convex combination between the total variation functional and
the high-order total variation as the regularization term to obtain the
original clustering data. In order to deal with non-smooth regularization term,
we solve this model by employing the alternating split Bregman method. Then, in
the second step, the segmentation can be obtained by thresholding this
clustering data into different phases, where the thresholds can be given by
using the K-means clustering method. Numerical comparisons show that our
proposed model can provide more efficient segmentation results dealing with the
noise image and blurring image.

 <dc:description>  We refine the general methodology in [1] for the construction and analysis of
essentially minimax estimators for a wide class of functionals of finite
dimensional parameters, and elaborate on the case of discrete distributions
with support size $S$ comparable with the number of observations $n$.
Specifically, we determine the &quot;smooth&quot; and &quot;non-smooth&quot; regimes based on the
confidence set and the smoothness of the functional. In the &quot;non-smooth&quot;
regime, we apply an unbiased estimator for a suitable polynomial approximation
of the functional. In the &quot;smooth&quot; regime, we construct a general version of
the bias-corrected Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) based on Taylor
expansion.
  We apply the general methodology to the problem of estimating the KL
divergence between two discrete probability measures $P$ and $Q$ from empirical
data in a non-asymptotic and possibly large alphabet setting. We construct
minimax rate-optimal estimators for $D(P\|Q)$ when the likelihood ratio is
upper bounded by a constant which may depend on the support size, and show that
the performance of the optimal estimator with $n$ samples is essentially that
of the MLE with $n\ln n$ samples. Our estimator is adaptive in the sense that
it does not require the knowledge of the support size nor the upper bound on
the likelihood ratio. We show that the general methodology results in minimax
rate-optimal estimators for other divergences as well, such as the Hellinger
distance and the $\chi^2$-divergence. Our approach refines the &quot;Approximation&quot;
methodology recently developed for the construction of near minimax estimators
of functionals of high-dimensional parameters, such as entropy, R\'enyi
entropy, mutual information and $\ell_1$ distance in large alphabet settings,
and shows that the &quot;effective sample size enlargement&quot; phenomenon holds
significantly more widely than previously established.

 <dc:title>Zigzag Decodable Fountain Codes</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a fountain coding system which has lower space decoding
complexity and lower decoding erasure rate than the Raptor coding systems. The
main idea of the proposed fountain code is employing shift and exclusive OR to
generate the output packets. This technique is known as the zigzag decodable
code, which is efficiently decoded by the zigzag decoder. In other words, we
propose a fountain code based on the zigzag decodable code in this paper.
Moreover, we analyze the overhead for the received packets, decoding erasure
rate, decoding complexity, and asymptotic overhead of the proposed fountain
code. As the result, we show that the proposed fountain code outperforms the
Raptor codes in terms of the overhead and decoding erasure rate. Simulation
results show that the proposed fountain coding system outperforms Raptor coding
system in terms of the overhead and the space decoding complexity.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we introduce a new set of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks in
Minecraft (a flexible 3D world). We then use these tasks to systematically
compare and contrast existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) architectures
with our new memory-based DRL architectures. These tasks are designed to
emphasize, in a controllable manner, issues that pose challenges for RL methods
including partial observability (due to first-person visual observations),
delayed rewards, high-dimensional visual observations, and the need to use
active perception in a correct manner so as to perform well in the tasks. While
these tasks are conceptually simple to describe, by virtue of having all of
these challenges simultaneously they are difficult for current DRL
architectures. Additionally, we evaluate the generalization performance of the
architectures on environments not used during training. The experimental
results show that our new architectures generalize to unseen environments
better than existing DRL architectures.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper investigates an important problem in stream mining, i.e.,
classification under streaming emerging new classes or SENC. The common
approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a
supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternative
approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. The
SENC problem can be decomposed into three sub problems: detecting emerging new
classes, classifying for known classes, and updating models to enable
classification of instances of the new class and detection of more emerging new
classes. The proposed method employs completely random trees which have been
shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning
independently in the literature. This is the first time, as far as we know,
that completely random trees are used as a single common core to solve all
three sub problems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning and model update
in data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method
often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing
classification-focused methods.

 <dc:description>  We propose a novel approach for pixel classification in hyperspectral images,
leveraging on both the spatial and spectral information in the data. The
introduced method relies on a recently proposed framework for learning on
distributions -- by representing them with mean elements in reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and formulating a classification algorithm therein. In
particular, we associate each pixel to an empirical distribution of its
neighbouring pixels, a judicious representation of which in an RKHS, in
conjunction with the spectral information contained in the pixel itself, give a
new explicit set of features that can be fed into a suite of standard
classification techniques -- we opt for a well-established framework of support
vector machines (SVM). Furthermore, the computational complexity is reduced via
random Fourier features formalism. We study the consistency and the convergence
rates of the proposed method and the experiments demonstrate strong performance
on hyperspectral data with gains in comparison to the state-of-the-art results.

 <dc:description>  In solving a linear system with iterative methods, one is usually confronted
with the dilemma of having to choose between cheap, inefficient iterates over
sparse search directions (e.g., coordinate descent), or expensive iterates in
well-chosen search directions (e.g., conjugate gradients). In this paper, we
propose to interpolate between these two extremes, and show how to perform
cheap iterations along non-sparse search directions, provided that these
directions can be extracted from a new kind of sparse factorization. For
example, if the search directions are the columns of a hierarchical matrix,
then the cost of each iteration is typically logarithmic in the number of
variables. Using some graph-theoretical results on low-stretch spanning trees,
we deduce as a special case a nearly-linear time algorithm to approximate the
minimal norm solution of a linear system $Bx= b$ where $B$ is the incidence
matrix of a graph. We thereby can connect our results to recently proposed
nearly-linear time solvers for Laplacian systems, which emerge here as a
particular application of our sparse matrix factorization.

 <dc:title>New tools in GeoGebra offering novel opportunities to teach loci and

 <dc:description>  GeoGebra is an open source mathematics education software tool being used in
thousands of schools worldwide. Since version 4.2 (December 2012) it supports
symbolic computation of locus equations as a result of joint effort of
mathematicians and programmers helping the GeoGebra developer team. The joint
work, based on former researches, started in 2010 and continued until present
days, now enables fast locus and envelope computations even in a web browser in
full HTML5 mode. Thus, classroom demonstrations and deeper investigations of
dynamic analytical geometry are ready to use on tablets or smartphones as well.
  In our paper we consider some typical secondary school topics where
investigating loci is a natural way of defining mathematical objects. We
discuss the technical possibilities in GeoGebra by using the new commands
LocusEquation and Envelope, showing through different examples how these
commands can enrich the learning of mathematics. The covered school topics
include definition of a parabola and other conics in different situations like
synthetic definitions or points and curves associated with a triangle. Despite
the fact that in most secondary schools, no other than quadratic curves are
discussed, simple generalization of some exercises, and also every day
problems, will smoothly introduce higher order algebraic curves. Thus our paper
mentions the cubic curve &quot;strophoid&quot; as locus of the orthocenter of a triangle
when one of the vertices moves on a circle. Also quartic &quot;cardioid&quot; and sextic
&quot;nephroid&quot; can be of every day interest when investigating mathematics in, say,
a coffee cup.
  We also focus on GeoGebra specific tips and tricks when constructing a
geometric figure to be available for getting the locus equation. Among others,
simplification and synthetization (via the intercept theorem) are mentioned.

 <dc:description>  The paper deals with modeling the liver perfusion intended to improve
quantitative analysis of the tissue scans provided by the contrast-enhanced
computed tomography (CT). For this purpose, we developed a model of dynamic
transport of the contrast fluid through the hierarchies of the perfusion trees.
Conceptually, computed time-space distributions of the so-called tissue density
can be compared with the measured data obtained from CT; such a modeling
feedback can be used for model parameter identification. The blood flow is
characterized at several scales for which different models are used. Flows in
upper hierarchies represented by larger branching vessels are described using
simple 1D models based on the Bernoulli equation extended by correction terms
to respect the local pressure losses. To describe flows in smaller vessels and
in the tissue parenchyma, we propose a 3D continuum model of porous medium
defined in terms of hierarchically matched compartments characterized by
hydraulic permeabilities. The 1D models corresponding to the portal and hepatic
veins are coupled with the 3D model through point sources, or sinks. The
contrast fluid saturation is governed by transport equations adapted for the 1D
and 3D flow models. The complex perfusion model has been implemented using the
finite element and finite volume methods. We report numerical examples computed
for anatomically relevant geometries of the liver organ and of the principal
vascular trees. The simulated tissue density corresponding to the CT
examination output reflects a pathology modeled as a localized permeability
deficiency.

 <dc:description>  Infographic is a type of information visualization that uses graphic design
to enhance human ability to identify patterns and trends. It is popularly used
to support spread of information. Yet, there are few studies that investigate
how infographics affect learning and how individual factors, such as learning
styles and enjoyment of the information affect infographics perception. In this
sense, this paper describes a case study performed in an online platform where
27 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to view infographics (n=14)
and graphics+text (n=13) as learning materials about the same content. They
also responded to questionnaires of enjoyment and learning styles. Our findings
indicate that there is no correlation between learning styles and post-test
scores. Furthermore, we did not find any difference regarding learning between
students using graphics or infographics. Nevertheless, for learners using
infographics, we found a significant and positive correlation between correct
answers and the positive self-assessment of enjoyment/ pleasure. We also
identified that students who used infographics keep their acquired information
longer than students who only used graphics+text, indicating that infographics
can better support robust learning.

 <dc:description>  Buyers (e.g., advertisers) often have limited financial and processing
resources, and so their participation in auctions is throttled. Changes to
auctions may affect bids or throttling and any change may affect what winners
pay. This paper shows that if an A/B experiment affects only bids, then the
observed treatment effect is unbiased when all the bidders in an auction are
randomly assigned to A or B but it can be severely biased otherwise, even in
the absence of throttling. Experiments that affect throttling algorithms can
also be badly biased, but the bias can be substantially reduced if the budget
for each advertiser in the experiment is allocated to separate pots for the A
and B arms of the experiment.

 <dc:title>The use of the multi-cumulant tensor analysis for the algorithmic
  optimisation of investment portfolios</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  The cumulant analysis plays an important role in non Gaussian distributed
data analysis. The shares' prices returns are good example of such data. The
purpose of this research is to develop the cumulant based algorithm and use it
to determine eigenvectors that represent investment portfolios with low
variability. Such algorithm is based on the Alternating Least Square method and
involves the simultaneous minimisation 2'nd -- 6'th cumulants of the
multidimensional random variable (percentage shares' returns of many
companies). Then the algorithm was tested during the recent crash on the Warsaw
Stock Exchange. To determine incoming crash and provide enter and exit signal
for the investment strategy the Hurst exponent was calculated using the local
DFA. It was shown that introduced algorithm is on average better that benchmark
and other portfolio determination methods, but only within examination window
determined by low values of the Hurst exponent. Remark that the algorithm of is
based on cumulant tensors up to the 6'th order calculated for a
multidimensional random variable, what is the novel idea. It can be expected
that the algorithm would be useful in the financial data analysis on the world
wide scale as well as in the analysis of other types of non Gaussian
distributed data.

 <dc:description>  Flexible licensing model is a necessary enabler of the technical and
procedural complexities of Spectrum Access System (SAS)-based sharing
framework. The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of 3.5GHz
Licensing Framework - based on census tracts as area units, areas whose main
characteristic is population. As such, the boundary of census tract does not
follow the edge of wireless network coverage. We demonstrate why census tracts
are not suitable for small cell networks licensing, by (1) gathering and
analysing the official census data, (2) exploring the boundaries of census
tracts which are in the shape of nonconvex polygons and (3) giving a measure of
effectiveness of the licensing scheme through metrics of area loss and the
number of people per census tract with access to spectrum. Results show that
census tracts severely impact the effectiveness of the licensing framework
since almost entire strategically important cities in the U.S. will not avail
from spectrum use in 3.5GHz band. Our paper does not seek to challenge the core
notion of geographic licensing concept, but seeks a corrective that addresses
the way the license is issued for a certain area of operation. The effects that
inappropriate size of the license has on spectrum assignments lead to spectrum
being simply wasted in geography, time and frequency or not being assigned in a
fair manner. The corrective is necessary since the main goal of promoting
innovative sharing in 3.5 GHz band is to put spectrum to more efficient use.

 <dc:description>  There are many application fields for robotic systems including service
robotics, search and rescue missions, industry and space robotics. As the
scenarios in these areas grow more and more complex, there is a high demand for
powerful tools to efficiently program heterogeneous robotic systems. Therefore,
we created RAFCON, a graphical tool to develop robotic tasks and to be used for
mission control by remotely monitoring the execution of the tasks. To define
the tasks, we use state machines which support hierarchies and concurrency.
Together with a library concept, even complex scenarios can be handled
gracefully. RAFCON supports sophisticated debugging functionality and tightly
integrates error handling and recovery mechanisms. A GUI with a powerful state
machine editor makes intuitive, visual programming and fast prototyping
possible. We demonstrated the capabilities of our tool in the SpaceBotCamp
national robotic competition, in which our mobile robot solved all exploration
and assembly challenges fully autonomously. It is therefore also a promising
tool for various RoboCup leagues.

 <dc:title>A Polynomial Time Graph Isomorphism Algorithm For Graphs That Are Not

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we show the existence of a polynomial time graph isomorphism
algorithm for all graphs excluding graphs that are locally trianglefree. This
particular class of graphs allows to divide the graph into neighbourhood
sub-graph where each of induced sub-graph (neighbourhood) has at least 2
vertices. We construct all possible permutations for each induced sub-graph
using a search tree. We construct automorphisms of subgraphs based on these
permutations. Finally, we decide isomorphism through automorphisms .
  The author expects that the solution, present in this paper, may lead to a
faster algorithm for the general case of graph isomorphism (using &quot; barycentric
subdivision&quot; ). The paper might affect group isomorphism also as we may
construct graphs (corresponds to a particular group) in way so we can avoid it
to be a triangle free graph. Since,for a given group G , each choice of a
generating set will give a different Cayley graph.

 <dc:title>Bitcoin's Security Model Revisited</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Sompolinsky, Yonatan</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Cryptography and Security</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We revisit the fundamental question of Bitcoin's security against double
spending attacks. While previous work has bounded the probability that a
transaction is reversed, we show that no such guarantee can be effectively
given if the attacker can choose when to launch the attack. Other approaches
that bound the cost of an attack have erred in considering only limited attack
scenarios, and in fact it is easy to show that attacks may not cost the
attacker at all. We therefore provide a different interpretation of the results
presented in previous papers and correct them in several ways. We provide
different notions of the security of transactions that provide guarantees to
different classes of defenders: merchants who regularly receive payments,
miners, and recipients of large one-time payments. We additionally consider an
attack that can be launched against lightweight clients, and show that these
are less secure than their full node counterparts and provide the right
strategy for defenders in this case as well. Our results, overall, improve the
understanding of Bitcoin's security guarantees and provide correct bounds for
those wishing to safely accept transactions.

 <dc:description>  We propose a generic strategic network resource sharing game between a set of
players representing operators. The players negotiate which sets of players
share given resources, serving users with varying sensitivity to interference.
We prove that the proposed game has a Nash equilibrium, to which a greedily
played game converges. Furthermore, simulation results show that, when applied
to inter-operator spectrum sharing in small-cell indoor office environment, the
convergence is fast and there is a significant performance improvement for the
operators when compared to the default resource usage configuration.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We propose a novel methodology, forest floor, to visualize and interpret
random forest (RF) models. RF is a popular and useful tool for non-linear
multi-variate classification and regression, which yields a good trade-off
between robustness (low variance) and adaptiveness (low bias). Direct
interpretation of a RF model is difficult, as the explicit ensemble model of
hundreds of deep trees is complex. Nonetheless, it is possible to visualize a
RF model fit by its mapping from feature space to prediction space. Hereby the
user is first presented with the overall geometrical shape of the model
structure, and when needed one can zoom in on local details. Dimensional
reduction by projection is used to visualize high dimensional shapes. The
traditional method to visualize RF model structure, partial dependence plots,
achieve this by averaging multiple parallel projections. We suggest to first
use feature contributions, a method to decompose trees by splitting features,
and then subsequently perform projections. The advantages of forest floor over
partial dependence plots is that interactions are not masked by averaging. As a
consequence, it is possible to locate interactions, which are not visualized in
a given projection. Furthermore, we introduce: a goodness-of-visualization
measure, use of colour gradients to identify interactions and an out-of-bag
cross validated variant of feature contributions.

 <dc:description>  This paper addresses identification of sparse linear and noise-driven
continuous-time state-space systems, i.e., the right-hand sides in the
dynamical equations depend only on a subset of the states. The key assumption
in this study, is that the sample rate is not high enough to directly infer the
continuous time system from the data. This assumption is relevant in
applications where sampling is expensive or requires human intervention (e.g.,
biomedicine applications). We propose an iterative optimization scheme with
$l_1$-regularization, where the search directions are restricted those that
decrease prediction error in each iteration. We provide numerical examples
illustrating the proposed method; the method outperforms the least squares
estimation for large noise.

 <dc:description>  This technical report details several improvements to the visual concept
detector banks built on images from the Multilingual Visual Sentiment Ontology
(MVSO). The detector banks are trained to detect a total of 9,918
sentiment-biased visual concepts from six major languages: English, Spanish,
Italian, French, German and Chinese. In the original MVSO release,
adjective-noun pair (ANP) detectors were trained for the six languages using an
AlexNet-styled architecture by fine-tuning from DeepSentiBank. Here, through a
more extensive set of experiments, parameter tuning, and training runs, we
detail and release higher accuracy models for detecting ANPs across six
languages from the same image pool and setting as in the original release using
a more modern architecture, GoogLeNet, providing comparable or better
performance with reduced network parameter cost.
  In addition, since the image pool in MVSO can be corrupted by user noise from
social interactions, we partitioned out a sub-corpus of MVSO images based on
tag-restricted queries for higher fidelity labels. We show that as a result of
these higher fidelity labels, higher performing AlexNet-styled ANP detectors
can be trained using the tag-restricted image subset as compared to the models
in full corpus. We release all these newly trained models for public research
use along with the list of tag-restricted images from the MVSO dataset.

 <dc:title>Fine tuning consensus optimization for distributed radio interferometric

 <dc:creator>Yatawatta, Sarod</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We recently proposed the use of consensus optimization as a viable and
effective way to improve the quality of calibration of radio interferometric
data. We showed that it is possible to obtain far more accurate calibration
solutions and also to distribute the compute load across a network of computers
by using this technique. A crucial aspect in any consensus optimization problem
is the selection of the penalty parameter used in the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) iterations. This affects the convergence speed as
well as the accuracy. In this paper, we use the Hessian of the cost function
used in calibration to appropriately select this penalty. We extend our results
to a multi-directional calibration setting, where we propose to use a penalty
scaled by the squared intensity of each direction.

 <dc:description>  A large body of work in machine learning has focused on the problem of
learning a close approximation to an underlying combinatorial function, given a
small set of labeled examples. However, for real-valued functions, cardinal
labels might not be accessible, or it may be difficult for an expert to
consistently assign real-valued labels over the entire set of examples. For
instance, it is notoriously hard for consumers to reliably assign values to
bundles of merchandise. Instead, it might be much easier for a consumer to
report which of two bundles she likes better. With this motivation in mind, we
consider an alternative learning model, wherein the algorithm must learn the
underlying function up to pairwise comparisons, from pairwise comparisons. In
this model, we present a series of novel algorithms that learn over a wide
variety of combinatorial function classes. These range from graph functions to
broad classes of valuation functions that are fundamentally important in
microeconomic theory, the analysis of social networks, and machine learning,
such as coverage, submodular, XOS, and subadditive functions, as well as
functions with sparse Fourier support.

 <dc:description>  Solving inverse problems with iterative algorithms is popular, especially for
large data. Due to time constraints, the number of possible iterations is
usually limited, potentially limiting the achievable accuracy. Given an error
one is willing to tolerate, an important question is whether it is possible to
modify the original iterations to obtain faster convergence to a minimizer
achieving the allowed error without increasing the computational cost of each
iteration considerably. Relying on recent recovery techniques developed for
settings in which the desired signal belongs to some low-dimensional set, we
show that using a coarse estimate of this set may lead to a faster convergence
at the cost of an additional error in the reconstruction related to the
accuracy of the set approximation. Our theory ties to recent advances in sparse
recovery, compressed sensing, and deep learning. Particularly, it may provide a
possible explanation to the successful approximation of the l_1-minimization
solution by neural networks with layers representing iterations, as practiced
in the learned iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (LISTA).

 <dc:title>A Note on the Area Requirement of Euclidean Greedy Embeddings of
  Christmas Cactus Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Prutkin, Roman</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computational Geometry</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  An Euclidean greedy embedding of a graph is a straight-line embedding in the
plane, such that for every pair of vertices $s$ and $t$, the vertex $s$ has a
neighbor $v$ with smaller distance to $t$ than $s$. This drawing style is
motivated by greedy geometric routing in wireless sensor networks.
  A Christmas cactus is a connected graph in which every two simple cycles have
at most one vertex in common and in which every cutvertex is part of at most
two biconnected blocks. It has been proved that Christmas cactus graphs have an
Euclidean greedy embedding. This fact has played a crucial role in proving that
every 3-connected planar graph has an Euclidean greedy embedding. The proofs
construct greedy embeddings of Christmas cactuses of exponential size, and it
has been an open question whether exponential area is necessary in the worst
case for greedy embeddings of Christmas cactuses. We prove that this is indeed
the case.

 <dc:description>  Segmentations are often necessary for the analysis of image data. They are
used to identify different objects, for example cell nuclei, mitochondria, or
complete cells in microscopic images. There might be features in the data, that
cannot be detected by segmentation approaches directly, because they are not
characterized by their texture of boundaries, which are properties most
segmentation techniques rely on, but morphologically. In this report we will
introduce our algorithm for the extraction of suchlike morphological features
of segmented objects from segmentations of neuromuscular junctions and its

 <dc:description>  We consider a distributed Software Defined Networking (SDN) architecture
adopting a cluster of multiple controllers to improve network performance and
reliability. Besides the Openflow control traffic exchanged between controllers
and switches, we focus on the control traffic exchanged among the controllers
in the cluster, needed to run coordination and consensus algorithms to keep the
controllers synchronized. We estimate the effect of the inter-controller
communications on the reaction time perceived by the switches depending on the
data-ownership model adopted in the cluster. The model is accurately validated
in an operational Software Defined WAN (SDWAN). We advocate a careful placement
of the controllers, that should take into account both the above kinds of
control traffic. We evaluate, for some real ISP network topologies, the delay
tradeoffs for the controllers placement problem and we propose a novel
evolutionary algorithm to find the corresponding Pareto frontier. Our work
provides novel quantitative tools to optimize the planning and the design of
the network supporting the control plane of SDN networks, especially when the
network is very large and in-band control plane is adopted. We also show that
for operational distributed controllers (e.g. OpenDaylight and ONOS), the
location of the controller which acts as a leader in the consensus algorithm
has a strong impact on the reactivity perceived by switches.

 <dc:description>  We propose a new internal guidance method for automated theorem provers based
on the given-clause algorithm. Our method influences the choice of unprocessed
clauses using positive and negative examples from previous proofs. To this end,
we present an efficient scheme for Naive Bayesian classification by
generalising label occurrences to types with monoid structure. This makes it
possible to extend existing fast classifiers, which consider only positive
examples, with negative ones. We implement the method in the higher-order logic
prover Satallax, where we modify the delay with which propositions are
processed. We evaluated our method on a simply-typed higher-order logic version
of the Flyspeck project, where it solves 26% more problems than Satallax
without internal guidance.

 <dc:description>  In this work the strategy of the Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) to
build a Latin American collaboration is presented. Installing Cosmic Rays
detectors settled all around the Continent, from Mexico to the Antarctica, this
collaboration is forming a community that embraces both high energy physicist
and computer scientists. This is so because the data that are measured must be
analytical processed and due to the fact that \textit{a priori} and \textit{a
posteriori} simulations representing the effects of the radiation must be
performed. To perform the calculi, customized codes have been implemented by
the collaboration. With regard to the huge amount of data emerging from this
network of sensors and from the computational simulations performed in a
diversity of computing architectures and e-infrastructures, an effort is being
carried out to catalog and preserve a vast amount of data produced by the
water-Cherenkov Detector network and the complete LAGO simulation workflow that
characterize each site. Metadata, Permanent Identifiers and the facilities from
the LAGO Data Repository are described in this work jointly with the simulation
codes used. These initiatives allow researchers to produce and find data and to
directly use them in a code running by means of a Science Gateway that provides
access to different clusters, Grid and Cloud infrastructures worldwide.

 <dc:description>  Hessian information speeds convergence substantially in motion optimization.
The better the Hessian approximation the better the convergence. But how good
is a given approximation theoretically? How much are we losing? This paper
addresses that question and proves that for a particularly popular and
empirically strong approximation known as the Gauss-Newton approximation, we
actually lose very little--for a large class of highly expressive objective
terms, the true Hessian actually limits to the Gauss-Newton Hessian quickly as
the trajectory's time discretization becomes small. This result both motivates
it's use and offers insight into computationally efficient design. For
instance, traditional representations of kinetic energy exploit the generalized
inertia matrix whose derivatives are usually difficult to compute. We introduce
here a novel reformulation of rigid body kinetic energy designed explicitly for
fast and accurate curvature calculation. Our theorem proves that the
Gauss-Newton Hessian under this formulation efficiently captures the kinetic
energy curvature, but requires only as much computation as a single evaluation
of the traditional representation. Additionally, we introduce a technique that
exploits these ideas implicitly using Cholesky decompositions for some cases
when similar objective terms reformulations exist but may be difficult to find.
Our experiments validate these findings and demonstrate their use on a
real-world motion optimization system for high-dof motion generation.

 <dc:description>  We propose k^2-means, a new clustering method which efficiently copes with
large numbers of clusters and achieves low energy solutions. k^2-means builds
upon the standard k-means (Lloyd's algorithm) and combines a new strategy to
accelerate the convergence with a new low time complexity divisive
initialization. The accelerated convergence is achieved through only looking at
k_n nearest clusters and using triangle inequality bounds in the assignment
step while the divisive initialization employs an optimal 2-clustering along a
direction. The worst-case time complexity per iteration of our k^2-means is
O(nk_nd+k^2d), where d is the dimension of the n data points and k is the
number of clusters and usually n &lt;&lt; k &lt;&lt; k_n. Compared to k-means' O(nkd)
complexity, our k^2-means complexity is significantly lower, at the expense of
slightly increasing the memory complexity by O(nk_n+k^2). In our extensive
experiments k^2-means is order(s) of magnitude faster than standard methods in
computing accurate clusterings on several standard datasets and settings with
hundreds of clusters and high dimensional data. Moreover, the proposed divisive
initialization generally leads to clustering energies comparable to those
achieved with the standard k-means++ initialization, while being significantly
faster.

 <dc:description>  Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art results on
many pattern recognition tasks, especially vision classification problems.
Understanding the inner workings of such computational brains is both
fascinating basic science that is interesting in its own right - similar to why
we study the human brain - and will enable researchers to further improve DNNs.
One path to understanding how a neural network functions internally is to study
what each of its neurons has learned to detect. One such method is called
activation maximization (AM), which synthesizes an input (e.g. an image) that
highly activates a neuron. Here we dramatically improve the qualitative state
of the art of activation maximization by harnessing a powerful, learned prior:
a deep generator network (DGN). The algorithm (1) generates qualitatively
state-of-the-art synthetic images that look almost real, (2) reveals the
features learned by each neuron in an interpretable way, (3) generalizes well
to new datasets and somewhat well to different network architectures without
requiring the prior to be relearned, and (4) can be considered as a
high-quality generative method (in this case, by generating novel, creative,
interesting, recognizable images).

 <dc:description>  We consider joint caching, routing, and channel assignment for video delivery
over coordinated small-cell cellular systems of the future Internet. We
formulate the problem of maximizing the throughput of the system as a linear
program in which the number of variables is very large. To address channel
interference, our formulation incorporates the conflict graph that arises when
wireless links interfere with each other due to simultaneous transmission. We
utilize the column generation method to solve the problem by breaking it into a
restricted master subproblem that involves a select subset of variables and a
collection of pricing subproblems that select the new variable to be introduced
into the restricted master problem, if that leads to a better objective
function value. To control the complexity of the column generation optimization
further, due to the exponential number of independent sets that arise from the
conflict graph, we introduce an approximation algorithm that computes a
solution that is within $\epsilon$ to optimality, at much lower complexity. Our
framework demonstrates considerable gains in average transmission rate at which
the video data can be delivered to the users, over the state-of-the-art
Femtocaching system, of up to 46%. These operational gains in system
performance map to analogous gains in video application quality, thereby
enhancing the user experience considerably.

 <dc:description>  Popular content caching is expected to play a major role in efficiently
reducing backhaul congestion and achieving user satisfaction in next generation
mobile radio systems. Consider the downlink of a cache-enabled cloud radio
access network (CRAN), where each cache-enabled base station (BS) is equipped
with limited-size local cache storage. The central computing unit (cloud) is
connected to the BSs via a limited capacity backhaul link and serves a set of
single-antenna mobile users (MUs). This paper assumes that only imperfect
channel state information (CSI) is available at the cloud. It focuses on the
problem of minimizing the total network power and backhaul cost so as to
determine the beamforming vector of each user across the network, the
quantization noise covariance matrix, and the BS clustering subject to
imperfect channel state information and fixed cache placement assumptions. The
paper suggests solving such a difficult, non-convex optimization problem using
the semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The paper then uses the $\ell_0$-norm
approximation to provide a feasible, sub-optimal solution using the
majorization-minimization (MM) approach. Simulation results particularly show
how the cache-enabled network significantly improves the backhaul cost
especially at high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) values as
compared to conventional cache-less CRANs.

 <dc:description>  Object recognition is an important task for improving the ability of visual
systems to perform complex scene understanding. Recently, the Exponential
Linear Unit (ELU) has been proposed as a key component for managing bias shift
in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), but defines a parameter that must be
set by hand. In this paper, we propose learning a parameterization of ELU in
order to learn the proper activation shape at each layer in the CNNs. Our
results on the MNIST, CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets using the NiN,
Overfeat, All-CNN and ResNet networks indicate that our proposed Parametric ELU
(PELU) has better performances than the non-parametric ELU. We have observed as
much as a 7.28% relative error improvement on ImageNet with the NiN network,
with only 0.0003% parameter increase. Our visual examination of the non-linear
behaviors adopted by Vgg using PELU shows that the network took advantage of
the added flexibility by learning different activations at different layers.

 <dc:description>  Many creative ideas are being proposed for image sensor designs, and these
may be useful in applications ranging from consumer photography to computer
vision. To understand and evaluate each new design, we must create a
corresponding image processing pipeline that transforms the sensor data into a
form that is appropriate for the application. The need to design and optimize
these pipelines is time-consuming and costly. We explain a method that combines
machine learning and image systems simulation that automates the pipeline
design. The approach is based on a new way of thinking of the image processing
pipeline as a large collection of local linear filters. We illustrate how the
method has been used to design pipelines for novel sensor architectures in
consumer photography applications.

 <dc:description>  This paper explores the social quality (goodness) of community structures
formed across Twitter users, where social links within the structures are
estimated based upon semantic properties of user-generated content (corpus). We
examined the overlap of the community structures of the constructed graphs, and
followership-based social communities, to find the social goodness of the links
constructed. Unigram, bigram and LDA content models were empirically
investigated for evaluation of effectiveness, as approximators of underlying
social graphs, such that they maintain the {\it community} social property.
Impact of content at varying granularities, for the purpose of predicting links
while retaining the social community structures, was investigated. 100
discussion topics, spanning over 10 Twitter events, were used for experiments.
The unigram language model performed the best, indicating strong similarity of
word usage within deeply connected social communities. This observation agrees
with the phenomenon of evolution of word usage behavior, that transform
individuals belonging to the same community tending to choose the same words,
made by Danescu et al. (2013), and raises a question on the literature that
use, without validation, LDA for content-based social link prediction over
other content models. Also, semantically finer-grained content was observed to
be more effective compared to coarser-grained content.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose several improvements on the block-coordinate
Frank-Wolfe (BCFW) algorithm from Lacoste-Julien et al. (2013) recently used to
optimize the structured support vector machine (SSVM) objective in the context
of structured prediction, though it has wider applications. The key intuition
behind our improvements is that the estimates of block gaps maintained by BCFW
reveal the block suboptimality that can be used as an adaptive criterion.
First, we sample objects at each iteration of BCFW in an adaptive non-uniform
way via gapbased sampling. Second, we incorporate pairwise and away-step
variants of Frank-Wolfe into the block-coordinate setting. Third, we cache
oracle calls with a cache-hit criterion based on the block gaps. Fourth, we
provide the first method to compute an approximate regularization path for
SSVM. Finally, we provide an exhaustive empirical evaluation of all our methods
on four structured prediction datasets.

 <dc:description>  The past century of telecommunications has shown that failures in networks
are prevalent. Although much has been done to prevent failures, network nodes
and links are bound to fail eventually. Failure recovery processes are
therefore needed. Failure recovery is mainly influenced by (1) detection of the
failure, and (2) circumvention of the detected failure. However, especially in
SDNs where controllers recompute network state reactively, this leads to high
delays. Hence, next to primary rules, backup rules should be installed in the
switches to quickly detour traffic once a failure occurs. In this work, we
propose algorithms for computing an all-to-all primary and backup network
forwarding configuration that is capable of circumventing link and node
failures. Omitting the high delay invoked by controller recomputation through
preconfiguration, our proposal's recovery delay is close to the detection time
which is significantly below the 50 ms rule of thumb. After initial recovery,
we recompute network configuration to guarantee protection from future
failures. Our algorithms use packet-labeling to guarantee correct and shortest
detour forwarding. The algorithms and labeling technique allow packets to
return to the primary path and are able to discriminate between link and node
failures. The computational complexity of our solution is comparable to that of
all-to-all-shortest paths computations. Our experimental evaluation on both
real and generated networks shows that network configuration complexity highly
decreases compared to classic disjoint paths computations. Finally, we provide
a proof-of-concept OpenFlow controller in which our proposed configuration is
implemented, demonstrating that it readily can be applied in production
networks.

 <dc:title>Review of Fall Detection Techniques: A Data Availability Perspective</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Khan, Shehroz S.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Learning</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  A fall is an abnormal activity that occurs rarely; however, missing to
identify falls can have serious health and safety implications on an
individual. Due to the rarity of occurrence of falls, there may be insufficient
or no training data available for them. Therefore, standard supervised machine
learning methods may not be directly applied to handle this problem. In this
paper, we present a taxonomy for the study of fall detection from the
perspective of availability of fall data. The proposed taxonomy is independent
of the type of sensors used and specific feature extraction/selection methods.
The taxonomy identifies different categories of classification methods for the
study of fall detection based on the availability of their data during training
the classifiers. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review within
those categories and identify the approach of treating a fall as an abnormal
activity to be a plausible research direction. We conclude our paper by
discussing several open research problems in the field and pointers for future
research.

 <dc:description>  Most of the fastest-growing string collections today are repetitive, that is,
most of the constituent documents are similar to many others. As these
collections keep growing, a key approach to handling them is to exploit their
repetitiveness, which can reduce their space usage by orders of magnitude. We
study the problem of indexing repetitive string collections in order to perform
efficient document retrieval operations on them. Document retrieval problems
are routinely solved by search engines on large natural language collections,
but the techniques are less developed on generic string collections. The case
of repetitive string collections is even less understood, and there are very
few existing solutions. We develop two novel ideas, {\em interleaved LCPs} and
{\em precomputed document lists}, that yield highly compressed indexes solving
the problem of document listing (find all the documents where a string
appears), top-$k$ document retrieval (find the $k$ documents where a string
appears most often), and document counting (count the number of documents where
a string appears). We also show that a classical data structure supporting the
latter query becomes highly compressible on repetitive data. Finally, we show
how the tools we developed can be combined to solve ranked conjunctive and
disjunctive multi-term queries under the simple tf-idf model of relevance. We
thoroughly evaluate the resulting techniques in various real-life
repetitiveness scenarios, and recommend the best choices for each case.

 <dc:description>  We show that the climate phenomena of El Nino and La Nina arise naturally as
states of macro-variables when our recent causal feature learning framework
(Chalupka 2015, Chalupka 2016) is applied to micro-level measures of zonal wind
(ZW) and sea surface temperatures (SST) taken over the equatorial band of the
Pacific Ocean. The method identifies these unusual climate states on the basis
of the relation between ZW and SST patterns without any input about past
occurrences of El Nino or La Nina. The simpler alternatives of (i) clustering
the SST fields while disregarding their relationship with ZW patterns, or (ii)
clustering the joint ZW-SST patterns, do not discover El Nino. We discuss the
degree to which our method supports a causal interpretation and use a
low-dimensional toy example to explain its success over other clustering
approaches. Finally, we propose a new robust and scalable alternative to our
original algorithm (Chalupka 2016), which circumvents the need for
high-dimensional density learning.

 <dc:description>  Optimization problems with Boolean variables that fall into the
nondeterministic polynomial (NP) class are of fundamental importance in
computer science, mathematics, physics and industrial applications. Most
notably, solving constraint-satisfaction problems, which are related to
spin-glass-like Hamiltonians in physics, remains a difficult numerical task. As
such, there has been great interest in designing efficient heuristics to solve
these computationally difficult problems. Inspired by parallel tempering Monte
Carlo in conjunction with the rejection-free isoenergetic cluster algorithm
developed for Ising spin glasses, we present a generalized global update
optimization heuristic that can be applied to different NP-complete problems
with Boolean variables. The global cluster updates allow for a wide-spread
sampling of phase space, thus considerably speeding up optimization. By
carefully tuning the pseudo-temperature (needed to randomize the
configurations) of the problem, we show that the method can efficiently tackle
optimization problems with over-constraints or on topologies with a large
site-percolation threshold. We illustrate the efficiency of the heuristic on
paradigmatic optimization problems, such as the maximum satisfiability problem
and the vertex cover problem.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents the derivation for per-tier outage probability of a
randomly deployed femtocell network over an existing macrocell network. The
channel characteristics of macro user and femto user are addressed by
considering different propagation modeling for outdoor and indoor links.
Location based outage probability analysis and capacity of the system with
outage constraints are used to analyze the system performance. To obtain the
simplified expressions, approximations of ratios of Rayleigh random variables
(RVs), Rayleigh to log normal RVs and their weighted summations, are derived
with the verifications using simulations.

 <dc:description>  While convolutional neural networks have gained impressive success recently
in solving structured prediction problems such as semantic segmentation, it
remains a challenge to differentiate individual object instances in the scene.
Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as
autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques
that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to
address this problem; however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural
network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism to model a human-like
counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentations. The network is
jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of interest as well as a
dominant object segmentation within each region. The proposed model achieves
competitive results on the CVPPP, KITTI, and Cityscapes datasets.

 <dc:description>  We introduce models and algorithmic foundations for graph watermarking. Our
frameworks include security definitions and proofs, as well as
characterizations when graph watermarking is algorithmically feasible, in spite
of the fact that the general problem is NP-complete by simple reductions from
the subgraph isomorphism or graph edit distance problems. In the digital
watermarking of many types of files, an implicit step in the recovery of a
watermark is the mapping of individual pieces of data, such as image pixels or
movie frames, from one object to another. In graphs, this step corresponds to
approximately matching vertices of one graph to another based on graph
invariants such as vertex degree. Our approach is based on characterizing the
feasibility of graph watermarking in terms of keygen, marking, and
identification functions defined over graph families with known distributions.
We demonstrate the strength of this approach with exemplary watermarking
schemes for two random graph models, the classic Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model and
a random power-law graph model, both of which are used to model real-world
networks.

 <dc:title>Construction of k-angle tight frames</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Frames have become standard tools in signal processing due to their
robustness to transmission errors and their resilience to noise. Equiangular
tight frames (ETFs) are particularly useful and have been shown to be optimal
for transmission under a certain number of erasures. Unfortunately, ETFs do not
exist in many cases and are hard to construct when they do exist. However, it
is known that an ETF of d+1 vectors in a d dimensional space always exists.
This paper gives an explicit construction of ETFs of d+1 vectors in a d
dimensional space. This construction works for both real and complex cases and
is simpler than existing methods. The absence of ETFs of arbitrary sizes in a
given space leads to generalizations of ETFs. One way to do so is to consider
tight frames where the set of (acute) angles between pairs of vectors has k
distinct values. This paper presents a construction of tight frames such that
for a given value of k, the angles between pairs of vectors take at most k
distinct values. These tight frames can be related to regular graphs and
association schemes.

 <dc:description>  The size of multi-modal, heterogeneous data collected through various sensors
is growing exponentially. It demands intelligent data reduction, data mining
and analytics at edge devices. Data compression can reduce the network
bandwidth and transmission power consumed by edge devices. This paper proposes,
validates and evaluates Fog Data, a service-oriented architecture for Fog
computing. The center piece of the proposed architecture is a low power
embedded computer that carries out data mining and data analytics on raw data
collected from various wearable sensors used for telehealth applications. The
embedded computer collects the sensed data as time series, analyzes it, and
finds similar patterns present. Patterns are stored, and unique patterns are
transmited. Also, the embedded computer extracts clinically relevant
information that is sent to the cloud. A working prototype of the proposed
architecture was built and used to carry out case studies on telehealth big
data applications. Specifically, our case studies used the data from the
sensors worn by patients with either speech motor disorders or cardiovascular
problems. We implemented and evaluated both generic and application specific
data mining techniques to show orders of magnitude data reduction and hence
transmission power savings. Quantitative evaluations were conducted for
comparing various data mining techniques and standard data compression
techniques. The obtained results showed substantial improvement in system
efficiency using the Fog Data architecture.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes a novel fault detector for digital relaying based on
independent component analysis (leA). The index for effective detection is
derived from independent components of fault current. The proposed fault
detector reduces the computational burden for real time applications and is
therefore more accurate and robust as compared to other approaches. Further, a
comparative assessment is carried out to establish the effectiveness of the
proposed method as compared to the existing methods. This approach can be
applied for fault classification and localization of a distance relay
reflecting its consistency in all system changing conditions and thus validates
its efficacy in the real time applications. The method is tested under a
variety of fault and other disturbance conditions of typical power system.

 <dc:description>  In this work, a pattern recognition system is investigated for blind
automatic classification of digitally modulated communication signals. The
proposed technique is able to discriminate the type of modulation scheme which
is eventually used for demodulation followed by information extraction. The
proposed system is composed of two subsystems namely feature extraction
sub-system (FESS) and classifier sub-system (CSS). The FESS consists of
continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for feature generation and principal
component analysis (PCA) for selection of the feature subset which is rich in
discriminatory information. The CSS uses the selected features to accurately
classify the modulation class of the received signal. The proposed technique
uses probabilistic neural network (PNN) and multilayer perceptron forward
neural network (MLPFN) for comparative study of their recognition ability. PNN
have been found to perform better in terms of classification accuracy as well
as testing and training time than MLPFN. The proposed approach is robust to
presence of phase offset and additive Gaussian noise.

 <dc:title>Undecidability of a Theory of Strings, Linear Arithmetic over Length,
  and String-Number Conversion</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ganesh, Vijay</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Berzish, Murphy</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Logic in Computer Science</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In recent years there has been considerable interest in theories over string
equations, length function, and string-number conversion predicate within the
formal verification, software engineering, and security communities. SMT
solvers for these theories, such as Z3str2, CVC4, and S3, are of immense
practical value in exposing security vulnerabilities in string-intensive
programs. Additionally, there are many open decidability and
complexity-theoretic questions in the context of theories over strings that are
of great interest to mathematicians. Motivated by the above-mentioned
applications and open questions, we study a first-order, many-sorted,
quantifier-free theory $T_{s,n}$ of string equations, linear arithmetic over
string length, and string-number conversion predicate and prove three theorems.
First, we prove that the satisfiability problem for the theory $T_{s,n}$ is
undecidable via a reduction from a theory of linear arithmetic over natural
numbers with power predicate, we call power arithmetic. Second, we show that
the string-numeric conversion predicate is expressible in terms of the power
predicate, string equations, and length function. This second theorem, in
conjunction with the reduction we propose for the undecidability theorem,
suggests that the power predicate is expressible in terms of word equations and
length function if and only if the string-numeric conversion predicate is also
expressible in the same fragment. Such results are very useful tools in
comparing the expressive power of different theories, and for establishing
decidability and complexity results. Third, we provide a consistent
axiomatization ${\Gamma}$ for the functions and predicates of $T_{s,n}$.
Additionally, we prove that the theory $T_{\Gamma}$ , obtained via logical
closure of ${\Gamma}$, is not a complete theory.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a novel approach for fault classification and section
identification in a series compensated transmission line based on least square
support vector machine. The current signal corresponding to one-fourth of the
post fault cycle is used as input to proposed modular LS-SVM classifier. The
proposed scheme uses four binary classifier; three for selection of three
phases and fourth for ground detection. The proposed classification scheme is
found to be accurate and reliable in presence of noise as well. The simulation
results validate the efficacy of proposed scheme for accurate classification of
fault in a series compensated transmission line.

 <dc:description>  We present a solver for a many-sorted first-order quantifier-free theory
$T_{w,bv}$ of string equations, string length represented as bit-vectors, and
bit-vector arithmetic aimed at formal verification, automated testing, and
security analysis of C/C++ applications. Our key motivation for building such a
solver is the observation that existing string solvers are not efficient at
modeling the string/bit-vector combination. Current approaches either reduce
strings to bit-vectors and use a bit-vector solver as a backend, or model
bit-vectors as natural numbers and use a solver for the combined theory of
strings and natural numbers. Both these approaches are inefficient for
different reasons. Modeling strings as bit-vectors destroys structure inherent
in string equations thus missing opportunities for efficiently deciding such
formulas, and modeling bit-vectors as natural numbers is known to be
inefficient. Hence, there is a clear need for a solver that models strings and
bit-vectors natively.
  Our solver Z3strBV is a decision procedure for the theory $T_{w,bv}$
combining solvers for bit-vector and string equations. We demonstrate
experimentally that Z3strBV is significantly more efficient than reduction of
string/bit-vector constraints to strings/natural numbers. Additionally, we
prove decidability for the theory $T_{w,bv}$. We also propose two optimizations
which can be adapted to other contexts. The first accelerates convergence on a
consistent assignment of string lengths, and the second, dubbed library-aware
SMT solving, fixes summaries for built-in string functions (e.g., {\tt strlen}
in C/C++), which Z3strBV uses directly instead of analyzing the functions from
scratch each time. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that Z3strBV is able
to detect nontrivial overflows in real-world system-level code, as confirmed
against 7 security vulnerabilities from CVE and Mozilla database.

 <dc:description>  Previous saliency detection research required the reader to evaluate
performance qualitatively, based on renderings of saliency maps on a few
shapes. This qualitative approach meant it was unclear which saliency models
were better, or how well they compared to human perception. This paper provides
a quantitative evaluation framework that addresses this issue. In the first
quantitative analysis of 3D computational saliency models, we evaluate four
computational saliency models and two baseline models against ground-truth
saliency collected in previous work.

 <dc:description>  We address the task of recognizing objects from video input. This important
problem is relatively unexplored, compared with image-based object recognition.
To this end, we make the following contributions. First, we introduce two
comprehensive datasets for video-based object recognition. Second, we propose
Latent Bi-constraint SVM (LBSVM), a maximum-margin framework for video-based
object recognition. LBSVM is based on Structured-Output SVM, but extends it to
handle noisy video data and ensure consistency of the output decision
throughout time. We apply LBSVM to recognize office objects and museum
sculptures, and we demonstrate its benefits over image-based, set-based, and
other video-based object recognition.

 <dc:description>  Auto-encoders are often used as building blocks of deep network classifier to
learn feature extractors, but task-irrelevant information in the input data may
lead to bad extractors and result in poor generalization performance of the
network. In this paper,via dropping the task-irrelevant input variables the
performance of auto-encoders can be obviously improved .Specifically, an
importance-based variable selection method is proposed to aim at finding the
task-irrelevant input variables and dropping them.It firstly estimates
importance of each variable,and then drops the variables with importance value
lower than a threshold. In order to obtain better performance, the method can
be employed for each layer of stacked auto-encoders. Experimental results show
that when combined with our method the stacked denoising auto-encoders achieves
significantly improved performance on three challenging datasets.

 <dc:title>A Subgradient Approach for Constrained Binary Optimization via Quantum

 <dc:description>  An earlier work [18] proposes a method for solving the Lagrangian dual of a
constrained binary quadratic programming problem via quantum adiabatic
evolution using an outer approximation method. This should be an efficient
prescription for solving the Lagrangian dual problem in the presence of an
ideally noise-free quantum adiabatic system. However, current implementations
of quantum annealing systems demand methods that are efficient at handling
possible sources of noise. In this paper, we consider a subgradient method for
finding an optimal primal-dual pair for the Lagrangian dual of a constrained
binary polynomial programming problem. We then study the quadratic stable set
(QSS) problem as a case study. We see that this method applied to the QSS
problem can be viewed as an instance-dependent penalty-term approach that
avoids large penalty coefficients. Finally, we report our experimental results
of using the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer and conclude that our approach helps
this quantum processor to succeed more often in solving these problems compared
to the usual penalty-term approaches.

 <dc:description>  Networked systems are systems of interconnected components, in which the
dynamics of each component are influenced by the behavior of neighboring
components. Examples of networked systems include biological networks, critical
infrastructures such as power grids, transportation systems, and the Internet,
and social networks. The growing importance of such systems has led to an
interest in control of networks to ensure performance, stability, robustness,
and resilience. A widely-studied method for controlling networked systems is to
directly control a subset of input nodes, which then steer the remaining nodes
to their desired states. This article presents submodular optimization
approaches for input node selection in networked systems. Submodularity is a
property of set functions that enables the development of computationally
tractable algorithms with provable optimality bounds. For a variety of
physically relevant systems, the physical dynamics have submodular structures
that can be exploited to develop efficient input selection algorithms. This
article will describe these structures and the resulting algorithms, as well as
discuss open problems.

 <dc:description>  The continuing expansion of Internet media consumption has increased traffic
volumes, and hence congestion, on access links. In response, both mobile and
wireline ISPs must either increase capacity or perform traffic engineering over
existing resources. Unfortunately, provisioning timescales are long, the
process is costly, and single-homing means operators cannot balance across the
last mile. Inspired by energy and transport networks, we propose demand-side
management of users to reduce the impact caused by consumption patterns
out-pacing that of edge network provision. By directly affecting user behaviour
through a range of incentives, our techniques enable resource management over
shorter timescales than is possible in conventional networks. Using survey data
from 100 participants we explore the feasibility of introducing the principles
of demand-side management in today's networks.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we study the likelihood of Bernie Sanders supporters voting
for Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton. Building from a unique time-series
dataset of the three candidates' Twitter followers, which we make public here,
we first study the proportion of Sanders followers who simultaneously follow
Trump (but not Clinton) and how this evolves over time. Then we train a
convolutional neural network to classify the gender of Sanders followers, and
study whether men are more likely to jump ship for Trump than women. Our study
shows that between March and May an increasing proportion of Sanders followers
are following Trump (but not Clinton). The proportion of Sanders followers who
follow Clinton but not Trump has actually decreased. Equally important, our
study suggests that the jumping ship behavior will be affected by gender and
that men are more likely to switch to Trump than women.

 <dc:description>  The performance of communication systems is fundamentally limited by the loss
of energy through propagation and circuit inefficiencies. In this article, we
show that it is possible to achieve ultra low energy communications at the
nano-scale, if diffusive molecules are used for carrying data. Whilst the
energy of electromagnetic waves will inevitably decay as a function of
transmission distance and time, the energy in individual molecules does not.
Over time, the receiver has an opportunity to recover some, if not all of the
molecular energy transmitted. The article demonstrates the potential of
ultra-low energy simultaneous molecular information and energy transfer (SMIET)
through the design of two different nano-relay systems, and the discusses how
molecular communications can benefit more from crowd energy harvesting than
traditional wave-based systems.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes CF-NADE, a neural autoregressive architecture for
collaborative filtering (CF) tasks, which is inspired by the Restricted
Boltzmann Machine (RBM) based CF model and the Neural Autoregressive
Distribution Estimator (NADE). We first describe the basic CF-NADE model for CF
tasks. Then we propose to improve the model by sharing parameters between
different ratings. A factored version of CF-NADE is also proposed for better
scalability. Furthermore, we take the ordinal nature of the preferences into
consideration and propose an ordinal cost to optimize CF-NADE, which shows
superior performance. Finally, CF-NADE can be extended to a deep model, with
only moderately increased computational complexity. Experimental results show
that CF-NADE with a single hidden layer beats all previous state-of-the-art
methods on MovieLens 1M, MovieLens 10M, and Netflix datasets, and adding more
hidden layers can further improve the performance.

 <dc:description>  To provide a live, active and high-quality virtual touring streaming
experience, we propose an unmanned drone stereoscopic streaming paradigm using
a control and streaming infrastructure of a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi grid. Our system
allows users to actively control the streaming captured by a drone, receive and
watch the streaming using a head mount display (HMD); a Wi-Fi grid is deployed
across the remote scene with multi-channel support to enable high-bitrate
stream- ing broadcast from the drones. The system adopt a joint view adaptation
and drone control scheme to enable fast viewer movement including both head
rotation and touring. We implement the prototype on Dji M100 quadcopter and HTC
Vive in a demo scene.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We consider a joint source-channel coding problem on a finite-field multiway
relay channel, and we give closed-form lower and upper bounds on the optimal
source-channel rate. These bounds are shown to be tight for all discrete
memoryless sources in a certain class $\mathcal{P}^*$, and we demonstrate that
strict source-channel separation is optimal within this class. We show how to
test whether a given source belongs to $\mathcal{P}^*$, we give a
balanced-information regularity condition for $\mathcal{P}^*$, and we express
$\mathcal{P}^*$ in terms of conditional multiple-mutual informations. Finally,
we show that $\mathcal{P}^*$ is useful for a centralised storage problem.

 <dc:description>  We propose a model of interdependent scheduling games in which each player
controls a set of services that they schedule independently. A player is free
to schedule his own services at any time; however, each of these services only
begins to accrue reward for the player when all predecessor services, which may
or may not be controlled by the same player, have been activated. This model,
where players have interdependent services, is motivated by the problems faced
in planning and coordinating large-scale infrastructures, e.g., restoring
electricity and gas to residents after a natural disaster or providing medical
care in a crisis when different agencies are responsible for the delivery of
staff, equipment, and medicine. We undertake a game-theoretic analysis of this
setting and in particular consider the issues of welfare maximization,
computing best responses, Nash dynamics, and existence and computation of Nash
equilibria.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we present a Virtual-Suspect system which can be used to train
inexperienced law enforcement personnel in interrogation strategies. The system
supports different scenario configurations based on historical data. The
responses presented by the Virtual-Suspect are selected based on the
psychological state of the suspect, which can be configured as well.
Furthermore, each interrogator's statement affects the Virtual-Suspect's
current psychological state, which may lead the interrogation in different
directions. In addition, the model takes into account the context in which the
statements are made. Experiments with 24 subjects demonstrate that the
Virtual-Suspect's behavior is similar to that of a human who plays the role of
the suspect.

 <dc:description>  Identifying musical instruments in polyphonic music recordings is a
challenging but important problem in the field of music information retrieval.
It enables music search by instrument, helps recognize musical genres, or can
make music transcription easier and more accurate. In this paper, we present a
convolutional neural network framework for predominant instrument recognition
in real-world polyphonic music. We train our network from fixed-length music
excerpts with a single-labeled predominant instrument and estimate an arbitrary
number of predominant instruments from an audio signal with a variable length.
To obtain the audio-excerpt-wise result, we aggregate multiple outputs from
sliding windows over the test audio. In doing so, we investigated two different
aggregation methods: one takes the average for each instrument and the other
takes the instrument-wise sum followed by normalization. In addition, we
conducted extensive experiments on several important factors that affect the
performance, including analysis window size, identification threshold, and
activation functions for neural networks to find the optimal set of parameters.
Using a dataset of 10k audio excerpts from 11 instruments for evaluation, we
found that convolutional neural networks are more robust than conventional
methods that exploit spectral features and source separation with support
vector machines. Experimental results showed that the proposed convolutional
network architecture obtained an F1 measure of 0.602 for micro and 0.503 for
macro, respectively, achieving 19.6% and 16.4% in performance improvement
compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates the fixed-time consensus problem under directed
topologies. By using a motion-planning approach, a class of distributed
fixed-time algorithms are developed for a multi-agent system with
double-integrator dynamics. In the context of the fixed-time consensus, we
focus on both directed fixed and switching topologies. Under the directed fixed
topology, a novel class of distributed algorithms are designed, which guarantee
the consensus of the multi-agent system with a fixed settling time if the
topology has a directed spanning tree. Under the directed periodically
switching topologies, the fixedtime consensus is solved via the proposed
algorithms if the topologies jointly have a directed spanning tree. In
particular, the fixed settling time can be off-line pre-assigned according to
task requirements. Compared with the existing results, to our best knowledge,
it is the first time to solve the fixed-time consensus problem for
double-integrator systems under directed topologies. Finally, a numerical
example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the analytical results.

 <dc:description>  Resource selection and task placement for distributed execution poses
conceptual and implementation difficulties. Although resource selection and
task placement are at the core of many tools and workflow systems, the models
and methods are underdeveloped. Consequently, partial and non-interoperable
implementations proliferate. We address both the conceptual and implementation
difficulties by experimentally characterizing diverse modalities of resource
selection and task placement. We compare the architectures and capabilities of
two systems: the AIMES middleware and Swift workflow scripting language and
runtime. We integrate these systems to enable the distributed execution of
Swift workflows on Pilot-Jobs managed by the AIMES middleware. Our experiments
characterize and compare alternative execution strategies by measuring the time
to completion of heterogeneous uncoupled workloads executed at diverse scale
and on multiple resources. We measure the adverse effects of pilot
fragmentation and early binding of tasks to resources and the benefits of
backfill scheduling across pilots on multiple resources. We then use this
insight to execute a multi-stage workflow across five production-grade
resources. We discuss the importance and implications for other tools and
workflow systems.

 <dc:description>  We consider networks of processes which interact with beeps. In the basic
model defined by Cornejo and Kuhn, which we refer to as the $BL$ variant,
processes can choose in each round either to beep or to listen. Those who beep
are unable to detect simultaneous beeps. Those who listen can only distinguish
between silence and the presence of at least one beep. Beeping models are weak
in essence and even simple tasks may become difficult or unfeasible with them.
  In this paper, we address the problem of computing how many participants
there are in a one-hop network: the {\em counting} problem. We first observe
that no algorithm can compute this number with certainty in $BL$, whether the
algorithm be deterministic or even randomised (Las Vegas). We thus consider the
stronger variant where beeping nodes are able to detect simultaneous beeps,
referred to as $B_{cd}L$ (for {\em collision detection}). We prove that at
least $n$ rounds are necessary in $B_{cd}L$, and we present an algorithm whose
running time is $O(n)$ rounds with high probability. Further experimental
results show that its expected running time is less than $10n$. Finally, we
discuss how this algorithm can be adapted in other beeping models. In
particular, we show that it can be emulated in $BL$, at the cost of a
logarithmic slowdown and of trading its Las Vegas nature (result certain, time
uncertain) against Monte Carlo (time certain, result uncertain).

 <dc:description>  This paper investigates optimal caching placement for wireless femto-caching
network. The average bit error rate (BER) is formulated as a function of
caching placement under wireless fading. To minimize the average BER, we
propose a greedy algorithm finding optimal caching placement with low
computational complexity. Exploiting the property of the optimal caching
placement which we derive, the proposed algorithm can be performed over
considerably reduced search space. Contrary to the optimal caching placement
without consideration of wireless fading aspects, we reveal that optimal
caching placement can be reached by balancing a tradeoff between two different
gains: file diversity gain and channel diversity gain. Moreover, we also
identify the conditions that the optimal placement can be found without running
the proposed greedy algorithm and derive the corresponding optimal caching
placement in closed form.

 <dc:title>Simpler Self-reduction Algorithm for Matroid Path-width</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Path-width of matroids naturally generalizes better known path-width of
graphs, and is NP-hard by a reduction from the graph case. While the term
matroid path-width was formally introduced by Geelen-Gerards-Whittle [JCTB
2006] in pure matroid theory, it was soon recognized by Kashyap [SIDMA 2008]
that it is the same concept as long-studied so called trellis complexity in
coding theory, later named trellis-width, and hence it is an interesting notion
also from the algorithmic perspective. It follows from a result of
Hlin\v{e}n\'y [JCTB 2006], that the problem to test whether a given matroid
over a finite field has path-width at most t is fixed-parameter tractable in t,
but this result does not give any clue about a corresponding
path-decomposition. The first constructive, though rather complicated, FPT
algorithm for path-width of matroids over a finite field has been given just
recently by Jeong-Kim-Oum [SODA 2016]. Here we give a much simpler
self-reduction constructive FPT algorithm for the same problem. Precisely, we
design an efficient routine that constructs an optimal path-decomposition of a
matroid (even an abstract one, given by a rank oracle) using a &quot;black-box&quot;
subroutine for testing whether the path-width of a matroid is at most t. In
connection with the aforementioned decision algorithm for path-width of
matroids over a finite field we then get the desired constructive FPT
algorithm.

 <dc:description>  A Hilbert space embedding of a distribution---in short, a kernel mean
embedding---has recently emerged as a powerful tool for machine learning and
inference. The basic idea behind this framework is to map distributions into a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in which the whole arsenal of kernel
methods can be extended to probability measures. It can be viewed as a
generalization of the original &quot;feature map&quot; common to support vector machines
(SVMs) and other kernel methods. While initially closely associated with the
latter, it has meanwhile found application in fields ranging from kernel
machines and probabilistic modeling to statistical inference, causal discovery,
and deep learning. The goal of this survey is to give a comprehensive review of
existing work and recent advances in this research area, and to discuss the
most challenging issues and open problems that could lead to new research
directions. The survey begins with a brief introduction to the RKHS and
positive definite kernels which forms the backbone of this survey, followed by
a thorough discussion of the Hilbert space embedding of marginal distributions,
theoretical guarantees, and a review of its applications. The embedding of
distributions enables us to apply RKHS methods to probability measures which
prompts a wide range of applications such as kernel two-sample testing,
independent testing, and learning on distributional data. Next, we discuss the
Hilbert space embedding for conditional distributions, give theoretical
insights, and review some applications. The conditional mean embedding enables
us to perform sum, product, and Bayes' rules---which are ubiquitous in
graphical model, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning---in a
non-parametric way. We then discuss relationships between this framework and
other related areas. Lastly, we give some suggestions on future research
directions.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we address the new problem of the prediction of human intents.
There is neuro-psychological evidence that actions performed by humans are
anticipated by peculiar motor acts which are discriminant of the type of action
going to be performed afterwards. In other words, an actual intent can be
forecast by looking at the kinematics of the immediately preceding movement. To
prove it in a computational and quantitative manner, we devise a new
experimental setup where, without using contextual information, we predict
human intents all originating from the same motor act. We posit the problem as
a classification task and we introduce a new multi-modal dataset consisting of
a set of motion capture marker 3D data and 2D video sequences, where, by only
analysing very similar movements in both training and test phases, we are able
to predict the underlying intent, i.e., the future, never observed action. We
also present an extensive experimental evaluation as a baseline, customizing
state-of-the-art techniques for either 3D and 2D data analysis. Realizing that
video processing methods lead to inferior performance but show complementary
information with respect to 3D data sequences, we developed a 2D+3D fusion
analysis where we achieve better classification accuracies, attesting the
superiority of the multimodal approach for the context-free prediction of human
intents.

 <dc:description>  Semidefinite programming is an indispensable tool in computer vision, but
general-purpose solvers for semidefinite programs are often too slow and memory
intensive for large-scale problems. We propose a general framework to
approximately solve large-scale semidefinite problems (SDPs) at low complexity.
Our approach, referred to as biconvex relaxation (BCR), transforms a general
SDP into a specific biconvex optimization problem, which can then be solved in
the original, low-dimensional variable space at low complexity. The resulting
biconvex problem is solved using an efficient alternating minimization (AM)
procedure. Since AM has the potential to get stuck in local minima, we propose
a general initialization scheme that enables BCR to start close to a global
optimum - this is key for our algorithm to quickly converge to optimal or
near-optimal solutions. We showcase the efficacy of our approach on three
applications in computer vision, namely segmentation, co-segmentation, and
manifold metric learning. BCR achieves solution quality comparable to
state-of-the-art SDP methods with speedups between 4X and 35X. At the same
time, BCR handles a more general set of SDPs than previous approaches, which
are more specialized.

 <dc:title>Predicting System-level Power for a Hybrid Supercomputer</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  For current High Performance Computing systems to scale towards the holy
grail of ExaFLOP performance, their power consumption has to be reduced by at
least one order of magnitude. This goal can be achieved only through a
combination of hardware and software advances. Being able to model and
accurately predict the power consumption of large computational systems is
necessary for software-level innovations such as proactive and power-aware
scheduling, resource allocation and fault tolerance techniques. In this paper
we present a 2-layer model of power consumption for a hybrid supercomputer
(which held the top spot of the Green500 list on July 2013) that combines CPU,
GPU and MIC technologies to achieve higher energy efficiency. Our model takes
as input workload information - the number and location of resources that are
used by each job at a certain time - and calculates the resulting system-level
power consumption. When jobs are submitted to the system, the workload
configuration can be foreseen based on the scheduler policies, and our model
can then be applied to predict the ensuing system-level power consumption.
Additionally, alternative workload configurations can be evaluated from a power
perspective and more efficient ones can be selected. Applications of the model
include not only power-aware scheduling but also prediction of anomalous
behavior.

 <dc:description>  This paper proposes an approach that predicts the road course from camera
sensors leveraging deep learning techniques. Road pixels are identified by
training a multi-scale convolutional neural network on a large number of
full-scene-labeled night-time road images including adverse weather conditions.
A framework is presented that applies the proposed approach to longer distance
road course estimation, which is the basis for an augmented reality navigation
application. In this framework long range sensor data (radar) and data from a
map database are fused with short range sensor data (camera) to produce a
precise longitudinal and lateral localization and road course estimation. The
proposed approach reliably detects roads with and without lane markings and
thus increases the robustness and availability of road course estimations and
augmented reality navigation. Evaluations on an extensive set of high precision
ground truth data taken from a differential GPS and an inertial measurement
unit show that the proposed approach reaches state-of-the-art performance
without the limitation of requiring existing lane markings.

 <dc:description>  This paper considers the identification of linear time-invariant networks,
also known as dynamic structure functions. Assuming identifiability of the
network addressed in previous work, this paper presents an identification
method that infers both the Boolean structure of the network and the transfer
functions between nodes. The identification is performed directly from data and
without any prior knowledge of the system, including its order. The method is
to formulate the identification as a linear regression problem together with
penalties for complexity, both in terms of element (order of nonzero
connections) and group sparsity (network topology). We then propose a novel
scheme that combines sparse Bayesian and sparse group Bayesian to efficiently
solve the problem. The method and the developed toolbox can now be used to
infer networks from a wide range of fields, including systems biology
applications such as signalling and genetic regulatory networks.

 <dc:description>  While depth sensors are becoming increasingly popular, their spatial
resolution often remains limited. Depth super-resolution therefore emerged as a
solution to this problem. Despite much progress, state-of-the-art techniques
suffer from two drawbacks: (i) they rely on the assumption that intensity edges
coincide with depth discontinuities, which, unfortunately, is only true in
controlled environments; and (ii) they typically exploit the availability of
high-resolution training depth maps, which can often not be acquired in
practice due to the sensors' limitations. By contrast, here, we introduce an
approach to performing depth super-resolution in more challenging conditions,
such as in outdoor scenes. To this end, we first propose to exploit semantic
information to better constrain the super-resolution process. In particular, we
design a co-sparse analysis model that learns filters from joint intensity,
depth and semantic information. Furthermore, we show how low-resolution
training depth maps can be employed in our learning strategy. We demonstrate
the benefits of our approach over state-of-the-art depth super-resolution
methods on two outdoor scene datasets.

 <dc:description>  Exclusive social groups are ones in which the group members decide whether or
not to admit a candidate to the group. Examples of exclusive social groups
include academic departments and fraternal organizations. In the present paper
we introduce an analytic framework for studying the dynamics of exclusive
social groups. In our model, every group member is characterized by his
opinion, which is represented as a point on the real line. The group evolves in
discrete time steps through a voting process carried out by the group's
members. Due to homophily, each member votes for the candidate who is more
similar to him (i.e., closer to him on the line). An admission rule is then
applied to determine which candidate, if any, is admitted. We consider several
natural admission rules including majority and consensus.
  We ask: how do different admission rules affect the composition of the group
in the long term? We study both growing groups (where new members join old
ones) and fixed-size groups (where new members replace those who quit). Our
analysis reveals intriguing phenomena and phase transitions, some of which are
quite counterintuitive.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we analyze the asymptotics of the normalized remaining
uncertainty of a source when a compressed or hashed version of it and
correlated side-information is observed. For this system, commonly known as
Slepian-Wolf source coding, we establish the optimal (minimum) rate of
compression of the source to ensure that the remaining uncertainties vanish. We
also study the exponential rate of decay of the remaining uncertainty to zero
when the rate is above the optimal rate of compression. In our study, we
consider various classes of random universal hash functions. Instead of
measuring remaining uncertainties using traditional Shannon information
measures, we do so using two forms of the conditional R\'{e}nyi entropy. Among
other techniques, we employ new one-shot bounds and the moments of type class
enumerator method for these evaluations. We show that these asymptotic results
are generalizations of the strong converse exponent and the error exponent of
the Slepian-Wolf problem under maximum \emph{a posteriori} (MAP) decoding.

 <dc:description>  Attention mechanisms have recently been introduced in deep learning for
various tasks in natural language processing and computer vision. But despite
their popularity, the &quot;correctness&quot; of the implicitly-learned attention maps
has only been assessed qualitatively by visualization of several examples. In
this paper we focus on evaluating and improving the correctness of attention in
neural image captioning models. Specifically, we propose a quantitative
evaluation metric for the consistency between the generated attention maps and
human annotations, using recently released datasets with alignment between
regions in images and entities in captions. We then propose novel models with
different levels of explicit supervision for learning attention maps during
training. The supervision can be strong when alignment between regions and
caption entities are available, or weak when only object segments and
categories are provided. We show on the popular Flickr30k and COCO datasets
that introducing supervision of attention maps during training solidly improves
both attention correctness and caption quality, showing the promise of making
machine perception more human-like.

 <dc:description>  In this work we introduce new approximate similarity relations that are shown
to be key for policy (or control) synthesis over general Markov decision
processes. The models of interest are discrete-time Markov decision processes,
endowed with uncountably-infinite state spaces and metric output (or
observation) spaces. The new relations, underpinned by the use of metrics,
allow in particular for a useful trade-off between deviations over probability
distributions on states, and distances between model outputs. We show that the
new probabilistic similarity relations, inspired by a notion of simulation
developed for finite-state models, can be effectively employed over general
Markov decision processes for verification purposes, and specifically for
control refinement from abstract models.

 <dc:description>  In this paper, we propose a new \emph{dynamic compressed index} of $O(w)$
space for a dynamic text $T$, where $w = O(\min(z \log N \log^*M, N))$ is the
size of the signature encoding of $T$, $z$ is the size of the Lempel-Ziv77
(LZ77) factorization of $T$, $N$ is the length of $T$, and $M \geq 3N$ is an
integer that can be handled in constant time under word RAM model. Our index
supports searching for a pattern $P$ in $T$ in $O(|P| f_{\mathcal{A}} + \log w
\log |P| \log^* M (\log N + \log |P| \log^* M) + \mathit{occ} \log N)$ time and
insertion/deletion of a substring of length $y$ in $O((y+ \log N\log^* M)\log w
\log N \log^* M)$ time, where $f_{\mathcal{A}} = O(\min \{ \frac{\log\log M
\log\log w}{\log\log\log M}, \sqrt{\frac{\log w}{\log\log w}} \})$. Also, we
propose a new space-efficient LZ77 factorization algorithm for a given text of
length $N$, which runs in $O(N f_{\mathcal{A}} + z \log w \log^3 N (\log^*
N)^2)$ time with $O(w)$ working space.

 <dc:description>  The capacity of automatically modeling photographic composition is valuable
for many real-world machine vision applications such as digital photography,
image retrieval, image understanding, and image aesthetics assessment. The
triangle technique is among those indispensable composition methods on which
professional photographers often rely. This paper proposes a system that can
identify prominent triangle arrangements in two major categories of
photographs: natural or urban scenes, and portraits. For the natural or urban
scene pictures, the focus is on the effect of linear perspective. For
portraits, we carefully examine the positioning of human subjects in a photo.
We show that line analysis is highly advantageous for modeling composition in
both categories. Based on the detected triangles, new mathematical descriptors
for composition are formulated and used to retrieve similar images. Leveraging
the rich source of high aesthetics photos online, similar approaches can
potentially be incorporated in future smart cameras to enhance a person's photo
composition skills.

 <dc:description>  Specialized dictionaries are used to understand concepts in specific domains,
especially where those concepts are not part of the general vocabulary, or
having meanings that differ from ordinary languages. The first step in creating
a specialized dictionary involves detecting the characteristic vocabulary of
the domain in question. Classical methods for detecting this vocabulary involve
gathering a domain corpus, calculating statistics on the terms found there, and
then comparing these statistics to a background or general language corpus.
Terms which are found significantly more often in the specialized corpus than
in the background corpus are candidates for the characteristic vocabulary of
the domain. Here we present two tools, a directed crawler, and a distributional
semantics package, that can be used together, circumventing the need of a
background corpus. Both tools are available on the web.

 <dc:description>  The use of simulated virtual environments to train deep convolutional neural
networks (CNN) is a currently active practice to reduce the
(real)data-hungriness of the deep CNN models, especially in application domains
in which large scale real data and/or groundtruth acquisition is difficult or
laborious. Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of
existing video games, animated movies to provide training data with high
precision groundtruth. However, a stumbling block is in how one can certify
generalization of the learned models and their usefulness in real world data
sets. This opens up fundamental questions such as: What is the role of
photorealism of graphics simulations in training CNN models? Are the trained
models valid in reality? What are possible ways to reduce the performance bias?
In this work, we begin to address theses issues systematically in the context
of urban semantic understanding with CNNs. Towards this end, we (a) propose a
simple probabilistic urban scene model, (b) develop a parametric rendering tool
to synthesize the data with groundtruth, followed by (c) a systematic
exploration of the impact of level-of-realism on the generality of the trained
CNN model to real world; and domain adaptation concepts to minimize the
performance bias.

 <dc:title>A Sparse Representation of Complete Local Binary Pattern Histogram for
  Human Face Recognition</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Guermoui, Mawloud</dc:creator>
 <dc:creator>Mekhalfi, Mohamed L.</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Human face recognition has been a long standing problem in computer vision
and pattern recognition. Facial analysis can be viewed as a two-fold problem,
namely (i) facial representation, and (ii) classification. So far, many face
representations have been proposed, a well-known method is the Local Binary
Pattern (LBP), which has witnessed a growing interest. In this respect, we
treat in this paper the issues of face representation as well as classification
in a novel manner. On the one hand, we use a variant to LBP, so-called Complete
Local Binary Pattern (CLBP), which differs from the basic LBP by coding a given
local region using a given central pixel and Sing_ Magnitude difference.
Subsequently, most of LBPbased descriptors use a fixed grid to code a given
facial image, which technique is, in most cases, not robust to pose variation
and misalignment. To cope with such issue, a representative Multi-Resolution
Histogram (MH) decomposition is adopted in our work. On the other hand, having
the histograms of the considered images extracted, we exploit their sparsity to
construct a so-called Sparse Representation Classifier (SRC) for further face
classification. Experimental results have been conducted on ORL face database,
and pointed out the superiority of our scheme over other popular
state-of-the-art techniques.

 <dc:description>  Adaptive learning rate algorithms such as RMSProp are widely used for
training deep neural networks. RMSProp offers efficient training since it uses
first order gradients to approximate Hessian-based preconditioning. However,
since the first order gradients include noise caused by stochastic
optimization, the approximation may be inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a
novel adaptive learning rate algorithm called SDProp. Its key idea is effective
handling of the noise by preconditioning based on covariance matrix. For
various neural networks, our approach is more efficient and effective than
RMSProp and its variant.

 <dc:description>  We present a general framework for the construction of quantum tensor product
codes (QTPC). In a classical tensor product code (TPC), its parity check matrix
is con- structed via the tensor product of parity check matrices of the two
component codes. We show that by adding some constraints on the component
codes, several classes of dual-containing TPCs can be obtained. By selecting
different types of component codes, the proposed method enables the
construction of a large family of QTPCs and they can provide a wide variety of
quantum error control abilities. In particular, if one of the component codes
is selected as a burst-error-correction code, then QTPCs have quantum
multiple-burst-error-correction abilities, provided these bursts fall in
distinct subblocks. Compared with concatenated quantum codes (CQC), the
component code selections of QTPCs are much more exible than those of CQCs
since only one of the component codes of QTPCs needs to satisfy the
dual-containing restriction. We show that it is possible to construct QTPCs
with parameters better than other classes of quantum error-correction codes
(QECC), e.g., CQCs and quantum BCH codes. Many QTPCs are obtained with
parameters better than previously known quantum codes available in the
literature. Several classes of QTPCs that can correct multiple quantum bursts
of errors are constructed based on reversible cyclic codes and
maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes.

 <dc:title>Stable extrapolation of analytic functions</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:subject>Mathematics - Numerical Analysis</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This paper examines the problem of extrapolation of an analytic function for
$x &gt; 1$ given perturbed samples from an equally spaced grid on $[-1,1]$.
Mathematical folklore states that extrapolation is in general hopelessly
ill-conditioned, but we show that a more precise statement carries an
interesting nuance. For a function $f$ on $[-1,1]$ that is analytic in a
Bernstein ellipse with parameter $\rho &gt; 1$, and for a uniform perturbation
level $\epsilon$ on the function samples, we construct an asymptotically best
extrapolant $e(x)$ as a least squares polynomial approximant of degree $M^*$
given explicitly. We show that the extrapolant $e(x)$ converges to $f(x)$
pointwise in the interval $I_\rho\in[1,(\rho+\rho^{-1})/2)$ as $\epsilon \to
0$, at a rate given by a $x$-dependent fractional power of $\epsilon$. More
precisely, for each $x \in I_{\rho}$ we have
  \[
  |f(x) - e(x)| = \mathcal{O}\left( \epsilon^{-\log r(x) / \log\rho} \right),
\qquad\qquad r(x) = \frac{x+\sqrt{x^2-1}}{\rho},
  \] up to log factors, provided that the oversampling conditioning is
satisfied. That is,
  \[
  M^* \leq \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{N},
  \] which is known to be needed from approximation theory. In short,
extrapolation enjoys a weak form of stability, up to a fraction of the
characteristic smoothness length. The number of function samples, $N+1$, does
not bear on the size of the extrapolation error provided that it obeys the
oversampling condition. We also show that one cannot construct an
asymptotically more accurate extrapolant from $N+1$ equally spaced samples than
$e(x)$, using any other linear or nonlinear procedure. The proofs involve
original statements on the stability of polynomial approximation in the
Chebyshev basis from equally spaced samples and these are expected to be of
independent interest.

 <dc:description>  In this article we explore one of the most promising technologies for 5G
wireless networks using an underlay small cell network, namely proactive
caching. Using the increase in storage technologies and through studying the
users behavior, peak traffic can be reduced through proactive caching of the
content that is most probable to be requested. We propose a new method, in
which, instead of caching the most popular content, the users within the
network are clustered according to their content popularity and the caching is
done accordingly. We present also a method for estimating the number of
clusters within the network based on the Akaike information criterion. We
analytically derive a closed form expression of the hit probability and we
propose an optimization problem in which the small base stations association
with clusters is optimized.

 <dc:description>  Recent years have shown that deep learned neural networks are a valuable tool
in the field of computer vision. This paper addresses the use of two different
kinds of network architectures, namely LeNet and Network in Network (NiN). They
will be compared in terms of both performance and computational efficiency by
addressing the classification and detection problems. In this paper, multiple
databases will be used to test the networks. One of them contains images
depicting burn wounds from pediatric cases, another one contains an extensive
number of art images and other facial databases were used for facial keypoints
detection.

 <dc:description>  A variety of large-scale machine learning problems can be cast as instances
of constrained submodular maximization. Existing approaches for distributed
submodular maximization have a critical drawback: The capacity - number of
instances that can fit in memory - must grow with the data set size. In
practice, while one can provision many machines, the capacity of each machine
is limited by physical constraints. We propose a truly scalable approach for
distributed submodular maximization under fixed capacity. The proposed
framework applies to a broad class of algorithms and constraints and provides
theoretical guarantees on the approximation factor for any available capacity.
We empirically evaluate the proposed algorithm on a variety of data sets and
demonstrate that it achieves performance competitive with the centralized
greedy solution.

 <dc:description>  In this work we identify a seminal design guideline that prevents current
Full-Duplex (FD) MAC protocols to scale the FD capacity gain (i.e. 2x the
half-duplex throughput) in single-cell Wi-Fi networks. Under such guideline
(referred to as 1:1), a MAC protocol attempts to initiate up to two
simultaneous transmissions in the FD bandwidth. Since in single-cell Wi-Fi
networks MAC performance is bounded by the PHY layer capacity, this implies
gains strictly less than 2x over half-duplex at the MAC layer. To face this
limitation, we argue for the 1:N design guideline. Under 1:N, FD MAC protocols
'see' the FD bandwidth through N&gt;1 orthogonal narrow-channel PHY layers. Based
on theoretical results and software defined radio experiments, we show the 1:N
design can leverage the Wi-Fi capacity gain more than 2x at and below the MAC
layer. This translates the denser modulation scheme incurred by channel
narrowing and the increase in the spatial reuse offer enabled by channel
orthogonality. With these results, we believe our design guideline can inspire
a new generation of Wi-Fi MAC protocols that fully embody and scale the FD
capacity gain.

 <dc:description>  The collapse of old print media and journalism happened when the Internet,
its solutions, services and communities became mature and mobile devices
reached the market. The reader abandoned printed dailies for free and mobile
access to information. The business of core industries of the early Internet
and mobile communication, the mobile network manufacturers and operators are
also in stagnation and decline. Therefore these industries may have similar
interests to improve or even restructure their own businesses as well as to
establish totally new business models by going into media and journalism.
  This paper analyses, first, the production flows and business models of the
old and present media species. Second, it analyses the current market
positioning of the network manufacturers and operators. Third, the paper
suggests two avenues for media and journalism and the network manufacturers and
operators, the Trio, to join their forces to update journalism and make all
three stagnating industries great again. Last, we propose further research,
development and discussion on the topic and envision possible futures for
journalism, if the three would engage in cooperation. We see that the
discussion should consist of ethical, societal and philosophical subjects
because the development of the Internet solutions are based on 'technology
first' actions.
  We find and outline a tremendous opportunity to create a new industry with
new actors through combining the interests of the network manufacturers,
network operators and journalism in a systemic solution through a strategic
alliance and collaboration Fig. 1. Software startuppers with their applications
and communities will be the drivers for this abstraction shift in media and
journalism.

 <dc:description>  Cyber-physical systems are integrations of computation, networking, and
physical processes. Due to the tight cyber-physical coupling and to the
potentially disrupting consequences of failures, security here is one of the
primary concerns. Our systematic mapping study sheds some light on how security
is actually addressed when dealing with cyber-physical systems. The provided
systematic map of 118 selected studies is based on, for instance, application
fields, various system components, related algorithms and models, attacks
characteristics and defense strategies. It presents a powerful comparison
framework for existing and future research on this hot topic, important for
both industry and academia.

 <dc:description>  The restricted isometry property (RIP) for design matrices gives guarantees
for optimal recovery in sparse linear models. It is of high interest in
compressed sensing and statistical learning. This property is particularly
important for computationally efficient recovery methods. As a consequence,
even though it is in general NP-hard to check that RIP holds, there have been
substantial efforts to find tractable proxies for it. These would allow the
construction of RIP matrices and the polynomial-time verification of RIP given
an arbitrary matrix. We consider the framework of average-case certifiers, that
never wrongly declare that a matrix is RIP, while being often correct for
random instances. While there are such functions which are tractable in a
suboptimal parameter regime, we show that this is a computationally hard task
in any better regime. Our results are based on a new, weaker assumption on the
problem of detecting dense subgraphs.

 <dc:description>  Person re-identification (re-id) is a critical problem in video analytics
applications such as security and surveillance. The public release of several
datasets and code for vision algorithms has facilitated rapid progress in this
area over the last few years. However, directly comparing re-id algorithms
reported in the literature has become difficult since a wide variety of
features, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics are employed. In order
to address this need, we present an extensive review and performance evaluation
of single- and multi-shot re-id algorithms. The experimental protocol
incorporates the most recent advances in both feature extraction and metric
learning. To ensure a fair comparison, all of the approaches were implemented
using a unified code library that includes 11 feature extraction algorithms and
22 metric learning and ranking techniques. All approaches were evaluated using
a new large-scale dataset that closely mimics a real-world problem setting, in
addition to 16 other publicly available datasets: VIPeR, GRID, CAVIAR,
DukeMTMC4ReID, 3DPeS, PRID, V47, WARD, SAIVT-SoftBio, CUHK01, CHUK02, CUHK03,
RAiD, iLIDSVID, HDA+ and Market1501. The evaluation codebase and results will
be made publicly available for community use.

 <dc:description>  In a traditional convolutional layer, the learned filters stay fixed after
training. In contrast, we introduce a new framework, the Dynamic Filter
Network, where filters are generated dynamically conditioned on an input. We
show that this architecture is a powerful one, with increased flexibility
thanks to its adaptive nature, yet without an excessive increase in the number
of model parameters. A wide variety of filtering operations can be learned this
way, including local spatial transformations, but also others like selective
(de)blurring or adaptive feature extraction. Moreover, multiple such layers can
be combined, e.g. in a recurrent architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the dynamic filter network on the tasks of video and stereo prediction, and
reach state-of-the-art performance on the moving MNIST dataset with a much
smaller model. By visualizing the learned filters, we illustrate that the
network has picked up flow information by only looking at unlabelled training
data. This suggests that the network can be used to pretrain networks for
various supervised tasks in an unsupervised way, like optical flow and depth
estimation.

 <dc:description>  Scalable and effective exploration remains a key challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL). While there are methods with optimality guarantees in the
setting of discrete state and action spaces, these methods cannot be applied in
high-dimensional deep RL scenarios. As such, most contemporary RL relies on
simple heuristics such as epsilon-greedy exploration or adding Gaussian noise
to the controls. This paper introduces Variational Information Maximizing
Exploration (VIME), an exploration strategy based on maximization of
information gain about the agent's belief of environment dynamics. We propose a
practical implementation, using variational inference in Bayesian neural
networks which efficiently handles continuous state and action spaces. VIME
modifies the MDP reward function, and can be applied with several different
underlying RL algorithms. We demonstrate that VIME achieves significantly
better performance compared to heuristic exploration methods across a variety
of continuous control tasks and algorithms, including tasks with very sparse
rewards.

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Databases</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Recently, with the rapid development of mobile devices and the crowdsourcing
platforms, the spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the
database community. Specifically, spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending a
location-based request to workers according to their positions, and workers
need to physically move to specified locations to conduct tasks. Many works
have studied task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing, however, their
problem definitions are quite different from each other. As a result, there is
no work to compare the performances of existing algorithms on task assignment
in spatial crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
experimental comparison of most existing algorithms on task assignment in
spatial crowdsourcing. Specifically, we first give some general definitions
about spatial workers and spatial tasks based on definitions in the existing
works studying task assignment problems in spatial crowdsourcing such that the
existing algorithms can be applied on same synthetic and real data sets. Then,
we provide a uniform implementation for all the algorithms of task assignment
problems in spatial crowdsourcing. Finally, based on the results on both
synthetic and real data sets, we conclude the strengths and weaknesses of
tested algorithms, which can guide further researches on the same area and
practical implementations of spatial crowdsourcing systems.

 <dc:title>Level Up Your Strategy: Towards a Descriptive Framework for Meaningful
  Enterprise Gamification</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ruhi, Umar</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Gamification initiatives are currently top-of-mind for many organizations
seeking to engage their employees in creative ways, improve their productivity,
and drive positive behavioural outcomes in their workforce - ultimately leading
to positive business outcomes on the whole. Despite its touted benefits, little
empirical research has been done to date to investigate technological and
individual personal factors that determine the success or failure of enterprise
gamification initiatives. In this article, we provide a summary of our
preliminary research findings from three case studies of gamification
initiatives across different business contexts and present an empirically
validated descriptive framework that details the key success factors for
enterprise gamification. Our adaptation of the mechanics, dynamics, and
aesthetics (MDA) framework for enterprise gamification aims to explicate the
connections between end-user motivations, interactive gameplay elements, and
technology features and functions that constitute effective gamification
interventions in the enterprise. Following a discussion of the core elements in
the framework and their interrelationships, the implications of our research
are presented in the form of guidelines for the management and design of
gamification initiatives and applications. The research findings presented in
this article can potentially aid in the development of game mechanics that
translate into positive user experiences and foster higher levels of employee
engagement. Additionally, our research findings provide insights on key success
factors for the effective adoption and institutionalization of enterprise
gamification initiatives in organizations, and subsequently help them enhance
the performance of their employees and drive positive business outcomes.

including Canonical Correlation Analysis, Partial Least Sqaure regression and
Linear Discriminant Analysis are studied using specific intrinsic and penalty
graphs within the same framework. Non-linear extensions based on kernels and
(deep) neural networks are derived, achieving better performance than the
linear ones. Moreover, a novel Multi-view Modular Discriminant Analysis (MvMDA)
is proposed by taking the view difference into consideration. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view embedding methods on visual object
recognition and cross-modal image retrieval, and obtain superior results in
both applications compared to related methods.

 <dc:description>  Continuous-time Markov decision processes are an important class of models in
a wide range of applications, ranging from cyber-physical systems to synthetic
biology. A central problem is how to devise a policy to control the system in
order to maximise the probability of satisfying a set of temporal logic
specifications. Here we present a novel approach based on statistical model
checking and an unbiased estimation of a functional gradient in the space of
possible policies. The statistical approach has several advantages over
conventional approaches based on uniformisation, as it can also be applied when
the model is replaced by a black box, and does not suffer from state-space
explosion. The use of a stochastic gradient to guide our search considerably
improves the efficiency of learning policies. We demonstrate the method on a
proof-of-principle non-linear population model, showing strong performance in a
non-trivial task.

 <dc:title>Multi-layer Mechanism for Multicast Routing in Multihop Cognitive Radio
  Networks</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Ali, Mustafa Mahdi</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Networking and Internet Architecture</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Multicast routing is considered as one of the most important process in
Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) to enable video sharing and data dissemination.
Multicast routing can be used without any difficulties if a medium can be
accessed by any transmitter at any given time. Unfortunately, challenges such
as the unexpected behavior of primary users (PUs) and their access priority as
well as network heterogeneity may appear in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In
this thesis, we propose a multi-layer multicast routing protocol for multi-hop
mobile Ad Hoc CRN based on the concept of the minimum spanning tree (MST) and
the shortest path tree (SPT). The proposed algorithm employs the probability of
success (POS) metric in performing the channel assignment process. Simulations
experiments were conducted, to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme, compare the performance of the proposed scheme with
the-state-of-the-art schemes, and study the performance of the proposed scheme
under various network conditions in terms of throughput and packet delivery
rate (PDR). Simulations results show that the SPT outperforms MST in term of
throughput all the time.

 <dc:title>Analysis of Key Generation Rate from Wireless Channel in In-Band
  Full-Duplex Communications</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  In this paper, the impact of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) wireless
communications on secret key generation via physical layer channel state
information is investigated. A key generation strategy for IBFD wireless
devices to increase the rate of generated secret keys over multipath fading
channels is proposed. Conventionally, due to the half-duplex (HD) constraint on
wireless transmissions, sensing simultaneous reciprocal channel measurements is
not possible, which leads to a degraded key generation rate. However, with the
advent of IBFD wireless devices, the legitimate nodes can sense the shared
wireless link simultaneously at the possible cost of a self-interference (SI)
channel estimation and some residual self-interference (RSI). As we
demonstrate, with HD correlated observations the key rate is upper bounded by a
constant, while with IBFD the key rate is only limited by the SI cancellation
performance and is in general greater than that of its HD counterpart. Our
analysis shows that with reasonable levels of SI cancellation, in the high SNR
regime the key rate of IBFD is much higher, while in low SNRs, the HD system
performs better. Finally, the key rate loss due to the overhead imposed by the
SI channel estimation phase is discussed.

 <dc:description>  Recently, several working implementations of in--band full--duplex wireless
systems have been presented, where the same node can transmit and receive
simultaneously in the same frequency band. The introduction of such a
possibility at the physical layer could lead to improved performance but also
poses several challenges at the MAC layer. In this paper, an innovative
mechanism of channel contention in full--duplex OFDM wireless networks is
proposed. This strategy is able to ensure efficient transmission scheduling
with the result of avoiding collisions and effectively exploiting full--duplex
opportunities. As a consequence, considerable performance improvements are
observed with respect to standard and state--of--the--art MAC protocols for
wireless networks, as highlighted by extensive simulations performed in ad hoc
wireless networks with varying number of nodes.

 <dc:description>  We present CYCLADES, a general framework for parallelizing stochastic
optimization algorithms in a shared memory setting. CYCLADES is asynchronous
during shared model updates, and requires no memory locking mechanisms, similar
to HOGWILD!-type algorithms. Unlike HOGWILD!, CYCLADES introduces no conflicts
during the parallel execution, and offers a black-box analysis for provable
speedups across a large family of algorithms. Due to its inherent conflict-free
nature and cache locality, our multi-core implementation of CYCLADES
consistently outperforms HOGWILD!-type algorithms on sufficiently sparse
datasets, leading to up to 40% speedup gains compared to the HOGWILD!
implementation of SGD, and up to 5x gains over asynchronous implementations of
variance reduction algorithms.

 <dc:title>Condorcet-Consistent and Approximately Strategyproof Tournament Rules</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  We consider the manipulability of tournament rules for round-robin
tournaments of $n$ competitors. Specifically, $n$ competitors are competing for
a prize, and a tournament rule $r$ maps the result of all $\binom{n}{2}$
pairwise matches (called a tournament, $T$) to a distribution over winners.
Rule $r$ is Condorcet-consistent if whenever $i$ wins all $n-1$ of her matches,
$r$ selects $i$ with probability $1$.
  We consider strategic manipulation of tournaments where player $j$ might
throw their match to player $i$ in order to increase the likelihood that one of
them wins the tournament. Regardless of the reason why $j$ chooses to do this,
the potential for manipulation exists as long as $\Pr[r(T) = i]$ increases by
more than $\Pr[r(T) = j]$ decreases. Unfortunately, it is known that every
Condorcet-consistent rule is manipulable (Altman and Kleinberg). In this work,
we address the question of how manipulable Condorcet-consistent rules must
necessarily be - by trying to minimize the difference between the increase in
$\Pr[r(T) = i]$ and decrease in $\Pr[r(T) = j]$ for any potential manipulating
pair.
  We show that every Condorcet-consistent rule is in fact $1/3$-manipulable,
and that selecting a winner according to a random single elimination bracket is
not $\alpha$-manipulable for any $\alpha &gt; 1/3$. We also show that many
previously studied tournament formats are all $1/2$-manipulable, and the
popular class of Copeland rules (any rule that selects a player with the most
wins) are all in fact $1$-manipulable, the worst possible. Finally, we consider
extensions to match-fixing among sets of more than two players.

 <dc:description>  Reinforcement learning for embodied agents is a challenging problem. The
accumulated reward to be optimized is often a very rugged function, and
gradient methods are impaired by many local optimizers. We demonstrate, in an
experimental setting, that incorporating an intrinsic reward can smoothen the
optimization landscape while preserving the global optimizers of interest. We
show that policy gradient optimization for locomotion in a complex morphology
is significantly improved when supplementing the extrinsic reward by an
intrinsic reward defined in terms of the mutual information of time consecutive
sensor readings.

PerfEnforce scales a cluster of virtual machines allocated to a user in a way
that minimizes cost while probabilistically meeting the query runtime
guarantees offered by a service level agreement. With PerfEnforce, we show how
to scale a cluster in a way that minimally disrupts a user's query session. We
further show when to scale the cluster using one of three methods: feedback
control, reinforcement learning, or perceptron learning. We find that
perceptron learning outperforms the other two methods when making cluster

 <dc:description>  The maturity of deep learning techniques has led in recent years to a
breakthrough in object recognition in visual media. While for some specific
benchmarks, neural techniques seem to match if not outperform human judgement,
challenges are still open for detecting arbitrary concepts in arbitrary videos.
In this paper, we propose a system that combines neural techniques, a large
scale visual concepts ontology, and an active learning loop, to provide on the
fly model learning of arbitrary concepts. We give an overview of the system as
a whole, and focus on the central role of the ontology for guiding and
bootstrapping the learning of new concepts, improving the recall of concept
detection, and, on the user end, providing semantic search on a library of
annotated videos.

 <dc:description>  The well-known word analogy experiments show that the recent word vectors
capture fine-grained linguistic regularities in words by linear vector offsets,
but it is unclear how well the simple vector offsets can encode visual
regularities over words. We study a particular image-word relevance relation in
this paper. Our results show that the word vectors of relevant tags for a given
image rank ahead of the irrelevant tags, along a principal direction in the
word vector space. Inspired by this observation, we propose to solve image
tagging by estimating the principal direction for an image. Particularly, we
exploit linear mappings and nonlinear deep neural networks to approximate the
principal direction from an input image. We arrive at a quite versatile tagging
model. It runs fast given a test image, in constant time w.r.t.\ the training
set size. It not only gives superior performance for the conventional tagging
task on the NUS-WIDE dataset, but also outperforms competitive baselines on
annotating images with previously unseen tags

decision support can be designed and developed in order to improve the quality
of health care. To answer this research question, several sub-questions were
identified and investigated. This included analyzing state of the art in two
different aspects of design and development and evaluation of Clinical Decision
Support (CDS) and also investigating application of a customized user-centered
design (UCD) process in developing openEHR-based clinical applications.
Analysis of state of the art in interplay between Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and CDS and also the intersection between CDS and Electronic Health
Records (EHR) revealed that consideration of both HCI and integration of CDS
into EHR is more appreciated in theory than in practice and there is still a
long way to go before reaching an acceptable level in these two success factors
of CDS. Moreover, the experience in designing an openEHR-based clinical
application revealed that apart from benefits offered by openEHR approach, such
as specifying different roles and involvement of domain experts in defining
domain concepts, there are various shortcomings that need to be improved, for
instance the limited support for openEHR application developers. Additionally,
this study revealed that there are characteristics of the domain, tasks and
users in the domain that developers should be informed about while applying UCD
methods.

 <dc:description>  Security protocols are building blocks in secure communications. They deploy
some security mechanisms to provide certain security services. Security
protocols are considered abstract when analyzed, but they can have extra
vulnerabilities when implemented. This manuscript provides a holistic study on
security protocols. It reviews foundations of security protocols, taxonomy of
attacks on security protocols and their implementations, and different methods
and models for security analysis of protocols. Specifically, it clarifies
differences between information-theoretic and computational security, and
computational and symbolic models. Furthermore, a survey on computational
security models for authenticated key exchange (AKE) and password-authenticated
key exchange (PAKE) protocols, as the most important and well-studied type of
security protocols, is provided.

 <dc:description>  This paper presents a Directed Controller Synthesis (DCS) technique for
discrete event systems. The DCS method explores the solution space for reactive
controllers guided by a domain-independent heuristic. The heuristic is derived
from an efficient abstraction of the environment based on the componentized way
in which complex environments are described. Then by building the composition
of the components on-the-fly DCS obtains a solution by exploring a reduced
portion of the state space. This work focuses on untimed discrete event systems
with safety and co-safety (i.e. reachability) goals. An evaluation for the
technique is presented comparing it to other well-known approaches to
controller synthesis (based on symbolic representation and compositional
analyses).

 <dc:description>  Asynchronous methods are widely used in deep learning, but have limited
theoretical justification when applied to non-convex problems. We show that
running stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in an asynchronous manner can be
viewed as adding a momentum-like term to the SGD iteration. Our result does not
assume convexity of the objective function, so it is applicable to deep
learning systems. We observe that a standard queuing model of asynchrony
results in a form of momentum that is commonly used by deep learning
practitioners. This forges a link between queuing theory and asynchrony in deep
learning systems, which could be useful for systems builders. For convolutional
neural networks, we experimentally validate that the degree of asynchrony
directly correlates with the momentum, confirming our main result. An important
implication is that tuning the momentum parameter is important when considering
different levels of asynchrony. We assert that properly tuned momentum reduces
the number of steps required for convergence. Finally, our theory suggests new
ways of counteracting the adverse effects of asynchrony: a simple mechanism
like using negative algorithmic momentum can improve performance under high
asynchrony. Since asynchronous methods have better hardware efficiency, this
result may shed light on when asynchronous execution is more efficient for deep
learning systems.

 <dc:title>Waddling Random Walk: Fast and Accurate Mining of Motif Statistics in
  Large Graphs</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Han, Guyue</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Social and Information Networks</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Algorithms for mining very large graphs, such as those representing online
social networks, to discover the relative frequency of small subgraphs within
them are of high interest to sociologists, computer scientists and marketeers
alike. However, the computation of these network motif statistics via naive
enumeration is infeasible for either its prohibitive computational costs or
access restrictions on the full graph data. Methods to estimate the motif
statistics based on random walks by sampling only a small fraction of the
subgraphs in the large graph address both of these challenges. In this paper,
we present a new algorithm, called the Waddling Random Walk (WRW), which
estimates the concentration of motifs of any size. It derives its name from the
fact that it sways a little to the left and to the right, thus also sampling
nodes not directly on the path of the random walk. The WRW algorithm achieves
its computational efficiency by not trying to enumerate subgraphs around the
random walk but instead using a randomized protocol to sample subgraphs in the
neighborhood of the nodes visited by the walk. In addition, WRW achieves
significantly higher accuracy (measured by the closeness of its estimate to the
correct value) and higher precision (measured by the low variance in its
estimations) than the current state-of-the-art algorithms for mining subgraph
statistics. We illustrate these advantages in speed, accuracy and precision
using simulations on well-known and widely used graph datasets representing
real networks.

 <dc:description>  Oblivious RAM (ORAM) protocols are powerful techniques that hide a client's
data as well as access patterns from untrusted service providers. We present an
oblivious cloud storage system, ObliviSync, that specifically targets one of
the most widely-used personal cloud storage paradigms: synchronization and
backup services, popular examples of which are Dropbox, iCloud Drive, and
Google Drive. This setting provides a unique opportunity because the above
privacy properties can be achieved with a simpler form of ORAM called
write-only ORAM, which allows for dramatically increased efficiency compared to
related work. Our solution is asymptotically optimal and practically efficient,
with a small constant overhead of approximately 4x compared with non-private
file storage, depending only on the total data size and parameters chosen
according to the usage rate, and not on the number or size of individual files.
Our construction also offers protection against timing-channel attacks, which
has not been previously considered in ORAM protocols. We built and evaluated a
full implementation of ObliviSync that supports multiple simultaneous read-only
clients and a single concurrent read/write client whose edits automatically and
seamlessly propagate to the readers. We show that our system functions under
high work loads, with realistic file size distributions, and with small
additional latency (as compared to a baseline encrypted file system) when
paired with Dropbox as the synchronization service.

 <dc:description>  The ability of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) framework to learn
generative models mapping from simple latent distributions to arbitrarily
complex data distributions has been demonstrated empirically, with compelling
results showing that the latent space of such generators captures semantic
variation in the data distribution. Intuitively, models trained to predict
these semantic latent representations given data may serve as useful feature
representations for auxiliary problems where semantics are relevant. However,
in their existing form, GANs have no means of learning the inverse mapping --
projecting data back into the latent space. We propose Bidirectional Generative
Adversarial Networks (BiGANs) as a means of learning this inverse mapping, and
demonstrate that the resulting learned feature representation is useful for
auxiliary supervised discrimination tasks, competitive with contemporary
approaches to unsupervised and self-supervised feature learning.

 <dc:title>Fast approximate furthest neighbors with data-dependent hashing</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Curtin, Ryan R.</dc:creator>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Data Structures and Algorithms</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  We present a novel hashing strategy for approximate furthest neighbor search
that selects projection bases using the data distribution. This strategy leads
to an algorithm, which we call DrusillaHash, that is able to outperform
existing approximate furthest neighbor strategies. Our strategy is motivated by
an empirical study of the behavior of the furthest neighbor search problem,
which lends intuition for where our algorithm is most useful. We also present a
variant of the algorithm that gives an absolute approximation guarantee; to our
knowledge, this is the first such approximate furthest neighbor hashing
approach to give such a guarantee. Performance studies indicate that
DrusillaHash can achieve comparable levels of approximation to other algorithms
while giving up to an order of magnitude speedup. An implementation is
available in the mlpack machine learning library (found at
http://www.mlpack.org).

 <dc:description>  Distributed optimization for solving non-convex Optimal Power Flow (OPF)
problems in power systems has attracted tremendous attention in the last
decade. Most studies are based on the geographical decomposition of IEEE test
systems for verifying the feasibility of the proposed approaches. However, it
is not clear if one can extrapolate from these studies that those approaches
can be applied to very large-scale real-world systems. In this paper, we show,
for the first time, that distributed optimization can be effectively applied to
a large-scale real transmission network, namely, the Polish 2383-bus system for
which no pre-defined partitions exist, by using a recently developed
partitioning technique. More specifically, the problem solved is the AC OPF
problem with geographical decomposition of the network using the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method in conjunction with the
partitioning technique. Through extensive experimental results and analytical
studies, we show that with the presented partitioning technique the convergence
performance of ADMM can be improved substantially, which enables the
application of distributed approaches on very large-scale systems.

 <dc:description>  A method for improving the efficiency of graph isomorphism testing is
presented. The method uses the structure of the graph colored by vertex hash
codes as a means of partitioning vertices into equivalence classes, which in
turn reduces the combinatorial burden of isomorphism testing. Unrolling the
graph into a tree at each vertex allows structurally different regular graphs
to be discriminated, a capability that the color refinement algorithm cannot

 <dc:description>  In this paper, an uncertain Multi-objective Multi-item Solid Transportation
Problem (MMSTP) based on uncertainty theory is presented. In the model,
transportation costs, supplies, demands and conveyances parameters are taken to
be uncertain parameters. There are restrictions on some items and conveyances
of the model. Therefore, some particular items cannot be transported by some
exceptional conveyances. Using the advantage of uncertainty theory, the MMSTP
is first converted into an equivalent deterministic MMSTP. By applying convex
combination method and minimizing distance function method, the deterministic
MMSTP is reduced into single objective programming problems. Thus, both single
objective programming problems are solved using Maple 18.02 optimization
toolbox. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the performance of
the models.

 <dc:description>  Here we demonstrate that the feature space of random shallow convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) can serve as a surprisingly good model of natural
textures. Patches from the same texture are consistently classified as being
more similar then patches from different textures. Samples synthesized from the
model capture spatial correlations on scales much larger then the receptive
field size, and sometimes even rival or surpass the perceptual quality of state
of the art texture models (but show less variability). The current state of the
art in parametric texture synthesis relies on the multi-layer feature space of
deep CNNs that were trained on natural images. Our finding suggests that such
optimized multi-layer feature spaces are not imperative for texture modeling.
Instead, much simpler shallow and convolutional networks can serve as the basis
for novel texture synthesis algorithms.

input and outputs a list of words semantically similar to that phrase. It is a
solution to the Tip-of-the-Tongue problem. We use a distance-based similarity
measure, computed on a graph, to assess the similarity between a word and the
input phrase. We compare the performance of our approach with the Onelook
Reverse Dictionary and a distributional semantics method based on word2vec, and
show that our approach is much better than the distributional semantics method,
and as good as Onelook, on a 3k lexicon. This simple approach sets a new
performance baseline for reverse dictionaries.

 <dc:title>Impact of Power System Partitioning on the Efficiency of Distributed

 <dc:description>  Recent studies have shown that multi-step optimization based on Model
Predictive Control (MPC) can effectively coordinate the increasing number of
distributed renewable energy and storage resources in the power system.
However, the computation complexity of MPC is usually high which limits its use
in practical implementation. To improve the efficiency of MPC, in this paper,
we apply a distributed optimization method to MPC. The approach consists of a
partitioning technique based on spectral clustering that determines the best
system partition and an improved Optimality Condition Decomposition method that
solves the optimization problem in a distributed manner. Results of simulations
conducted on the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus systems show that the distributed MPC
problem can be solved significantly faster by using a good partition of the
system and this partition is applicable to multiple time steps without frequent
changes.

 <dc:description>  We present Vibrato Nonnegative Tensor Factorization, an algorithm for
single-channel unsupervised audio source separation with an application to
separating instrumental or vocal sources with nonstationary pitch from music
recordings. Our approach extends Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for audio
modeling by including local estimates of frequency modulation as cues in the
separation. This permits the modeling and unsupervised separation of vibrato or
glissando musical sources, which is not possible with the basic matrix
factorization formulation.
  The algorithm factorizes a sparse nonnegative tensor comprising the audio
spectrogram and local frequency-slope-to-frequency ratios, which are estimated
at each time-frequency bin using the Distributed Derivative Method. The use of
local frequency modulations as separation cues is motivated by the principle of
common fate partial grouping from Auditory Scene Analysis, which hypothesizes
that each latent source in a mixture is characterized perceptually by coherent
frequency and amplitude modulations shared by its component partials. We derive
multiplicative factor updates by Minorization-Maximization, which guarantees
convergence to a local optimum by iteration. We then compare our method to the
baseline on two separation tasks: one considers synthetic vibrato notes, while
the other considers vibrato string instrument recordings.

 <dc:description>  The database community has developed numerous tools and techniques for data
curation and exploration, from declarative languages, to specialized techniques
for data repair, and more. Yet, there is currently no consensus on how to best
expose these powerful tools to an analyst in a simple, intuitive, and above
all, flexible way. Thus, analysts continue to rely on tools such as
spreadsheets, imperative languages, and notebook style programming environments
like Jupyter for data curation. In this work, we explore the integration of
spreadsheets, notebooks, and relational databases. We focus on a key advantage
that both spreadsheets and imperative notebook environments have over classical
relational databases: ease of exception. By relying on set-at-a-time
operations, relational databases sacrifice the ability to easily define
singleton operations, exceptions to a normal data processing workflow that
affect query processing for a fixed set of explicitly targeted records. In
comparison, a spreadsheet user can easily change the formula for just one cell,
while a notebook user can add an imperative operation to her notebook that
alters an output 'view'. We believe that enabling such idiosyncratic manual
transformations in a classical relational database is critical for curation, as
curation operations that are easy to declare for individual values can often be
extremely challenging to generalize. We explore the challenges of enabling
singletons in relational databases, propose a hybrid spreadsheet/relational
notebook environment for data curation, and present our vision of Vizier, a
system that exposes data curation through such an interface.

 <dc:description>  A number of recent works have proposed attention models for Visual Question
Answering (VQA) that generate spatial maps highlighting image regions relevant
to answering the question. In this paper, we argue that in addition to modeling
&quot;where to look&quot; or visual attention, it is equally important to model &quot;what
words to listen to&quot; or question attention. We present a novel co-attention
model for VQA that jointly reasons about image and question attention. In
addition, our model reasons about the question (and consequently the image via
the co-attention mechanism) in a hierarchical fashion via a novel 1-dimensional
convolution neural networks (CNN). Our model improves the state-of-the-art on
the VQA dataset from 60.3% to 60.5%, and from 61.6% to 63.3% on the COCO-QA
dataset. By using ResNet, the performance is further improved to 62.1% for VQA
and 65.4% for COCO-QA.

 <dc:title>Quantifying the probable approximation error of probabilistic inference

 <dc:description>  This paper introduces a new technique for quantifying the approximation error
of a broad class of probabilistic inference programs, including ones based on
both variational and Monte Carlo approaches. The key idea is to derive a
subjective bound on the symmetrized KL divergence between the distribution
achieved by an approximate inference program and its true target distribution.
The bound's validity (and subjectivity) rests on the accuracy of two auxiliary
probabilistic programs: (i) a &quot;reference&quot; inference program that defines a gold
standard of accuracy and (ii) a &quot;meta-inference&quot; program that answers the
question &quot;what internal random choices did the original approximate inference
program probably make given that it produced a particular result?&quot; The paper
includes empirical results on inference problems drawn from linear regression,
Dirichlet process mixture modeling, HMMs, and Bayesian networks. The
experiments show that the technique is robust to the quality of the reference
inference program and that it can detect implementation bugs that are not
apparent from predictive performance.

 <dc:title>Applications of Probabilistic Programming (Master's thesis, 2015)</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Perov, Yura N</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  This thesis describes work on two applications of probabilistic programming:
the learning of probabilistic program code given specifications, in particular
program code of one-dimensional samplers; and the facilitation of sequential
Monte Carlo inference with help of data-driven proposals. The latter is
presented with experimental results on a linear Gaussian model and a
non-parametric dependent Dirichlet process mixture of objects model for object
recognition and tracking.
  In Chapter 1 we provide a brief introduction to probabilistic programming.
  In Chapter 3 we present an approach to automatic discovery of samplers in the
form of probabilistic programs. We formulate a Bayesian approach to this
problem by specifying a grammar-based prior over probabilistic program code. We
use an approximate Bayesian computation method to learn the programs, whose
executions generate samples that statistically match observed data or
analytical characteristics of distributions of interest. In our experiments we
leverage different probabilistic programming systems to perform Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling over the space of programs. Experimental results have
demonstrated that, using the proposed methodology, we can learn approximate and
even some exact samplers. Finally, we show that our results are competitive
with regard to genetic programming methods.
  In Chapter 3, we describe a way to facilitate sequential Monte Carlo
inference in probabilistic programming using data-driven proposals. In
particular, we develop a distance-based proposal for the non-parametric
dependent Dirichlet process mixture of objects model. We implement this
approach in the probabilistic programming system Anglican, and show that for
that model data-driven proposals provide significant performance improvements.
We also explore the possibility of using neural networks to improve data-driven
proposals.

 <dc:description>  For many macromolecular systems the accurate sampling of the relevant regions
on the potential energy surface cannot be obtained by a single, long Molecular
Dynamics (MD) trajectory. New approaches are required to promote more efficient
sampling. We present the design and implementation of the Extensible Toolkit
for Advanced Sampling and analYsis (ExTASY) for building and executing advanced
sampling workflows on HPC systems. ExTASY provides Python based &quot;templated
scripts&quot; that interface to an interoperable and high-performance pilot-based
run time system, which abstracts the complexity of managing multiple
simulations. ExTASY supports the use of existing highly-optimised parallel MD
code and their coupling to analysis tools based upon collective coordinates
which do not require a priori knowledge of the system to bias. We describe two
workflows which both couple large &quot;ensembles&quot; of relatively short MD
simulations with analysis tools to automatically analyse the generated
trajectories and identify molecular conformational structures that will be used
on-the-fly as new starting points for further &quot;simulation-analysis&quot; iterations.
One of the workflows leverages the Locally Scaled Diffusion Maps technique; the
other makes use of Complementary Coordinates techniques to enhance sampling and
generate start-points for the next generation of MD simulations. We show that
the ExTASY tools have been deployed on a range of HPC systems including ARCHER
(Cray CX30), Blue Waters (Cray XE6/XK7), and Stampede (Linux cluster), and that
good strong scaling can be obtained up to 1000s of MD simulations, independent
of the size of each simulation. We discuss how ExTASY can be easily extended or
modified by end-users to build their own workflows, and ongoing work to improve
the usability and robustness of ExTASY.

 <dc:description>  The popularity of neural networks (NNs) spans academia, industry, and popular
culture. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been applied
to many image based machine learning tasks and have yielded strong results. The
availability of hardware/software systems for efficient training and deployment
of large and/or deep CNN models has been, and continues to be, an important
consideration for the field. Early systems for NN computation focused on
leveraging existing dense linear algebra techniques and libraries. Current
approaches use low-level machine specific programming and/or closed-source,
purpose-built vendor libraries. In this work, we present an open source system
that, compared to existing approaches, achieves competitive computational speed
while achieving higher portability. We achieve this by targeting the
vendor-neutral OpenCL platform using a code-generation approach. We argue that
our approach allows for both: (1) the rapid development of new computational
kernels for existing hardware targets, and (2) the rapid tuning of existing
computational kernels for new hardware targets. Results are presented for a
case study of targeting the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 mobile computing platform
for CNN deployment.

studied. In this paper, we investigate 6 popular blending algorithms---feather
blending, multi-band blending, modified Poisson blending, mean value coordinate
blending, multi-spline blending and convolution pyramid blending. We consider
in particular realtime panoramic video blending, a key problem in various
virtual reality tasks. To evaluate the performance of the 6 algorithms on this
problem, we have created a video benchmark of several videos captured under
various conditions. We analyze the time and memory needed by the above 6
algorithms, for both CPU and GPU implementations (where readily
parallelizable). The visual quality provided by these algorithms is also
evaluated both objectively and subjectively. The video benchmark and algorithm
implementations are publicly available.

 <dc:creator>Thomas, Christopher</dc:creator>

 <dc:description>  In this technical report, we present our publicly downloadable implementation
of the SALICON saliency model. At the time of this writing, SALICON is one of
the top performing saliency models on the MIT 300 fixation prediction dataset
which evaluates how well an algorithm is able to predict where humans would
look in a given image. Recently, numerous models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance on this benchmark, but none of the top 5 performing models
(including SALICON) are available for download. To address this issue, we have
created a publicly downloadable implementation of the SALICON model. It is our
hope that our model will engender further research in visual attention modeling
by providing a baseline for comparison of other algorithms and a platform for
extending this implementation. The model we provide supports both training and
testing, enabling researchers to quickly fine-tune the model on their own
dataset. We also provide a pre-trained model and code for those users who only
need to generate saliency maps for images without training their own model.

 <dc:description>  Mixed-criticality systems combine real-time components of different levels of
criticality, i.e. severity of failure, on the same processor, in order to
obtain good resource utilisation. They must guarantee deadlines of
highly-critical tasks at the expense of lower-criticality ones in the case of
overload. Present operating systems provide inadequate support for this kind of
system, which is of growing importance in avionics and other verticals. We
present an approach that provides the required asymmetric integrity and its
implementation in the high-assurance seL4 microkernel.

 <dc:description>  Nearest-neighbor search, which returns the nearest neighbor of a query point
in a set of points, is an important and widely studied problem in many fields,
and it has wide range of applications. In many of them, such as sensor
databases, location-based services, face recognition, and mobile data, the
location of data is imprecise. We therefore study nearest-neighbor queries in a
probabilistic framework in which the location of each input point is specified
as a probability distribution function. We present efficient algorithms for
  - computing all points that are nearest neighbors of a query point with
nonzero probability; and
  - estimating the probability of a point being the nearest neighbor of a query
point, either exactly or within a specified additive error.

 <dc:title>Hardness of the Pricing Problem for Chains in Barter Exchanges</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Kidney exchange is a barter market where patients trade willing but medically
incompatible donors. These trades occur via cycles, where each patient-donor
pair both gives and receives a kidney, and via chains, which begin with an
altruistic donor who does not require a kidney in return. For logistical
reasons, the maximum length of a cycle is typically limited to a small
constant, while chains can be much longer. Given a compatibility graph of
patient-donor pairs, altruists, and feasible potential transplants between
them, finding even a maximum-cardinality set of vertex-disjoint cycles and
chains is NP-hard. There has been much work on developing provably optimal
solvers that are efficient in practice. One of the leading techniques has been
branch and price, where column generation is used to incrementally bring cycles
and chains into the optimization model on an as-needed basis. In particular,
only positive-price columns need to be brought into the model. We prove that
finding a positive-price chain is NP-complete. This shows incorrectness of two
leading branch-and-price solvers that suggested polynomial-time chain pricing
algorithms.

 <dc:description>  Motivated by online recommendation and advertising systems, we consider a
causal model for stochastic contextual bandits with a latent low-dimensional
confounder. In our model, there are $L$ observed contexts and $K$ arms of the
bandit. The observed context influences the reward obtained through a latent
confounder variable with cardinality $m$ ($m \ll L,K$). The arm choice and the
latent confounder causally determines the reward while the observed context is
correlated with the confounder. Under this model, the $L \times K$ mean reward
matrix $\mathbf{U}$ (for each context in $[L]$ and each arm in $[K]$)
factorizes into non-negative factors $\mathbf{A}$ ($L \times m$) and
$\mathbf{W}$ ($m \times K$). This insight enables us to propose an
$\epsilon$-greedy NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions
(selecting specific arms), that achieves a balance between learning this
low-dimensional structure and selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our
algorithm achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}\left(L\mathrm{poly}(m, \log K) \log
T \right)$ at time $T$, as compared to $\mathcal{O}(LK\log T)$ for conventional
contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest
for each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency
conditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known
Statistical RIP condition. We further propose a class of generative models that
satisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of
$\mathcal{O}\left(Km\log T\right)$. These are the first regret guarantees for
online matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank is greater than
one. We further compare the performance of our algorithm with the state of the
art, on synthetic and real world data-sets.

 <dc:description>  Decentralized control of mobile robotic sensor networks is a fundamental
problem in robotics that has attracted intensive research in recent decades.
Most of the existing works dealt with two-dimensional spaces. This report is
concerned with the problem of decentralized self-deployment of mobile robotic
sensor networks in three-dimensional environments. The first part of the report
investigates the problem of complete sensing coverage in three-dimensional
spaces. We propose a decentralized random algorithm to drive mobile robotic
sensors on the vertices of a truncated octahedral grid for complete sensing
coverage of a bounded 3D area. In the second part, we present a distributed
random algorithm for search in bounded three-dimensional environments. Third,
we study the problem of locating static and mobile targets in a bounded 3D
space by a network of mobile robotic sensors. We introduce a novel
decentralized bio-inspired random search algorithm for finding static and
mobile objects in 3D areas. This algorithm combines the Levy flight random
search mechanism with a 3D covering grid. This report studies the problem of 3D
formation building in 3D spaces by a network of mobile robotic sensors.
Decentralized consensus-based control law for the multi-robot system which
results in forming a given geometric configuration from any initial positions
in 3D environments is proposed. Convergence of the mobile robotic sensors to
the given configurations are shown by extensive simulations. Moreover, a
mathematically rigorous proof of convergence of the proposed algorithms to the
given configurations are given.

 <dc:title>Caching Placement in Stochastic Wireless Caching Helper Networks:
  Channel Selection Diversity via Caching</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Information Theory</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  Content delivery success in wireless caching helper networks depends mainly
on cache-based channel selection diversity and network interference. For given
channel fading and network geometry, both channel selection diversity and
network interference dynamically vary according to what and how the caching
helpers cache at their finite storage space. We study probabilistic content
placement (or caching placement) to desirably control cache-based channel
selection diversity and network interference in a stochastic wireless caching
helper network, with sophisticated considerations of wireless fading channels,
interactions among multiple users such as interference and loads at caching
helpers, and arbitrary memory size. Using stochastic geometry, we derive
optimal caching probabilities in closed form to maximize the average success
probability of content delivery and propose an efficient algorithm to find the
solution in a noise-limited network. In an interference-limited network, based
on a lower bound of the average success probability of content delivery, we
find near-optimal caching probabilities in closed form to control the channel
selection diversity and the network interference. We numerically verify that
the proposed content placement is superior to other comparable content
placement strategies.

 <dc:description>  A basic setup of a two-tier network, where two mobile users exchange messages
with a multi-antenna macrocell basestation, is studied from a rate perspective
subject to beamforming and power constraints. The communication is facilitated
by two femtocell basestations which act as relays as there is no direct link
between the macrocell basestation and the mobile users. We propose a scheme
based on physical-layer network coding and compute-and-forward combined with a
novel approach that solves the problem of beamformer design and power
allocation. We also show that the optimal beamformers are always a convex
combination of the channels between the macro- and femtocell basestations. We
then establish the cut-set bound of the setup to show that the presented scheme
almost achieves the capacity of the setup numerically.

 <dc:description>  Self-paced learning (SPL) mimics the cognitive mechanism of humans and
animals that gradually learns from easy to hard samples. One key issue in SPL
is to obtain better weighting strategy that is determined by minimizer
function. Existing methods usually pursue this by artificially designing the
explicit form of SPL regularizer. In this paper, we focus on the minimizer
function, and study a group of new regularizer, named self-paced implicit
regularizer that is deduced from robust loss function. Based on the convex
conjugacy theory, the minimizer function for self-paced implicit regularizer
can be directly learned from the latent loss function, while the analytic form
of the regularizer can be even known. A general framework (named SPL-IR) for
SPL is developed accordingly. We demonstrate that the learning procedure of
SPL-IR is associated with latent robust loss functions, thus can provide some
theoretical inspirations for its working mechanism. We further analyze the
relation between SPL-IR and half-quadratic optimization. Finally, we implement
SPL-IR to both supervised and unsupervised tasks, and experimental results
corroborate our ideas and demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of
implicit regularizers.

 <dc:description>  Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning (QSTR) is concerned with symbolic
knowledge representation, typically over infinite domains. The motivations for
employing QSTR techniques range from exploiting computational properties that
allow efficient reasoning to capture human cognitive concepts in a
computational framework. The notion of a qualitative calculus is one of the
most prominent QSTR formalisms. This article presents the first overview of all
qualitative calculi developed to date and their computational properties,
together with generalized definitions of the fundamental concepts and methods,
which now encompass all existing calculi. Moreover, we provide a classification
of calculi according to their algebraic properties.

 <dc:description>  Entanglement-assisted quantum error correcting codes (EAQECCs) are a simple
and fundamental class of codes. They allow for the construction of quantum
codes from classical codes by relaxing the duality condition and using
pre-shared entanglement between the sender and receiver. However, in general it
is not easy to determine the number of shared pairs required to construct an
EAQECC. In this paper, we show that this number is related to the hull of the
classical code. Using this fact, we give methods to construct EAQECCs requiring
desirable amount of entanglement. This leads to design families of EAQECCs with
good error performance. Moreover, we construct maximal entanglement EAQECCs
from LCD codes. Finally, we prove the existence of asymptotically good EAQECCs
in the odd characteristic case.

 <dc:description>  We study large-scale classification problems in changing environments where a
small part of the dataset is modified, and the effect of the data modification
must be quickly incorporated into the classifier. When the entire dataset is
large, even if the amount of the data modification is fairly small, the
computational cost of re-training the classifier would be prohibitively large.
In this paper, we propose a novel method for efficiently incorporating such a
data modification effect into the classifier without actually re-training it.
The proposed method provides bounds on the unknown optimal classifier with the
cost only proportional to the size of the data modification. We demonstrate
through numerical experiments that the proposed method provides sufficiently
tight bounds with negligible computational costs, especially when a small part
of the dataset is modified in a large-scale classification problem.

 <dc:title>Recovering Architectural Variability of a Family of Product Variants</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  A Software Product Line (SPL) aims at applying a pre-planned systematic reuse
of large-grained software artifacts to increase the software productivity and
reduce the development cost. The idea of SPL is to analyze the business domain
of a family of products to identify the common and the variable parts between
the products. However, it is common for companies to develop, in an ad-hoc
manner (e.g. clone and own), a set of products that share common
functionalities and differ in terms of others. Thus, many recent research
contributions are proposed to re-engineer existing product variants to a SPL.
Nevertheless, these contributions are mostly focused on managing the
variability at the requirement level. Very few contributions address the
variability at the architectural level despite its major importance. Starting
from this observation, we propose, in this paper, an approach to reverse
engineer the architecture of a set of product variants. Our goal is to identify
the variability and dependencies among architectural-element variants at the
architectural level. Our work relies on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to
analyze the variability. To validate the proposed approach, we experimented on
two families of open-source product variants; Mobile Media and Health Watcher.
The results show that our approach is able to identify the architectural
variability and the dependencies.

 <dc:description>  Squared planar markers are a popular tool for fast, accurate and robust
camera localization, but its use is frequently limited to a single marker, or
at most, to a small set of them for which their relative pose is known
beforehand. Mapping and localization from a large set of planar markers is yet
a scarcely treated problem in favour of keypoint-based approaches. However,
while keypoint detectors are not robust to rapid motion, large changes in
viewpoint, or significant changes in appearance, fiducial markers can be
robustly detected under a wider range of conditions. This paper proposes a
novel method to simultaneously solve the problems of mapping and localization
from a set of squared planar markers. First, a quiver of pairwise relative
marker poses is created, from which an initial pose graph is obtained. The pose
graph may contain small pairwise pose errors, that when propagated, leads to
large errors. Thus, we distribute the rotational and translational error along
the basis cycles of the graph so as to obtain a corrected pose graph. Finally,
we perform a global pose optimization by minimizing the reprojection errors of
the planar markers in all observed frames. The experiments conducted show that
our method performs better than Structure from Motion and visual SLAM
techniques.

 <dc:title>Using almetrics for contextualised mapping of societal impact: From hits

 <dc:description>  In this article, we develop a method that uses altmetric data to analyse
researchers' interactions, as a way of mapping the contexts of potential
societal impact. In the face of an increasing policy demand for quantitative
methodologies to assess societal impact, social media data (altmetrics) has
been presented as a potential method to capture broader forms of impact.
However, current altmetric indicators were extrapolated from traditional
citation approaches and are seen as problematic for assessing societal impact.
In contrast, established qualitative methodologies for societal impact
assessment are based on interaction approaches. These argue that assessment
should focus on mapping the contexts in which engagement among researchers and
stakeholders take place, as a means to understand the pathways to societal
impact. Following these approaches, we propose to shift the use of altmetric
data towards network analysis of researchers and stakeholders. We carry out two
case studies, analysing researchers' networks with Twitter data. The comparison
illustrates the potential of Twitter networks to capture disparate degrees of
policy engagement. We propose that this mapping method can be used as an input
within broader methodologies in case studies of societal impact assessment.

 <dc:description>  International scientific mobility is acknowledged to be a key mechanism for
the diffusion of knowledge, particularly tacit or 'sticky' knowledge that
cannot be transferred without geographical proximity and personal contact, for
the incorporation of young researchers into elite transnational scientific
networks, and for accessing additional resources or infrastructures that are
essential to the research process but located in other places. The inadequacy
and lack of appropriate data to assess the phenomenon of researcher mobility
has been repeatedly pointed out by scholars and policy makers. This paper
presents an exploratory analysis of different typologies of researchers
according to their traceable mobility using scientific publications covered in
the Web of Science (WoS). We compare two populations of researchers, of the
same 'scientific age', based in Spain and The Netherlands. We observe
differences in the degree of mobility of Spain and Netherlands based
researchers. Factors associated with the different institutional conditions
characterizing the two national systems need to be taken into account. First,
the Spanish and Dutch university and research systems are different in many
ways. Second, there may be very different institutional incentives for mobility
in the two systems. More sophisticated bibliometric analyses and comparisons
with different 'generations' of researchers, possibly combined with qualitative
investigation, will be required to better understand the role and function of
national institutional context in both research mobility and research careers.

 <dc:description>  Synaptic plasticity is implemented and controlled through over thousand
different types of molecules in the postsynaptic density and presynaptic
boutons that assume a staggering array of different states through
phosporylation and other mechanisms. One of the most prominent molecule in the
postsynaptic density is CaMKII, that is described in molecular biology as a
&quot;memory molecule&quot; that can integrate through auto-phosporylation Ca-influx
signals on a relatively large time scale of dozens of seconds. The functional
impact of this memory mechanism is largely unknown. We show that the
experimental data on the specific role of CaMKII activation in dopamine-gated
spine consolidation suggest a general functional role in speeding up
reward-guided search for network configurations that maximize reward
expectation. Our theoretical analysis shows that stochastic search could in
principle even attain optimal network configurations by emulating one of the
most well-known nonlinear optimization methods, simulated annealing. But this
optimization is usually impeded by slowness of stochastic search at a given
temperature. We propose that CaMKII contributes a momentum term that
substantially speeds up this search. In particular, it allows the network to
overcome saddle points of the fitness function. The resulting improved
stochastic policy search can be understood on a more abstract level as
Hamiltonian sampling, which is known to be one of the most efficient stochastic
search methods.

 <dc:description>  The Mathematical Intelligencer recently published a note by Y. Sergeyev that
challenges both mathematics and intelligence. We examine Sergeyev's claims
concerning his purported Infinity computer. We compare his grossone system with
the classical Levi-Civita fields and with the hyperreal framework of A.
Robinson, and analyze the related algorithmic issues inevitably arising in any
genuine computer implementation. We show that Sergeyev's grossone system is
unnecessary and vague, and that whatever consistent subsystem could be salvaged
is subsumed entirely within a stronger and clearer system (IST). Lou Kauffman,
who published an article on a grossone, places it squarely outside the
historical panorama of ideas dealing with infinity and infinitesimals.

 <dc:title>An Alternating Qubit Protocol and Its Correctness Checking</dc:title>

 <dc:subject>Quantum Physics</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In this paper, a quantum version of classical alternating bit protocol is
proposed. This protocol provides a reliable method to transmit the secret
quantum data via a noisy quantum channel while the entanglement between
particles is not broken. Our protocol is based on quantum teleportation and
superdense coding. By assuming that the participants can distinguish the
alternating qubit from other messages and also the assumption that data can be
resent unlimited times, an abstraction of this protocol can be derived. Using
the quantum process algebra \textit{full} $qACP$, we show that the proposed
protocol is correct, so the desired external behaviour of the protocol is
guaranteed.

 <dc:description>  Digitally unwrapping images of paper sheets is crucial for accurate document
scanning and text recognition. This paper presents a method for automatically
rectifying curved or folded paper sheets from a few images captured from
multiple viewpoints. Prior methods either need expensive 3D scanners or model
deformable surfaces using over-simplified parametric representations. In
contrast, our method uses regular images and is based on general developable
surface models that can represent a wide variety of paper deformations. Our
main contribution is a new robust rectification method based on ridge-aware 3D
reconstruction of a paper sheet and unwrapping the reconstructed surface using
properties of developable surfaces via $\ell_1$ conformal mapping. We present
results on several examples including book pages, folded letters and shopping
receipts.

 <dc:description>  A comprehensive implementation of the envisioned traffic safety and
efficiency applications of the IEEE 802.11p and WAVE standards assume the
premise of the use of DSRC technology both as on-board units (OBUs) and as
Roadside Units (RSUs). The high cost associated with RSUs, however, has so far
prevented massive deployment of RSUs. Finding alternative solutions to this
longstanding problem is therefore very important. In this paper, we propose a
self-organizing network approach to using parked cars in urban areas as RSUs.
This self-organizing network approach enables parked cars to create coverage
maps based on received signal strength and make important decisions, such as if
and when a parked car should serve as an RSU. Our results show the feasibility
and cost-effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is able to provide
excellent coverage using only a small fraction of the cars parked in a city.

 <dc:description>  We study Probabilistic Workflow Nets (PWNs), a model extending van der
Aalst's workflow nets with probabilities. We give a semantics for PWNs in terms
of Markov Decision Processes and introduce a reward model. Using a result by
Varacca and Nielsen, we show that the expected reward of a complete execution
of the PWN is independent of the scheduler. Extending previous work on
reduction of non-probabilistic workflow nets, we present reduction rules that
preserve the expected reward. The rules lead to a polynomial-time algorithm in
the size of the PWN (not of the Markov decision process) for the computation of
the expected reward. In contrast, since the Markov decision process of PWN can
be exponentially larger than the PWN itself, all algorithms based on
constructing the Markov decision process require exponential time. We report on
a sample implementation and its performance on a collection of benchmarks.

 <dc:description>  In the problem of edge sign prediction, we are given a directed graph
(representing a social network), and our task is to predict the binary labels
of the edges (i.e., the positive or negative nature of the social
relationships). Many successful heuristics for this problem are based on the
troll-trust features, estimating at each node the fraction of outgoing and
incoming positive/negative edges. We show that these heuristics can be
understood, and rigorously analyzed, as approximators to the Bayes optimal
classifier for a simple probabilistic model of the edge labels. We then show
that the maximum likelihood estimator for this model approximately corresponds
to the predictions of a Label Propagation algorithm run on a transformed
version of the original social graph. Extensive experiments on a number of
real-world datasets show that this algorithm is competitive against
state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
Finally, we show that troll-trust features can also be used to derive online
learning algorithms which have theoretical guarantees even when edges are
adversarially labeled.

 <dc:description>  Nearest neighbor search is a problem of finding the data points from the
database such that the distances from them to the query point are the smallest.
Learning to hash is one of the major solutions to this problem and has been
widely studied recently. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of
the learning to hash algorithms, categorize them according to the manners of
preserving the similarities into: pairwise similarity preserving, multiwise
similarity preserving, implicit similarity preserving, as well as quantization,
and discuss their relations. We separate quantization from pairwise similarity
preserving as the objective function is very different though quantization, as
we show, can be derived from preserving the pairwise similarities. In addition,
we present the evaluation protocols, and the general performance analysis, and
point out that the quantization algorithms perform superiorly in terms of
search accuracy, search time cost, and space cost. Finally, we introduce a few
emerging topics.

 <dc:description>  Phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems have previously
been used for the task of grammatical error correction (GEC) to achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy. The superiority of SMT systems comes from their
ability to learn text transformations from erroneous to corrected text, without
explicitly modeling error types. However, phrase-based SMT systems suffer from
limitations of discrete word representation, linear mapping, and lack of global
context. In this paper, we address these limitations by using two different yet
complementary neural network models, namely a neural network global lexicon
model and a neural network joint model. These neural networks can generalize
better by using continuous space representation of words and learn non-linear
mappings. Moreover, they can leverage contextual information from the source
sentence more effectively. By adding these two components, we achieve
statistically significant improvement in accuracy for grammatical error
correction over a state-of-the-art GEC system.

 <dc:description>  A growing trend for information technology is to not just react to changes,
but anticipate them as much as possible. This paradigm made modern solutions,
such as recommendation systems, a ubiquitous presence in today's digital
transactions. Anticipatory networking extends the idea to communication
technologies by studying patterns and periodicity in human behavior and network
dynamics to optimize network performance. This survey collects and analyzes
recent papers leveraging context information to forecast the evolution of
network conditions and, in turn, to improve network performance. In particular,
we identify the main prediction and optimization tools adopted in this body of
work and link them with objectives and constraints of the typical applications
and scenarios. Finally, we consider open challenges and research directions to
make anticipatory networking part of next generation networks.

 <dc:title>Not dead, just resting: The practical value of per publication citation
  indicators</dc:title>
 <dc:creator>Thelwall, Mike</dc:creator>
 <dc:subject>Computer Science - Digital Libraries</dc:subject>
 <dc:description>  In the final analysis citation-based indicators are inferior to effective
peer review and even peer review is flawed. It is impossible to accurately
measure the value or impact of scientific research and a key task of
scientometricians should be to produce figures for policy makers and others
that are as informative as it is practical to make them and to ensure that
users are fully aware of their limitations. Although the Abramo and D'Angelo
(2016) suggestions make a lot of theoretical sense and so are a goal that is
worth aiming for, it is unrealistic in practice to advocate their universal use
in the contexts discussed above. This is because the indicators would still
have flaws in addition to the generic limitations of citation-based indicators
and would still be inadequate for replacing peer review. Thus, the expense of
the data gathering does not always justify the value in practice of the extra
accuracy. In the longer term, the restructuring of education needed in order to
get the homogeneity necessary for genuinely comparable statistics would be too
expensive and probably damaging to the research mission, in addition to being
out of proportion to the likely value of any citation-based indicator.

 <dc:description>  Current reconfiguration techniques are based on starting the system in a
consistent configuration, in which all participating entities are in their
initial state. Starting from that state, the system must preserve consistency
as long as a predefined churn rate of processors joins and leaves is not
violated, and unbounded storage is available. Many working systems cannot
control this churn rate and do not have access to unbounded storage. System
designers that neglect the outcome of violating the above assumptions may doom
the system to exhibit illegal behaviors. We present the first automatically
recovering reconfiguration scheme that recovers from transient faults, such as
temporal violations of the above assumptions. Our self-stabilizing solutions
regain safety automatically by assuming temporal access to reliable failure
detectors. Once safety is re-established, the failure detector reliability is
no longer needed. Still, liveness is conditioned by the failure detector's
unreliable signals. We show that our self-stabilizing reconfiguration
techniques can serve as the basis for the implementation of several dynamic
services over message passing systems. Examples include self-stabilizing
reconfigurable virtual synchrony, which, in turn, can be used for implementing
a self-stabilizing reconfigurable state-machine replication and
self-stabilizing reconfigurable emulation of shared memory.

 <dc:description>  Graphs have been widely used in many applications such as social networks,
collaboration networks, and biological networks. One important graph analytics
is to explore cohesive subgraphs in a large graph. Among several cohesive
subgraphs studied, k-core is one that can be computed in linear time for a
static graph. Since graphs are evolving in real applications, in this paper, we
study core maintenance which is to reduce the computational cost to compute
k-cores for a graph when graphs are updated from time to time dynamically. We
identify drawbacks of the existing efficient algorithm, which needs a large
search space to find the vertices that need to be updated, and has high
overhead to maintain the index built, when a graph is updated. We propose a new
order-based approach to maintain an order, called k-order, among vertices,
while a graph is updated. Our new algorithm can significantly outperform the
state-of-the-art algorithm up to 3 orders of magnitude for the 11 large real
graphs tested. We report our findings in this paper.

 <dc:description>  Reliable network measurements are a fundamental component of networking
research as they enable network analysis, system debugging, performance
evaluation and optimization. In particular, decoding the LTE control channel
would give access to the full base station traffic at a 1 ms granularity, thus
allowing for traffic profiling and accurate measurements. Although a few
open-source implementations of LTE are available, they do not provide tools to
reliably decoding the LTE control channel and, thus, accessing the scheduling
information. In this paper, we present OWL, an Online Watcher for LTE that is
able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99% of the system frames,
significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. Compared to
previous attempts, OWL grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained
from the LTE random access mechanism. This makes it possible to run our
software on inexpensive hardware coupled with almost any software defined radio
capable of sampling the LTE signal with sufficient accuracy.

 <dc:description>  New technologies such as Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA), Single Electron
Tunneling (SET), Tunneling Phase Logic (TPL) and all-spin logic (ASL) devices
have been widely advocated in nanotechnology as a response to the physical
limits associated with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
technology in atomic scales. Some of their peculiar features are their smaller
size, higher speed, higher switching frequency, lower power consumption, and
higher scale integration. In these technologies, the majority (or minority) and
inverter gates are employed for the production of the functions as this set of
gates makes a universal set of Boolean primitives in these technologies. An
important step in the generation of Boolean functions using the majority gate
is reducing the number of involved gates. In this paper, a multi-objective
synthesis methodology (with the objective priority of gate counts, gate levels
and the number of inverter gates) is presented for finding the minimal number
of possible majority gates in the synthesis of Boolean functions using the
proposed Majority Specification Matrix (MSM) concept. Moreover, based on MSM, a
synthesis flow is proposed for the synthesis of multi-output Boolean functions.
To reveal the efficiency of the proposed method, it is compared with a
meta-heuristic method, multi-objective Genetic Programing (GP). Besides, it is
applied to synthesize MCNC benchmark circuits. The results are indicative of
the outperformance of the proposed method in comparison to multi-objective GP
method. Also, for the MCNC benchmark circuits, there is an average reduction of
10.5% in the number of levels as well as 16.8% and 33.5% in the number of
majority and inverter gates, as compared to the best available method
respectively.

 <dc:description>  Grammatical error correction (GEC) is the task of detecting and correcting
grammatical errors in texts written by second language learners. The
statistical machine translation (SMT) approach to GEC, in which sentences
written by second language learners are translated to grammatically correct
sentences, has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. However, the SMT approach is
unable to utilize global context. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
improve the accuracy of GEC, by exploiting the n-best hypotheses generated by
an SMT approach. Specifically, we build a classifier to score the edits in the
n-best hypotheses. The classifier can be used to select appropriate edits or
re-rank the n-best hypotheses. We apply these methods to a state-of-the-art GEC
system that uses the SMT approach. Our experiments show that our methods
achieve statistically significant improvements in accuracy over the best
published results on a benchmark test dataset on GEC.

 <dc:description>  The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most commonly used application
programming interface for process communication on current large-scale parallel
systems. Due to the scale and complexity of modern parallel architectures, it
is becoming increasingly difficult to optimize MPI libraries, as many factors
can influence the communication performance. To assist MPI developers and
users, we propose an automatic way to check whether MPI libraries respect
self-consistent performance guidelines for collective communication operations.
We introduce the PGMPI framework to detect violations of performance guidelines
through benchmarking. Our experimental results show that PGMPI can pinpoint
undesired and often unexpected performance degradations of collective MPI
operations. We demonstrate how to overcome performance issues of several
libraries by adapting the algorithmic implementations of their respective
collective MPI calls.

 <dc:description>  Remote sensing hyperspectral sensors collect large volumes of high
dimensional spectral and spatial data. However, due to spectral and spatial
redundancy the true hyperspectral signal lies on a subspace of much lower
dimension than the original data. The identification of the signal subspace is
a very important first step for most hyperspectral algorithms. In this paper we
investigate the important problem of identifying the hyperspectral signal
subspace by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the true signal and
an estimate of the signal. Since the MSE is uncomputable in practice, due to
its dependency on the true signal, we propose a method based on the Stein's
unbiased risk estimator (SURE) that provides an unbiased estimate of the MSE.
The resulting method is simple and fully automatic and we evaluate it using
both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets. Experimental results shows
that our proposed method compares well to recent state-of-the-art subspace
identification methods.

which applies to any estimation procedure. We further propose Triangular
Estimation (TE), an algorithm for estimating the reliability of workers. TE has
low complexity, may be implemented in a streaming setting when labels are
provided by workers in real time, and does not rely on an iterative procedure.
We further prove that TE is minimax optimal and matches our lower bound. We
conclude by assessing the performance of TE and other state-of-the-art
algorithms on both synthetic and real-world data sets.

 <dc:description>  We introduce a reshuffled approach to empirical analyze signs' organization
in real directed signed social networks of Epinions and Slashdots from the
global viewpoint. In the reshuffled approach, each negative link has
probability $p_{rs}$ to exchange its sign with another positive link chosen
randomly. Through calculating the entropies of social status ($S_{in}$ and
$S_{out}$) of and mimicking opinion formation of the majority-rule model on
each reshuffled signed network, we find that $S_{in}$ and $S_{out}$ reach their
own minimum values as well as the magnetization $|m^{*}|$ reaches its maximum
value at $p_{rs}=0$. Namely, individuals share the homogeneous properties of
social status and dynamic status in real directed signed social networks. Our
present work provides some interesting tools and perspective to understand the
signs' organization in signed social networks.

 <dc:description>  Social media based indicators or altmetrics have been under scrutiny for the
last seven years. Their promise as alternative metrics for measuring scholarly
impact is still far from becoming a reality. Up to now, most studies have
focused on the understanding of the nature and relation of altmetric indicators
with citation data. Few papers have analysed research profiles based on
altmetric data. Most of these have related to researcher profiles and the
expansion of these tools among researchers. This paper aims at exploring the
coverage of the Altmetric.com database and its potential use in order to show
universities' research profiles in relationship with other databases. We
analyse a sample of four different Spanish universities.First, we observe a low
coverage of altmetric indicators with only 36 percent of all documents
retrieved from the Web of Science having an 'altmetric' score. Second, we
observe that for the four universities analysed, the area of Science shows
higher 'altmetric' scores that the rest of the research areas. Finally,
considering the low coverage of altmetric data at the institutional level, it
could be interesting for research policy makers to consider the development of
guidelines and best practices guides to ensure that researchers disseminate
adequately their research findings through social media.

 <dc:description>  Automata-logic connections are pillars of the theory of regular languages.
Such connections are harder to obtain for transducers, but important results
have been obtained recently for word-to-word transformations, showing that the
three following models are equivalent: deterministic two-way transducers,
monadic second-order (MSO) transducers, and deterministic one-way automata
equipped with a finite number of registers. Nested words are words with a
nesting structure, allowing to model unranked trees as their depth-first-search
linearisations. In this paper, we consider transformations from nested words to
words, allowing in particular to produce unranked trees if output words have a
nesting structure. The model of visibly pushdown transducers allows to describe
such transformations, and we propose a simple deterministic extension of this
model with two-way moves that has the following properties: i) it is a simple
computational model, that naturally has a good evaluation complexity; ii) it is
expressive: it subsumes nested word-to-word MSO transducers, and the exact
expressiveness of MSO transducers is recovered using a simple syntactic
restriction; iii) it has good algorithmic/closure properties: the model is
closed under composition with a unambiguous one-way letter-to-letter transducer
which gives closure under regular look-around, and has a decidable equivalence
problem.

 <dc:description>  In countries like Denmark and Spain classified journal lists are now being
produced and used in the calculation of nationwide performance indicators. As a
result, Danish and Spanish scholars are advised to contribute to journals of
high 'authority' (as in the former) or those within a high class (as in the
latter). This can create a few problems. The aim of this paper is to analyse
the potential use of network centrality measures to identify possible
mismatches of journal categories. It analysis the Danish National Authority
List and the Spanish CIRC Classification. Based on a sample of Library and
Information Science publications, it analyses centrality measures that can
assess on the importance of journals to given fields, correcting mismatches in
these classifications. We conclude by emphasising the use of these measures to
better calibrate journal classifications as we observe a general bias in these
lists towards older journals. Centrality measures can allow to identify
periphery-to-core journals' transitions.

 <dc:description>  We present a scheme to automatically set the precision of floating point
variables in an application. We design a framework that profiles applications
to measure undesirable numerical behavior at the floating point operation
level. We use this framework to perform mixed precision analysis to
heuristically set the precision of all variables in an application based on
their numerical profiles. We experimentally evaluate the mixed precision
analysis to show that it can generate a range of results with different
accuracy and performance characteristics.

 <dc:title>On a Topic Model for Sentences</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Probabilistic topic models are generative models that describe the content of
documents by discovering the latent topics underlying them. However, the
structure of the textual input, and for instance the grouping of words in
coherent text spans such as sentences, contains much information which is
generally lost with these models. In this paper, we propose sentenceLDA, an
extension of LDA whose goal is to overcome this limitation by incorporating the
structure of the text in the generative and inference processes. We illustrate
the advantages of sentenceLDA by comparing it with LDA using both intrinsic
(perplexity) and extrinsic (text classification) evaluation tasks on different
text collections.

 <dc:title>Advanced Transport Options for the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Multimedia streaming over HTTP is no longer a niche research topic as it has
entered our daily live. The common assumption is that it is deployed on top of
the existing infrastructure utilizing application (HTTP) and transport (TCP)
layer protocols as is. Interestingly, standards like MPEG's Dynamic Adaptive
Streaming over HTTP (DASH) do not mandate the usage of any specific transport
protocol allowing for sufficient deployment flexibility which is further
supported by emerging developments within both protocol layers. This paper
investigates and evaluates the usage of advanced transport options for the
dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP. We utilize a common test setup to
evaluate HTTP/2.0 and Google's Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC) protocol
in the context of DASH-based services.

 <dc:title>Relational type-checking for MELL proof-structures. Part 1:

 <dc:description>  Relational semantics for linear logic is a form of non-idempotent
intersection type system, from which several informations on the execution of a
proof-structure can be recovered. An element of the relational interpretation
of a proof-structure R with conclusion $\Gamma$ acts thus as a type (refining
$\Gamma$) having R as an inhabitant. We are interested in the following
type-checking question: given a proof-structure R, a list of formulae $\Gamma$,
and a point x in the relational interpretation of $\Gamma$, is x in the
interpretation of R? This question is decidable. We present here an algorithm
that decides it in time linear in the size of R, if R is a proof-structure in
the multiplicative fragment of linear logic. This algorithm can be extended to
larger fragments of multiplicative-exponential linear logic containing
$\lambda$-calculus.

 <dc:title>Multi-Label Zero-Shot Learning via Concept Embedding</dc:title>

 <dc:description>  Zero Shot Learning (ZSL) enables a learning model to classify instances of an
unseen class during training. While most research in ZSL focuses on
single-label classification, few studies have been done in multi-label ZSL,
where an instance is associated with a set of labels simultaneously, due to the
difficulty in modeling complex semantics conveyed by a set of labels. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach to multi-label ZSL via concept embedding
learned from collections of public users' annotations of multimedia. Thanks to
concept embedding, multi-label ZSL can be done by efficiently mapping an
instance input features onto the concept embedding space in a similar manner
used in single-label ZSL. Moreover, our semantic learning model is capable of
embedding an out-of-vocabulary label by inferring its meaning from its
co-occurring labels. Thus, our approach allows both seen and unseen labels
during the concept embedding learning to be used in the aforementioned instance
mapping, which makes multi-label ZSL more flexible and suitable for real
applications. Experimental results of multi-label ZSL on images and music
tracks suggest that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art multi-label ZSL
model and can deal with a scenario involving out-of-vocabulary labels without
re-training the semantics learning model.

 <dc:title>Using Monte Carlo Search With Data Aggregation to Improve Robot Soccer

 <dc:description>  RoboCup soccer competitions are considered among the most challenging
multi-robot adversarial environments, due to their high dynamism and the
partial observability of the environment. In this paper we introduce a method
based on a combination of Monte Carlo search and data aggregation (MCSDA) to
adapt discrete-action soccer policies for a defender robot to the strategy of
the opponent team. By exploiting a simple representation of the domain, a
supervised learning algorithm is trained over an initial collection of data
consisting of several simulations of human expert policies. Monte Carlo policy
rollouts are then generated and aggregated to previous data to improve the
learned policy over multiple epochs and games. The proposed approach has been
extensively tested both on a soccer-dedicated simulator and on real robots.
Using this method, our learning robot soccer team achieves an improvement in
ball interceptions, as well as a reduction in the number of opponents' goals.
Together with a better performance, an overall more efficient positioning of
the whole team within the field is achieved.

 <dc:description>  In software testing, the large size of the input domain makes exhaustively
testing the inputs a daunting and often impossible task. Pair-wise testing is a
popular approach to combinatorial testing problems. This paper reviews
Pair-wise testing and its history, strengths, weaknesses, and tools for
